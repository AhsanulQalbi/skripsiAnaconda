0,"Overly complicated Being both a U.S. history buff and a mystery fan, I expected to love this book. I gave up after slogging through 150 pages. New characters (many with similar names) are introduced about every other page, making the story very difficult to keep straight. Benjamin January also brings a multi-layered backstory to the proceedings, adding additional layers of complexity (and does anybody else think a musician-surgeon-classically educated sensitive widower is a bit too good to be true?).Add a setting unfamiliar to most readers (an 1830s Creole sugar cane plantation), and the density of details overwhelms both plot and characterization. Casual readers will find this book tough sledding."
0,"Terrible Disappointment -- parts don't fit My son (almost 8) and my husband (an engineer) sat down to put this together. Many of the holes were either drilled too small or, even worse, drilled in the WRONG PLACE. Some pieces are cut the wrong size and just don't fit!! What a terrible WASTE OF MONEY. There is no way to make it work without major drilling and sanding and then re-painting.My son is so disappointed -- he was really looking forward to putting this together."
0,"Didn't hold up.....very disappointed I bought this OXO Insight Tea Kettle tea after I'd let my former whistler boil dry. The whistling cover on the spout had been left in the ""UP"" position after filling and I totally forgot about it. Well, I thought, THIS teakettle had solved that problem for me. Just a squeeze of the handle causes the spout top to flip down into the spout. When the the kettle is set down and the handle released, the spout top closes. What a great idea!After just 6 months of light use, the spout top will no longer close. I am so disappointed. FYI, the whistle on it was great, not too irritating, but loud enough to get one's attention.I am on the hunt for a new teakettle. A stainless one with a non-irritating whistle --- some of these teakettles sound like a tornado siren."

0,"Nice toy but ... My six-year-old loves space and to get this he was so exciteded! However, as we assembled some of the shuttle and other things the taps and pins would break-off. Needless to say, now he can't put everything together to simulate launch from Kenedy Space Center because all the parts won't stay together."
0,"Very low quality It's sad to see that the space toys based on the actual space program are not good ones. My son loves space and space exploration, but he hardly plays with this set. The shuttle does not stay on the tanks, even when sitting still.I like the fact that everything fits into a box. If only the toy were higher quality!I'd buy it again, but just for the fact that my son loves space and the space program so much."

0,"To Paraphrase Cordell Hull. . . In all my years of viewing movies, never have I encountered a film laced with such infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge, that until today I never believed a studio was capable."

0,"Misleading Title. This book's title and its thesis ""seem"" to suggest that it is all about the impact of people on politics, but in fact it is about feminism. The topic, feminism, is fine; anything under disguise is not.It is not quite an academic book with logical arguments but rather a propaganda with a few claims that are appealing accompanied by loads of emotional examples exposing the unfairness of this world which do nothing to strengthen the previous claims."

0,"Good Story, Bad Writing, Bad Acting, Bad Directing And worst of all was the techno music, which in no way fit the setting of the film."
0,"I want my [money] back! I was the only one in my senior English class who loved the epic poem. Several years later I bought a copy of it at a comic book shop.For some reason, I liked Christopher Lambert, and I thought he would be a good actor for a movie based on this classic tale.Man, was I wrong!Aside from the names of the hero and one of the villians, this movie has almost nothing in common with the poem. It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!The acting, even with a so-called ""top talent"" like Christopher Lambert, is awful. The setting is almost non-existant, and the plot, ah yes, the plot ....I knew this movie would reek within the first 10 minutes. I mean, I tried really hard to be open-minded, but it was to no avail.Spare yourself the pain and skip the movie. Settle in on a dark winter's night by a fire, put on some quiet music, and read the epic poem. You'll be glad you did."
0,"This Film Was a Waste of Time I agree with the reviewer who said, ""Read the book."" Or better yet, see Thirteenth Warrior, which is another fanciful rendition of this myth.Yeah, it's a B movie. It even has glimmers of interesting character development and plot line in it. But it's also-as one reviewer recognized--a pseudo video game, an imitation of an imitation of a life. It's a hostile, cretin, pubescent violence fantasy, festering in a cracked mirror. Beowulf, in the original tale, saved people from the monsters and nobly sacrificed himself. In this moronic film, he is a sociopathic ""swiss-army-knife"" who wants us to feel sorry for him. BEOWULF, the film, is gratuitous violence run amok. Who is the real monster in this film? Who really cares if the main character gets et? Everybody, not just mostly everybody, should have died in this film. They were all despicable."
0,"bad This is a pretty bad movie. It was only 90+ minutes and it seemed like forever. The sets are pretty good and some of the action scenes are as well. That is about all that is good. The special effects are bad...laughingly so at the end. There is no character development and most of the actors don't even bother to act (such as the king). There isn't much plot, except near the end. You spend the whole movie wondering when the actual story will begin. It canabalizes the Beowulf legend to the point where the only thing in common is some monster killing everyone. And while they claim it is a ""technofuture"" its really just a medieval setting with some props forced in (like a loudspeaker in a stone castle). You'd be much better off watching The 13th Warrior."
0,"Bad movie, bad writing, bad everything Ok, where to start with this piece of junk. Christopher Lambert sleep-walks through his scenes and the other actors take their queue from him. The soundtrack his pure heavy metal with no real link to the scenes. The set is minimalist to say the least - pipes and natural gas flames do not make a set. Writing was atrocious, directing was even worse if that is possible.This movie is just one more reason that Hollywood should not be allowed to touch a classic written story. Read the classic Anglo-Saxon story, but don't get this movie. Avoid at all cost."
0,"Yeesch I'm convinced that this is the worst movie ever made. I rented it because it sounded like it might have been remotely interesting but it wasn't even that. The story was godawful, the acting was worse and the effects were comical. So instead of purchasing this film, do yourself a favor. Take the money you were going to spend on the tape, buy a torch and a metal hanger, heat the hanger with the torch and beat yourself senseless. It would be infinately more enjoyable than watching this movie."
0,"Stink! Stank! Stunk! Unbelievably stupid and inane. Chris Lambert has the acting ability of a limp dish rag. If you haven't seen a pseudo-martial arts film that spends most of its time having the actors sommersault backwards again and again and again and again to a soundtrack filled with WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!, then this film is for you. And the fact that this film is based on what is considered the first English language literary classic is sacrilegious. Everyone associated with this film should be subjected to that huge single-edged razor blade used to separate people shown in the beginning of the film. This goes down in my books as one of the biggest bombs of all time. And Chris Lambert is positively laughable as an actor. Bar this man from acting!! Trash this film or--better--use it to prep people in how NOT to make a film."
0,"OK, really now... How can anyone like this garbage? I just listened to the song Money Talks with a few friends and we agreed that it was one of the poorest written songs we've ever heard. The overuse of keyboards sounds like something out of a bad video game, only with lots of rainbows and flowers and stuff. But the vocals, man, the VOCALS! The guy sounded like he was getting pleasure from discussing the way that money talks to him and he does what it wants! Sounds like he's looking for a profession in the red light district if you ask me. Howabout they take time off and never get caught... it's all part of the game! In fact, take a lot of time off. In fact, stop ripping off Marillion with a touch of RuPaul and Prince and never write another album again!"
0,"Package fine; pan bent or warped and they shipped it anyway! I would assume whoever packages these items, looks at them -- this should be a round pan -- not a dented pan. The box was not damaged, airpacks around the pan. Pan has a serious dent -- not a minor dent. Watch what you buy"
0,Amanda A daughter of the Mennonites This book felt like I was reading a book written by a sixth grader. The portrayal of the characters seamed unrealistic and staged. It felt like the writer hadn't done any or very little interaction with the Mennonite community.
0,"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? After 20+ years you would've thought Temple could have made a film without rehashing swindle. 99% of the footage has been seen before, the only new stuff is the interviews carried out in pitch darkness - probably sounded good in theory, in reality it is profoundly dull.No complete performances, overdubbed music, endless footage of council flats, endless rehashed footage from Swindle. A complete and utter wasted opportunity.Ever get the feelin you've been cheated?"
0,"BOLLOCKS!!!!!! The Pistols made Punk into the biggest media bonanza since hippie.When Punk came out, to spread out its dirty little wings, the generation caught by the narcotic f**k up of the sixties had a new hope something to fight for, to live, but within months the dream was sold, baught out it was turned into another commodity beacause of bands like The Pistols,The Damned, and the Clash. They can stuff their punk credentials, with all their money up their a**. ANARCHY IN THE UK WHAT A BUNCH OF BOLLOCKS, what did they ever do to live out that dream.They didnt care about punk, they dont wanna worry about anything. They numb their minds on T.V., space out on coke and dope they dont want their sh*tty lives to surface. I know its sh*t and u know its sh*t but they wont admit to the themselves that the fun they have all that style they got is the same old sh*t. Their music is a joke. Find some other ""Punk"" bands theirs many and a lot better too. THE PISTOLS, BOLLOCKS!!!"
0,"Time to Revitalize I think I have read everything Hillerman has written. Hunting Badger, is, at least in my opinion, his worst work. We already know Chee, Leaphorn and the other staple characters. Very disappointingly, Hunting Badger has no character development of the antagonists, no suspenseful plot and no real conclusion. This book seems to me to be a ""My editors want another book."" piece. I look forward to additional Hillerman books with hope that he will again do his usual interesting charatcer development as well as geographically detailed work. But, as far as Hunting Badger goes, miss it. It isn't very good. jbd"
0,"Hunting for a reason to like this book. Tony Hillerman is a great American author. His Jim Chee / Joe Leaphorn mysteries have introduced me to the Navajo culture and the American southwest, about which I knew little before I began to read his books. Therefore, I was very disappointed to discover that Hillerman's most recent book, ""Hunting Badger"", is far below his usual standards. I read the book before coming to this site, and I agree with the many criticisms posted by other reviewers. What I would like to add is my concern that two or more reviewers stated that ""Hunting Badger"" is the first Hillerman book they have read and it will be the last. They don't know what they're missing! ""Hunting Badger"" is in need of better editing, plot strengthening, more character development... and an ending!"
0,"A misstep in the series I've been a fan of the Hillerman series for many years, but Hunting Badger represents a great disappointment. I only hope that most new readers begin with another book in the series--any other would do. Also, why name a book after the villain if you're not going to confront or even glimpse him in the book? I felt as though Hillerman simply got tired and quit before he wrote the final chapters. Lots of typos and poor editing throughout. Maybe he had a falling-out with the publisher."
0,"Hunting Badger This is my first Hillerman book, and it will also be my last. I put it down after enduring 125 pages. I am not sure what the problem was, but it never really grabbed hold of me. The book seemed to just meander along without any real bite."

0,"Beware if you're sensitive to MSG I bought this at the health food store, and I guess I could get used to the bitter aftertaste that, as one other reviewer says, ends up in your throat, but I should have read the ingredients more closely. Even if I liked the taste, I couldn't use it because of that last ingredient ""natural flavor"". Not sure if you're aware, but that's one of the many aliases of Mono-sodium Glutamate, as in ""Accent"", and is a flavor enhancer. Many people have no known sensitivities to MSG, but I'm a lifelong migraine sufferer and have to keep an eye out for it because it's poison to my system."
0,"This stuff is absolutely NASTY!! I have no idea who is submitting the 5* reviews here, but they lost their taste buds years ago.This stuff tastes nothing like salt. It has a horrible bitter after-taste that lingers in your mouth ruining anything it touches.Try it at a restaurant or something before buying it. It even nauseates in cooking or in recipes requiring any significant amount of salt.If you are on a salt free diet, find something else. Yuk! With a capital Yuk!!=============UPDATE=====================I have found one use for this. In cooking, with tomato sauce, if you mix it with real salt, you need much less salt. The tomato sauce appears to nullify the bitterness somehow. So, if you like pasta with sauce but have to cut down on salt intake, perhaps this is the answer for that.But it is NO salt shaker for the table."
0,"WARNING!! You should not use potassium chloride if you have kidney failure, Addison's disease, severe burns or other tissue injury, if you are dehydrated, if you take certain diuretics (water pills), or if you have high levels of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia).

Serious side effects of potassium include uneven heartbeat, muscle weakness or limp feeling, severe stomach pain, and numbness or tingling in your hands, feet, or mouth.In addition to all this scary information...product tastes horrible. Like something that is not intended for human consumption. Its bitter with a definate 'bite' and aftertaste. I would not expect anyone to use this product regardless of their health...it's that bad!"
0,"no Rod Stewarts here Cibo Matto are one of the many bands trying to be too many things at once while winking to their friends in the audience. Stereotype A is an appropriation of many disparate styles, and it never comes together. The one lead singer in the band is very attractive, which makes their shows a must. Nothing on Stereotype A suggests that Cibo Matto will ever be able to incorporate many styles into one seamless blend like a music maestro such as Rod Stewart, whose many great albums are on sale right here at amazon, the country's most reliable source for music and book purchases. I think Yuko is the name of the very attractive member of Cibo Matto."
0,"Cibo Matto Goes Mainstream R&B What a disappointing, overproduced, overhyped mess. Yes, the ladies have abandoned their former trip-pop, sampled, quirky kookiness for radio friendly, very mainstream r&b blandness, replete with empty romanticized lyrics (I really miss the food references) and annoying (Shades of a Carpenters revival) backing vocals. There are only two vaguely salvagable tracks here ""Sci-Fi Wasabi"" (Derailed for me by an uncool Star Wars reference) and ""Blue Train"" (Sounds like a bad Buffalo Daughter outtake). The rest is an indistinguishable blip on the Top 50 charts. And why did they tamper with ""Spoon"", which was perfectly fine in its former incarnation (Perhaps to show off their improved diction)???? They're sure to make lots of money (Probably the idea)with this as the new Japanese TLC."
0,"Cibo Matto has made an incredibly boring album Having heard the decent track by Cibo Matto ""Sci-fi Wasabi"" on a CMJ sampler, I bought STEREOTYPE A thinking it might have other songs in the same vein. Much to my dismay, it honestly is a boring album. Nearly the songs sound the same, and the singing of Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda is inept and lazy.Cibo Matto, like several other Japanese artists (most notably Towa Tei), tried to use the American fascination with seemingly alien culture to sell this album. In the end, all one gets is a collection of 14 yawn-inducing filler-pop tracks. It has no redeeming qualities, and I would recommend that people would find much more worthy music to spend their money on."

0,"I love the Bodeans but not Sammy's solo effort I have every Bodeans album ever made (my favorite is the live ""Joe Dirt Car""), I have seen them in front of 200 people as well as 15,000 people (at Milwaukee's Summerfest) and absolutely love them. I was anxious to listen to Sammy's solo effort but have to admit it is not a CD I listen to often. The theme of the album is extremely dark and the CD simply depresses me.I am eagerly awaiting Kurt Neuwmann's solo effort (coming July 25, 2000). As the other half of the Bodeans songwriting duo, his album will likely be much more upbeat musically but still have great words...we'll find out in a few weeks."
0,"very disappointing first of all, this cd has too much swearing. second, it's just boring to listen to...there arent any decent rythms. What was fiend thinking when he wrote this horrible cd??? go buy 2pac or jay-z if you want to listen to decent rap!"
0,"GREAT movie - TERRIBLE DVD This is by far one of my all time favorite movies. My wife always loved it, so has my 3-year old boy. So we went ahead and purchased this movie on DVD. However, how annoying is it when the DVD doesn't allow you to skip the previews of other insignificant movies before you actually get to see the feature film. This thing locks up your DVD player control completely (disables functions of menu / stop / fast forward) and forces you to sit through previews of five movies before ever getting to the Babe feature. It is simply the most offensive and intruding thing my family has ever experienced in DVD's and VHS.I have a lot of words to describe those folks at Universal Studio, I will try to be gentle. Let's just put it this way - your limited creativity in marketing really must be the ultimate lowest of all."
0,"Love the movie, not the previews... First and foremost: Babe is one of my favorite movies.If you haven't seen it, you're missing out.But this movie has ""coming attractions"", previews that cannot be skipped. Granted, they're only a few minutes long. But you have to watch them each and every time you play the disk. No skipping to the title menu.If there were other versions available, I'd buy them.Hey studios: Ineffective marketing tool. Next time I'll research before I buy, and won't buy a movie with forced previews."
0,"Buy the VHS Tape One of the benefits of DVDs is the ability to skip to any part of the movie easily. This benefit is exceptionally true when you have kids and they want to watch a movie. Normally, you can skip the trailers and head right to the movie or at least the main menu. This DVD makes you go through each of the many trailers before you can get to the main menu. You can't fast forward through them or skip them. You must wait until the trailers have completed then select ""Play"" from the main menu. Because of this, we would have rather bought the VHS version of the movie. With a tape, you can at least fast forward through the trailers!"
0,"Do not buy this disc; you will be forced to watch 10 minutes of advertisements The movie is great. This disc will end up in your trashcan in pieces unless you have the patience of a saint. Universal pictures has decided that you are paying them for the imperative privilege of watching ten minutes of previews. /Dumb/ previews, through which you cannot fast forward and from which you cannot access the main menu. Buy the movie elsewhere or pirate it."
0,"Too sad!!! I'm sorry, but my eyes were filled with tears through the entire movie!!! Sure, it's nice seeing the animals talk, but it's SOO 'darn' sad! It's just another depressing animal movie.If you love animals and want a good bawl, this movie's for you."
0,"Not Good At All This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen. We had to see it in our class one day. The teacher said that I HAD to watch. Reluctantly, I sat down. I hated it. She fast forwarded it to the middle so we could see the end. Even that part was bad, and I didn't see all of it! I'd give it -10 stars for horrible scenes, cruelty to animals, and lack of trying. DON'T SEE IT EVER!!!"
0,"Weak, very weak! My ex-boyfriend Jeff and I rented this movie a while back and we had very different opinions. I thought the movie was childish, stupid and just simply not dope. Jeff on the other hand thought it was a great movie. I feel it takes a very warped individual to like this movie. This may be why I have since dumped Jeff and moved in with my new boyfriend Jermaine."
0,"skimmed to the end This reminded me of a Nancy Drew story in which Nancy gets laid, more than once. If this seems vulgar, then prepare yourself for a big surprise if you read this book. Contrived ""in the nick of time"" encounters hobble the already weak suspense, and stereotypes abound. You'll be happier with some James Lee Burke."

0,"Incomplete, missing musicians This release is missing two of the songs from the original performance at Woodstock, ""Gypsy Woman"" and ""Mastermind."" Hendrix only performed these songs at the Woodstock show; therefore, their historic value is impossible to deny. Yet these songs are not on this release!Additionally, this album does not include some of the other musicians' performances. The guitar of Larry Lee, for example, has been mixed out, along with other percussion and singing.This release could have been the definitive edition of Jimi Hendrix's legendary performance at Woodstock. Instead, it represents almost nothing beyond the 1994 Alan Douglas :Woodstock release."
0,Trash I have a good collection of hendrix and heard much more; this is trash cashing in on the extremely overrated concert of its name. The band is very spotty and really juiced making them all completely unable to follow Jimi's talent (which shines through in SSB and the long solo afterwards - pretty much the only highlights of this disc) You would be much better off with Band of Gypsies or Live at the Fillmore. In this vein Isle of Wight works from a more solid foundation. Do note that Jimi never played with this band again.
0,Don't Bother I bought this program to load onto my laptap for school and work. You can only download the installation cd. You cannot load the other 7 cd's onto your hard drive.

I have emailed the company to see if an upgrade will be released but I have not received a reply yet. I am now looking for a program that can be completely loaded onto my hard drive.

I found it as alot of jibberish, granted there was some decent parts, most of it seemed like it was written for her and only her and those she teaches. I found most of it difficult to understand, and her version of the Craft seemed so organized; for instance, your altar MUST look like this. Needless to say, Cunninghams book I finished, Ms Cabot's, I did not."
0,"Please don't go here! This book is just awful. Written at a fourth grade reading level but I would not recommend it for children. It is just disappointing.

0,"Sequels are almost always disappointing Having been so impressed with the original ""Megatrends,"" I was very much looking forward to this edition. Unfortunately,the authors' crystal ball failed too often this time around to inspire much confidence. One major flaw, I think, is that there is much less content analysis used in tracking these trends and far too much fluff in the way of interviews and anecdotes. Too, in ""Megatrends,"" statistics were used to back up forecasts derived from content analysis. Here statistics and surveys seem to be the sole basis for the forecasts. Perhaps the authors' thought the original work was too dry, or perhaps they were just trying to capitalize on a winner with a quick and dirty follow-up. In any case, this book was not nearly as insightful, or useful"

My friend from out of town (who I was carting around the city doing touristy stuff) picks it up and starts reading it out loud to all of us. It says such horrible bad bad BAD advise. If you follow this guide you will be slapped. NO DOUBT. And possibly knocked out, depending on who you approach. This is from 2 chicks and one dude who are very open minded. You will NOT get anything other than a fat lip if you do even ONE of the things it tells you to do. So actually i think this should be in the comedy section.

The two are college level texts and probably quite good for those engaged in intellectual pursuits. I, on the other hand, teach ESL as a volunteer and was simply looking to shore up my practical knowledge of the subjects. Both texts contain virtually no such information. In fact, they assume a significant knowledge of linguistics and linguistic theory; they are literally packed with obscure jargon that I presume familiar to some set of initiates but certainly far beyond my ken. If your situation is analogous to mine, I suggest Side by Side Spanish & English Grammar and Practice Makes Perfect English Pronouns and Prepositions--much less expensive ($30 the pair I think) and much more practical."

This is almost bootleg level in terms of editing quality and intention as a piece of art but that besmirches the good name of the better quality bootlegs I've enjoyed in my life.

0,does not fit Garmin 276c I purchased this power cord for a Garmin 276 gps. I specifically wanted the one clearly pictured on the website that has the 90 deg bend at the end. I bought 2. I received the item and it does not fit the 276. The contacts are correctly placed but the rubber type product that is meant for a press fit into the gps is too small in diameter and the cord immediately falls out. The end of this cord is straight and not the 90 deg. It is packaged as a Garmin product with the 276c clearly on the package so I do not know where the problem lies. I tried to contact Antonline but they do not provide for any human to contact to explain/rectify the problem so I ended up sending the cords back and eating the shipping each way. Will never buy from Antonline again.Garmin 12-Volt Adapter Cable for GPSMap 276C (010-10516-00) I would personally verify with any vendor offering this product.

0,"Where's Coral Sea? What a crock!I bought this DVD in the (vain) hope it contained the entire 2:45 minute movie not just the stupid love scenes (which I really don't care for.) The long version (rarely seen on TV) of Midway with more detail (among the missing scenes: the death of VT-3, the massacre of VMF-221 and the battle of Coral Sea) is (I think anyway) actually a better movie than the theatre original which is on this DVD.Upon further reflection I should add the following. As it was pointed out, many of the additional scenes were shot for TV and not part of the original movie. However, if they could jam in those love (useless) scenes, why couldn't they stick in the combat (good) scenes that everyone else (myself included) wanted?"

0,"Midway between ""bad"" & ""sucks"" This is not a movie for anybody who is interested in Naval history or has any knowledge of the ships and aircraft types that were actually in the battle. Besides Hestons' usual overblown acting, the movie is spoiled by outakes from actual combat footage shot long after Midway was a memory, involving aircraft types that were not in service at the time. Overhead views of modern(1950's & 60's) U.S. carriers only needed an Apollo or Gemini spacecraft bobbing in the water to complete the fiasco. This movie is one anachronism after another. For a far better portrayal of the events at Midway, I would recommend the television mini-series of Herman Wouks' ""War and Remembrance"", starring Robert Mitchum et. al. Although built around fictional characters, the historical research was better and skilled use of good models was better than bad use of inaccurate video. Skip this movie."
0,"Poorest war movie ever made 'Midway' on DVD while we're still waiting for 'The Longest Day'- somebody's got to be kidding. This one really sucks. Here we go: stock-shots ripped off from 'Thirty seconds over Tokyo', 'Tora Tora Tora' and probably other movies, WWII newsreels footage extensively cropped to fit into the Panavision frame, meaningless cameos by various aging stars -probably to make the flick look like a blockbuster- , historical mistakes and countless errors about planes and aircraft carriers, inept dramatization -the predictable romance between Heston's son and a Japanese girl-, you name it. The only reason I give this awful turkey one star is because the software doesn't allow me to give it none."
0,"Can't give a minus star review! It's pathetic that perhaps the greatest sea battle in U.S. history generated such a lousy movie.This movie stinks on many levels. It uses outtakes from Tora Tora Tora, so the viewer sees interesting things like battleship masts at Midway. The actors, except maybe Henry Fonda and Hal Holbrook, do lousy jobs. Charlton Heston is particularly irritating- you get the impression that he was running the Pacific fleet and Admiral Nimitz just came in on the weekends to read his mail.The ""romance"" angle in the movie just slows it down and somehow makes you wonder if these people's personal problems were bigger than World War II!"
0,"YAWN I fell asleep during this one, watched again, drank much coffee, then wished I had fallen asleep instead of watching it. Young men fought and died at Midway, not tired old actors. I wonder what they could do with it today, with better acting and realistic younger actors in the parts?"
0,"I had a great expectation for this... What would you get if you took a bad script, uninspired acting, WW2 stock footage, scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora!, and put it in a blender and mixed it around? The answer: Midway! This reeaallly bad movie suffers from everything. WW2 stock footage is over-used (most of it didn't even take place during the battle of Midway) and the scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora! are out of place. A corny love interest gets in the way of the action too much. Lot's of familiar faces in this, but their acting is uninspired, and the script is dreadful. About 30 minutes of important footage was cut out of the original release (including the battle of the Coral Sea). Please, avoid this film!"
0,APC MAKES JUNK BX900R I spent a lot of money for this unit and got about one year of use out of it before it started constantly beeping and overloading. I replaced the batteries with new ones plugged it in and it still overloads with nothing attached to it. I deduced from reading all the other reviews that this is a poor design on cooling the circuit board. The unit runs hot with nothing attached. I guess the cheap fan doesn't last too long and you ruin the warranty by replacing it. If you go to the APC site the unit is discontinued thank goodness they retired it. This will be the last APC product I buy.
0,"used to be a fan of apc This product is an unfortunate one. From the very beginning since owning it, it must be plugged in all the time to maintain the battery and take a great deal of power to do so. After owning it for less than two years, beeping has started anytime you turn it on (annoying that you can't turn it off), which suggests that its battery is about to do. For being such an expensive unit and not even being able to find a battery to replace it easily, I am thinking this may be my last apc. If you search apc's website, there isn't even product info or manuals for this manual, so support is lacking."

Further good news is that the shipping met my expectations (5 stars). What I did not expect is for it to be delivered with mold or algae (it's green when I wipe it off) particularly on the parts of the mat that were not enclosed by the cardboard package. This made the experience a 1 star experience because I have had to spend a good deal of time cleaning it. I am a little uncertain about the safety of mat, even if it appears that I have cleaned the mold off. The idea of having to return this gift is appalling."

Don't get me wrong - I hate violence in all its manifestations in life although I like it on screen, but here we can't even empathize this woman 'cos the movie is just sooo bad. The acting is terrible, characters do very strange and unexplainable things. You can't feel with a character when you see everything in the film is false and naive. Don't believe the taglines - there's nothing shocking in there. It's just one big waste of time. You'll feel cheated and robbed. If you hate violence in cinema, I guess you are not reading this right now and if you like shocking movies, don't bother with this one, there are plenty of others that are much more shocking and I assume you already know them all by names. Go and watch ""Irreversible"" for god's sake."
0,"What a sick disappointment I watched this film hoping for a great revenge flick, in which the victim of a brutal rape enacts the revenge on her assailents like they deserve. Unfortunately what I saw was a film about a woman who gets raped, the details being the main focus of the movie, and a bit thrown in at the end about her getting revenge by killing the guys. Only the bath tub guy gets what he deserves. The other guys all get relatively quick and painless deaths. They should be killed like the victims in ""Saw"", but they actually seem to get off pretty easily.The fact that the rape scene is around forty minutes long proves the misguidedness of the film makers. It's like using the movie ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to say that murder is wrong. It just doesn't work to throw the subject in our face and force us to stare at it.I just feel like this movie screams to be remade, with the rape being downplayed, and the revenge being emphasized. It could have been done far better."
0,"A very dull, unbelievable movie, with horrible audio I had been wanting to see this ""notorious"" movie for a long time. Now that I have seen it, I can honestly say ""What's The Big Deal?"". Other than the fact that the Camile Keaton gets attacked 3 times, and makes a lot of noise while doing so, I didn't see what's was so horrorible about this movie. The one thing that I found bothersome was the sound. Other than the commentary tracks, there is the original mono audio track, and the new dolby 5.1 surround track. I listened to the latter. It sounded like someone had put the microphone up against another tv to record the sound....This movie is unbelievable because Camille Keaton is raped & sodomized by several men on 3 different occasions, and within a day or so she able to walk around like nothing happened to her."

0,"DVD-R wont play on newer systems bought the ""DVD"" millennium edition and watched it on (a now old) DVD player a few years ago.This evening I tried to watch it again on my new-ish PS3 and it would not get past Dolby ad.Windows 7 laptop stalls one third the way through.. While this is not a film I love to see, I didwant to watch it once more as a re-make is out soon. Shame, my comparison is spoiled by what seemsto be a bootleg, bought on Amazon. Beware."
0,"just say no I watched this movie sometime in the late 80's. It disturbed meto the point that I've never forgotten it, and never will.Take my advise and don't fill your mind with this trash. It willstain your soul. If you like to see lots and lots of violent rapethen this movie is for you and you need help. I can't imaginewhy anyone would make this movie. There is enough of this typeof horrible stuff in the real world without adding a fantasyversion."
0,"graphic and terrible, but reality I put reality because this is a very strong depiction of what rape is and how men can be. It made me nauseous just watching it, and I read the other reviews on here about it and was very offended by the guy who wrote ""if your a man the bathroom scene will make you squirm"". Well, the man in the tub had brutaly raped this woman and deserved what he got, in my opinion if your a man watching this film what should make you squirm would be the scenes of the rape and just knowing that you are part of the male species that commit this horrific act. Dont watch this if you have ever been raped, it will bring flashbacks."
0,"biggest disappointment EVER If you are looking for something shocking, don't bother with this movie.rape scene: why doesn't she run???? why doesn't she fight??? how come there's all this blood on her all of a sudden??? where did that come from???? stupid. revenge scenes: first of all, i wasn't upset enough to thirst for revenge. second of all, the murder scenes were even weaker than the rape scene.what you've basically got here is a movie hollywood could remake, scene for scene, including every gratuitous moment. and it would get made. it would show in theaters. and lots of annoying people would think it was horrifying. go rent ""irreversible"" it's much better at this sort of thing."
0,I Spit On Your Grave After no word for three weeks I was sent a message that I had been sent notice that the product was unavailable. Not true. The message arrived the day after the last day that I was to expect it. I would have appreciated a timely message so I could look somewhere else. Instead the import CD wasted three weeks of my time.
0,Waste of money ! From the name of the movie you will think that you will see real good horror movie. In fact the story was so bad .....it is not worth it to waste your time and money .....!
0,"Waste of time, soft core trash! I Spit on Your Grave, more like I spit on this movie. How anyone can like this movie is beyond me. I personally like violent movies, but movies of class and style, such as (Goodfellas, Halloween, and The Exorcist), but I Spit on Your Grave has neither, just a woman getting raped in the first half, and her revenge in the second half. Mabey the reason critics hate this film(HA-HA) so much is because it really does suck. Their really is no bacic story, and acting that deserves turkey awards for the entire cast. Come on people quit wasting your time on a movie that no one can even say (this is a horror movie, a suspence movie, or a drama) because honestly I don't even know myself. But I do know that this garbage should be banned from the public peroid..."
0,A poor film with not much story that should not be seen. This is a very low budjet film and really is nothing special. After seeing the exorcist I thought to myself I should start to get into these Banned movies. When this came through my door all that was in it was rape and more rape that should not be allowed to be seen in any country. It is not a horror or thriller but just more like a old cult film gone wrong. If you are looking for a film with a story line that is banned buy A clockwork orange.
0,Violent and Exploitive. Extremely violent horror/thriller about pretty young woman travelling to an island only to be beaten and raped by a gang of young holigans. Terrible film is banned in most countries and is an absolute abomination. Don't waste your time or money.
0,"A Grave Mistake This is one bad film. It has all the style and charm of a 1970 porno flick but with none of the benefits. Okay there me sex and violence, but is that enough? As that isn't even done well I saw no. All in all this is one Nasty Video."
0,"Garbage The only people I can see really trying to get this flick are poor souls in the UK who are curious as to why it was banned. I'll tell you why it should have been banned. Unfortunately in Britain they still censor and ban films, which is a joke, and people become obsessed with these ""nasty"" flick, most of them being just plain bad. Save your money, American or British, and pass over this poor excuse for a film."
0,"Sick and repulsive I gave this movie at least one star because the woman got revenge. I was so digusted and shamed by this movie[...]This is a sick, sick movie about a horrific experience that women face everyday. This movie is basically rape porn, so if you enjoy that then rent it, but if you are a normal human being and are sickened by the act (which is very graphic in this movie) then avoid this [...]."
0,"You have to be disturbed to enjoy this movie! Im not going to lie to you, but you do have to be slightly disturbed and/or sick to actually enjoy this movie. What can be enjoyable about watching a girl getting gang raped numerous times? And to say this is not worse than the likes of Deliverance is insane. Yes, there is a male rape scene in Deliverance, which again was not at all enjoyable to watch and i shall not be watching again, but the scene in that movie is far shorter and far less graphic than the rape scenes in I Spit On Your Grave. So basically, if you have any sanity and/or morals you will not enjoy this movie as there is absolutely nothing in the movie to enjoy."
0,"only pricks like this film This movie is just fake snuff. Thats it. Its boring, laughable, and not scary or disturbing in the least. Watch Last House on the Left, now thats scary!!"
0,mold issues like other had I ran a few batches with this and every time it got moldy. Then it attracted bugs in my kitchen(the seeds in the bag not the growing grass).
0,Has live grain bugs I received my order a couple of weeks ago. The shipment has live bugs -- Sawtooth Grain Beetles. I have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage. I have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds. Usually I place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out. This bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment. The seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star.
0,"Never could get the bells to work right I have some Woodstock bells for the patio, so I thought this would be great. It wasn't. No matter what I tried, I never could get the bells to go around and strike one another properly. I feel like this product was definitely not worth its price."
0,"i am still in a hole this game, sorry this item is not unfinished but it shouldn't even be in the market. Not only was it impossible to complete, it made me gag every time i hear the E.T. theme song. This game should be extreme punishment for kids to suffer if they misbehave or break something valuable.

It is a book that says what it is, but as a teacher, I could make all the signs that are in it and have access to most of the documents that could be legally binding. I was disappointed but should have known better...."

0,"Far from classic Two powerful interstellar magnates vie for control of human-controlled space in this early (1959) John Brunner novel. This is the only novel of Brunner's that I've read, but I have to assume that he improved considerably later since he produced two very highly regarded novels, ""The Sheep Look Up"" and ""Stand on Zanzibar."" This book is a bit of fluff that displays all of the worst traits of Golden Age science fiction--a nave faith in the ability of extraordinary individuals (invariably scientists) to engineer the optimum human destiny, and a maddening tendency toward endless exposition delivered through interminable conversations. The hero, Counce, subjects people to horrendous fates, including starvation and torture, all in the name of a greater good--and they love him for it later. I don't think this novel has ever been reprinted (I came across it in a used book store), and I can understand why."
0,"Pathetic excuse for a book Pathetic cut and paste typical of TFH. Oh, and the company also owns Nylabone, which they promote in every book. Make sure that you don't get one of their HOLLOW Nyalobones for your Neo. TFH has no scruples whatsoever."

0,"NOT WORTH THE 'JAILBAIT' I saw 'Jailbait' when it was first on MTV. I was looking foward to a stupid, funny entertaining teen sex comedy. What I got was a stupid, unfunny, offputting, offensive, teen pregnancy so-called 'comedy'. I happen to like MTV movies- I enjoyed '2gether', etc. but this was just plain bad. Do Yourself a favor and skip 'Jailbait' -ROBBIE SCHEER, 15 YEARS OLD"
0,"total waste I have used other hair styling tools so I am not totally inept with them, but this tool was a real failure on my hair. My hair is fine and straight and I wanted a little curve to it (achievable with other hot brushes). All it did was to frizz my (usually) non frizzy hair. The strands do not wrap tightly around the cylinder and this causes fly away hair. For anyone with my type of hair, I wd strongly advise against this tool."
0,"Infiniti by Conair BC173 I have shoulder length curly, fine hair. I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair. The brush does more blowing than straightening in my opinion - it is fine for drying hair. But I did not get the sleek, smooth, shiny effect that was promised by the straightening tool. It was nothing like the salon straightening job I normally get. I will be returning this styler ASAP. Very unhappy."
0,Hate it! I feel like I waisted money on this product. The clamps dont hold onto my hair like they should to straighten/dry my hair. My hair was still left looking like it was frizzy. I did a better job at blow drying my hair with a dryer and then straightening my hair with my straightener than using this product. Don't buy it!
0,Do not buy!!! This product is money going to the trash. I used it once and it doesn't do ANYTHING. It can hardly grasp the hair and can't really streighten anything. Simply doesn't fit.
0,"Never buying from Conair again While the thing worked just as good as a flat iron in half the time I went through 4 of these, in a little over a year. They All died within 3-5 months of each other. I called the company and gotten replacement for my first one and and was given a 6-10 week wait, so I buckled and bought another one...which died before they even sent me my replacement which was taking way longer then 10 weeks, when i called again asking where my replacement was, the guy we talked to said there was no reason i should have even had that wait and that he'd make sure he sent a replacement for both dryers, and that they'd arrive in a timely manner. Which they did. Both replacements are dead. I switched back to my flat iron, which cost the same as one of those stupid driers but has lasted at least 4 years and still works like day 1."
0,"Twice the effort for half the sleekness My hair is about 90% straight and 10% wavy, so you wouldn't think it takes much to make it sleek, straight and shiny; I even use an ant-firzz serum before I style. But using this Conair took twice as long as drying and straightening my hair in two steps, and gave me half as straight hair. I even used my regular blow dryer first to get most of the dampness out, thinking this would speed up the process...but no, it took ages. The Conair is basically a very small hairdryer with a few brush bristles. When I was finished, my hair definitely had frizz and fly aways, and I had to go back over it with my Chi flat iron. I really wanted to like this product and to save time, but I will be returning it."
0,"Singed my hair after one use I used it just like it said, I brushed as it dried never leaving it in one place and after one use I found a section of hair that was burned.This gets too hot and their is no way to protect the hair shaft.It is going back and I will have to trim my hair"
0,hirdryer this is not what i wanted.i tryed to get a hold of someone to tell me where to send this back and no one could help me.they just shifted me around to some one else.i wont order again
0,too little band and too much buck Really only works with tension which is not possible at the ends of your hair. I would return it if I could. Very expensive for what you get.
0,dissapointed it really hard to use this product unless you are an stailist. Also it take time to straighten the hair and at the end is frizzy. I'm very dissapointed and it was a waste of money.
0,Total junk I owned this for less than 2 weeks when it stopped working and began to smell like it was burning. I returned it for a refund.
0,"Terrible This product was so awful, I returned it - something I RARELY do. It didn't dry or straighten well. My dryer and round brush were far superior to using this. I don't recommend this product."
0,"EVEN MY HAIR STYLIST THOUGHT THIS WAS A LOSER I bought this product thinking it was the perfect answer for my shoulder length slightly wavy fine hair, to give me a sleek styled look. Wrong! I tried numerous times to use this ""styler"" and found it awkward and useless at best. At worst, I felt like I was damaging my hair! I even took it to my hair stylist to see if there was some technique I needed to use for better results. She was baffled by the poor design of this product as well. My advice? Don't waste your money."
0,not worth it... It doesnt do anything to my hair but take an hour to dry it and make it frizzy. Doesnt do what it says it does. it makes it very poofy & frizzy.
0,"Doesn't straighten my hair I have extra long wavy thick hair. I've always wanted to be able to straighten my hair on my own without having someone else's help or going to a salon. This does dry my hair, but it doesn't make it straight, it always makes my hair frizzier and more dull. I would not recommend this product."
0,Not Pleased This dryer is not meant for ethnic hair. My hair doesn't get any straighter than it did using a regular blow dryer and brush. I wouldn't recommend it for women of color.
0,"My hair looked horrible after using this. I have frizzy hair and use a straightener. When I read about this product, I thought it sounded like what I had waiting for all my life!It made my hair drab and flat. I will go back to my former styling method."
0,"Not what I expected at all!! I puchased this product and was not happy with it at all!It is very sturdy and all that but after awhile using it - the handle is too heavy - which tends to put a strain on your wrist - i have long hair, straight hair and feel it for those who have this product and have curly, long hair - take it from me - if you insist of purchasing this product - get a wrist guard - cause after awhile you will feel the 'burn'.Hope this helps... I can surely say - i wasted my $$$$P.S. i would like to add - it last only 1 yr - used only 7 times out of that one year.."
0,"Does not work, electrical problem Just received it, plugged it in after watching DVD and reading instructions but it would not go on; tried reset button etc. with no luck. Will have to send it back. I have purchased other Conair products over the years but this was a big disappointmnet because I didn't get a chance to use it."
0,"Too Many Omissions to Count... The name of the film is American Hardcore, but never once mentioned are seminal Hardcore legends Reagan Youth, Warzone and the Angry Samoans. The Dead Kennedys, Misfits, Husker Du, 7 Seconds and Suicidal Tendencies are briefly mentioned and in no way given their due. Much of the running time of the documentary focuses on the California, Boston and DC scenes. But how can you cover Cali in depth without delving deep into the Dead Kennedys? The film is completely disjointed and has no rhyme or reason as they move from California to Boston back to California to DC and then briefly to New York. I know the intention was good but the product is subpar and heinously omits bands that should have gotten their 15 minutes for their contributions to this important underground scene. Not recommended."
0,"This translation from the French is HORRIBLE! Although I have not yet read the original French publications of these essays, I must express my dissapointment with this translation.

0,"Immoral movie This movie could have been so good. The storyline was great and the relationship between Mr. Sorrell & his son is wonderful. However, there were lots of bedroom scenes. Leading character was very immoral and there was language. In the end, the son winds up euthanizing his father after the encouragement of his wife. Very dissapointed"
0,"Unfortunatley, There Are No Grades Less Than One. This is the last William W. Johnstone book I buy. It was a pathetically written story.

0,"The Worst SF Movie I ever saw. It was the first time I ever felt a need to fast forward through a video and even then I couldn't stand to watch it. Fast forwarding through all the action on earth I was dumbfounded by the impossible plot on the space ship. Special effects or not, this movie is not worth paying for, I didn't - (checked it out of the local library).Take a hint from the Director credit: Alan Smithee - the real director did not even want his name on it."
0,"A high budget Sci-Fi mess The first sign that this film is no good is it's directed by ""Alan Smithee"". ""Smithee"" is a psudonyum for directors who want to disassociate themselves from a finished picture. Too bad the stars didn't have the same luxery: Peter Boyle, Jack Palance, Charlton Heston, Tim Matherson. The hard-to-follow story deals with evacuation of Earth during a probable supernova of the Sun (I think) but what you really get is an unstable bastardization of ""2001"" and ""Road Warrior"". This film may have impressive special FX but the best visuals in the world don't mean a thing if you don't have a halfway decent story to go with it."
0,"Exploding bomb! I would actually give this ""film"" no stars. Quite possibly, next to a few others, this has to be one of the most convuluted, boring and sickening movies to watch. Want the storyline? Refer to the title, and thats about as exstensive as it gets. I own this on laser disc and have wanted to burn it for years. So many quality films being excluded from dvd and this pile of junk gets released. Too bad alot of good actors got caught up in this mess, but they are just as responsible. Man, this is bad, dont waste a dime on it."
0,"I did not even finish this book I was told that Amanda Cross was a good mystery writer and looked forward to reading some of her works. After reading 4 of these short stories, I put the book down and will not look for any more of her works.I tried to over look the excessive use of fractured compound sentences, but the bizarre resolution of the stories was more than I could bear."
0,"Warning do not buy highpoint product I was originally sold highpoint rocketraid cards from a company that I buy my hard drives from. Highpoint implements a technology where one must use a browser to log onto the hard-drives in order to mount them, format them or do anything else with them.The trick is that sometimes the password works, sometimes not. So I am locked out of my own hard drives. This has happened several times to me. So far today I have been sitting in front of a dead computer for 8 hours waiting for Highpoint to return my tech help call - I have left 5 messages.In order to switch cards I must wipe out all my data. Which I am going to do as the frustration level of not being able to access my own hard drives is horrific. This company is basically holding me hostage.

0,"BOOOO, two thunbs Down! it was an EXCELENT movie but distroyed by Rhino. they Cut sceans, they Changed the movie, there are barelly NO extra features, and it is a bad transfer. this is just very disapointing. sorry to break it to you all but this is not worth the time or Money."
0,ATTENTION! NOT WHAT YOU THINK! The movie itself is FANTASTIC BUT beware that this is NOT the original 1986 movie. It's the Special Collectors Edition that's been remastered and includes foul language. The only way you'd know that is if you happened to mouse over one of the extra thumbnail images (and who does that?!).
0,"Pure Boredom I tried to watch this movie a couple of months ago. I am sorry. I see no sorry. It's a series of unrelated events and unanswered questions. Ugh. I don't see why people love this movie. Even if you are a Transformers' fan, you have to realize that this movie is sooooooooooooooooo boring. I had a hard time trying to watch this movie a second time.If you want real stories, check out Beast Wars and Beast Machines. Now that is entertainment."
0,"Parents, keep your children away! My child attempted to transform into a semi truck like the much lauded ""Optimus Prime."" He has not been able to stand up straight since 1986. It was weeks before we were able to detach the trailer. The Transformers are more than meets the eye, they are a disaster in disguise."
0,"one of the worst movies I've ever seen Even considering the fact that this movie is 25 years old, it's still bad. There are plenty of other animated movies from that era that are ten times better than this. I stopped halfway through watching this with my kids because I just couldn't bear it any longer. The animation is poor, but I can write that off to its age. The story is horrendous, with plot holes too numerous to count. On top of that, right in the middle of this movie I thought was geared for kids one guys yells an expletive at the top of his lungs. I don't recommend this for anyone."
0,"Awful DVD A lifetime TF fan of the original series, the movie was a classic, when I first saw it August 9, 1986. I wish the new characters didn't have to be introduced by killing off the favorite characters. It was awful to see fire spewing out of Prowl's mouth, when he was killed. And Ironhide's head being blown off by Megatron. I just saw the Kid Rhino DVD, and it was the sorriest way to bring a classic movie to DVD. The colors were too bright, and the animation was choppy. Besides the interview with the composer of the music, this DVD didn't have any features. It was just sloppily thrown together, just to get a DVD of the movie out there. I hope in the future, Paramount (Who is filming the new Transformers movie) gets in touch with Marvel/Sunbow, and re-release the original film, complete with trailers from the original film, plus toy commercials, featuring the movie characters. This is one movie, Kid Rhino, should have never put their hands on. This DVD sucked!!!!"
0,"Memories Yes, this is one of those movies you can never forget about. Most of us that grew up in the 80's remember this movie. Truly, this is one that i don't regret buying. Now that it is a part of my dvd collection, i can enjoy it over and over again. It can now be enjoyed by the next generation of kids can enjoy it as much as we all did when it came out."
0,"... Well, I just bought myself Transformers on DVD. Giggling like an idiot and running to my DVD player I was absolutley shocked when I threw it in. No extras whatsoever. Not even a theatrical trailer. Pan and Scan only ?!?!! Augh! Could it get any worse? Yep. The sound is horrible. Hissy and muted. The Video isn't incredible, either. on Par with the VHS copy. Perhaps slightly crisper. I'm not sure if I got a different version. It has a different cover than what's shown here on Amazon (I bought mine at a local video store) This version is released by a company called Seville and Sports a cover like the VHS Release froma few years back with Optimus. Needless to say. I was incredibly dissapointed. Disgusted, even."

0,Statistics It would be an interesting and informative exercise for both sides of the creationist/evolutionist debate if someone could produce some statistics on the proportion of readers of this sort of publication were bought to the fold of the lamb by it and the proportion who on reading it realised that the writer and many of his adherents had very real problems and were led to the assumption that all Christians were that way inclined and decided that they wanted nothing to do with them or their beliefs.If only from a crass marketing point of view the churches should give this some consideration if they are tempted to go along with these people with the intent of making new converts.Brian Giles
0,"Evolution is true Science in no way refutes evolution, if used correctly. The authors of this book don't have an inkling of what 'science' is. If you're thinking about buying this book, do yourself a favor and go buy ""On the Origin of Species"" by Charles Darwin. That is, if you care about the truth. This book is full of lies. What it preaches is blatantly wrong and you would be a fool to believe a word of it."
0,"The inability to think equates to the inability to vote ! This (comic) book tells us much more about the mentality of it's authors and readers then it does about evolution. And more importantly it helps to explain how the Repiblicans could convince a majority of voters to vote for an intellectual midget like G.W. Bush.It is now clear that an American conservative is one who believes that there is proof that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, but that evolution is an unproven fallacy!God (or Darwin) help the United States of America!"
0,can't believe I can't believe that so many people gave this piece of garabge high marks. This book and any thing else ever written Ken Ham is an absolute waste of a tree.
0,"Refuting nothing Sarafati's book begins promisingly, but soon degenerates into blatant and unashamed creationist propoganda. He presents a few problems regarding evolution that are worth ruminating over, but for the most part he merely contradicts himself and asserts, without evidence, that his view of the creation of the world fits sceintific evidence better than evolution does. The reader does not have to read far until Sarafati sheds any illusion of scientific fairness or reason. Good for an ardent creationist who would like a source to quote in argument, bad for anyone looking for any real scientific insight."

0,"A Memory There isn't much to add to the other comments except this: I attended the premiere of this little opus in Southern California back in the late '70s. Many of the stars, including Mae West, were in attendance. Afterward, making my way through the stunned crowd, I came face to face with Dom DeLuise. I will never forget the look that passed between us."
0,"only to see and enjoy the great Mae West well, what can i say about this movie, i just acquire it to see the great West on her 80s fun as ever in her last movie work. the dvd transfer? well i cant see any diference between it and the vhs format they have the same bad and poor image, but who cares is Mae West on it thats worth this dvd. for the Mae West fans is a great acquisition. well, she can even move, her voice is litle,but hello she was 85, and stills.... mmmm well come up and see me sometime."
0,"Unsatisfactory I waited almost two months to rent this video. Unfortunately., I was disappointed. The movie while poignant, was spasmodic and disjointed. I had to try too hard to piece together the events while they were occurring. James Caviezel's performance was compelling. Dennis Quaid's acting was fair."
0,Couldn't read it Pics are nifty. Watch Coal Miner's Daughter. Don't try to read this book. I know she was raised in the woods but trying to read like you are illiterate is kinda challenging.
0,"please look for a better source than SRW Those of us in the pagan/wiccan community rarely take Silver RavenWolf's writings as serious in nature, as her writings are filled with condescending tone, advice to lie for teens, and an obvious gimmick to make money without any regard for gaining credibility for the pagan community. If you are looking for credible resources, look to Scott Cunningham, Raymond Buckland, Christopher Penczak, Ellen Dugan, but if you see Silver RavenWolf RUN the other way."
0,"Ultimate? . . . Fluff! I bought this because it seemed to cover a lot of territory. In the end, that's its biggest fault--kind of a lick and a promise approach. Even worse is that this author seems to devote much of her efforts to feeding the usual teenaged angst, and giving youngsters the idea SHE is the only one who understands them. . . very dangerous territory, IMO. One thing to offer generic advice, and another to try to generate a cult following. Some useful stuff within, but even more to have to sift through with a grain of salt.

Here, Silver has successfully minced up her old works, thrown in some bogus information to taste, and hit the puree button on the proverbial blender.Personally, I wouldn't bother with the investment. I borrowed the book from a friend, and returned it disgusted, not wanting to buy it for myself. In this book, there are places where Silver begins to Christanize some of the Pagan ideas... in my opinion, she's just selling out her craft.If you're looking to get started in the craft, I would absoluely recommend some of her earlier books, like ""To Ride a Silver Broomstick"" and ""To Stir a Magick Cauldron."" These books are excellent, and essential additions to the library of any serious Witch. This new book, however, is defiently one that my bookshelf will be happier without!"
0,"Not a Fan I have tried to read the ""whole"" of the book, but find that the book has too many ""holes"".For those who are interested in the Wiccan path, read Scott Cunningham as a start as he, and there are others, who explain and teach with great wisdom.I am sorry I am not s fan of hers, but I find her books more for teenagers and certainly they should not be reading Silverwolf without having read a proper authority on Wicca. Sadly, hers are the books that remind me too much of Halloween and all the kiddy behavior that sometimes follows.Please, save your money."
0,"Was She Guessing??? Has she stopped researching for these books? I have never returned a book in my life but this one went back to the store. Being Asatru I immediately opened up to the section on runes. That was a joke, they were completely messed up. She changed the names, swapped meanings for the runes, and even included the blank one. Runes are not something that one can debate on, they are what they are. The section of teenie bopper spells was memorable. Of course that kind of throws the three fold rule out the window. Or drives the witch performing them into a pickle, I would not want that backlash. This book was a waste of perfectly good paper."
0,"Filler material for Wicaa wannabes. If you have no plans on taking Wicca seriously, read it by all means, but if you're exploring this as a legitimate religious option, stay away from her at all costs."
0,"Confused I purchased this book with the idea that it could be a good reference guide for a student I have been working with. I would have returned the book if I could have. Although it is focused toward the wandering teen, it's ideas are too scarce. The ideas within are not necessarily focused to any one religion, but a mix of all the different aspects that the author has put together as wicca. This is a choice that is made by the practicioner, and nowhere in this book does it stress this opinion.For those who would like some fun reading about what fantasy religion could be, this would be the book for you. For those who really need some insight into pagan or wiccan religion/spirituality should look elsewhere."
0,"Poor quality product The idea around this board game is a good one--to make it cooperative. The picture on the board itself is a colorful and fun graphic. However, the quality of the product is very poor. The game pieces are on such thin paper and so tiny it is difficult to pick them up. It is VERY over priced for the quality of the product. Should be more like $5. Peaceable Kingdoms game, Stone Soup, is $10 instead of $15 and the quality is superb."
0,"Poor quality without supporting service I totally agree with the other reviewers: the quality is very poor. damage the card in the beginning. very easy to lose small cards. very cheap made. does not worth $12. The idea is fun. But there are other better games at this price(I mean quality). BTW, there is no way to contact the seller or manufacturer. No phone number, no response. Do not buy this. Buy something made in U.S. At least you can talk to someone when there is a problem."
0,"Evil, Self-Mutilation, Vomiting, Defecation, Oral Sex, Abuse Here's my review: In this video your children WILL SEE: Marilyn Manson rubbing a Bible on his naked crotch; Marilyn Manson mutilating himself by cutting his chest with broken beer bottles; A band member vomiting back stage; A band member forking a piece of excrement; Marilyn Manson performing oral sex on his (male) lead guitarist? They will hear a woman being abused. She was actually being abused or she was the best actress on the planet. They will see hate and agression, all in the creative guise of free speech - you couldn't call it entertainment. Oh yeah, there was some music in there too.It's America and he has the right to do so, to do so doesn't make it right."
0,"Don't buy! Don't waste your money! The original book was far better than this version. So was the 70s version, one of those ""Made for TV"" movies.Find the book wherever you can, and read it.

0,"Prince of Centeral Park Many years ago, I saw was fortunate to see off Broadway show ""Prince of Central Park"" Reason I say fortunate, is because UNFORTUNATELY this was in and out. Everyone I was every telling about this show has never heard of it. I have to say that that was THE most impressive shows I have ever seen. Many years later I came across this movie and was excited because I could finally share it with my husband who I was telling so much about the show. Unfortunately the movie was not done as powerfully as the show was. Even thought the subject is very moving. I wish this Broadway Show would be back."

0,"More Like ""Royal Rape"" The so-called ""hero"" of this book is nothing more than a rapist. For goodness sake, the first time they get together, he throws her down, holds her down and rapes her, and yet this is somehow supposed to be seen as romantic.This book is sickening. It does not deserve to be called a romance novel."
0,Not a great book! This is absurd. I don't know how the other reviewers judged this book. It is based on [assault] of an innocent girl and coersion. I'm forced to give a 1 star because no stars is not an option. The author is way off base in this one. I stopped reading the book when the prince mistook Angeline for Claire and proceeded to [assault] her.
0,"Shallow and Poorly Thought Out The best thing about Morey's book is the Recommended Reading list at the end. Too bad he didn't study some of the books he listed. John Howard Yoder could have helped him tremendously. For the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century. Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions. If you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war , this is not it. But if you want a shallow piece of work that may reinforce your prejudice, When Is It Right To Fight? may be exactly what you have in mind."

0,"Concept is interesting but, doesn't amount to much... It seems that Korine has just decided to make his script as controversial as possible so that it would at least allow him some publicity for a film that probably would have otherwise sunk without trace. Being a small independent movie, it suffers the effects of such a budget; bad sound, camerawork and even actors (apart from Sevigny). Unlike many other films that are similar in content and subject matter, Clark's direction doesn't raise it above standards. Boys Don't Cry is a classic example of an 'indie' film that has risen above prejudices concerning independent films due to Peirce's sharp direction and haunting photography."
0,"Horrible I am only 14 years old. I would think that a movie like this would have an impact on someone my age. It didnt. It nearly put me to sleep. It was the biggest waste of money in my life. I just bought it today and am throwing it away today also.All this movie offers is an inaccurate portrait or teens, and the story of a group of moron teenagers who thinks its cool to be going around drinking, smoking, engaging in brutal fights with people and other acts of vandalism, having sex with girls between the age of 12 and 15, and stealing from their parents.This was a huge waste of an hour and a half. I only gave this movie 1 star because amazon doesn't allow me to give it 0.If you are looking for a movie that offers the story of troubled teens, and is GOOD, Thirteen is the movie you wanna watch."
0,"I hate wiggers The sex, drugs, violence and constant marijuana usage didn't get to me. What got to me where the unbelievably annoying accents of white kids trying to be black.

0,"A modern-day ""Reefer Madness"" I watched this film with some at-risk teenagers and probably the funniest comment I heard was, ""They made this movie like a documentary because the rest of it is so fake."" When I first saw it, I was like other people who think that this is an artistic reflection of real life. I grew up with kids who used drugs and sex for recreation, and I imagined that things had gotten worse since I left my teens.Then I listened to the comments of teens who have lived in crackhouses, who have been shot at, who were raised by folks who traded their bodies for drugs or cash - and THEY'RE saying this movie is unrealistic.Telly, with his multitude of willing virgins, is more a dark fantasy of a teenage player than a real teen - rather like ""Reefer Madness,"" which had more to do with middle-class America's fear of marijuana than actual drug use. I wonder if this film will seem as dated in a few more decades as ""message"" films from the '60s and '70s."
0,"""kids"" will be kids People are forgetting how to make memorable films without having to shock people to get it noticed. There are a bunch of kids , wearing droopy jeans, with their undies hangin out, who do drugs and have sex. Full of annoying slang and even worse fashion. It was too ""directed"" and wooden. If I hear ""peace out"" one more time my head will explode...It was like watching one of those boot camp episodes on ""Sally"" Jesse Raphael.."
0,"If you want to send a message... I watched this movie when I was in high school. I hated every last minute of it, as did everyone I watched it with. The person who insisted we rent it apologized profusely. Spending two hours watching a movie about the type of person I was glad to see wind up in juvie was about as rewarding and worthwhile as shooting myself in the leg with a nail gun."
0,"Where was Robin Williams? The only thing that could have made this movie better is Robin Williams. I expected a ""wonderfully funny, bright and cheery"" (the New York Times) cameo performance by the Great Hairy Comedian, but instead I just got a bunch of kids talking about sex. Big deal, I can get that walking into Soho."
0,"Dreck for Dreck's Sake You have to have an affinity for what is most loathsome in human nature to appreciate the unrelenting vileness and a-morality celebrated in this movie. Okay, whether it is actually celebrated is, of course, arguable. However, this movie does nothing more than show us sordidness after sordidness: Teenage Telly practicing his favorite pasttime (next to getting high, perhaps)--painfully deflowering very young virgins; Telly kicking some poor slob nearly to death. Sex, drugs, sex, drugs, ad tedium.This movie might show us what *some* kids indulge in, but it really shows us nothing new, leads us to no new understanding of, well, anything under the sun except perhaps our own stoicism should we heroically make it through the entire movie.In a word: Blech!"
0,"It was stupid I can't imagine why anyone would praise this film. Okay maybe it is a reality check for our society, but so what?? It's a horribly acted, horribly scripted, uncreative, unoriginal and VERY exploitive film. The mere fact that it accurately depicts the lowest form of young degenerates in American society doesn't by itself make this a good film. Any idiot can film a bunch of teens having sex, getting intoxicated, beating up and raping people. But the film doesn't go beyond these depictions. it doesn't offer any solutions or explore the root causes of such behavior. And how many times do we need to be shown teens having sex or being raped to get the message? One time was shocking enough to be educational. Three or four times turns it into simple exploitation. This is little more than glorified child pornography."
0,"Boring This is low grade, boring, exploitative rubbish. Only shocking to the thoroughly naive. It's high rating is a testament to the gullibility of the general public."
0,"Absolutely horrible. This is by far the worst movie I have ever watched. Perhaps it is realistic if you live in inner city New York, or Chicago, but the majority of the world does not live like this. And there are very few teenagers that have the maturity to watch this and not think it's ""cool"" to do these things. This movie was all about shock value. And it looks like it served its purpose."

0,"Wow, this is BAD! I think this may have grazed my top ten list of bad horror movies (it is right up there with movies like ""half-caste""). This just redefined the word bad. It is defecation. The best way to describe this is to imagine an episode of the power rangers meeting an MTV boy band video: It has very bad acting, slow, generic killing scenes (each victim is surround by members of a boy band and smothered so you cannot see what they do to the victim) At least half of the movie is a generic music video (singing throughout the movie) You almost have to see it to believe it, and I definitely wouldn't recommend seeing it. This movie is the equivalent to getting kicked in the groin or going to the dentist. This movie will make you want to hurt someone, or vomit uncontrollably. It will make you want to peel your eyelids off with a fork. Oh and did I mention it was bad?"
0,Wow bad even by DeCoteau standards A real time waster. Not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that.
0,"Oh no... One star is being generous, this is probably the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen some pretty bad ones. I like B horror movies but this was WAY below that. It actually played out more like a gay porno movie than anything else with the blood ritual in black briefs? IF the movie were going for $4.99 I'd consider sending it to my cousin as a joke who loves zombie movies. But these weren't even zombies, they had grey makeup and looked kind of like the guys from V, the old movie/TV Show, but they didn't even have scales! It was just grey makeup! Do yourself a favor and run, don't walk, away from this film! Cooking with Porn stars was a better buy than this would be, and that movie was REALLY bad. I don't know who thought to sell it for $24, discounted to $22, but if they sell one at that price, it should just about cover the budget for the film with those ""special"" effects of the burnt zombies which were really piles of sand from down the beach on the same set."

0,"Quality is an illusion While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax."
0,"Emma - Noteable for dubious reasons There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered. It was written by a woman. If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit. The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's ""Frankenstein"", Kate Chopin's ""The Awakening"", Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple"", ""Nectar in a Seive"" by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" by Zora Neale Hurston. All of these works have better characteristics than ""Emma"", and prove to be superior to all of Austen's writings.Trust me, ""Emma"" is a waste."

The characterizations are awkward, the plot contrived, and the prose is so roughly handled it makes a reader queasy. Pride and Prejudice at least had a little humor in it, but ""Emma"" has no redeeming qualities. I don't recommend spending your time on this one."
0,"PRUNELLA SCALES NO HEIGHTS I've always been a fan of the British actress Prunella Scales and already own some of her readings of classic novels, including Cranford which she handles delightfully.So it was a big disappointment to find that she seems to have completely misjudged her narration of Emma. One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."
0,"Don't waste your time or money I bought this book because my book group had chosen it for a ""classic"" read. I can't imagine why anyone would waste their time and money on this book. I could barely get through the first 50 pages or so until I gave up on it. As far as I'm concerned, the characters were worthless and their activities were pointless. Why anyone still reads Jane Austen is beyond me. If this book is an example of her writing, it is terrible! People in my book group said her other works are better but I won't be reading them."
0,"Poor Condition This book is VERY poor condition. The pages are uneven and look like they were cut when the blade needed changing or sharpening or cut with too many at once.I am returning it to Amazon, the only good thing is that I bought it with Amazon, they are paying for return shipping. I have to say that I am very pleased with Amazon's CS. I am a frequent customer and will continue to be."
0,"Doesn't survive the test of time I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention."
0,"No classic in my mind After reading Emma by Jane Austin I am very much considering not reading another book by Jane Austen.I was very dissapoited with the book. I am new to readint ""the classics"" and after looking at several ""classic"" reading lists found this book to be on several. I decided to read the book and even completed it against my better judgement. I found the book extremely boring and would not recomend it to anyone outside of maybe teenage girls."
0,"Indypublish.com edition is a flimsy computer printout The name of the publisher should have clued me in to the fact that this edition is only an imitation of a real children's book. Perkins' original book was charmingly illustrated; this has no illustrations at all. This is disorienting as well as disappointing, since even the first line of the text refers to an illustration. The lack of illustrations greatly reduces its appeal to younger children. The edition is flimsily bound, and closely resembles a manual that might come with your new Kenmore washer."
0,"A disgrace to both original film and Margery Sharp! This Disney sequel, ""inspired by characters created by Margery Sharp"" totally rips the appeal of the original novels and the original Disney animated classic. This sequel hardly captures Sharp's world, it only offers the same title characters but those have become probably the most boring characters in the film. The whole thing has turned into a modern day ""adventure."" I really don't have much to say about the plot other than it seems to me as a remake of the first film.Even though the first film twisted Sharp's world a lot, it was still a fine piece of beautiful animation and smart storytelling. This sequel has nothing especial and has no heart. Skip it. There are better films out there. Too bad for Bernard and Bianca, though...

Nothing happens here that relates to the first movie, there was no need for it at all!But to have Miss Bianca and Bernard marry?! That's like shooting Margery Sharp!

My 8 year old daughter absolutely loves them, but what little I have read when reading with her is just gawd-awful. Thank goodness she can read these by herself. I find it hard to believe the spectacular ratings these books have received here. I found the writing to be almost unbearable. The author uses the same few adjectives, verbs and adverbs over and over again, and she seems incapable of writing a sentence that does not contain the repetitive names of two or more cats. Has she never heard of pronouns? Maybe the story is compelling, I wouldn't know, but no story could be compelling enough to make me wade through this horrible writing. True, the target audience of these books is very young, but writing for a third-grader does not mean one has to write LIKE a third-grader."

This book is NOT for young children. I don't want to have to explain to my son what at ""Cutter"" is and why cat's would be afraid of it. I don't think that young children should be hearing about the pleasure that cats (or any animals) get from a fresh kill. Those just aren't the types of things I want to introduce to him at his age. This book should really be targetted for older children (teenagers), not young readers. Besides the issue of the target audience, I do feel the writer does capture the feelings of cats as best as a human can capture an animals ""feelings"", but I also think that the writing is not particularly polished or engaging. I would not recommend this book."
0,"Frightfully BORing, ol' chap When I read that Hollinghurst had a new book out, and a prize-winner at that, I was really looking forward to reading it. I requested it from my public library and had to wait a couple of months for it to become available. After part 1, pg. 160 (Nick's first ""love"" affair), the book was due back, and I gladly returned it. Read the other 1-star reviews, and I TOTALLY agree with those in-depth reviews.I found it impossible to ""relate"" to and/or care about ANY of the characters in this book--two important criteria for a ""good"" book-- in my opinion."
0,Utter rubbish I agree with a previous critic that this is one of the worst books ever to win the Booker. I hated it so much - its obsession with people of no consequence and the belief that it was 'recording' something important. It is crass and banal. Awful. Don't get me started on its attempt to be shocking!
0,"Tremendous, unmitigated downer One of the worst books I have ever read. A perversion of an unquestionably great talent (and I don't mean the sex). The worst thing in art is using talent to send out a message that is without hope.There is a lot of very explicit sex in this book. No problem with that. The problem is that none of these mostly very unlikeable people learns anything, grows as a person, shows any degree of integrity or finer human qualities. They show the worst side of humanity, something worth looking at, but without a spark of hope for something better, it is just a collosal bummer.True art uplifts, inspires, enlightens. It makes us face up to the worst of ourselves and ultimately makes us glad to be human."
0,"Nig-Nog? One wishing to learn about racism in the gay community would do well by reading the collected novels of Mr. Hollinghurst. The graphically brutal rape of the white protagonist by the black cook near the end of The Swimming Pool Library is disturbing; but no less so than Hollinghurst's gratituous use of racial slurs and the stereotypical depiction of the ""black"" council clerk, Leo, in this contemporary ""masterpiece"".Not my cup of tea."
0,"nothing beautiful about it I had such high hopes for this book - nominated for all those prizes! If you're looking for gay fiction then this book is for you. It should be sold with the porn magazines - the first 100 pages ramble on and on about gay sex - but never get to a storyline. I tried to endure. I kept hoping there was a story! I grew up in Britain and thought this sounded like a great perspective on the Iron Lady (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher) and 80's Britain. But it's just about a guy trying to fit in with a bunch of snobbish upper class twits! Oh yes, and there's lots of gay sex."
0,"Boring, boring, boring I found reading the book very tedious. He takes chapters to say very little. I had to read the book for a book club, or I wouldn't have finished it."
0,"???????? i liken this book to fitzgerald's ""tender is the night."" and that is not a good thing. people of no substance plod through hundreds of dull dull pages. are people really this shallow? this empty? probably. but, my god, do i have to read about them? no. i do not. i simply could not finish this book (and that is rare). i wasted valuble reading time for about 300 pages, then had to admit it just wasn't working. because of all the critical acclaim this book recieved, i was very much looking forward to reading it. what a major disappointment! i am truly puzzled by the positive response this thing gets from so many people. great writing? really? i just did not see much of that here. shouldn't a book have at least one interesting character in it? it seems that dullness is making a comback in critical circles these days. too bad."
0,"the literary equivalent of watching grass grow This book wins my award for the most unreadable novel ever written: English twits talking endless twaddle. Thats all there is. No plot, no suspense, no conflict, no characterization, no development of anything--you could shuffle the chapters and it would make no difference in either the novel's outcome or rampant boredom. It is simply a litany of shallow upper class stereotypes making prissy comments about the insignificant concerns in their lives--i.e. a character's ""confusingly firm buttocks ... set off by his tight Fred Perry shorts."" That's about the depth of character insight one gets in this novel. Read it at your peril."
0,"Confusing even if you are not an idiot This book is poorly organized and confusing. The authors used way too many quotations from other sources, i.e. books, websites. In the end, I have to wonder what the authors' own take is on the subject. It doesn't have a backbone of its own, period."
0,"Do not buy REMANUFACTURED from this outlet! I received a broken waffle maker. Sent it back, received another broken waffle maker. Both were broken due to poor packing. They both were broke in a place that could not be fixed to be operational.Save the headache and buy the newer Waring Pro PROFESSIONAL waffle maker with the fold down handle. If you shop around you can find one for about ten buck more than the remanufactured cleaper line for a much better waffle maker, and brand new! Would NOT recommend rebuilt on this item. Would give ZERO stars not one! Also bad customer service."

0,"Don't waste your cash. Ok let me start by saying that this cd is really [bad]. The only thing that saves it is the song Cadillac. Other than that, this cd is about as good as shoving forks into your ears. It has some semi-decent music, but the lyrics are so [bad] it isn't natural. I think their are so many bands that are better than M.E.S.T. (like Good Charlotte, A Simple Plan, and my personal favorite The Sarting Line) that you shouldn't waste your money on this garbage, unless you want to hear the song Cadillac (which for some reason is really good), but i just suggest that you download it."
0,"posers they aren't real punk, they are just pop-punk. Good Charolatte (however you spell their name), A New Found Glory, Blink 182, and Sum 41 aren't punk either they are all posers like Mest.

0,"Junk -- will flood your kitchen Expensive and works for less than 3 years, at which time it will flood your kitchen. I've had two dispensers and both flooded the kitchen. How this product stays on the market is beyond me."
0,"save your money We listened to this once, and kept thinking, ""When will this end?"" It sounds like someone had a cheap synthesizer system, and put it together in their basement. After listening to this version, we put on a stereo recording we had of Bolero by a real orchestra. The difference was astonishing."
0,Strange sound I love music... all kinds of music. Ravel Bolero is one of my all time favorites... but certainly not this one. It was very disjointed. I wish I had save the $$$. If anyone wants it I'll let it go for 1/2 price!I do have to say that the sonics were great though. It did show off my system soncially... but I sure hated the interpretation of this ordinarily fine piece of music. I bet Mr. Ravel turned over in his grave when he heard it.
0,"Pathetic My rating for this product is no stars at all. Of maybe a dozen versions of this wonderful piece of music that I have heard in almost 60 years of music enjoyment, this piece must be the worst. I was so hungry for DVD-Audio surround sound recordings that I purchased two recordings from this company ""ears unheard"". This was the worst waste of money I have ever encountered. I would mail the disks back to the company to let them know my displeasure but it isn't even worth the postage.Yes, it is indeed a synthesizer all the way through. Feel free to purchase it but only if you totally understand that this is an experimental piece playing around with surround sound recording. DO NOT BUT IT IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A DVD RECORDING OF A REAL ORCHESTRA."
0,"expensive mistake I was very dissappointed in this disc. Syntesized instruments don't even come close to reproducing Boleros majesty,not to mention many were out of key,and it was a poor quality attemt at reproducing the sounds of the symphony instuments!!! Don't waste your money,I'm sorry I bought it."
0,A Decent Book Pick It Up ! This was a good book but not what I was expecting. The first few pages had me hooked but then I lost my my pace along with the author.Things that seem to make sense melt into a burning candle dripping down a frozen glacier two degrees north of the equator. Now I'm forever Three Doors Down ! Try it if you dare!!
0,Not worth the penny it cost The seller provided timely shipping. However the product is junk. The sound is muffled and intermittently goes up and down when I move the input cable. I guess you if you buy cheap you get cheap. I have since ordered a name brand device to cassette converter which I hope will work better.
0,"Doesn't work for me. I wish it worked -- but it doesn't for me. I have an old Land Rover Discovery with a working tape deck -- but I place this in with my iPhone attached and nothing.

0,"Toy has a basic design flaw We bought this toy for our 2 year old who loves to play with her toy kitchen. This is a basic fun toy - all kids love to take things in and out of something at this age.However, this toy has a basic design flaw and we ended up tossing it out after just 3 days.The basket holds onto the base with a very flimsy amount of plastic that sort of latches on the bar across the back of the base. This plastic makes a simple hook that is relatively easy for young kids to take on/off but it doesn't have nearly enough material to last. My daughter pushed down on the basket once and the plastic cracked and the backet then hung down. Then we tossed it and were very dissapointed.Hope this helps you pick a better quality toy."
0,Dont' waste your $$$...breaks within 6 months! We bought this showerhead so it could help our skin and my dd's eczema. It was great while it lasted but now cracked in 2 places and is unusable. I can't believe I paid over $60 for it!
0,"Expensive and poor quality - not a good combination Regardless of their orientation in politics, I think most people would agree that a dictionary should give objective definitions of ideas, not opinions of the author. This ""dictionary"" does not have an ounce of objectivity in it. The author frequently substitutes his opinion of an idea for the definition of it.Also, given the price, I expected a bigger book. It's not very large, though admittedly it has had most of the terms I wanted to look up in it.If I knew of a better dictionary for politics I would recommend it; since I don't, I simply recommend not wasting your money on this one."
0,"Wrong, very wrong! I started to read just the introduction and I started to sense that something was wrong, very wrong. Besides the assumption of eco-feminism as compatible with Orthodoxy, he discusses the occult he was deeply involved with in terms that made me more than uncomfortable: admiration, an ambassador's tone in describing occult matters, almost reminiscent of patriotism. This is the sort of thing one should speak of out of deep humility spurred by repentance from serious sin.This is the first time I have purchased a book that I thought was Orthodox theology and didn't get past the introduction before regretting I'd made the purchase.If you wonder, ""Does this critic have anything better to say?"" then <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/author/cjshayward"">I invite you to visit my own author's section.</a>"
0,"Very disappointing video This video focuses on children trying to sing their favorite songs. You don't see very many Sesame Street characters; it's mostly about other children. It lost my son's attention (14 months old) almost immediately.The first video (Kids' Favorite Songs) shows Sesame Street characters singing, and he loves this."
0,"We're dissapointed... My kids (age3, boy & girl) love ''KIDS FAVORITE SONGS'' video . So I purhased this video for them. We do not want to watch an interview program! I want to give my kids song video. I had been deceived by that title."
0,"Unimpressed! We have the first video Kids Favorite Songs, which my son just adores. I was so thrilled to find out that there was a second edition, and bought it for Christmas. It is terrible. He could care less about this video. It is not entertaining at all since they use mostly kids that can't sing, and hardly any puppets like the first one. Very dissapointed and a waste of money. Do not recommend!"
0,"Astonishingly Poor Re-mastering! I cannot believe that this imported product by Universal Music, that contains many of the most important recordings by the Four Tops would be ruined by poor digital re-mastering. The volume level for all of the tracks is low and the sound is thin and tinny. I own another Universal Motown GOLD SERIES box by Martha and the Vandellas and it is re-mastered at 24 bit and the sound is amazing. It is because of the Vandellas collection that I purchased this Four Tops set and instead of getting a real winner, I get a gigantic loser. It is so true that you can't judge a book by it's cover. Now that I have spent my money on this CD I notice that all of the other Motown Gold series critiques on Amazon have 5 star ratings except for this one which has no ratings at all. Poor sound is the reason. Well, you now have my rating of 1 star."
0,"Kindle Edition unreadable Aside from the other flaws pointed out, it doesn't have any chapter breaks. If Amazon doesn't want a good edition available for free for the Kindle, that's their business, but that this one comes up first on the search page sullies the reputation of the Kindle, of free books available over the Internet, and of Ulysses itself. (I'm not going to say Ulysses isn't a challenging read, but it's an impossible one here.)"
0,"This edition is an incomplete text! This edition omits most everything that appears in the print edition centered in the page, i.e. the poetry and songs like ""The Ballad of Joking Jesus,"" noted by other reviewers. Utterly unacceptable for a book written with care to every word."
0,"Unreadable This is not a story. This is nonsense. Other reviewers who called it ""unreadable"", ""verbal flatulence"", ""emetic"", ""well nigh incomprehensible"", are spot on correct. Unless you really hate yourself, do not attempt to read this book."
0,"This is a literary masterpiece??????? The book consists of an overabundance of mini-stories that are irrelevant to each other and there is no real plot. If you took this book into a publisher nowadays, he or she would probably throw it at you and then laugh in your face. I had to have been published on a dare, then banned as a publicity stunt. If you want to read it, I would suggest going to the library. Don't waste your money."
0,"Not for ebooks Ulysses is a book that must be held, not battery powered. I doubt James Joyce would like his books as ebooks. Any more than Shakespeare, Ovid, Milton, Boethius, Sartre, Shelley, Kazantzakis or Tobias would. It's not an appropriate fit. These authors transcended the instantaneous, the inelegance of electricity. They wrote by candle-light, just as Nureyev danced by candlelight."
0,"Pretentious intellectual self-absorption I was tempted to write this review after reading the other reviews. It seems that most readers had to struggle through it or use Cliff Notes. In short, it seems many succumbed to the peer pressure that it was a ""great"" book and that they just ""had"" to read it. It puts me in mind of someone going to an art gallery full of atrocious modern art and faking that they liked it to show how sophisticated they are. The truth is this book stinks.For one thing it is vulgar, which, I hate to disappoint anyone, requires no talent at all. This is a talent any six year-old boy possesses. Is the wordplay clever? Yes, too clever. James Joyce must have been incredibly pleased with himself.(...)himself."
0,"Awful Indecipherable rubbish.I bought this door stop because it is on everyone's list of Great Books. I read 200 or so pages and had to stop, I'd rather have a root canal without anesthesia than read the rest of it. I am a college educated English major, but how this random witlessness can share a shelf with Steinbeck, Vonnegut, Hemingway, Orwell or Forster and a number of other fine authors escapes me."
0,"This book is WAY overrated...definitely NOT the #1 book ever I know the Modern Library picked this as the #1 book of all-time, which was one of the reasons I chose to read it. However, I was sorely disappointed in it. I like books that I can read without having to scrutinize every page in abhorring detail. A book like Huckleberry Finn is a very readable book that I can read on one level and my son on another and both take a lot away from it. A book like Ulysses has only one level, and it's way to deep to enjoy. The ""story"" gets lost in the chaff. I have never used Cliff Notes in my life, but was forced to buy them about halfway through this book and was surprised to find some ""obvious"" things I missed. If you want a good book, read Frankenstein, Huck Finn, any Dickens, etc but skip this ""classic"" and leave it to those folks who like to disect a book and not enjoy it..."
0,"uggghhhhh uggghhhh, after nine months i finally finished this rambling, incoherent string of words.i took this book on because i'm reading the 100 best books of the 20th century (as defined by the modern library). i had read about 20 already before taking on this 'project'. so why not start at number 1? big mistake.when i bought it, i had no idea what it was about, and i actually became excited when i heard that it loosely followed the odyssey. was i ever disappointed. this book just kept rambling and rambling. 2/3rds of the way through i still didn't know what was going.the only reason i know anything about this book (even after finishing it) was because i went on the internet and found 'ulysses for dummies' - a cartoon depiction of the book. my suggestion, save yourself 9 months and read 'ulysses for dummies'whoever listed this as number 1 was smoking too much crack - since i can't afford a nine-month crack habit, i guess i'll never be able to truly appreciate it."
0,"Obfuscation incarnate! I had to read this (years ago) because I took English as a minor when I was an undergraduate. I cringe at the memory and the heated discussion I had with the professor (a Joyce fanatic). Now as a librarian I decided to give it another attmept, trying to keep an open mind. I have to give Joyce points for being clever and kudos for verbosity. After struggling through it again, I had to ask myself what was the point? Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun.To me as a reader, literature requires something more than an exercise in erudition or diction. I may be in a distinct minority here, but I still dislike Joyce for inflicting such a circus upon readers."
0,"Everybody's favourite pitch There are few books that could actually change your life, as in change the way you view artistic creativity, and Ulysses is one of them; reason being because Ulysses is the bible for modern writers in its unparalleld absorption of culture and human folly. Typically, this novel is a university favourite as there is so much to discuss, unravel and admire.I don't see how anybody can say that Ulysses is their favourite read. Like all of Joyce's works it is not particularly warm and, for me, wasn't a work to inspire and enflame the spirit. As you all know, or should know, Ulysses is the most important fictional text of the 20th century and that in itself makes it worthwhile to the patient reader."
0,"""What he's saying, I know not..."" Having gotten through ""Portrait of the Artist"" and ""Dubliners,"" I can now say James Joyce has to be the most arrogant, overrated author EVER. For someone with so clearly a gift for language, he lacked one important thing: THE ABILITY TO TELL AN INTERESTING STORY. Without a plot, it's just a bunch of random thoughts thrown at the wall, which is what this giant pile of excrement truly is. Don't buy the hype, I've read dozens and dozens of books deemed 'classic' and I found most to be labeled so for good reason. James Joyce is NOT a great writer, and this proves it. Awful, just awful..."
0,"A waste of your time Considered such a masterpiece - I HAD to read it. What a waste of time...First - the language: extremely difficult and archaic. Even for English speaking people. Can one enjoy a book if one needs a dictionary every couple of lines ?Then the allegedly 'cultural' riddles Joyce planted in the book for the sole purpose of torturing generations of English literature students and their teachers. Ask yourself - are you going to enjoy a book that neccesitates your literature teacher lie next to you and explain its 'sophistication' to you ? Every other page ?Then the foreign languages quotes in latin, german, irish, italian and who knows what else...Did Joyce expect his readers to be THAT fluent in other dialects ?Personally - I think Joyce wrote the book being completely drunk. Or worse.Last but not least - the story, the time frame and the main characters - boring, boring and then boring again.Your reading time could be used on much more pleasant, interesting books. Really."
0,Soporific I read somewhere that this book has been termed the greatest book of 20th century in American History. I absolutely have no clue why. I think its just a hype.This book is very dry in prose and its hard to keep reading for more than 10 minutes. For me its one of the most soporific books - it makes me doze off in a few minutes in the middle of insomnia.
0,"James Joyce Needed an Editor How could a book like Ulysses ever have made it to print? The grammar is so disjointed as to make it nearly impossible to read. Additionally, the point-of-view and writing style change in nearly every chapter after the sixth. It should also be mentioned that the story is not very well paced. The book is well over 600 pages long, but the events in the story appear to take place over the course of just a single day.I have heard numerous people praise this book, but that would seem to be largely posturing because the story is lost under the weight of inadequate editing."
0,"Der, I like stories! This is one of those books that ""smart"" people like to ""read."" Well if being smart means liking this, count me out! I don't know if it's modern, post-modern or what: but I know this much, I'd rather just curl up with ""Bridges of Madison County"" for a good cry! I don't understand why such a 'great' author can't seem to come up with a straightfoward plot that makes sense. I'd like to have seen Leopold patch things up with Molly, am I right? I mean, let's get down to brass tacks: don't we all hate those intellectuals who consider this one of the century's 'finest works of literary craft'? I mean these are the people who put ""Citizen Kane"" in the top ten...and totally ignored ""Life as a House""! (No offense, but Orson Welles is no Kevin Kline!) Unless Oprah puts it on her book list, I won't be picking this one up again, that's for sure."
0,"English writer,so how much you can expect from him? What an awful book this is?When an English/American writer try to explain his/her ideas about life(I mention ideas about meaning,purpose and philosophy of life)and when he/she try to do this with complicated ideas and long sentences(or like very short ones especially in this particular book);what his/her work become to is:A tremendous nonsense!!!When you see a book like that I mentioned above(and I also warn you against it),all you need to do is:RUN,RUN, RUN AWAY!!!NOTE:My ideas about English/American writers doesn't concern Shakespeare."
0,"Do not buy the Simon & Brown Edition The Simon & Brown Edition is a poorly laid out version of the novel. It appears as if a print on demand (POD) publisher hastily assembled the book from Project Gutenburg or some other public domain source. There are inexplicable spaces between lines and paragraphs, the dialogue is bulleted and has no quotation marks, the page numbers are all on the bottom left of the page, etc. Overall an amateurish attempt. I am returning this version today."
0,This book is NOT annotated! There are no notes in this book. It's just a copy of the text. Please title appropriately. That is all.
0,"Can't Read It, Can't Hear It Tried many times to read the book, thought maybe this would be better. It isn't. Nice package, though, and it will make a great doorstop."
0,"Hugely dissapointing I bought this having been a huge fan of the cartoon series, but Mr Joyce has taken a winning formula and produced a prize turkey. After 20 pages not only had Ulysses failed to even board his spaceship, but I had no idea at all what on earth was going on. Verdict: Rubbish."
0,"An exercise... Richard Ellman in his biography of the famous Dublin-born sponge, points out that Joyce was once asked why he was taking 12 years to write what would become Ulysses. Joyce was living in Europe, hitting up friends, relatives, and would be patrons for money as he masturbated away his talent right in front of the poor, half-wit woman he married. ""Because,"" he answered, ""I can't think of anything else to do."" That about sums up why this book in truth is an eruption of verbal flatulence, a screech in the literary void by a man who was not capable of doing what lesser writers could: compose a plot. There are scenes, passages and conversations from Ulysses that are truly brilliant--but that's all one can say about it. The tragedy is that a man of such talent, who would have secured a place in literary history if he had never written another word after ""The Dead"", felt obliged to labor his way through this doorstop of a novel, when he could have produced something so much better."
0,"text missing which is present in the project gutenberg edition I read a number of reviews pointing out that significant bits of text are missing from this edition, and often the reply is made that the present volume is probably based on the Project Gutenberg edition, and the text is probably missing from the Project Gutenberg edition as well.Well, I looked. In the first section Buck Mulligan chants in a ""happy foolish voice""--I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.My mother's a jew, my father's a bird.With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.So here's to disciples and Calvary.The text is in the P.G. edition, but is missing from the Kindle edition offered here. Amazon should remove this edition, it is a corrupt text falsely advertised as complete."
0,"Such a wretched waste of time Yes, ULYSSES is a mainstay of college literature. Yes, the book is a worthy literary endeavor. But for those who are not brutally devoted to the endless pursuit of mind-numbing genius, ULYSSES is tiresome, tedious, and passe. The appeal of reading the mind wanderings of a pasty, weak pseudo-intellectual grows stale after the first dozen pages. For those enterprising readers such as myself who feel guilty dumping a Joyce work after only a chapter, read on. It gets worse. Confession: the genius mind-maze that is Joyce is sometimes just not worth exploring. One would have better luck escaping the Minotaur than successfully exiting this lingual labyrinth. (Dr. Marcus Smith: I apologize for this heresy against the Modern Epic.)"
0,"The death of literature With _Ulysses_, Joyce truly showed the world what a elitist egotist he was. Unfortunately, too many academics were entranced by occasional flourishes of vivid imagery to see this sham for what it was (and is): An intense act of laziness and hubris by a writer who had trouble telling stories. I think of _Ulysses_ as the precursor to all the self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual garbage that turned so many people off from reading ""great literature"" over the last 60 some odd years. However, the greatest tragedy comes from the fact that Joyce had talent in spades and showed it on occasion, such as with many of his short stories. If he would have tried to make _Ulysses_ even semi-comprehensible, it may indeed have been as great as some make it out to be. In the end, though, it's all just gibberish without a story to drive it."

Description is different then what i receive that all i got to say i got the picture to show it. false advertisement given out cheap piece of crap...look GROSSS
0,"No quality control and minimal support! I ordered a set for a gift. While the chips were fine, the inside of the case was awful. The insert that holds the chips is flimsy and is too small for the case. The insert was cracked in several places, and glued support strips inside the case were exposed and sticky. Amazon was easy about the return. I spoke with a rep and ordered a replacement set on the condition that the set be examined before shipping. I was reassured this would happen. The replacement set arrived and was so bad that the first set looked good by comparison! Again, Amazon was easy about the return but never once offered any suggestion as to what I might buy instead, and offered no 'free shipping' as I had had on my original orders. I think there should be better quality control and I think Amazon should make an effort to ""make-good"" when a good order goes bad."

However the characters were just weird and the parady from Meet the Parents with the cat using the bathroom bordered on just plane discusting.
0,"Worst film I have ever seen, What was Alyson Hannigan thinking??? This has got to be the worst film I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones. Parody's like ""Scary movie"" and ""Not another teen movie"" look like Oscar winning Shakespeare films next to this disaster. Ever since I first saw her on BTVS I have always been a big Alyson Hannigan fan, it is rare to see an actress that can handle both sensitive dramatic scenes AND have a great sense of comic timing, neither of which are evident here, I really would like to see her mix in a few more dramatic roles like she did in ""Beyond the city limits"" (A Very underrated film!!!) but one more horrible disaster like this and the great career boost she got from doing BTVS and the American Pie films will have gone right down the tubes. What was her agent thinking even showing her this project??? Will some director PLEASE save Alyson Hannigan and offer her a great dramatic role to save her career!"
0,"Total waste of time. . . I've alread wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this movie. And beleive me that's time I'd like to have back. It pains me to have to spend anymore time dwelling on this drivel.There are two major problems with this film. First and foremost it's not funny. Maybe I missed an e-mail or a memo or something but I thought comedies were supposed to be funny. And secondly why is this movie "" unrated "". I saw nothing in here that wouldn't have been above a PG-13. My only guess is that without "" unrated "" plastered on the cover it wouldn't have appealed to such a wide audience.The four writers who had nothing to do with this movie have to be some of the smartest people in the world. So if you're eyeing this movie in the rental store, my only advice to you is to slowly back away and move on to the next movie on your list. Do that and you'll be lucky enough to be considered in the same breath as those four writers...some of the smartest people in the world."
0,i want my $20 back. this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen. it was a total waste of money and i want to light the disk on fire just so i can get some enjoyment out of it.
0,"worst. movie. ever. I normally don't write movie reviews because movies are very subjective but in this case, I'll make an exception. I had the misfortune of watching this movie, as I'm a fan of ""dumb comedies"" but this one fails. On every level. Do not waste your time with this one...TRUST ME ON THIS. It is so bad; I don't even know where to begin.Skip it."
0,"Unrated? I'm tired of all these movies claiming to be the Unrated Version and not offering a single thing that wouldn't be included without exception in a PG-13 movie. Add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and I'm pretty ticked-off. Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie, so I won't do it.Tried and true spoof formula is not properly hashed out in cheap attempt to cash-in on quarter-of-a-century craze(Airplane 1980). Top Secret, Hot Shot, Hot Shot Part Deux and Not Another Teen Movie are much examples of this (art) form.Might have given it two stars if they left the Unrated off the box.A lot more of Josh Meyers might have helped."
0,"Zero Stars if I could. It shouldn't even exist... This movie is by far the worst movie ever!!! I'm so pissed that I even watched it. The fact that I sat through this piece of [...] is my ONLY regret in life. Seriously...It's not funny. It's not... damn, it's not anything...I wanted to walk out of the theater so bad, but unfortunately, I'm cheap... so unfortunately I stayed.You're gonna watch it anyway, but don't say I didn't warn you!!!"
0,"not even worth a star the sad thing about me giving this movie a horrible rating is that i love comedies and didn't even expect it to be watchable. it seems like every year there is a new trend or two for movies. the past five or six years, i would bet that at least 1/3 of the theatrical releases have been either sequels, remakes, or spoofs of other movies. the reason ""scary movie"" works (assuming it works because a third sequel is in the making) is because it lampoons supposed scary movies for comedic effect. you know its a bad sign when the movies that DATE MOVIE makes fun of are funnier than the movie itself. also, to all the directors out there: comedy cannot be shoved down the audiences' throat, it has to evolve naturally from the situation."
0,"One of the All-Time Worst Movies Ever Made This movie is so horribly bad that I recommend mature adults rent it just to see how bad it is. My wife and I walked out on this movie after 20 excruciating minutes of stupid, senseless, parodies. At least there was a loose plot to Another Teen Movie and the first three Scary Movies, but not this one. Most of the kids in attendance were teens and preteens, which was not good because of the terribly insensitive scenes like the dating couple beating the heck out of a street bum, or the male date inexplicably faking a female orgasm for no particular reason other than to make you think they might be making fun of When Harry Met Sally.Only trouble is that these gags hit zero on the humor meter. Do not waste your money on this trash other than renting it for sheer morbid curiosity."
0,Wow An Average Rating Of Two Stars.......That Tells You Something! I have to agree with the masses. This movie is a total bore. The repetitive spoofs back to back to back are oh so annoying. My attention drifted away from this garbage and I startd surfing the net.Not only were the jokes bad but they were gross and unpleasant and demeaning. Even Allsion Harrigan as a thin person was not too pleasing to view on the screen. And the scene where the couple roll a drunk like its the thing to do is so mean spirited.Avoid at all costs. The people have properly spoken.
0,"Astoundingly bad Perhaps the worst mainstream, major studio release in the history of American movies. If it was 100 times better it might reach the ""so-bad-it's-funny"" level, but it is far worse than that. Too bad- Alyson Hannigan is hot and the reason I watched this. If she had performed the entire movie nude it still wouldn't be worth watching."
0,"STOP! BACK AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE...(its for your own good) Date Movie? More like a horrible blind-date movie. Instead of buying this movie, go buy all of the movies that this one spoofed. Because this movie is just incredibly dumb...(I was trying to think of a better word for it, but there is none) TRUST ME, if you are a fan of movies at all...don't watch this one, because it will turn you off of others for a while."
0,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!! I never thought in my life i would see a movie so bad. It was pointless. I love all the scary movies but now i know that whenever i see a bad part in a scary movie the 2/6 writers probaly made it up!
0,"Not deserving of two stars I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. I bought this DVD from Wal-Mart's bargain bin and I feel cheated out of $5. I tried to watch it twice, the second time skipping through the especially stupid and unfunny parts, and still could not bring myself to finish it. I've seen just about every parody movie Hollywood has come out with and this one is at the bottom. To quote a great comedy, Date Movie is ""dreadful, embarrassing, terrible, horrifyingly bad, bad, bad..."""
0,"RENT BEFORE YOU BUY I WAS DUMB,,I WENT OUT AND GOT THIS MOVIE BEFORE SEEING IT AND I REALLY WANT MY $12.00 BACK.. STUPID MOVIE,,,SAME DAMN JOKES AGAIN,,IN CLOSING DONT RENT IT DONT BUY IT!"
0,"always laugh at these parody movies...but not this one... The movie was funny the first, oh lets say about maybe the first 20-40 minutes. After that the movie is garbage. The humor and mocking was so dis-tasteful and a little offensive. The cat in the bathroom, ""dead mrs.jones"", the little jokes by the bachellor's parents, the bizarre family relationships, and the mock-sexual references to sex.I was very surprised at myself when i viewed the film. I hardly laughed and didnt laugh when I needed. Like I said I totally love these not another teen movie, scary movie type films...but Date Movie is pure garage. The humor is so awful and the mockery sucks tooBottom line: Horrible movie...never watching it again."
0,What's with all the yowling? Amazing jazz but would be much better without all the yowling (is he okay?). Because yowling seems to be part of the Keith Jarrett jazz experience this was my first and last Keith Jarrett purchase. Check out something by Bill Evans. Make the yowling stop! Please!
0,"Waste of money - Omega 3 oil... Snake oil After taking Thera Tears Omega-3 supplements for 3 months straight along with the Thera Tears eye drops, there has been absolutely no change in my eye dryness or redness. I purchased after reading overwhelmingly positive reviews on multiple sites, but considering that this is nothing more than 1.2g of fat and after noticing no effect myself, I believe this product is just another snake oil/placebo. Don't waste your money.As far as an omega-3 supplement, you can get about the same amount of omega-3 in Now's supplement for half the price and twice the quantity."
0,"Gave me a headache I purchased TheraTears for my eye discomfort from contact lense wear. I was taking 3 pills in the morning, just as directed on the label. I noticed I was getting migraines from taking the pills after the second day or so. I began to get headaches every day. After about the 5th or 6th day, I thought it could be from the TheraTears. I stopped taking them and the next day or two my headaches were gone. I have since discontinued use altogether. Unfortunately, due to the side effects, I wasn't able to use the product very long to assess if it helped with my dry eye. During the short period of time I did use it, I did not see a difference. By the way, this product is not FDA approved."
0,"this is a waste of time!!! the movies on this disc might be good,but from the very poor transfers here(droped audio,picture drop-out and freese pictures ,and all the movies were very very dark almost not watchable)you would never know. skip this mess and look for these movies elsewere!!!"
0,"Trash Infantile depiction of politics, sex, and Panama itself. Insulting screenplay for the viewer. The movie is pure bravado and seems made-up on the fly. No sense of understanding for the people or politics of Panama. Shockingly bad."
0,"Complete letdown I expected a film of at least some dramatic content with Geoffrey Rush alongside Brosnan, but sadly no. This film is awful. The screenplay is atrocious, the directing weak and the character played by Brosnan utterly appalling. My advice, don't waste your cash."
0,"A Keeper? 40 Used DVDs for sale says it all. Aside from the competition of all the used copies now for fire-sale of this bogged-down story, what keeps me from pitching this DVD is to show it as an example of how badly some critics' ""masterpieces"" so completely miss the mark. If you want the ""anti-007"", view the quality of ""The Prisoner"" series. And that ""print-bite"" of this being ""Casablanca without heroes"", that's as much baloney as ""Subway without heroes"" (sandwiches)!"
0,"Wasted effort Without a doubt this is one of the most alienating productions for otherwise good contributors; LeCarre and Brosnan. Having served in ""the trade"" from my twenties, I have encountered more than enough of the reprehensible elements that serve the intelligence field. But ""Tailor"" serves no redeeming message at all. If only to portray the negatives of human nature of some participants the field, the effort was wasted."
0,"Worst movie I've seen in quite a while I can't believe there are reviews giving this movie more than one star! It is a very bad movie. The dialog is muffled and hard to hear in parts, the plot very thin, acting mediocre. Stay away from this movie, or at least rent it and see how bad it is first.Geoffrey Rush does a good job, as good as can be expected from this weak script."
0,"A really stupid flick. I had a back pain, needed to lie down, and decided to look in the local newspaper what was on TV. This movie was listed with a 3-star (out of 4) rating, so I picked it to watch. I guess they would have given 3 stars to anything bashing American and British imperialism with its devilish plans against the proud people of Panama (which, if you don't know, is a Central American country, located where the canal is). There is absolutely nothing in this film to even partially redeem its incredibly silly premise. I first thought that the leading actor was James Woods, but it turned out to be another guy, what put the final nail in the coffin of my opinion. Save yourself the trouble."
0,"The Second Worst Movie Ever Made. Absolutely terrible. What a pity, Mr. Rush is usually so wise in the films he stars in. This is certainly two hours you will never get back. I've been totally robbed."
0,"Shockingly Terrible It's rare to a see a movie where it appears that the entire cast, director AND writer all phoned in their performances. But the Tailor of Panama is such a film. The heavy dialogue drowns itself and its actors, who don't seem to try to tread water. Rush and Brosnan are broad charicatures which might work in another film, but not here. The films jokes and attempts at wit are labored and artificial. What the heck does ""Casablanca without the heroes"" mean? The beauty of Casablanca was that there were no perfect heroes in that movie, everyone had their dark side. Watching this film made me flinch far too many times."
0,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I saw this a few weeks ago with a friend, both of us kept looking at our watches to see how much longer before the torture would end, this movie was SLOW SLOW SLOW, with no real plot. It had some great actors in it too bad they were in such a horrible movie!"
0,"Not worth your time A very deceptive title. Ian Rakoff worked on only a few episodes and his accounts are limited to a few encounters with McGoohan and trivial gossip around the show. The book should've been titled ""Ian Rakoff: A bunch of stuff I did that had nothing to do with the Prisoner."" Maybe 25% of the book is about working on the show, the rest is about his career before and after which makes for poor reading. I didn't even finish it because after the sections about the Prisoner it completely lost my interest. Anything worthwhile about the Prisoner has been written about in other books. Avoid dissapointment."
0,"junk-bad company they do not answer the phone,have called to say glasses cracked after 2 months,they have no phone service to talk to customer service-pissed"
0,"Unwatchable This is one of those films that are made to capitalize on star power, get quick results at the box office, and then disappear into the land of forgotten films.About a half hour into this debacle, which featured whiny children, predictable plotting, and overall lack of likable (or believable) characters, I was forced to just turn it off."
0,"Thoughtless ""The Bachelor"" looks and feels like it was conceived, written, and filmed over a long-weekend, as if it were a rehearsal for a real movie. Watching this is absolutely exhausting, as the script limps along in mind-numbingly obvious directions. Overall the acting is poor, but is otherwise shackled by inane dialogue. I'm ashamed for not having found something better to with with the 90+ minutes this movie stole from me."
0,It was beyond bad plain and simple I was disappointed in this album. no wonder the record label didn't want them to release it.
0,"Thumbs down from a huge Yes fan I got all five solo efforts by the members of Yes in 1975-1976, and the only good thing you can say about this one is that Alan White's effort (Ramshackle) was worse.As the other reviewers note, Steve Howe simply can't sing, and I find his attempts unlistenable. Those of you accustomed to crystal clear vocals from Jon Anderson are in for quite a shock if you get this album.Steve's guitar playing can also be pretentious, and this album lacks other band members to control those impulses. Don't get me wrong - he's a great guitar player. But I prefer good music to continuous displays of virtuosity. He seems to always being trying to say ""Hey, look how good I am"", instead of just trying to make good, coherent, well-structured music.If you like Yes stuff from this period, and want to sample the solo efforts, try Chris Squire's ""Fish Out of Water"" first. You'll be glad you did."
0,"Oh ! the pain. I remember buying this album in anticipation that they would continue where ""Sir Army Suite"" left off. Unfortunately my hopes were dashed and found myself with a new frisbee. I tried listening to it a couple days later hoping that what I heard was a bad dream and that it would be something I could salvage...only ""all good things"" was the only track that had an ounce of playability attached to that word.There so-called come back album or final epitah ""Magentalane"" would only confirm the bloom was off the rose and that Klaatu had nothing more in the tank or anything to offer."
0,"Yikes! With the exception of the first track, I Can't Help It, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile on here. It sounds like they phoned it in on this one. It must have been a contractual obligation record and is actually a painful listen. All you need to play is the track Sell Out, Sell Out and you'll catch on. Sell out, Sell Out ... says it all."
0,"Sorry I bought it. Less than three months after purchase, it's in the shop; an authorized repair center. Picture started ""snapping"" 'till no more picture. They replaced the picture tube and something else. I took it home. Then, it started displaying flickering white lights across the top of the screen and a vertical rectangular discoloration on the left side of the screen. They've been working on it for a week ..."
0,Waste of Money We purchased this product because of its filteration system claiming it would help eliminate hard water stains on our shower doors and walls. It does not work at all and the design of the shower head is ugly. The product was delivered as promissed but without any return address or customer service information.
0,Really aweful movie! Extremely boring with a very weak storyline. This is compounded by the fact that it is very poorly executed. You will start snoring after the first 10 minutes as you realize that there is no character development at all! This movie was so aweful it put me off from seeing other movies for a week...it was that bad! Minus 2 stars!

0,"This is not worth buying... I purchased this product and used it for a couple months... and the click of death happened.I UPS'ed it to the Seagate specified RMA center and received UPS confirmation that someone signed for it at their reps facility.Unfortunately whoever signed for it misplaced it and SEAGATE, is stalling on sending me a replacement drive. The drive was received 11 days ago and they can't get any confirmation from their shipping and receiving dept.I didn't purchase this from amazon, but wish I hadn't purchased it from anyone else either.SEAGATE customer service is the worst, a five year guarantee attracted me to seagate, but it doesn't appear to be worth much."
0,"Fell Asleep. Viewed: 5/05Rate: 25/05: Plainly awful, Airplane II: The Sequel seemed to be a deja-vu of the first movie without anything new to add. The cast was terrible, and even Lloyd Bridges couldn't save the movie. Thinking of the cast, I would like to torture the odious character of Stephen Stucker. On a large scale, the humor was too minuscule at best, trampled by the comparison to the first film. Obviously, there is no story, just a stupid repeat of the same plot used in Airplane!. During the movie, there is a particular scene where Striker narrates his sad story to the lady beside her. She got seasick by the sound of it and proceeded to vomit in a bag. In the end, she got all dried up to the bone. That's exactly how I felt about Airplane II: The Sequel."
0,"More Groans Than Laughs Weak, derivative, and thoroughly unfunny - classic example of a studio cashing in with the old Good Movie Rehash. (...). Although what's funny and what isn't is often a matter of opinion, the element of surprise is what defines humor. We laugh when the unexpected happens. But having seen it all before in the original, nothing - and I mean NOTHING - is funny in Airplane 2. Even the new jokes are variations on a theme. Save your money and watch Airplane! twice."
0,"Airplane 2 Crashes Sequels are often cheap imitations of the original and more often than not, they're usually pretty bad. And ""Airplane 2: The Sequel"" is no exception. The producers and writers of this lackluster endeavor obviously didn't put a lot of thought or effort into making this film. Much of the material is nothing more than a variation of what was in the original ""Airplane!,"" which makes for a rather dull and predictable movie.In ""Airplane 2,"" the writers do try to vary the plot a bit by changing the venue to the 21st century but this does more harm than good. This futuristic setting has some comic aspects but it never really connects with the audience. There are also some futile attempts at political/ethnic/sexual humor but they too fall flat.This is a second-rate movie that never gets off the ground. Don't waste your money on it."
0,"Ouch...Airplane II pains me. No audio commentary to find out what the director was thinking...Airplane II is a travesty. Even if the movie hadn't hastily re-staged almost all the same jokes, excluded the presence of Leslie Nielsen, and generally just sucked...it gets major horror points for having, at least on the VHS copy, a short animation after the credits saying ""Coming Next Year from Paramount Pictures: Airplane III!"" Obviously, someone thought it was going to be a hit...they were wrong. I honestly laughed once at this film, at the classic viewscreen gag performed by William Shatner. What a waste of a lot of people's time."
0,"Strictly for Seattle radicals (all others need not apply). This movie is in black and white (better still, in black and red!) and I don't mean colorwise. It's your standard politically-correct hagiography where good guys ooze beatitude, bad guys reek evil, and if you don't root for the former, you belong with the latter. Like history told this way? If so, then you're gonna love it; if not, at least you'll get some laughs.Mind you, it's not that I object the fake look, dubbed dialogue, hammy overacting or holier-than-thou attitude of everyone concerned in this dated political flick from the sixties; I mean, we were all pretty much ridiculous ourselves back then. But Joan Baez's awful lyrics and worst wailing tear apart the movie's only redeeming asset: Ennio Morricone's beautiful music score. Now that's a true crime!So you've been warned!"
0,"Afflu-Repetitive I had to read this book for summer reading for an AP Gov course. It was a dreadful experience. It was very difficult to force myself to read more than one chapter per sitting because of the book's repetitiveness and dullness. If you actually want to read it, let me save you the time while I summarize it:-Spend more time hiking than working.-Don't get a well paying job, because it will make you miserable and you will undoubtedly go into dept.-take a low paying job, because life will be great. As long as you dont want to buy anything.-Don't buy material goods that make you happy.-Only nature and people make you happy.-Rich people, 90% of the time are littering, stuck-up, scumbags.pack that into 250 pages, and there you go."
0,"A Pointless and meaningless rant I dont know how many times I have read this same book: It rehashes the same old stale arguments heard over and over. The material world is bad, spending is bad, consumption is bad... yap yap yappity yap.Nobody denies that there is something wrong with our economy and culture, and we need to fix that, but the boring and unoriginal rant that Simon offers does nothing for our understanding of the dynamics or nature of consumerism.In the end, this book is nothing but a empty status symbol for the kind of consumerist yuppies that Simon seems to abhor. If you want to show people that you are a concerned pseudo-intellectual, who is all concerned about the future of our planet and society, you buy this book and have it lying around your house.What a load of pretentious crap."

0,"Utterly charmless. Surely this marks the end of Madonna's movie ""career"".To be quite honest it's not entirely her fault.The Next Best Thing is victim to flat direction and an awful script.Is this really the same John Schlesinger who made a film called Midnight Cowboy over thirty years ago?..."
0,"Not Just ""Borderline"" Terrible--It Is Terrible! Thank your ""Lucky Star"" if you miss this one. This movie is so bad I don't know where to start. I don't like Madonna to begin with. It's bad enough that I have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers, but this so-called ""movie"" is quite possibly the worst thing she's unleashed on the public. It's even worse than ""Body of Evidence"" and that's saying something. Maybe I'm prejudiced against Madonna, but I was willing to give this movie a chance...boy, do I regret it. I want my two hours back."
0,"Wished for more.... I had high expectations for this movie and anticipated what I should expect with controversial storyline and the incredible cast. However, it saddens me that the movie lacked realism and honesty. Being a huge Madonna fan, I really was hoping for more, but her performance felt forced and lacked sincerity. I felt most of the performaces individually were outstanding, but with Madonna's ""acting"" the film just didn't work. I do encourage you to see it, explore it, and make your own opinions, but that is mine and I'm staying woth it."
0,"Madonna is an embarrassment... This movie is So very bad on so many different levels, that it is almost beneath any serious movie lover or critic to waste time viewing it. Madonna is at her all time low, and it is a low that few stars ever reach. She is a terribly bad actress and this time out, she made even her die-hard fans cringe in embarassment for her. Simply put, there is no guesswork here...there is not a redeaming quality in this movie. The acting, script, direction, tone, pace, etc., are all at an extremely shoddy level, and DAMN is she getting painful to look at. The only comfort comes in the knowledge of the FACT that this movie was completely shunned by not only critics but by the public as well. Even Madonna's legion of fans couldn't get her out of this one. It bombed on every level."
0,The Next Best Thing The product came quite quickly but unfortunately I'm unable to watch it because it says it's from a different region.
0,"hate this movie... i don't like this movie at all. the plot is just dumb and really bad. the soundtrack is good though. i can't say that madonna is one of the best actress out there but she has a few, good decent films. if you're a fan, just skip this one."
0,"Tragic..... The best that can be said is that this movie kept me watching...I kept waiting for Madonna to 1) figure out where her accent was coming from and 2) let go of the stiff, tense, and downright atrocious acting. Look, I'm not anti-Madonna. In fact, I wanted to like this movie and I still applaud the theory of a ""family movie with a twist"". However, this movie was truly horrid. The acting was so appauling I cringed everytime a laugh was expected. If you are interested in a dumbfounding waste of time, watch ""The Next Best Thing."" Side note: I'm horrified that this was the same director who brought us ""Midnight Cowboy""!!"
0,"The next best thing to tonsilectomy! I just had my tonsils taken out, and that was the most painful experience of my life. Watching this movie was a close second.Madonna has got to be the worst actress to get on a movie screen. Her inability to express any emotion is uncanny. Rupert is no better. Just because someone speaks with an English accent, that doesn't make him a good actor (as some reviewers tend to think). He literally competes with Madonna throughout the entire movie to see who will put the least effort and emotion in a scene. At least Madonna has got her music to fall back on. The plot is so silly that it doesn't even deserve a mention. The dramatic turn, half way through the movie, only makes the actors more uncomfortable, becoming even more unconvincing.Please, Madonna, stick to your music. We love your albums, but your movies stink!"
0,is it a surprise that Madonna ruined a film? Just god awful!!!! Madonna cannot act worth anything!!!! She can barely make decent albums now much less act. You know Rubert only did this as a favor!!! Please!!!!!! Just sad!!!! Not even worth buying if it were 99 cents.

0,"Awful! I had to keep checking the front page to make sure this terrible book was by one of my favorite authors, Diana Palmer. Every character in this novel was one-dimensional, and the book was so dialogue heavy. It never SHOWED me what the characters were feeling, but only what they were saying. I love Diana Palmer but this book was such a dissapointment. I wanted to love it, but I did not care about whether the characters got together or whether they lived or died. This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The only reason I finished it was to be fair to one of my favorite authors. Pass on this one; it's a waste of time. Try Palmer's Lacy."

0,"returned it - preaches deceit; more fluff than substance The author's target audience seems to be salaried employees working unpaid overtime, who are overweight, out of shape, watch too much TV and get too little sleep. His solution to the unpaid overtime is to lie to your employer and coworkers about how much you work at home, use oversized containers to take work home so it looks like more, schedule outside appointments late in the dy so you can just go home, etc. A lot of the book is aimed at helping people take better care of themselves and get their priorities in order, which I applaud. But that isn't what I was looking for in a time management book. I was looking for practical strategies for organizing my work and time, which it is thin on. It has some, and there are some very good ideas in there, but not really much more than a good magazine article."
0,I wan't my money back! There's not much I can say about this movie other than after about 30 minutes it was so painful to watch I had to get up and leave. The senseless action is just unbelievably overdone and predictable. I would rate this movie at zero stars.
0,"Bonus Features Review This movie stinks. Action movies with kids in the story are lame, this one is no exception. I like the Mummy Movies because I like Egypt and the history, but the winks at the camera and the kid are so dated -- it really makes a bomb out of this. Attempts to incorporate every action movie staple really wear thin -- like the pigmy mummies clearly using the Lord of the Rings troll figure -- whatever his name is -- didn't see it -- never will.But there is some true humor here listening to the director commentary and how clueless he is to just how horid this film is. He even ridicules Roger Ebert who had legitimate complaints that these knuckleheads dismiss out of hand -- like they never considered, or finally realized, the movie wasn't good.Some positives: Rachael Weisz is great -- and so is all of the cast -- wasted by bad period directing. ILM effects are great and fun to watch. Some of the extra features are difficult to view, with no ""play all"" option."
0,"wrong product I ordered this for an October birthday. imagine my surprise when we opened the product for viewing and found not ""The Mummy Returns,"" but ""The Mummy"" (which I had also purchased)."
0,CAUTION! Unplayable format HD DVDs are an obsolete technology that WILL NOT play in a Blu-Ray player. Some companies will send you an upgrade to the Blu-Ray version for a fee ($4.95 + $6.95 S&H). DO NOT BUY THIS FORMAT!
0,"Mummy Dearest Such trash the movie studios insult us with. The Cringometer peaked over the red line from the opener and climaxed with some of the worst CG ever. The Rock- more like The Crock! Possibly the worst film in any aspect ratio, preferable on NO SCREEN. Had hoped that Stephen Sommers would be sent into exile for this sub-par Jules Verne abortion, but we've just seen Van Helsing and don't understand why he hasn't suicided."
0,"No Return I received this product in a very timely fashion, however I did not realize that it was only for an HD DVD player, (error on my part). Once I realized I had made this mistake, I contacted the company to exchange for regular DVD or Blue-ray. They told me that they only have HD-DVD's and would not refund. Lesson learned I guess.Not very timely in their response either way nor good customer service.I would not recommend."
0,"1 star for the edition, 3 for the movie Not a very great sequel (like most), but come on, enough already with the double dipping. Granted, we all KNEW this would come out as soon as they announced the third film (I don't count any film starring a has been wrestler as a sequel, sorry, that's just how I roll). Seems we get two new featurettes, and again, as SOON as the third film comes out on DVD, there'll be ANOTHER re-release. Wait for that one, I'm sure it will be ""fantastic."""
0,"bad this is one of the worst movies ever made. I have no clue why it was so popular. First of all, the story is so stupid! Scorpion King? Give me a break! And the special effects look terrible. Woody Woodpecker looks more realistic. If you see this movie, be prepared to see humans interacting with cartoons most of the time. So I guess this movie is just like 'Space Jam.'"
0,"Plays like it was adapted from a video game. If you like non-stop action, care nothing for story or character, and enjoy watching digitized monsters die in a variety of ways, this is the film for you. Otherwise skip it.Brendan Frazier's son has been kidnapped by a powerful, ancient being. In order to save the boy, Frazier must take on countless hoardes of bad guys in a variety of locations. He mowes through them like a superhero from a video game, and despite the non-stop action I found this film almost as dull as watching someone else play Quake for two hours."
0,"AWFUL MOVIE I saw this pathetic movie when it first came out last May and was completely disappointed with it. It's got to be the worst film I've seen this year. The acting is completely lousy as is the script. There is no story at all, the movie is just a bunch of guys running around killing mummies. It's ten times worse than the abysmal first - give THE MUMMY RETURNS a skip."
0,"pretty bad If you loved the first one, this one might be worth a rent from the video store, but i thought that they were both pretty bad."
0,"The worst I've seen in a long time! Never-ending boring unoriginal special effects, that would have obscured the story if there had been one, larded with (not spiced with!) mysticistic egyptianesque mumbo jumbo and mushy sentimentality. The only vaguely interesting scenes are the fights between the bad lady and the good lady. I am glad that I viewed this film as a recording - this allowed me to scrole past (fast view) the uninteresting parts - about two thirds! All this is not the fault of the actors! Its too bad because I liked the first one."
0,"Mummy, I Want To Go Home The Mummy Returns is the worst kind of CGI explosion. Visual noise splashed across the screen without rhyme or reason. An action = entertainment mish mash of woefully inadequate characters, couldn't care less, just plain stupid plotting and special effects turned up to a brash, artless, over-reaching 11.Brendan Fraser struggles valiantly against this background of technical hysteria to give something approximating a likable performance with absolutely no help from the so-called script. And the only suspence in this 'worst of its genre' action horror flick was not knowing whether it would ever end."
0,"This should have been a good movie... but it really wasn't. The returning characters display none of the character traits that made them entertaining in the first movie. The movie simply careens, in a nearly plot free fashion, from one set-piece of computer enhanced combat to another. Now, I like a good, violent action movie as much as the next guy, but this one wasn't good. Watching it reminded me of watching somebody play the ""Mortal Kombat"" type video games of the 90's. If the producers had spent half of what went toward special effects on a better script, this movie could have lived up to its predecessor."
0,The Mummy that Wasn't First of all I was really disappointed in this movie. The first Mummy movie was Excellent. This second movie had no storyline whatsoever. In the first movie The Mummy becomes mortal and Mr. O'C.onnell kills him. Well in the second movie when they dig him up out of the ground and he becomes alive again. How did he get his powers back?I'm not criticizing the acting. I feel that the cast did what they could with a less than adequate script. I feel with a better written script that the Mummy Returns could have been just as good as the first movie.
0,did not save best for last The movie is really sorry.It just doesn't make sense. Plot doesn't flow. It is like it hade been wrote by third graders. However the special effects are good. Rent it first and you will not buy it
0,"If only Hollywood... Could stop making horrible movies such as this, then there'd be a chance for something good to come out more than usual. I can't begin to say how bad it was. The SFX weren't nearly as good as the first, the acting was worse (though I didn't think that'd be possible), and the worst part about the movie was The Rock's head superimposed on a scorpion's body! Ye gods, that was pathetic. I was going into the movie expecting a massive 3-man brawl b/w the Mummy, Fraser, and The Rock. That would've made the movie more enjoyable, but alas, Hollywood couldn't be that interesting. So, if you're looking for an enjoyable action flick, look elsewhere. Go buy ""Predator"" and see what Hollywood used to put out as an action flick. Don't waste your money on this trash."
0,UGGGH! Save your money! This is THE WORST movie sequel I have ever seen. It was so terrible that it inspired me to write my first movie review ever on Amazon. Where's my receipt? You might enjoy this flick if you're less than 10 years old AND in possession of a single digit IQ. It's a huge disappointment following the original Mummy flick. I would like to give it a negative star.
0,The Mummy Returns The Mummy Returns was a huge disappointment to me a huge fan of the great B movie fun of the first one I was absolutly disappointed by this unimaginative typical hollywood sequel formula shlock designed to seperate you from your money with the least amount of effort.Note to hollywood..special effects AND an intelligent story line are the keys to a good screenplay I already have dim hopes for the third installment yet to hit movie theatres.I would recomend to Mummy Fans save your dollar just go watch the first one again it at least frolicked in its own silliness enough to be fun or go watch Indiana Jones Nuff said...
0,"Bad, Terrible, Awful, Horrid..... OK, now I'll admit to sort-of liking the first installment, if for no other reason than it was a reasonably entertaining couple of hours.The sequel, however takes ""suspension of disbelief"" and throws it off a cliff. I would point out some of the plot holes, but I'm still trying to figure out if there ever really was a plot in the first place. Sure the CGI graphics were interesting, but what's the point?There were what, a quarter million or so members of the 'Medjai' in that valley scene just waiting to go up against the Scorpion King's unholy army? Just take a few riders on a ridge over looking a valley, and paint in CGI replicas until you run out of room in the frame.Oh yeah, the DVD is also chock full of self-serving promo junk like stuff for the Scorpion King movie and some hokey-looking Universal Studios attraction. There's a commentary track, but I don't think I could stand to sit through it again.And the upcoming ""Scorpion King"" looks even better....."
0,It stunk This movie isnt even worth rental.Everthing was boring and the mummy was fully regenerated in the first 30 minutes.It wasnt evenworth the one star it got.
0,"Terrible, Terrible Movie! I loved the previous and original 'Mummy' movies, but 'The Mummy Returns' is a complete insult to the audience. The overwhelming, annoying amount of special effects? (Do you remember the cheesy images of the Scorpion King at the end? What was he doing winking at the camera?) The plot that completely forgets that of the previous 'Mummy' movie? There are many actors in this movie with some great potential that spend the whole movie ""acting"" to the special effects? The only thing we are telling the Hollywood studios, by making this movie one of the highest-grossing of the year, is that we want computer special effects to take the place of real acting and story. If we quit wasting our money on terrible movies like this, Hollywood will realize that we are tired of stupid movies like this and start making real films again!I want two hours of my life back!"
0,"SO VERY STUPID & CGI SATURATED!!! First off, did all you people see the same stupid & overblown movie I saw? How can any of you say this film is even entertaining to a bus full of cretins? The computer graphics are so overblown that the movie may as well have been a cartoon! Terrible acting, awful & predictable plot, lousy special effects! Too much! A flying pirate ship? Let's leave the supernatural to the mummies & the realistic to the humans. I really & truly can't understand what anyone would like about this idiotic waste of time. Trust me & ignore every other review!"
0,"Chock full of dumb The Mummy was a dumb movie, but it was a big, fun dumb movie. It managed to weave a bunch of old movie cliches together in a novel way and package it with some fun performances and neat special effects. The Mummy Returns is a dumb movie, but it's not fun, it's just dumb. You can pull something like The Mummy off once, but forget about trying any sequels. Summary: AVOID"
0,"THIS MOVIE [STINKS] Normally I would never write a review, I just don't. But as we have all learned from this past week, terror stirrs us to action. Don't even spend time thinking about spending money on this movie. This movie was almost as bad as Battlefield Earth! Plus, it is in some pre-order competition with the Simpson's Complete 1st season, so don't let the world think that this moivie is even a little good! Help Brendan Fraiser save the world from the Mummy, by not buying it, or even talking about it, or saying the name of the movie out loud!"
0,"Dumb... I just saw this movie last night and It amazes me that The Mummy Returns made as much money as it did in the box office. I believe the theaters should have pad us to see this one. The first Mummy was OK, but not great. I would have given it two stars at the most. But this one only gets one, and that's because I had to put a star up there. If I had a the option it would have got a big fat goose egg. If you plan on buying The Mummy Returns... please return it."
0,"i have seen better 3rd grade plays I thought this was going to be a good movie, WRONG!! I want 2 hours of my life back. The acting was bad, the story was terrible, and the visual effects were even worse."
0,"What a waste of time This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector's Edition. The picture quality is excellent. The DTS soundtrack (yes, this is standard on the R4 DVD unlike the R1)is of reference quality and quite outstanding in dynamic range (especially in the water-wall sequence). Unfortunately, the film was a total waste of time and I think studios should be paying audiences to watch films like this. No where near as good as the original -very formulaic and it felt almost like a cartoon with its over reliance on CGI. I scanned through most of the movie and I feel sorry for everyone who thinks this is worth buying. Even if a free copy was offered I would not accept -because I would never watch it again! And the bonus materials! Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic. I hope I'm not a minority who thinks film substance is still more important than its technical merits. I have invested in home theatre to enjoy films not gunfire, car chases and explosions."
0,"Ugh. Should be Zero Stars The title of the review says it all. This was the worst movie of the year, and one of the few times I ever wished I had walked out of the theater early. Special effects cannot make up for a thin, unbelievable plot. If you are going to set a movie in the real world, nearly a century ago, try and stick with historically accurate props and storylines. A rocket powered blimp just doesn't cut it."
0,"one of the worst movies I have ever seen Please, do not waste your time watching this movie. It is not only a waste of time, but a waste of money too. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I almost left when I watched it at the cinema."
0,"OK as a monocular, not a binocular I could not get these to form a single image of a star or planet because the two tubes are not exactly parallel. I do not know whether that was a quality control issue of the pair I had, or the overall quality specification is so poor that misalignment is typical. Mine went back. A properly aligned pair would be a considerable bargain. If you buy these, buy them from a place with a good return policy. Keep the packaging and invoice."
0,"Help!!! I'm Melting... I bought this as one of my mom's Christmas gifts. Within 2 days the spout cover (not sure if that is the proper name) was melting! The tea kettle was barely used and was not burned or mistreated. Needless to say, I have returned this item for one without a plastic spout cover.Good luck if you actually buy this kettle! I am shocked because OXO usually has great products!"
0,Nasty Metallic Taste We will be looking forward to throwing it out because it gives off a nasty metallic taste after heating the water. We thought it was the tap water but it is indeed the kettle. It makes me pretty upset because my wife drinks a few cups of tea everyday and I dont know what kinds of metals/toxins she is ingesting. Please beware. We had a Zojirushi hot water pot that broke during our move across the country. Please check that out...its the way to go although it costs $100+. They are popular in Japan. We will be getting another one and forget about any kind of kettle from now on.
0,"Poor quality After just a couple months of use on a gas stove, the plastic cap over the pour spout melted. It eventually cracked and fell off. Guess you're supposed to boil your water on a simmer."
0,"Useless I didn't get very far with this cd series so my review will not be very thorough or technical. But what I would have wanted to know before I made my purchase, is that it is a very regional dialect that is spoken in this cd set (Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian dialect). Which is fine if that is what you need, but since my husband is Egyptian, I would like to be able to communicate with him and his family in their own dialect. It was actually pretty comical listening to the first cd with him because he kept saying, ""What? No, we say it this way..."" until we just turned it off.The Egyptian dialect is also more widely recognized throughout the Arab world since Egyptian movies, music, etc. are a big part of Middle Eastern popular culture - so even if you don't have Egyptian family, I think that it would not make sense to learn the spoken Arabic with this dialect - it's difficult enough already!"
0,"The Worst movie of the decade! This movie broke down on numerous occasions into the realm of the unbelievable. Even fantasy and sci-fi movies present ideas and events in a way that the audience can accept as logical for the story. But Mission Impossible contains scenes that are stupid, illogical, unnecessary, and unrealistic.Why would a man who is a genius and the mastermind of the MI Force betray his country and his friends for a mere million dollars when he could easily obtain it legally? Why would this man turn his back on his enemy to kill his friend? How could a man survive a helicopter explosion while traveling at high speed in a tunnel?This is not just a bad movie, it is an insult to all fans of the TV series. Obviously the producers did not care about that. They are only after a quick buck from the name recognition. This is SHAMEFUL!"
0,"Why is this called Mission Impossible? First off I enjoyed the film greatly. Having said that, why make a film and call it Mission Impossible then make it so that it is the exact opposite of the TV series. I could just about accept the plot apart from the apalling travesty of making the baddie Jim Phelps. I would like to know how Paramount could sanction this. It is no wonder Peter Graves wanted nothing to do with it."
0,"Mission Horrible Mission Impossible TV Series had some bad chapters especially duringthe Sixth and Seventh Seasons. However, these Episodes were muchbetter than this Film starring Tom Cruise. This is really a horriblemovie."
0,"I was dissappointed Fans of the TV series should be dissappointed and angry that a good show has gotten into the wrong hands. There is none of the intrigue or ingenuity that was so integral to the series. The movie could have and should have been made under a different title. Why was it necessary to spoil the memory of a great TV series with this nonsense?Without revealing any of the plot, let me just say that the denouement is particularly awful, in that it puts one of the main characters from the TV show in a very negative light. This particular plot element was completely unnecessary and un-called for. No reason to see this at all."
0,"Darn it I ordered three of the Mission Impossible DVD's but from different places. When I tried to watch this dvd, it would not play. It arrived in on time just wasn't able to watch it. Darn it."
0,"Only if You Love Tom Cruise And unfortunately so many people do. Blatant vanity project, the movie's saved only when director Brian DePalma kicks in with his brand of blazing comic book action - which is great, yes, but not enough this time around. Complicated plot? Phooey. Annoying is more like it."
0,"If you're a fan of the television series, skip to MI 2 As an avid fan Bruce Geller's Mission Impossible and its iconic characters and cast, I was aghast at this film and despise it. Anyone who has any affection for Peter Graves and his inimitable portrayal of the heroic Jim Phelps is forewarned.That said, I do like the MI franchise, and find 2, 3, and 4 very entertaining."

0,"Complete Garbage I bought this case expecting from what I heard to not be as good as quality as the XCM but I was very surprised to find out just how bad the quality really was. After ordering this case from Ghost Case I recived the order fairly quick, opened the box and it was a disaster. I recived 2 tops, 2 bezels, and Two DVD spindles, No bottom, so it gets worse, Only one face bezels in the box was the way it should be every other piece in the box had a huge crack on it or busted chips out of it. Just handling one of the tops and seeing how bad it would look by placing on my xbox it went on without that tight of a fit but low and behold another crack :( These cases are garbage and should be avoided like the plauge."

0,"A creepy book I did read this as a child, and though I could not have articulated the unpleasant feeling it gave me--I never liked it, that sad, vaguely arlarmed, looking doll, or the text. As an adult I find it very creepy. The doll who is so lonely and invites in a domineering father figure. THe bottom-up spanking is the illustration frequently complained about but they all invoke lonliness and passivity for me."
0,"Very poor quality! The assertion that ""This is one of the best thumb tips made on the market today"" is simply NOT true.

0,"Awful Recording While I do appreciate the performing skill of American Brass Band, I have to say that the quanlity of CD one of the worst I have ever seen.

0,"Great movie, ruined by touchstone DVD politics.. Touchstone has decided to force you to watch two trailers EVERY SINGLE TIME you insert the disc in your player.

0,Boring! The film has Skinner (Mel Gibson) as a FBI agent sent to a low life hotel to investigate the death of an artist named Izzy (Tim Roth.) Everyone thinks that it was just suicied. But old Skinner knows better and through some searching comes up with his own idea. The film also has Tom-Tom (Jeremy Davies)who's best friend was Izzy as the main suspect. But the film goes and does nothing but burn up two hours. You can even see Mel yawning on screen.It is the one Mel Gibson film we should like to forget. Grade:D-
0,"why isn't there a Zero rating on the scale? This is one of those movies that is ""artistic"" because someone was trying really really really hard to make it that way. People say that art is in the eye of the beholder and I have typically felt that the so-called ""artistic"" movies try so hard to be ""artistic"" that they become... In this case, I am the beholder and I say that this movie is garbage, even for Mel Gibson, who is a wonderful actor. I feel the same way about this movie as I did about Pulp Fiction and Taxi Driver. This movie was... The plot was dumb. The ending was dumb. The characters and acting were ridiculous and .... well I dunno! There are so many bad things I could say about this movie but I don't want to waste anymore of my time. I have other things I could be doing. I just felt the need to print my very very negative review."
0,"not up to standards This book is a low-grade rewrite of dream team, which is a copy of one flew over the cuckoos nest, witch if a rip off of Don Quixote. So we see that everything is a copy of some classic, and as time progresses, the copies get worse, like running Shakespeare through a Xerox machine so the copies get more and more degraded each time.The music isn't even up to par with u2's standasrds. I think that 'passengers' is a better soundtrack like miss Sarajevo which is really a monotonous song, but bono and the lads breath live and power into what would normally be a sub-B side song. But satellite of love isn't up to snuff there are better versions of this song.An odd film to be sure but are crazy people really that virtupus, and do they really see things saner than we do? We should get real with thementally ill abnd increase funding and nor glamorizeing a disease."
0,"The Emperor Has No Clothes Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS-stars. This film is garbage; boring, pretentious, and meaningless. Perhaps other reviews can attach their own fantasies and for them this DOA film may say something. But I found it an irritating waste of time. When a script and the characters within it have no definition, no relevance, and no entertainment value - watching it becomes either self-torture or an exercise in pretending that it serves some arty vision. This is the only time that Mel Gibson let me down. I understand he donated his services to this production and, in that case, he was very much overpaid."
0,"Much Ado About Nothing Despite of having the hand of a true great director at the helm and a multi-star cast (including a top-notch soundtrack by U2), the movie lacks the rhythm and charisma needed to live up to its expectations, with great performances lost in a bad script. It's just a wanna-be art movie, and nothing else."
0,"GIVE ME A BREAK BONO! if your into romanticizing junkies and insanity, you love this pseudo-intellectual pretentious piece of garbage. Even a Bud Cort cameo couldn't save this trash.

0,"A book to be avoided unless you are a sanctimonius humbug I had it as a text book in my high school and hated it.

I know any number of kids who get turned off by Dickens just because they had a tyrannical teacher stuff it down, rather up their brainstems in junior high school. One is asked to read a book in so called dear time, got to read it and follow the party line to get the grades and move on.

But then at times, so is Nabukov. And I've read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, all great, deservedly so. And never painful."
0,The Real Jan was smart for letting the fake Jan take Over!! I saw this and man was this corny beyond belief! Eve Plumb the real Jan turned this down. Smart girl! I love the original classic TV show though which yes can be kind of corny but not as much as that variety show!
0,Ultimate French Was supposed to come with audio CDs but didn't so product is unusable. So they come separate? Would like to purchase the audio for the text.
0,no cd package the book did not come with a cd package at all.i this is a waste of money. i received the book and had a note the rest of the items will be made separately..however it never came.
0,Burnout 5 Is Not Paradise I wish I would have known the following before I wasted $60 on this.Road Rage is still my favorite except Open World = No Instant Restart = Lame. Constantly checking the map sucks. Crash Mode is gone. And there's no split-screen. With the Burnout series the only thing I want to do is Crash Mode and Road Rage with my wife. Thank you EA for making my wife cry!Now go make Burnout 6 fun again...
0,"Wow...HUGE LET DOWN I've been waiting for this game for over a year now. One of the great things about Burnout Revenge was the fact you could crash into other cars and get a power boost...with Paradise if you hit a car from behind going to fast you will crash...why? The race mode is horrible now, you have to keep your eye on the map the whole time because there are so many different routes to take, playing with somebody else isn't nearly as fun because the takedowns aren't nearly as frequent. What a huge let down compared to Revenge."
0,"In-game Advertising I just read an article where EA talks about selling advertising to the Obama campain. There's going to be an ad in the XBox 360 version that reads, ""Obama for President"". I think that is going to far. Revenue from sale of the game should be enough for EA, but no, they have to sell ad space so they can make even more money at our expense. No thanks."
0,"Hate Burnout Paradise I truly wish I would have checked reviews from my friends before trusting the critics on this game. I absolutely hate Burnout Paradise. I loved the games before this one but whoever did this one screwed the pooch. There are no set races you basically just wander aimlessly around a beautifully drawn city with no real goals of any kind. Quite often you'll accidently start a race only to realize too late you did and smash into something and lose.WTF reviewed this game, extremely drunk critics perhaps, that thought driving around and doing absolutely nothing else was the greatest game ever? If you love the Burnout Series just think about how the old games are and then play this game and you may hate is as much as I do. I stupidly bought the game new and paid full price."
0,"Where's the feeling?? I have been an Alabama fan for years. This CD is a huge disappointment. Most songs seem to all have the same rhythm and there is a total absence of dynamics. There is no excitement to the songs and the voices sound tired. The accompaniment is thin, at best. Their adaptation of ""Precious Memories"" is a travesty-dull, dull, dull."
0,"1 star for Amazon.com not Canon I just wanted to report that ""usually ships 24 hours"" is an inaccurate description of reality in mid June. I ordered one and the order page said that expected ship date is 8/22/06, which is 2 months away. So whoever is thinking of ordering this capable, well-reviewed printer just be aware of this."
0,"ill Bury You Tomorrow Caution,Stay away from this film.Do not believe the 4or5 star reviews.They must be on crack.Save your money.I was a fool to believe these reviews.Now im stuck with a $22.00 piece of crap filmmaking.Just run away from this film as fast as you can.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!"
0,"THIS MOVIE IS DISAPPOINTING Stiller and Norton are DEFINITELY NOT at their best. Stiller does a lot of yelling (as does everyone in the show) and Norton seems to be play acting and normally I think these guys are awesome!The story line is weak and unconvincing. There is way too much kissing/sex scenes and there is absolutely NO chemistry between Stiller and ""what's her name"" Really bad. What's her names character is un-believable too. Super high powered flawless business woman. And as if Norton, a priest would go drunk and loud into the synagogue to fight it out with Stiller (who is a Rabi) Stupid.There is one funny moment in this movie and that is when Stiller is out on a date with the aerobics nut and the tug-a-war that ensues afterwards. Hilarious .. But folks -- that is about it.Otherwise it pretty much stinks. 1.5 stars"
0,"comedy supposed to be funny When I hear ""priest and rabbi "" I expect to hear the joke next. Not in tnis film. Couple funny moments in the begining and boring melodrama for the rest. Why are these guys priest and rabbi but not carpenter and musician? And such great actors like Ben Stiller and Ed Norton look just stupid and pathetic, but not funny. Maybe because of Norton's directing. Also, heroine Jenna Elfman play is unbelievably bad, reminds me Macaulay Culkin in his worst. So save your time and money. This movie neither funny nor smart."
0,"Ed Norton - Stick to dramatic acting This film is embarassing. I have liked everything Stiller and Norton have done individually but man this film is bad. Promoted as a comedy, there are very few funny moments other than what you see in the trailer. The rest is a confused badly paced romance that never has any tension. The fact that these guys are supposed to be clergy is laughable. There is no chemistry between Stiller and Elfman and Norton's direction is obviously saved by editors."
0,"irritatingly idiotic Huge fan of both Norton and Stiller, enough so that hearing that either of them is playing the lead in any movie is enough to get me to watch it. Nevertheless, this was the worst work I know of either of them doing . . . and they did it together!While the idea of two guys vying for a former childhood playmate is certainly a viable premise for a romantic comedy, I simply wasn't able to swallow the idea of their being a Catholic priest and Jewish rabbi respectively. Not for a second; and since everything that came after depended on your swallowing this, the film was painful to watch.And overlong. Just when you think it's about time to wrap up things, you check the Display on your DVD and see that there are over 60 minutes left!"
0,"Not funny Hey, like everyone, I saw the cool trailer, the nice commercials on TV so I went to see it in the theater, and I must say that I was really disappointed, except for the first narrating scene which made me smile and a few (3-4) other funny moments like the Rabbi trading cards, this comedy is probably one of the dullest and most pointless movies in recent filmmaking.The plot at first seemed appealing, it talks about a Priest and a Raby who are best friends and in love of a girl they knew from school. And when she moves back to NY, they starts seeing her again...Well, the entire movie is boring with some really endless moments of me and my friends wondering were the plot was going.My advice, don't waist your time or money."
0,Color was really disappointing I ordered the Kiwi color which arrived looking faded and worn out just out of the box. Color doesn't look anything like the photo. Not worth the money.
0,"VERY DISAPPOINTING... Very low-budget program. Two actors who are used over and over again, walking, strolling, reflecting, running, sighing, staring, falling down. Repetitive scenery shots abound. Little useful information, and very few clans. Monotonous narrator. Could have been an informational delight. Instead, a static drone."
0,"Oooooh LOL {gracious me, hahahaha! hahHAHAHA!} You know, I simply do not even recall ever watching this bollywood flick. I can't tell you anything about it other than it shows in my records that I indeed purchased this Salaam Namaste DVD~oh goodness.... just remembered. YES! I had checked it out of the library abt one yr. ago and it was one of the most boring movies I ever set my eyes on, so I fell asleep. The high-pitched singing woke me up, so turned it off. The next day was gathering a bunch of DVDs I'd checked out to return them to the local library, however noticed my cat had knocked this dvd onto the floor & it cracked. This is why I purchased this movie, as a REPLACEMENT for the library as I obligated to. No, this movie really sucked. Good choice for insomniacs however."
0,"The DVD censors at it again. On a special edition, no less! I love this movie. It was one of the first PG-13 flicks to come out, so when I was a kid this was quite exciting. It had some action, some nudity and a snake-monster all rolled into a fun pseudo sci-fi package.Imagine my disgust and horror upon discovering that the DVD of the film had been edited for content! Don't believe me? Compare it to the video or laser version. The comical sex dream scene at the beginning has been altered so that there are no breasts. There are also no children watching. This may not seem all that important to you, but I think that this silent trimming is quite insidious. The film is rated PG-13 after all, which means that parents should be cautious about showing it to younger kids. Why then must it be cut without telling us so on the package?To sum it up, I love the movie, but I hate this version. Hooray for Hollywood."
0,"altered i love this movie, however, for some reason, someone has decided to edit all of the romantic scenes, brief nudity, etc. from the dvd version. if that isn't bad enough, they don't tell you that it has been altered from it's original content. i bought this dvd thinking i was getting the original that i loved only to get a chopped up version. rotten deal!"
0,"This Title Deserved Better No movie censored for content deserves to be called a ""Special Edition"". Recommend this as a possible rental, but not as a buy, even for the current price."
0,"not closed captioned I am a deaf person and I count on the Closed Captioning and subtitles to be able to enjoy a movie.Even though Blow is listed as being Closed Captioned, this copy is not.A waste of my time and money."
0,"Boring... Don't get trapped! This movie is way over rated here at Amazon! Thank God I didn't buy this movie!Everything was terrible:1. Boring story. Yes it is a true story but it doesn't deserve to be written in the first place! Why did they make a movie of it?2. You'll never sympathize or get attached to any character! (lack of emotions).3. Weak dialogue!4. Zero suspense and surprises!The bottom line is don't fall into this trap! It is boring, boring, boring! Even the (Infinifilm Edition) DVD is not worth it!"
0,"Yes it does BLOW! This movie is the worst of it's type to date. More a series of classic rock music videos strung together than anything else, It never pulls you into the world it is trying to create. Donnie Brasco, Goodfellas, even Godfather III. Make this a film I think Johnny Depp should probably try and buy all copies and burn. Get the soundtrack instead. Long and boring non-involving, bad acting and bad wigs make this truly unwatchable."
0,"Dry Treatment of an Uninteresting Plot This movie drags. The plot moves slowly. It is typical of movies with an inverted hero, the treatment of the subject is neither innovative nor exciting.The high point is seeing Pee-Wee Herman, Bobcat Goldthwait, and that 21 Jump Street guy doing a hit of coke, all together, off a bar while girls in bikinis play in the pool.Depp struggles with an amusing, forced, and marginal Boston accent. He seems to have copped it by watching Good Will Hunting about six times. He should have watched it six or eight more times.But, yeah, that triumverate of acting talent doing a line, that's about the high point. The soundtrack is great, and the audio is well produced. But it's not an entertaining movie, or even a well-told story."
0,"worst movie ever seen This is one of the worst movie that I ever seen. The story is boring, doesn't make sense.Casts were ok,cheap production."
0,Review Didn't like the product but my money was happily refunded. Would definitely do business with company again.
0,"Horribly cheap construction quality I was very disappointed with this double boiler. I purchased one, used it twice, and on the second use, the lower handle simply snapped off as I tried to lift it off the counter. On closer inspection, it appears the handle is held on with four tiny rivets. One of the four was rusted, and the handle snapped right off, sending milk all over my kitchen. Even if it hadn't been rusted, you can tell from looking at those rivets that the handle wouldn't have stood up to years of use. It's just a shoddily made double boiler. Look elsewhere, is my advice."
0,"Horrible This double boiler came out of the box just in time for christmas baking. I washed it and got it all ready. It is small but it worked for the purposes and was priced right. After I got done my baking, I washed it and left it to air dry. I checked it to make sure it was clean before I put it away and the cooking pan was filled with rust spots and scratches. I used a teflon baking spoon and silcone spatula while I was cooking, not metal. There is no way I could have done this myself. I now have to buy another one before I can make any recipes calling for a double boiler. It will not be this product!!!"
0,"Rated one star cuz ZERO stars wasn't an option!! What a boring, ridiculous movie. For a film that supposedly starred Treat Williams, he was barely in the movie. Everything about the plot was highly improbable from the plane crash to the weather. The actresses in the movie continued to have perfect makeup and hairdos considering they had survived a plane crash and several days without running water or hair blow dryers. I don't have a clue how the movie turned out as I had to turn it off as my brain was rapidly turning to mush. I hope somebody buys my copy so I can get it out of the house."
0,"rips off scences from other major movies This movie steals scences from the movie cliffhanger (yes their scences) This is a watch before you buy movie. this movie is just not original. sorry, but this movie is copyright crook."
0,"Bad Bad Bad From the start this movie had all the making of a real bomb. The JetStar and DC-9 aircraft scenes were totally bogus. Treat Williams is a pilot, he should have know the flying scenes were bogus. Grizzly bears hibernate in winter. When it is 20 below zero water freezes, but it wasn't frozen in these scenes. Should have been a comdy."
0,"Don't bother. I hated, hated, hated this book. It came highly recommended and I voluntarily (and rather enthusiastically) picked it up. There has never been a main character I have been more disgusted by, a storyline that has been less interesting, and a writing style that has been more obnoxious. I would burn it if it weren't borrowed."
0,"wrong book They sent me the wrong book. It was The Berenstain Bears, Learn About Strangers, instead of The Stranger. It was disappointing!!"
0,"The Only Good Thing About It Is The Title & That Cure Song Being unnaturally obsessed with Kafka, it was assumed by my compadres that I would also like this author, and particularly this book. How wrong they were. The plot makes no sense, the characterization is meager & unconvincing, and the only poetic prose occurs on the last page as our hero (ha!) languishes in prison in the final hours before he is to be executed, wondering what it all means & railing at humanity for treating him like the dog he is."
0,"A horrible translation I have read a previous translation of The Stranger, and was deeply moved. My entire life was changed. The previous translator did Camus justice. Matthew Ward, with this translation of The Stranger, ruined the novel. Ward includes awful cliche and unintelligent description. Unfortunately this is the only translation currently in print in the US. If you are able to, please order from a forgein printer (sometimes printed under the title The Outsider) or consider searching for an out of print copy not translated by Matthew Ward."
0,"Wrong Cover and Translator I purchased this thinking it to be the american translation because the cover was the same. The cover of the book sent to me is very different and it is in fact the british translation not the american. I need the american one for my english class, now I'm stuck with a book I cannot use."
0,"Disappointing I'll keep this short. The book was an awful read save the last ten pages. Everything before that is terribly uninteresting. It is only once he has been sentenced and awaits his end that it becomes something worth flipping through. I have the utmost respect for Albert Camus, but this is dribble."
0,"Confusing and Contradictory Okay, I have read, analyzed, and written an 11- page paper on this book, and I don't have good things to say about it. The critics say it is a brilliant insight on the personality of the absurd, and they believe that Camus is amazing. Please. Camus could not decide what kind of character he wanted Meusault to be. One minute M. didn't care about anything, while the next he was absorbed in Marie's smile. I did not find the book insightful at all, and I honestly feel it is a waste of time to try to find deep meaning in it."
0,"Terrible Existentalistic Trash! Ugh,worst book EVER. Camus'little novel about a nihilistic nobody who sheds no tears over the death of his haggy old mother, does boring things and commits a murder. That's the plot. Gee, I hated this book. Hated it. The main character's behaviour and atheistic beliefs slightly offended me. Don't waste your time on this. Read Ionesco's 'Four Plays' instead. Then again, I might be wrong. After all, a critic's review is based solely upon his or hers personal opinion. It could be a wonderful novel, but not bloody likely. All I know is that at the end I was glad to see the malicous little bugger executed."
0,"This is a book for losers!! I hate this book, though I understand why this book became so popular. We, humans, are not logical machines. I think anyone who have read any of Nietzsche's books would think this book childish and absurd."
0,"Used it as kitty-litter for my cat This book was bad. I read this book when I was in grade 10 and it was very depressing. I probably was not old enought to appreciate the book or the content in it but i was aware of how i felt after reading it and wanted to burn it.The book presents the main character as a person with no heart, no faith and nothing (and no one) to believe in. Sounds like a great book right? Its unfortunate the Albert C does not have any faith in the human race."
0,"The philsophy of old ::yawn:: Here is your plot. The main character doesn't care about anything, about himself the world or other people. And in the end and instead of defending himself (and he is 100% innocent) he chooses to die instead. Wow what a real hero, a true life that we should all imitate. I'll put it in simple words, IT'S STUPID. Don't buy this piece of junk, I had to read it for High School and I think it's garbage. The main character is simply, a moron. Wow how philsophical and interesting. Not to mention it's translated poorly from the French language."
0,"This book has DRM I am afraid that, as much as I love the book, I do not appreciate the limitations put upon this particular edition (Kindle) by way of DRM. How much of a problem DRM is, may vary from user to user, but I would have appreciated it if Amazon had informed me about it in advance of my purchase, as I would then have chosen a different edition (hardcover) where I OWN the book and not merely LEASE it."
0,Confusing and Depresing I had to read this book for a test I am having in Honors English tomorrow. The book made no sense and was all out depressing. I don't know why anybody would want to read it let alone deem it as a classic.
0,"Just Terrible I'm sure that I'm missising something here. Or maybe all of the people who wrote their glowing reviews of this book are missing something, but this was one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing style was like a Junior High School student trying to write their first story. Really more than just a list of sequential events like, I woke up, I went to work, I went to bed. I found after a few pages that I didn't really care what happened to the main character any more than he seemed to care what happened to himself. The only saving grace was that it was such a short book that I was able to read it in about two hours. I know that Camus is well respected and was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature, but based on this book I can't understand or imagine why."
0,"SO overrated This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_, but upon reflection I have decided that I would rather read _Star_ again than read _The Stranger_ again, although I would rather be eaten alive by rabid wolverines than do either. This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it. If I had a time machine, I would pay to have Camus beaten to death on a deserted beach, ultimately preventing this disaster from ever coming into existence."
0,terrible why are we forced to read this GARBAGE in high school? this book was terrible. i really felt like jumping in the book and slappin' that guy around a bit. how could he just act like that? UGH!
0,"Pardon me while I indulge in a moment of shallowness... This book really, really sucks.It doesn't even DESERVE a more in-depth review. UGH."
0,"A story skimmed off the top I was so disappointed after reading this trilogy. The idea of the story itself was what attracted me in the first place. I found the alternating points of view extremely annoying. Because the focus changes from one character to another so quickly, I felt I was only skimming the top of the story. I was also disappointed at how the story ended. She just left the characters hanging at the end of the battle. What happend to their future? I don't recommend this trilogy."
0,"No support for low screen res The interface may be horrific or it may be brilliant; either way, I wouldn't know as that I am running on a laptop with a vertical resolution of 480 dpi. When running at this resolution, the bottom of the dialogue boxes are chopped off - scroll bars, lists of words, et al - instead of resizing as would be expected of even a sub-par user interface.And tech-support's response to my dilemma? Increase your resolution. Sorry, it's a laptop with a fixed resolution; not an option. Guess I'm stuck with Encarta's less-than-inspiring definitions of words."
0,"Who, Which, Where?? There have been more than dozen productions of this piece made available on LP/tape/CD. Which one is this?? If it's the most recent London revival, it's lame. If it's the New York original cast with Elly Stone, it's priceless.What have we here??"
0,"Big Fat Waste of Time! As a big fan of Nicole, I was pretty disgusted with this movie. It was so corny in dialogue and content I had a hard time staying interested, but did because it was so bad, I had to see what happened. And that affair with her student was so dusgusting! The ending was hardly entertaining, and I wanted my $ back at the theatre, which I got!"
0,"Garbage written by a sellout looking for help. Like any sell out of their own, she now cries for protection. She has reaped what she and her kind sowed. 20 years ago, the forwarnings of this where well known, but people like Catherine denounced them as racist bigots, so such. Now, like the sell-out then and now reaping her eternal benifits of such, should now be allowed to stew in a sewer of her own making. Tough Luck kid, maybe next life you won't sell out."
0,Don't Waste Your Money There is nothing of interest in this book. Read the Amazon and Publishers Weekly reviews - they politely explain how little of the content is either new or tells you anything significant about John Lennon. If you buy it you are only providing more money to a very rich talentless person who has parasited the memory of JL for 25 years.
0,"Pure junk...worth no stars Like any bottom-sucker, Yoko continues to feed off the legacy of a deeply troubled, yet brilliant, man. If you have a warm spot in your heart for John Lennon, do not buy this book."
0,"Too Wordy! I was assigned this book through my 10th grade English course. Never before have I been forced to struggle through a book like this one. Conrad's style is adds superfluous information that does absolutely nothing to advance the plot or symbolic significance of the story. The sentences and paragraphs were too large to be dealt with rationally. One of the chapters, which is about 4 and a half pages, is one single paragraph! While the story itself was a good one, Joseph Conrad ruins it with his esoteric and over-descriptive style of novel-writing."
0,"WHY??? I was definitely turned on by all of the hype before the movie. The commercial previews left me with much anticipation....LL, Jada, Vivica Fox, Whoopi!!! I couldn't wait! Then I saw the movie..........What happened? How could they have all of those folks in there and have that movie turn out that way? All I can really say is that I was truly disappointed and I don't know who was at fault. I've seen all of these people in other productions, so I know they can act....was it the director? the producer? Now here's a good question, Toni Braxton WAS in the movie, right? So why in the world would they have Jada up there acting like she was singing?????? I can't go on............."
0,"READ THIS FOR HONESTY I bought this product hoping for a nice poker chip set.It came a week late(i have prime, so this was very sad...)Not only was it late but the carrying case cameBROKEN at EVERY END.The chips are very nice and high quality, so if you don't care about the case, buy it anyways.I simply had to return it because I needed a way to hold and store my chips.Case-0/5 starsChips-5/5 stars"
0,"Disappointed Received the alluminum case that was broken in the corners. At the first look thought it was damaged in shipping. But when I looked for the missing/ broken pieces, I could not find them in the shipping box. Then I realised that they packed a broken poker set. Ridiculuos..... how can they sell a crappy product. Utterly disappointed!!"
0,poor quality set I was very disappointed with the set. It looked like low quality items were selected for the set. The dice looked cheap and were dislodged from the fitting when I opened it. I was unable to fit them back altogether in their slot. It was as if the dice went to another set. I will be looking for a nicer set now.
0,"A waste of time. This book, which tries to act like a full sized book, but is so full of larger print...larger spacing....huge margins...empty pages or nearly empty pages....chapters cut into 10 or 15 pieces, so that they can then insert MORE blank pages....is a big, fat, waste of time. It pretty much reads like a 13 year old girl's diary...sappy, and not in touch with reality. I love a good tear jerker...this one was neither good OR a tear jerker. The only good thing I can say about reading this book is that I got it at the library and did not pay for it....I'd have kicked myself if I had paid for it. My advice? Don't waste your time OR your money. How this ever made the Best Sellers List is beyond me."
0,"I just don't know about this one... My mom passed this book on to me with the words, ""it's a quick read."" And I will give her proper credit, it was a quick read. Unfortunately, the plot is far from subversive and the characters are two dimensional at best. The plot while slightly outlandish (woman loses husband and miscarries, then meets a man that is also dying) could technically happen, but I was not emotionally invested in any of these characters. And sadly, I think that is what this book is missing, characters that the reader knows or indentifies with or some sort of level. When I read, I like to think well I know someone like that or I can picture that character. I didn't do that at all in this book. Patterson seldom gets behind typecasted characters to actually create anyone real. I am honestly not sure what could have saved this book, more exposition or details maybe...not a total write off...but nothing spectacular."
0,"Sugary Harlequin Story If you're a lonely housewife, romantic at heart, and like harlequins, wait for Patterson's book to come out in paperback. It's an easy sugary read, tugging at your heartstrings, but not worth the hardcover price. It also seems to me that Patterson is jumping on a new genre style of writing and ""literally"" losing his fans of Alex Cross. He is trying to capitalize on sappy, romantic, tragic, love stories after his success of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and picking a touristy, profitable town like Lake Geneva, which he may not even have visited for more than a day, just to sell his books and make more money. I admit I like easy, romantics once in a great while, but a classic writer like Patterson should leave the romantic books to R.W.A (Romance Writers of America). And lastly, he should fire his editor and take writing classes again with all his money. This is not literature; it's choppy, full of basic writing errors, and clichÃ©."
0,"Disgusted This book glorifies adultery. Between a married woman and her pastor, no less. She didn't love her husband? Why not divorce him? Why marry him in the first place? Why cheat on him? And, try to justify it to her granddaughter?"
0,"Like getting jabbed by a stick with poo on it. It might make you cry a little, but mostly you're angry that such a thing has been inflicted on you.And it stinks.Really, really bad."
0,"Not Worth Your Time I collect books that feature Wisconsin or are written by a Wisconsin author.This book uses Lake Geneva, Wisconsin as the setting. Nearly every reference to the town and even the way Patterson categories it is wrong.If you don't know the town make up a fictional one rather than try to capitalize on a town's cachet. In the least have someone fact-check the work."
0,"Sam's Letters to Jennifer I knew I should have put the book down and not wasted any more of my time when the author writes that Jennifer puts on her husband's Michigan U jogging suit. There is no Michigan U! There is The University of Michigan (U of M) or Michigan State University (MSU). But I unfortunately kept reading only to subject myself to reading the preposterous scene of when Brendan and Jennifer performing CPR on one Of Jennifer's cats and it lives. So, at that point I put the book down and have no intention of finishing it or purchasing another book by James Patterson."
0,"Disappoionting, Cliche, Predictable, and Poor Materials I'm quite a fan of Patterson's books. To read this kind of poor plot crap was a waste of time! The story was nice if putting in one or two sentenses, but to make a book it ought to have a better research and twists than this! The worst of his books I've read by far!This is a complete junk, lame story. Mind as well read a gossip column from National Enquirer!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"Awful read! You really need to read this kind of trash books once in a while to be able to fully appreciate good books. I picked it up from Borders because they had it on a huge sale. I should have known why nobody would buy it at normal price.A grandma (soon to be great grandma) confessing about an unconvincing extra marital affair to her grand daughter while the grand daughter herself is finding a new love in her life, in a not-so convincing manner! How sick can this get?It is almost like the author just followed a predictable plot line."
0,"Sam's letters to jennnifer Another James Patterson novel. As I reached the end, l realized I have already read the book, several years ago. As Jennifer read her grandmother's storytelling of her romance with a man whom she did marry but no one was told except Jennifer and her Brendan at the end of the story. Patterson tells a good with lots of scenic descriptions and makes the characters seem real"
0,"Sappy, stupid and predictable Boring, sappy, stupid and predictable should have been the title for this review. It says it all. Shallow characters who have ""suffered hardships"" find that ""love conquers all."" The whole story is one big cliche."
0,"confused from page 1 did anyone notice the masculine pronoun ""he"" referring to Sam on the first few pages??? then, when the call from the nursing home came, sam was no longer a ""he"" but a she! i must've re-read the first 5 pages at least 10x, wondering if i was seeing things!!! editting mistakes like that, right out of the gate, are totally bogus. i never bothered reading further!"
0,"Merely a short story I found this ""novel"" to be one of the poorest I have read to date. The characters are not developed, the story line was weak and it lacked imagination. It seemed as if Mr. Patterson stopped by a bar one night and jotted it down on a napkin! It should have been labeled as no more than a short story.I believe the last time I read a book with such a large font, two inch margin on all four sides and less than 200 words per page ---- I was in the third grade!! New chapters were used as a way of extending the story/number of pages --- they were not used as a means to express a new idea or thought.Take my advice -- do not waste your time or money."
0,Why do I bother? I don't know why I bother with James Patterson-all the melodrama and cliches. This book typifies his style. I correctly quessed the ending after reading just 20 pages of this book. It's sappy and silly. I promise not to do this to myself again...
0,"NOT the originals While the sound quality on these disks is excellent, be aware that app. 50% of the tunes are not the originals. Shout Factory should be ashamed, duping customers like this. Rhino Records would never pull such a stunt. Go for the 4-disk Rhino box set (Vol. One) instead. You can find many high quality used versions for sale all over the web, too."
0,"I may be the only one I may be the only one who didnt like this movie, and thats fine with it cause people like different kinds of movies. This movie wasnt my fav because It really wasnt very much like the older verison, that one gave me chills, I didnt see it till after I saw this one but I must say the older one was better.The ending was changed which was a part I didnt really understand, he was alone in the basement(celler) and he turned to a demon he was never bit or anything and yet he turned to one of the zombies. The older one he was shot cause they though he was a zombie, and they never found him in the celler. The older one was a bit smarter then Tony Todd, I am sorry to say but it is, and if your going to make a remake of a movie wouldnt you want to have the same things?..Just try to make it more scarier to people?"
0,"completely silly! Who would give the green light to this?It is a total remake of the 1968 classic. The only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times.Since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it...it pales in comparison to the original. This was really weird to remake this movie.""Dawn of the Dead"" was cool b/c it had a new, fresh spin to the story. This has no scares, no atmosphere, no innovations and no riveting performances.Skip this one"
0,"NO REMAKE NEEDED!!!! this is one of those movies that you have to ask,""why remake a movie that did it right the first time!!! buy the 1968 version and forget this one! skip it!!"
0,"Unwatchable Buy the DVD, the bluray has a terrible transfer. Everything is tinted a deep blue, which makes the entire movie look like it takes place in a room with very dim lighting. You can especially see it when a white moon shows up as dark smurf blue. I have no financial stake in trying to convince anyone this is a great product, I won't even dump my copy on Ebay as its such a poor product. I watched the first half hour, then had to switch to my DVD of this movie because I couldn't see at all what was happening in the movie.Shame on Twilight Time for releasing the worst looking bluray in my collection. Buyer beware. Search out the DVD vs Blu comparison screenshots if you need to they're accurate."
0,Avoid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bad transfer on Blu-ray. The blu-ray transfer is very dark and has a blue tint. Do not waste your money.
0,"really BAD Sony transfer. Saw a friend's copy of this and the difference between the DVD and this bluray is like night and day - pun intended - someone over at Sony when transferring this disc made the entire movie so utterly dark - it renders the disc nearly unwatchable. Granted the film is supposed to take place at night, the new transfer is quite frankly awful."
0,Garbage Never buy this; it worked about 1 week. I will never buy that again. I can't find another similar pump yet.
0,fix formatting in kindle version The equations are incomplete and it becomes very hard to read. Have tried on multiple devices. mathematical formatting is not complete. Very disappointing. Particularly the bras and kets.
0,"Read the SMALL print! Everyone is correct, the movie is a great movie. The problem is in the Amazon descriptions, or lack thereof. This movie has been EDITED! I can't understand why, it was a good wholesome movie in the first place. Amazon should make this information more prominent. We watched the movie and that was how we found out it was edited....what a waste of money. I won't buy anymore movies from Amazon."
0,"I'm rating the dvd only. I had this DVD for a while, and thought I'd come here and comment on how awful the transfer is. I've seen better quality on normal TV without a cable/sat. Connection. The picture is extremely dark in the hospital scene in the beginning. Then there is a lot of grain and I've seen wood with less grain. The grain makes the scene even darker then it should be. Then when he's out of the hospital and on the road, the grain is still very noticeable. I love the movie, but this DVD is just horrible. Sadly there aren't any features on the disc either, so buying the VHS is so much better if you actually like this movie.Transfer 0.5/5Audio 3/5Features 0/5I really hope that the studio that released this film decides to re-release it and do a better job at it. It's not even worth the cheap price."
0,"Returned twice WHEN I RECEIVED MY FIRST ""DOC HOLLYWOOD DVD"" I WAS UNABLE TO HEAR THE MOVIE, THEN I REQUESTED TO HAVE IT REPLACE AND WHEN I GOT IT THE 2ND TIME IT WAS THE EXACLY THE SAME PROBLEM. SO I RETURNED AND REQUESTED MY MONEY BACK, SORRY I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS SELLER."
0,No sure if satisfied yet Wrote to ask if movie was in italian or english...opened to see after no reply..will not play in our DVD so going to try a brand new one my daughter has. If works and is in English we will keep it. If it in Italian or it does not work in their dvd we will be sending it back.Stewart Schofield
0,"Terrible customer service I'll admit, I mistakenly bought this item without reading all the details, which I rarely do. I knew nothing about different codes for different areas (stupid BTW). I paid a sensational amount for shipping thinking I was still getting a decent deal. The product showed up as advertised, albeit I felt the seller was a bit deceitful by not highlighting that this disc is not compatible with US DVD/Bluray players. I attempted to contact the seller to return the item a month ago and haven't received a response. That's bad business and deserves a 1 rating on ethics alone. Don't get duped by this seller. You won't be able to get your money back."
0,"DOES NOT PLAY ON MY REGULAR DVD I am so upset right now! this DVD does not play on my regular DVD player. The cover of the DVD is printed in Italy, the DVD comes and was shipped from Italy. I wanted the English version, as of now, i do not know if the DVD's audio is in English or Italian because it doesn't work AT ALL. Maybe if i was leaving in Italy would work but for some unknown reason this is a bad purchase, i DO NOT RECOMMEND this DVD at all! i was looking forward to get it on the mail for such a long time, i was excited to put this movie on for my toddler boy, since i know Pinocchio sends a positive message to children, and that's why i feel so frustrated that this seller is knowingly putting this out for sale. Amazon needs to make arrangements with sellers like this one! too bad, i know i wont get my $ back and neither my son could watch his movie! DECEPTION !!!"
0,hate it didnt watch this/returned it for a refund/ this was in italian notthe english copy i ordered./ i couldn't watch it / i'll re-order another movie so as i do like this movie
0,will return it Will return it - did not realize it was not in English until Christmas morning when I tried to play it for my son and got message not compatible in this region?
0,"Was Not Happy!!! It turned out to be a Region 2 DVD and would not play on my Blu-ray Player. I had looked at so many before I bought it I must have not looked, or it wasn't posted."
0,Very Dissapointed I purchased this movie for my son(6yrs) and the add stated that the DVD was in excellant shape. We played it once and noticed some sound problems but when went to play this again the sound was horrible. I sent an email to Amazon and received no response. I would like to get a replacement but I do not know how to go about this as I no longer have any information on the person who actually sent it to me.For the most part I have had good luck buying from Amazon but this was a terrible purchase and we are very dissapointed.
0,Pinocchio not the only one who lies! This version of Pinocchio was in Italian! No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version! Now I have to send it back to Italy for a refund...
0,"The Puppet Show This certainly is not one of my favorite Disney movies. I just really didn't get in to the movie I guess but then I never really cared for this Fairy Tale either.The voice actors are good and the scenery, and colors are great. But for some reason this one really just didn't hit home for me."
0,"Just for the Seller... I bought this ""new"" on amazon and when it was delivered I could tell it had been repackaged. Not only that but the plastic circle the holds the dvd into the case was broken for BOTH cds, and the dvd had scratches all over it. I wouldn't even consider this ""like new""Of course, the movie is still a wonderful classic."
0,"NEVER AGAIN!! No where does it state that the DVD will not play in my region. I bought a DVD in America, it should work on my DVD player. The same with the bluray from MovieMars, it won't play because it's not available in my country. What in the world!!?"
0,"NO Slipcover!!! I recently ordered the Pinocchio 2-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition blu-ray/dvd, and it did NOT come with a slip cover, just the basic blu-ray case. All the other Disney blu-ray's I ordered on Amazon came with nice metallic slip covers, EXCEPT this one. I'm almost 100% certain I have seen this item sold in stores with a slip cover. Why not here? I'm considering returning it, as I have not opened it yet."
0,"Disney video The one I bought at a premium price was advertised as being new and sealed. It was from an affiliated store with Amazon.com The seller went by at least 3 different names and one was ?""Milano"". What I rec'd was a pirated piece of junk. When I complained, the crook said he made a mistake and would replace the video but that I should not tell Amazon that I had been sent junk. I never did get the promised video from that crook and so I stopped ordering anything outside the Amazon.com system for a long time and I still do not like the idea of ordering outside the system. I guess the only good thing to come from this is that the pirating crook did not get ahold of my credit card info because he probably would have stollen my identity and run up my bill."
0,"Ooops - who let Goofy in the copy-room? Pinocchio is one of my favorite movies and my children love it as well. What a gift it was to get it on DVD! But upon putting it in the player today, found out that the Prince of Egypt was actually on it. The cover and holder showed Pinocchio. This was a very sad mistake by Buena Vista Home Entertainment."
0,This was a fake Don't believe the item was authentic. Then when I contacted the vendor to return I never got a response. This was a gift and not only was I embarrassed I lost my money. This will make me hesitant to order from another vendor.
0,playability It wasn't clear this could not be played on a VCR in the US. that was in the small print
0,Doesn't Play Bought this as a gift for my niece and won't play in many types of DVD players. Might be burned copy from original?
0,very upset i was very upset with this movie. If you have read this book... dont watch the movie. There are so many different scenes that were switched around from the book. for example in the book johnny tutored a highschool kid not a elementery kid. there was a fire at a graduation party not a drowning. this movie swayed from the book big time!
0,"I've been marketed! According to the dust jacket, if you love a boy, were a boy, or care about boys and the men they become, read this book."" Well gosh, what a coincidence, that includes me! The premise of this book, that we should pay more attention to the emotional lives of boys, isn't exactly a trailblazer, considering the degree to which we've re-evaluated sex roles in recent decades. I can't help thinking that the book was devised to fill an available market niche left open by ""Reviving Ophelia."" The ""product"" is a rambling series of pop psych anecdotes (I sometimes ask, is there any other kind of psych?)and patronizing sermons from the all too male authors. God forbid that my boys should grown up to be as shallow and as self-satisfied as they."
0,"a tired rehash of stuff you've heard before Raising Cain is a tired rehash of child-rearing advice you've heard a million times. It's too bad that parents who are willing to spend moneyand, say, six hours of reading time to learn more about their sons will be so poorly rewarded. My advice: spend that six hours with your boys, doing something fun. Save the money for pizza and ice cream."
0,"Personal Beliefs and Values This book is more for those who believe in a liberal approach to raising their children. While I believed that this book was focusing on treating your child with respect and love...teaching your child in turn to respect and love...it was apparent from reading it that the focus was more on allowing your child to be free from criticism and discipline. I would not suggest this book for anyone who believes in more traditional approaches to raising their children. Also, I do have concern regarding the fact that the authors are the parents of daughters and have written this book by mere observation through a clinical setting."
0,"You are kidding, Right? This is possibly the worst movie I have ever had to sit through, and believe me, I have seen some really horrible movies. The acting is deplorable. The ""special"" effects aren't special. It was a dog. No, that is an insult to that majestic animal. My husband is an Ed Wood fan. Even those movies have a comical appeal to them, whereas this movie is nothing short of inane. If there is a God in heaven, this movie will fade into obscurity, never to be heard from again."
0,"Please I can't believe they made a movie this bad, and worse yet i sat and watched it.In the 1950's this would have made my all time monster list when i was 10 years old.The best part is when they showed Finn Cater bare legs.By the why i found myself rooting for the worms."
0,"Crouching Frenchman - Hidden Plot Apparently in 17th Century France, the laws of gravity were suspended for a time. Everyone leaps around on wires to the point that it is getting silly. The swordfighting is O.K. but, it's heavly influenced by Wu Shu Kung Fu which is understandable given the stunt coreographer for the movie. The acting is wooden with half the cast speaking with a French accent and everyone else speaking Californian.Justin Chambers can't pronounce D'Artagnian, it sound like he is saying ""Darten"" overall, it's not that great a version of the Three Musketeers."
0,"Enough with the Musketeers It's not so much the fact that there have been far too many Musketeer films, as the fact that this movie stinks!!!The acting is totally atrocious!!! SOme of the worst acting I've seen on film. Mena Suvari was so good in American Beauty, but in this dud she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.Whoever that guy is playing D'artanan...he looked a bit like Chris O'Donnell, who did play this character in the three musketeers, he needs to take some acting classes or find a new career. What a bore!While this fellow was nice to look at, he was such a bad actor! He needs to just stick to something easy, like male modeling.This is just another attempt at a swashbuckler film, and it failed miserably. Reminds me of some made for t.v. movie that might show up on the WB network.Watch the Musketeer film with Chris O'Donnell and Kiefer Sutherland. It's a much better made film."
0,"Fluff and Drivel: Perfect waste of film With a ""pert near"" absence of plot, acting, and storyline, Musketeer falls flat on its face. What looks to be a pseudo-copy of the Disney version with Oliver Platt et al, is a hopeless effort with truly awful screenwriting, character development, and fight scenes that imploy so much cloth and whirling that it's impossible to tell who ever gets wounded. I distinctly notice within the first five minutes, however, that the film was quite dead. Please don't make me ever watch a film where most actors have a British accent, but the lead actor mumbles along with an L.A. drawl. Please don't make the mistake of renting this movie: save your money, watch the Disney version instead, which should rent for about a buck at your local video store. You'll thank me for it someday."
0,"ugh! I'm not sure who I am more dissapointed in: the lead actor or the director. Maybe I am too used to watching actors who know how to deliver their lines, but clearly Justin Chambers does not. The utter lack of passion in his delivery gave me the impression that the director wanted him to read his lines as quickly as he could in order to get the movie over with as soon as possible. I don't blame him."
0,I wish there was a zero star.. Unless something comes out in the future to trump this...It's going to go down for me as the worst film of all time. If you have a pet peeve that ruins a movie for you then it is probably in here. I feel symphathy for Tim Roth who must have took this role on a dare.I felt so blindsided when I watched this because I was not expecting the utter trash this film is. The negative review in the Spotlight Review section are right on the money. You couldn't pay me to watch this again. Too bad there isn't a zero star.
0,"How did this happen? If you have any respect for a story, characters or an era...DONT WATCH THIS. The names resemble the characters from a classic story written by Andre Dumas. This is about as far as the similarity goes. This is a big budget disaster. Did they try to keep it real by lighting the night scenes with candles? It provides a washed out set which might have been its redeeming feature.Dumas is turning in his grave."
0,"The worst ever This is absolutely the worst 17th century movie I have ever seen.Words cannot describe how much it revolted me.They could do a better job if they would not try to make a film at all.If halfway through the movie, the actors began to turn into lizards, it would not have surprised me.Controlling the urge to vomit was hard to say the least.As an armourer, reenactor, historian, and having studied the sword arts for more than two decades, I can honestly say that I believe in my own heart that Micky Mouse could have played the lead role and the little pigs could have been the Three Musketeers, which by the way, we do not even get to know the Musketeers in the movie, due to the focus being on superhuman acts of levitation and flight.But if you must watch it, please bear in mind that this movie is pure fantasy when it comes to any historical value and I would not recommend it even to children if you ever want them to learn ""real"" storylines, from ""real"" books, based on ""real"" history."
0,"At least the title was right THE musteteer was about ""A"" musteteer. The whole story was horrible. You don't have to be a fan of the older Musteteer movies to know this was BAD. My advise is to watch the 15 second preview of the movie. This displays the best action that takes place in the entire movie and you can't tell just how bad the acting was. I wish I never wasted my time watching it and I was able to watch it free. Just don't bother with this one."
0,"Why are there soooo many ladders here??? While my wife and I are fans of this genre of film, we were at first appalled, and then disgusted by this poorly executed version. Some people have praised the fight sequences, but I found them lacking for the most part, and laughable in others--esp. the men on ropes on the castle's turret, and in the room full of ladders. Why were there so many ladders there anyway? Most disturbing were the inconsistencies in the plot. Why doesn't the hero make it back to the queen BEFORE the bad guys whom he beats up at the river scene? Why does he ride to Paris rather than to the ferry, where he could have saved Lord Buckingham and foiled the cardinal's plot? Why was this movie even made?? Save your money...we were disappointed even though we only rented it."
0,"Wow, this movie was a sad attempt of entertainment Allright. I fell asleep. I wasn't even tired and I fell asleep. I never fall asleep. That's sad.If I could give this 0 stars I would have. The movie sounds interesting, but it makes little sense and has an ending that could of been guessed five minutes into the movie.Don't watch it. Please. Unless you really need some sleep."
0,"Insult to Dumas and all fans of the genre Is it possible to give **minus** five stars? I feel ashamed at being forced by Amazon.com to offer this debacle even 1 star.This film, from its very beginnings, had me saying aloud what an incredible mistake it was to waste good money on buying it.And an even greater insult was to squander the not inconsiderable talents of Tim Roth and Stephen Rea. I could only shake my head in disbelief as scene after horrid scene unfolded.It felt like some of the worst fan fiction I've ever read. And the finale with the ladders? Obviously the stunt coordinator has spent his entire life living in a box with no air holes, and nothing but Jackie Chan movies to help lighten his otherwise empty hours.Ten thumbs down, way down."
0,"Quite possible the worst movie of all times. 0 stars This movie [stinks]. The story is nothing like the original, the acting is horrific, the swordfighting utterly ridiculous.The scene that sums it all up is when the guards won't chase after a carriage going about 1 mph and everyone escapes.I have no idea how on earth anyone could make a movie so terrible. Extremely torturous to watch. Do not buy it, do not rent it. In fact, just read the book, which is awesome."
0,"Don't buy it !! This is not a movie, but a joke in the dark! The picture is dark, and so dark that sometimes you can't even see the movie !!This is incredible, actors are speaking like if they were reading their text. No emotion, no feeling !What a deception !!"
0,"Insulting, Monsieur! Born and raised in France I will tell you this movie is a supreme insult to Mr. Alexandre Dumas! The original masterpiece has been hacked to bits by a Hollywood mob hooked on fluff and with no regards whatsoever for substance; the characters are shallow, the acting without flavor and the the whole movie altogether pointless. The fighting scenes would have been enjoyable had I not been bored to tears by the senseless rubbish stuffed in between them.I give it one star for the mere reason the Amazon does not offer the possibility of a lower grade. Save your money, buy the book instead!"
0,"What a shame Wow, it is really really bad movie. I would rate it a B-Hong-Kongmartial arts movie (not even just B-movie). I wonder who came up with this ``wonderful'' idea to introduce Chinese fighting into this classical story. Complete failure. Jerking plot (and just motion, even in fighting sequence). Clothing was Ok and Mena Suvari acted well. Actually, many actors were potentially good, BUT the director and ``fighting horeographer'' are amazingly not good."
0,This is not a movie for people who enjoy watching movies! This movie is outrageous and ridiculous and stupid and corny and just not one to watch and enjoy and absorb often. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this mish mash of scenes. It don't make much sense. Very little character development and even less fun...
0,"I can't believe I saw this worthless piece of crap. I just want to say that I feel sorry for the wasted Blockbuster coupon - ""rent one movie get another free"".So I rented ""Heist"",which is another story, and this ""masterpiece"".People from Newark of De United States might enjoy this [junk] but not me.My advice to all who concider to buy or rent this movie, don't do it."
0,"Very Bad Movie This is really one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It does an injustice to the Pulitizer Prize winning novel titled ""The Mambo Kings Play Songs Of Love"" which the movie is based on.If you must see this movie, check it out at a local library, or rent it, but don't spend the money to own this video. You're much better off reading the novel."

He was making us a couple of cocktails put the lid on the shaker and within the first shake it shattered. My set 3 glasses broke the first use. This is the cheapest quality glass I have ever seen. As soon as you unpack the item and handle a glass it feels like it could break in your hand. The glass at the local dollar store is fine china compared to this junk! I believe in the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" but in this case you dont get anywhere close to getting what you pay for. I only paid $8 with free shipping!"
0,MArtini Glasses was very disappointed when the glasses came broken did not even get to enjoy the use of the for the party that they were originally purchased for

0,"UNHAPPY THIS ITEM ARRIVED USELESS. I ASKED THE SALERS TO INDICATE WHAT CAN I DO TO GET IT FIXED, BUT NEVER RECEIVED AN ANSWER."
0,"Not worth a look. Enticed is a disappointing read, less a story of romance than a catalogue of sexual perversions. Kitty jumps from one to the next, beginning with her rape at the hands of the man Henley would have us believe is the hero of the piece, through two marriages to other men that make Patrick a sideline character for a significant portion of the book. By the time she finally finds her way back to Patrick again, the book has gone on too long, and neither of the romantic leads have built up enough charisma to make the ending believable or compelling. Skip it."
0,"I loved all of the Henley books so far except this one! Of the Henley books I've read thus far, this one was by far the worst! I skipped through most of the book, only reading the steamy scences, which weren't as good as they normally are! Save your money!"
0,insipid this book and others like it so insult the intelligence of anyone with half a brain. Read something substantial for a change!
0,"An insult to volleyball and cheaply made. This dvd is a complete joke,and I believe my single purchase paid for the entire production. I am ashamed that I purchased it.

It is so pathetic that I cannot even hand it down to the 12 year-old level coaches. Pay for shipping and you can have my copy!"

It malfunctioned just when I had set the year to 2064 (just to see if my girl would be with me till that time).

0,"Poodle still can't talk I bought this a few days ago as I read a canine training book that said Uranium Ore heightened canine intelligence. Since my family doesn't have a Geiger counter, we figured we'd just be safe if we kept the uranium in an airtight tupperware container with some used pencil lead. I placed the uranium ore under my standard poodle's makeshift bed and left it there for about six months. Lo and behold, our poodle figured out barking at nothing was illogical! Hence, since I saw the success and always wanted to have long, in-depth discussions with my poodle on American policy, I left the ore there for another six months. She now has six arms and still doesn't talk.I would give this .00000000001 star, but that's not possible. What a useless item."
0,"Less than satisfying enlargement I purchased this product to enhance my physique. Specifically, the nethers. I applied it just as it said on the label, ""rub judiciously to area desired to enlarge"". and I waited. And waited. And waited. The best effect I received was a warm glowing that my girlfriend found unnerving, though illuminating. Overall, this product did not work as well as the pumps or pills that I buy from spam emails. Would not buy this product again unless my Geiger counter needs to be calibrated. which it never does. because i don't own one."

Now I am left with one clumsy scientist and 17,897 units of low grade Uranium which are of absolutely no use to anyone.Not only that, the Uranium you see sold above is of low grade and I would not recommend it to anyone looking to blow up a small to medium sized country off the Mediterranean sea.If you want my advice, contact the Russians.Since doing so I have never looked back.

In the future I'll remember not to keep large amounts of fertilizer on hand as well as short pieces of black pipe. I also regret my decision to go for the ZZ Top look.

0,"Nyet! I no recommend this product for mad scientist, evil overlord, enemy's of James Bonds or little girls. Is too expensive and too small for building even small nuclear device much less power global death beam. I have brother Pavel that sell three times as much for half price.

Walk to second freezer, inside is Pavel's office. Cash only."
0,"A very substandard fissile material! I purchased this product because I wanted to make a 5 megaton bomb to impress my neighbors at our fourth of July barbecue. Unfortunately, when all was said and done, I was embarrassed when the yield was less than 500 kt. No birds on fire, no boiling rivers, nothing.I want my money back!"
0,"Looks too much like Skinny & Sweet I think this product should be recalled, specifically because it's packaging looks too much like Skinny & Sweet. I mean there's a big radilogical symbol on the side, but I thought that jut meant it tasted really good. I put some in my bosses coffee, and well... he's dead now. luckily I only confided this fact with my friends in the women's room.After checking the stalls first.I mean, I'm not an idiot. I don';t want word of this getting around or anything,Anyway, recall the stuff, make new packaging and I won't have to go stealing bodies from the morgue.Not that... I... stole a body or anything like that."

0,"Poor addition to cake mix! I thought it would add more Yellow Flavor to myDuncan Hines Classic Yellow Cake Mix. I added six canisters of Uranium Ore but maybe it wasn't enough. My cake just didn't improve. It didn't taste like much but the inside of my mouth & my throat have turned an acidic, bile-y yellow & viscous tendrils of black esophagus have been spewing out when I cough.I would not recommend this product to any stay-at-home moms or 30-minute chefs looking to add a little something to theirSweet 'N Low Yellow Cake MixorWomen's Bean Project Golden Cornbread Mix.As a saffron substitute it certainly saves $$$ but your dinner party guests will know you're a cheapskate! Save yourself from the shame by choosing high-quality spices over cheap imitation Uranium!"

0,"Peanuts? My child has a severe peanut allergy, and I want to know if it is safe to feed Uranium Ore to him. They really should put a label on this stating one way or another. I called the manufacturer, but they acted like I was crazy for even asking. They must not have kids, otherwise they would understand. I mean, even if this Uranium Ore was processed on equipment used to process peanuts, it could be dangerous for my boy. He's very allergic."
0,Not amusing comments. Given the Iranian Islamic Mullahs truly believe God chose them to murder billions of infidels with Uranium 235 warheads in a surreptitious-triggered global thermonuclear war.

0,"I hope this is tongue in cheek Is it hate speech to call someone who teaches falsehood a liar? Should nothing be said about the false claims of Jack T Chick? He supposedly hasn't granted a public interview in approximately 30 years. Is he alive? Is he real? The level of anti-Catholicism is virtually unparalleled. And as a Catholic (by the way, Catholic is Christian, and to be less is to be less than the Body of Christ), I am offended that he makes false statements and hides behind comics. Despite this, I will pray for those behind these falsehoods. God bless."
0,"Who writes these things??? DREK... absolute, pure drek. Offensive in its man-only-thinks-of-sex premise, even more offensive that Mel Gibson, like so many aging actors, is paired with ever-younger female costars. That studios still pay actors like Gibson to make such drek, and that those studios pay screenwriters to write it, and that people go see the movie in the theater and then buy the dvd, is as great a mystery to me as any."
0,Don't bother This is the worst film I have seen for at least 3 years I was so bored at the end of this I thought I had died and gone to hell. my advice is if you want a bonfire buy this film otherwise avoid it
0,"Interesting Idea, Terrible Movie As a romantic comedy addict, I expected a lot from this movie. The original idea was very interesting and could have made an excellent comedy about women and emotions. MISTAKE! this is one of the worst film i ever seen in my whole life and without a doubt the most predictable and boring piece of garbage. The acting is terrible: Mel Gibson is Over-The-Top and horrendous.You can't believe him one second. I was ashamed for him. Then, we got Helen Hunt (the worst actress in history): To say that this girl can't act is an understatement. She made me sick. One-dimensional and absolutly horrible performance. The only good points are the solid performance from Marisa Tomei and the enjoyable Bette midler guest appearence but they just can't save the film. Avoid this movie at all cost: It's just too BAD. A waste of time, efforts and movie reels. 2 hours of my life i'll never get back. If you enjoy romantic comedies, check out ""Chocolat"" or ""You've Got Mail""."
0,"What I want...an end to mel gibson movies! Yes I am reviewing another Mel Gibson movie,and yes,it's not worth the silicon it's recorded on!Every once in a while a film will come out that really will make you want to hunt down the cast,crew and backers,and inflict pain on them.This is such a film!Truely awful from beginning to end,if you really must buy this,don't watch it,just use it as a coaster or something,for your own sanity!"
0,"This movie deserves to burn! Mel Gibson gets hit by lightning three times and doesn't die? What type of script is this? Who's supposed to believe this tripe? Helen Hunt looks like an overgrown owl and any man in Mel Gibson's place would use his powers for the good of sex instead of throwing it all away. Also, when he says he's gay, I truly believed him because JUST LOOK AT HIM!!!! This was obviously a chick flick and every man's nightmare and I'd watch out because I know who the writers are. BEWARE."
0,"Dumb movie -- don't waste your money I'm not even going to spend much time writing this review because this movie is not worth my time. But anyway, the movie had a few cute moments, but other than that, neither my fiance or I enjoyed watching it. We didn't even finish it before deciding to sell it off. Definately not recommended. If you really feel the urge to watch it, rent it first."
0,"A total flop I'm sorry but I think Mel Gibson is much too old for the character of this role. I thought the story line relied too much on crude humour, obviously Hollywood doesn't think that people can enjoy a movie without a little naughty stuff in their movies.Well their wrong, I didn't enjoy this movie because of the objectionable and disgusting crude humour,etc.. I thought that it was silly, and shallow, and definately this is not Mel Gibson's best. He's much too old for this part.I don't know what Hollywood wants women to think they want, but I know that I was sorry to have wasted my time watching it. His character is manipulative, and disgusting. I don't understand how the director, could glamourize this. It has too many offensive things for me to like it.I think that the romance storyline was ridiculous and silly."
0,"Highly Inept In Mel Gibson's latest vehicle--and I use the term in all seriousness; his films are like beautiful, empty cars that he somehow manages to power with his charisma--he plays a womanizing cad with a lot of charm and no manners. He's involved in a highly implausible freak accident involving a lightning bolt and a hair dryer which allows him to hear what women are thinking. He learns to be more accepting and eventually develops something akin to human empathy. And, heaven help us, there is even a cameo by Bette Midler. It's a great date movie; it's light and fluffy, like popcorn or cotton, and there's some funny business with Mel as he does funny woman things, like waxing his legs and trying on pantyhose. The soundtrack is so uninspired that, frankly, it finds itself right at home."
0,"Great premise, bad movie What a great premise. Mel Gibson, a male chauvanist of the worst order, can hear what women think. The previews looked like the movie was going to be a great comedy. If you're looking for comedy, though, just watch the previews. All of the funny parts are in the previews, and the movie turns into a romantic drama about Mel Gibson's character reforming and seeking better relationships with his daughter and boss. This had all the makings of a truly fun comedy, and there are great actors in this movie, but it just doesn't satisfy. Perhaps if I had known going in that this movie was a drama, I would have appreciated it more, but this is a movie in search of a theme. Also, Mel Gibson's character is hard to like as he first is a chauvanist, then uses his gift to manipulate people, then finally reforms. By the time he's turned things around, it's too late to turn this movie around. Definately one that I would skip."

0,"This is an OK book for beginners If you are just beginning Tai Chi this book is a start but by all means not the authority on the art.

Even if you are a new student to tai chi Dr. Lam's book will help you more than this one."
0,"An excersise in being wrong Wow, this book makes you realise how unbelievably wrong a single author can be, and pass it off as fact. She presents the argument that heavy metal and roleplaying games will cause teenagers to kill themselves, kill others, and worship the devil.It's sad that a person can believe this, and devote so much time to this. I'm sure when Gary Gygax sat down in 1970 to write Dungeons and Dragons he said 'right, my ultimate goal here is to make teenagers worship satan Hahahahaha (maniacle laughter no doubt followed). Or Judas Priest said 'yes, if we make our fans kill themselves then we'll have none left! ha! Brilliant!'An interesting book, but only when viewed from afar, as a study in how deluded some people can really be."

0,"Scholastic version of the Count incomplete I purchased the Scholastic version of the book so I could finish reading the novel (I had it on my PDA and lost my PDA). After finishing reading the Scholastic printing of the book, I found the book seemed to leave many unanswered questions, so I thought I would re-read it. It was then that I discovered that the scholastic publication is missing some of the chapters (though the included chapters are sequentially numbered). In fact, a person reading the Scholastic printing would never understand the most important act which caused Edmond Dantes so much grief, as that most important chapter, ""the Conspiracy"" is one of the omitted chapters. Thus, this printing is, in my humble opinion, worthless.The book, as a whole, is great, and I recommend the book (in its complete form) to anyone."
0,"Missing content This review applies only to the 2002 Modern Library Classics edition of the book. I read the book partly online but mostly as this paperback. At the very end there is, in this paperback edition, a very important section missing. It's in chapter 113. Right after Dantes takes his leave of Mercedes, and before he meets Morrel in the cemetery, the online version includes what must be several pages where Dantes returns to the Chateau d'If. Inexplicably, the whole episode is missing in this paperback edition."

0,"A shameless abridgment Although billed by Amazon as unabridged, this is a butchering of the story that would make Dumas roll in his grave. The back of the box says ""abridged,"" yet somehow the store insists it is unabridged, simply because it is longer than other audio additions. Make no mistake, many rich and wonderful (not to mention important) are left off with no attempt to apologize, repent, or make amends. A proper COUNT audio book should be in the neighborhood of 30 CDs...this one is only 14, although this information is concealed in the product description. The picture shown is not accurate. BEWARE!"

0,"Count of Monte Cristo Story has good twists, but there are too many French places and people which makes the audio confusing."
0,"Terrible, terrible edition A wonderful classic story butchered by a senseless editor who removed major portions of the story without letting the reader know. The description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text (the edition includes a brief introduction of the author, critical analysis and explanatory notes). I'd rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript. The problem isn't that the editor decided to abridge the book, but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader.The removed portions are integral to the storyline and I was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed, so uncharacteristic of Alexandre Dumas. Then I found out it's not the author's fault.Book is highly recommended, but I would also recommend that readers invest in more trustworthy versions out there."
0,"Half the story omitted I thought this story was very difficult to follow. I even restarted it after reading the first hundred or so pages.

0,"Waste of Money and Time As part of my job, I read this book because I had heard so much about it. It was not only a disappointment, but also a waste of my time. I could not believe the drivel it contained. The writing is so poor that the text is actually difficult to follow, and, to top it all off, the concepts are so trite, hackneyed and saccharine that following the text yields nothing. No insight, no information, no enhanced awareness. Nothing. I am at a loss to explain the good word of mouth this paperback has received except to suggest that perhaps the people who order it for prisoners don't actually read it before ordering. It's a waste of paper, newsprint and glue."

When I got home that night, I put the DVD in my TV/DVD player. Sure enough it would not play in that machine either.As of this writing, this issue has not yet been resolved with Amazon.

I don't care about that fact either because nothing could convince me to put up with this boring old movie again. I had the misfortune of seeing this some time ago, and even more misfortune of seeing the stage show. Boring. I'd rather pull my eyelashes out one by one or something equally as torturous. I know I'm not going to convince many people about this mundane tired movie, but I feel better having said my peice and maybe I could save someone from the pain."
0,"Puke Okay, now you know my alltime unfavorite 80's movie. Sure its set in the early 60's - then tell me why the hell are they dancing to 80's songs? I almost shelved Patrick Swayze after this one but he was redeemed by Roadhouse. This movie could only be enjoyed by a pack of prepublescent girls at a slumber party who are wondering what its like to lose their virginity. And am I the only one who thinks that Jennifer Gray is a total dog? Sure she's got a hot body but that face! UGGG! That is the one thing that kept this movie from scorring with the guys in my opinion. Skip it, rent roadhouse instead. Better plot, better chicks!"
0,"Voice synthesis is very bad Don't buy this if you are looking for a translator that pronounces (speaks) words. It sounds like early 1980's computer voice synthesizers and the result is very poor. Enligh is my first language, and it is difficult for me to understand the English words it speaks. Some of the words, I could only understand because I was looking at the written word on the screen at the same time I was listening to the spoken word. When I tried the French words on several native French-speaking people, it was difficult for them as well. It does written translations OK. The user interface is a little bit awkward and not very intuitive."

0,Don't Bother A horrible movie which makes Dull & ordinary (with the exception of sex) one of the most complex writers/individuals that Ireland has produced.

I know this is back in the day so I'll give her that much. But she was a little TOO hairy for me. This movie is really graphic and it shows a lot of uh..stuff. Ewan was so cute in it! But I think there could have been a better Nora picked. This is definitlely an erotic film like the actual overview says. the reason why i gave this film only 1 star is because it was so hard to follow! i figured out in the middle that time was jumping VERY fast. they should have dates as subtitles. It jumped ahead quickly, it was too graphic, and overall..it's probably one of the worst films i have ever seen. sorry ewan!!!"
0,Beverly Hillbillies Very rough video. Looks like it was taped off of someone's TV...Very noisy and blurry. Love the episodes but not the quality...
0,"Don't be Deceived! Don't be fooled, this is a cheap public domain copy of Beverly Hillbillies episodes; hence they do not contain the original music (Ballad of Jed Clampett, etc). and the sound and picture quality are abyssmal, not to mention the product stamp on every frame of the disc. If you're a true affectionado of the Hillbillies try ""The Ultimate Collection"" discs as they were produced by the estate of Paul Henning the creator of the show. Only the first two volumes have been released and hopefully a company will release genuine episodes as opposed to these public domain ripoffs."
0,"Why? I found this book useless. Very short, confusing explanations of product types and color guides. Everything is illustrated with pictures of her own products--do you want to pay money for an advertisement?The Bobbi Brown or Kevyn Aucoin books would be more helpful than this if you want to learn how to apply makeup."
0,"How many incomplete sentences can you fit on one page? I really wanted to like this, but it's one of the worst-written fantasies I've ever read. Apparently little money is expended on editing at Luna Books. The writing is so awkward, repetitive and dull that much of it simply wastes space and insults the reader's intelligence. It's about what I'd expect a talented eighth-grader to write. There are multiple incomplete sentences on every page, the descriptions are lackluster and cliched and the dialogue is dull and staccato.It's so disappointing that this book wasn't edited adequately. If the author had been challenged to tighten the writing, it could have been turned into something readable, if not actually good. I'm astonished at the positive promotional comments on the jacket and wonder if the reviewers actually read the book."
0,"Veto and disregard This book is not worth the time to read or even browse. Stick with his ""Five Day Course in Thinking"" if you can find a copy or his ""Thinking Course."""
0,"If you see it, just throw it straight into the trash I picked this book up at the airport to kill time. The book was so bad that I threw it in the trashcan to make sure no one else had a chance to waste their time. Kyla's irrational attachment to her dead husband was increadibly annoying. She needed counseling and it doesn't look like she had any. Someone else mentioned to skip this book and go to another. I will read another Sandra Brown book, but if the next one is as silly as this one, then I'll be through with her."

0,The French Connection This DVD was very disappointing because it was not the full movie. It ended in America with the Frenchman returning home. The movie was much longer with Popeye Doyle going to to Paris to follow up on the case. The most exciting and important conclusion of the film was deleted.
0,"TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE. C'mon people! How fun is it to watch a racist, lewd, borrish, and dumb person beating up people for no f-----g reason. As little as possible. All the film does is show two unorthadox sleep in car all night, hold up bars just because there are black people there, and reapeatedly getting the same food as 24 minutes ago. And a point that should go out, THERE IS NO CAR CHASE! Just someone chasing a train! I will end by saying that this trashy film deserved no oscars! BYE!"
0,Disappointed Buyer The picture of the product with Gene Hackman on the cover of the jewel case IS NOT what I received. All I got was the movie in a blank jewel case. Isn't that false advertising?

Too many cliches to count: every sister is an exec, every brother is a player.Some garbage has to be watched to see how bad it can be. I'm in the wrong business. Would have been made for tv except for all the swearing.Now to read the five-star hallucinations."

0,"A hugh bore..the trailer gives all the good stuff away Wow what a dissapointment a big disapointment. I found the trailer funny and could not wait to see this movie and was the movie ever boring and bad. The trailer gives away all the funny moments and all the funny moments are when Uma Thurman's charactors tells Strepp's charactor about there sex life. The film is very boring and has hardley no funny moments, it also drags on and on and on. The acting is not that good also. Overall dont waste your time watching this waste of a movie."
0,"Take home message: Religious Bigots are Oh-so-cool! Lovely acting and dear moments in a movie that could have been really good.But, the movie ended; and, I almost felt sick to my stomach. The two main characters have let their souls die on the ancient, twin altars of religious bigotry and social conformity.Meryl Streep's part - the antiseptic, re-worked Archie Bunker of the 21st century - is bigoted, hypocritical and professionally corrupt. And, the movie basically laughs and gives it all a pass.Surely, the 60's were fought in vain."
0,"OMG, it's bad. Wow. A movie about age difference in a relationships. Wow. What an earth-shattering idea! wow. Add a punch of bored actor and clumsy acting and have one wow of a mediocre movie. I don't know what bothers me more: Hollywood's inability to make great movies, or the publics' insatiable appetite for movies that they will watch craps and don't know it."
0,"Very Long And BORING Movie....Waste of Film ! I rented this moving thinking it would be good.....Big Mistake! Save yourself some time and money and don't rent or buy this movie...waste of good film and I really like Meryl Streep. There is no exciting plot, no great acting just very dull. If you do happen to rent the movie anyway just be prepared."
0,"Prime Hallo, unfortunately this kind of DVD does not work within European countries, therefore I am going to return it back to Amazon. But the movie itself is great, funny and Meryl Streep is incredibly great!"
0,"I wanted to like this but I have to be honest... I was a bit excited to see this but I was dissapointed.I bet you know already the plot of this movie but I would like to point out the things that are ""wrong"" about this movie:1.The lovers in the movie does'nt have the chemistry2.Cheesy lines, specially the scene when theyre breaking up while having sex...EEEEWWWWW!3.Uma's character was'nt developed.4.Streep's (good performance,as usual)character does'nt really help the movie as a whole.These days,its really hard to find a good romantic movie and this one in particular is not good.Watch at your own risk."
0,"an embarrassment How did I get hoodwinked into wasting 2 hours in renting this movie?? Meryl Streep seems to wearing a mask, doing a SNL parodie of herself ""acting"" Jewish. Every bad cliche in the book, along with silly dialog, and shallow charactors are stuffed into this unfunny bore of a movie."
0,"Worthy reading for any student of political philosophy, but ultimately dangerous to our republic. To correct the previous reviewer - Wilson did not think separation of power didn't exist, but that in reality they shouldn't exist. If you favor a historicist government unlimited in size and scope, and reject the universal truths espoused in the Declaration of Independence, then this is your book and Wilson is your man."

0,"Absolute Drivel I read this book for the literary circle at my high school, and we unanimously declared it the worst thing we had ever read. It had no structure, so it appeared to be a mixed-up jumble of thoughts. Since there was no structure, the author strays off the ""topic"" (supposedly bullfights) quite frequently into little discussions about ""venereal diseases"", which he claims are relevant as they are a cause of death to many bullfighters.Perhaps if you have a Spanish background or love bullfighting, or possibly Ernest Hemmingway, it is possible you could relate to this book and enjoy it.Please note that our lit. circle read other books by Ernest Hemmingway. Those books, including ""A Farewell to Arms"", ""The Old Man and the Sea"", and ""The Sun Also Rises"", are definitely worth the read. Just because you liked other books by the same author, please do not assume you will like this one. I LOVED ""The Old Man and the Sea"" and ""The Sun Also Rises"", but I couldn't stand this book."
0,"Great Writer. Horrific, outdated material. Hemmingway may be a classic - but that doesn't mean this book has any place in literary history.How can an intelligent person defend a blood sport between man and animal that is unfair from the get-go? In bullfighting, the bull, whether he wins the fight or not, will always be sent to a gruesome death. It is a hideous, cruel sport that every Spaniard and supporter, should be ashamed of. Why it has not been outlawed, is a disgrace.Burn this book!"
0,Too drawn out! I usually enjoy reading this author however that was not the case in this particular title. The plot was too drawn out.
0,"Good cookbook but a poor kindle version This is a very good cookbook, but only in traditional format. Unfortunately it does not have an indexed table of contents rendering the Kindle version nearly useless as a reference book which is ultimately what a cookbook is. Cookbook authors who publish ebooks please do your homework and think of what you are doing."
0,"As a sequel, it fails. Guys, just listen. This isn't a great movie. If you've only seen it, and not the original, it's okay. But to point everyone in the correct direction...buy the original. It's so great and funny. It should have been titled ""Val and Earl"" (The two main characters) rather than ""Tremors."" The character interaction is what made that movie. This film doesn't have, or master, nearly any of those qualities. The original is a barrel of laughs."
0,"In denial that there is this/any sequel to Tremors. This was oneof the lamest sequels to any given movie. First off, you could tell they wrote around availability. Examples, primary ones. Weren't able to bring back Kevin Bacon but, keep Fred Ward in it, even though the bubby thing between the two was seamless in Tremors. Can't bring Reba back in, well, let's say they were divorsed. Please, that notion is an easy out to admit she wasn't coming back to it.The newer evovled ""tremors"" was a stupid idea. Tremors was called Tremors for a reason, the monsters shook the ground, that registered on the richter scale. These stupid chicken designed ones in 2 takes away fro mthe whole point and the name. Now if it had evolved and was huge, Godzilla size, then it could still be called Tremors, and add to it.My love for the first movie can't be ruined but, 2 doesn't even exist as far as I'm conscerned, it wasn't Tremors and 2 never needed to be made.Honestly, if I could select 0 stars, I would."
0,Nothing Like DragonHeart I was so looking forward to this movie. What a disappointment. It was NOTHING like the first movie. I guess a good (great)act is hard to follow. If your looking for a good fantasy movie I recommend the origional Dragonheart or Excalubur. If your thinking about purchasing this movie PLEASE rent it first to see if you like it.
0,"Draco would not approve of this. I am not someone who hates sequals. I absolutly hate the first Dragonheart it is a masterpiece. Great effects, great story, sad ending. It is a five star movie all the way. This is horible. First of all the effects are awful. Many dragon films form the 1960s looked better. Drake looks like a cartoon. The plot is worse then the effects. It involves finding a dragon egg. Where did he come from. The first said draco was the last one. Now this movie said he wasn't. THIS RUINS THE FIRST MOVIE. The acting stinks. I can't believe anyone over the age of 5 would like this... Watch the first Dragonheart."
0,"PIECE OF CRAP! Dragonheart did not need a sequel. The story was told. It is over. The first movie peaked therfore, end of franchise. This has bad acting, terrible C.G.I., and stupid story. Stick with the first."
0,"Either flawed production, or deliberate omission of a key detail Let me put this in perspective:The description nowhere TELLS YOU that you have to connect the mini-plug into the adapter for the 1/4"" -- duh. Of course it doesn't say so. That's obvious.EQUALLY obvious to anyone who works with audio is that the main plug is (or should be) a 1/8"" (3.5mm). The description nowhere TELLS YOU that, granted. But just as with understanding that one connects the mini into the 1/4, that is a *completely* reasonable inference.So when I found that the small plug would not fit into my laptop, and that only with force would it go into my Zoom H2 (which now I'm afraid I may have damaged), I saw it, in effect, as de facto deception. Either the slightly-longer mini-plug is flawed in production, OR it's a nonstandard size, fitting ONLY their 1/4"" unit.As long as you're OK with always using that bulky 1/4"" thing, and evidently NOT being able to use it with your computer or portable recorder, don't worry."
0,"What a let down Having only read the two Dune novels and having loved the first one so much, I couldn't believe how dull this one was. What a huge let down. Do I even dare reading the third, fourth and fifth. No; I sleep well enough as it is."
0,"great book, outrageous kindle price. Shame on Penguin ""Dune"" is a wonderful book. I read it years ago and loved Herbert's talent for world-building. ""Fear is the mindkiller..."" is a mantra that I've used over and over.So why am I giving it a 1 star rating? Like other Kindle readers, I'm appalled at the price, which is actually higher than the price for the hardback. As other reviewers have pointed out, the Kindle edition is also highly flawed--formatting and spelling errors abound. Is it so much to ask the publisher to get it right? Also, this is a 40 year old book. Penguin has no business charging this much for a non-print edition of a book that is readily available in multiple editions used and is ten bucks new in paper."
0,Cost of the Kindle version Why is the kindle version more expensive than a hard copy? I thought it was suppose to go the other way! Don't get it. Could someone explain this phenomenon.
0,"A Great Book, Horrible Price I had this book. I've read it twice. When I moved I left it so that the next person would be able to read it and enjoy it, knowing that I would probably get a digital version the next time I wanted to read it. $14.99 for a 40 year old book that can be picked up in innumerable used book stores? That much for a book that is 40 years old? There's no reason for it to be more expensive than a print version. Now, instead of buying it, I'm going to pass. I'm also going to pass on all the sequels I might have bought after it, and all because Penguin doesn't understand the digital world yet. Readers shouldn't have to pay for a publisher's mistake. Set a reasonable price for this book, and I'd happily purchase it!"
0,The Kindle edition is still chock full o' errors. The re-listed Kindle edition of this book still contains a ridiculous number of typographical errors.
0,"Nice but slow reading Lot's of hype, good substance/plot/characters, but no suspense. There is a lot to slog through and this book is slow reading. I did have to put it down after ^150 pages because after a while, I just wasn't interested. Who are these Dune cultists? Living in a big city, I can't say I've met one."
0,unbelievably boring and tedious description without end A friend told me that DUNE was different from the run of the mill sci-fi endless spillage of adverbs and adjectives. After three chapters of the most tedious and unnecessary descriptions of the tiniest details I decided he didn't know what he was talking about. Boring junk with a capital J!
0,Buy this book at amazon.co.uk for HALF PRICE!!! Ridiculous pricing here.Get an Amazon.co.uk account. Change your Kindle Registration to the address of a friend in the UK. Buy the SF Masterworks Kindle edition of Dune for 4.99 ($8.00 US)This is what I would do if I didn't still have a paperback version of this book handy. Does it violate any policies? I don't know. But I certainly felt violated when I saw Penguin's price for this e-book.
0,Great book: worst narrator! This is indeed one of the best science fiction works produced however I must give it a miserable review on account of the almost criminal selection of narrators! There are a great many text to speech programs available which offer a more enjoyable listening experience! I am no stranger to audiobooks but this one is almost unbearable to listen to on account of the deplorable narration!
0,"Not the best I had great expectations when I picked this book up from the store last month. This book is okay, but certainly not ""the best"" as many claim. My suspicion is that people on this review site tend to be a small but determined bunch of supporters. The biggest flaw is that the book is boring. It truly is difficult to keep turning the page. After being 1/2-way through, I just had to toss the book out. If you scroll through the ""real"" reviews, you will find this is a common lament. Also, it doesn't have the same emotional life as ""The Lord of the Rings"" and does not draw one in. Dune is certainly not in the same league as Tolkien's works."
0,"Good idea, but bad book... I know this is considered a classic and one of the supreme Sci-Fi novels of all time and that's why I was excited to read it. However, I found it boring and disjointed. Some of the characters are interesting and the story has it's moments but it's not worth the time it takes to read it. The story spends too much time building up to events which are either unsatisfying or over the top. The main character was extremely shallow and what personality he did have was still obscure. I didn't care for him at all. He seemed to be as bored as I was with the things going on around him. The book had good concepts but they were never really put to good use. I really wanted this book to be good. I was on it's side to begin with, but now I can see why Herbert had such a hard time finding someone to publish it."
0,"Boring Clearly, you have to be a fan of the robot genre to remotely even come close to liking this book. The first chapter gets off to a very slow start, the storyline becomes boring rapidly, and after a while, the book is unreadable. I would imagine that those disappointed with this highly overrated book would turn to other science fiction. Lord of the Rings puts this book to shame. J.R.R. Tolkien makes this author look unimaginative to say the least. If you want real science fiction, start with The Hobbit and go onto the LORD OF THE RINGS. Put this book where it belongs: in the GARBAGE bin."
0,"Ghastly A hatful of people with unreadable alien names, and a central character called Paul. Vastly advanced civilisations who retain a totally monarchic society. Never have so many dreadful Science Fiction cliches been brought together in one book. Ghastly."
0,"Kindle version I have climbed out of bed to write this for you, because I can take it no longer. Whoever made the kindle version should be fired. The book itself is great. However, random missing spaces, extra spaces, italics that begin or end when they shouldn't, mis-spellings of stillsuit as ""stulsuit""....Please, buy another version. This is an embarrassment to e-publishing....and you'd think with it being on the computer it'd be easier to check for errors. Guess not.Look elsewhere for your ebook copy of Dune."
0,"This may be the biggest disappointment for a sequal... ever! Dune has about seven interweaving plot layers. This book has maybe one, which is life and death. At just 278 pages this book is by far the shortest book in the six book series. If you've loved Dune, you'll probably hate the sequal so don't read it."
0,Dune I own the Kindle Fire. Why should I have to pay more for an e-book then one thats actually printed and shipped and stored? Thats crazy.
0,Formatting makes these ebook unreadable. I purchased this Kindle book because I wanted to re-read the book but also wanted to have the electronic version. Huge mistake. The book is horribly formatted and is almost impossible to read. One font size results in words being dropped from the end of a page and the next size down results in last passage of a page also appearing on the next page. It appears that there is not a way to get the text to appear correctly. Fifteen pages into the book and I have given up trying to read this great work in the format.
0,"Ridiculous Price $15 for a poorly formatted, un-proofread eBook version of a book that is more than 40 years old is a travesty. Love my Kindle, love the book, but stuff like this makes me seriously question the long term chances for eBooks; you can pick up a gently used version of this book for <$1 from various places for crying out loud."
0,"Kindle version is awful I'll start by saying that I LOVE the book Dune and have for years. The story itself is magnificent and should get five stars. The only reason I'm only giving my review one star is because the Kindle version is so full of typos and formatting errors. I can't believe I paid so much (more than a print book!) for a Kindle version that is so appallingly badly edited.If this were a physical book, it would never have made it to the printer. I can't imagine that this version was even proofread. It's distracting and disruptive, and ruins the flow of the story to be correcting things in my head as I read.Awful. DO NOT buy the Kindle version. Save your money and buy a $2 used paperback copy."
0,"Wow. Is this book boring or what? I got through the first 100 pages with great difficulty (it was hard to keep from falling asleep) but it didn't get any better. So, I bagged it. I have no idea what the hype was about. I have enjoyed sci-fi and fantasy books before, so that wasn't the problem. It just happens to be a very tedious book."
0,"okay Hype aside, it's a good, albeit not spectacular story. I was actually a little put off by the grammar and boring parts. I did have to force myself to accept ""spice"" et al. Is it anti-semitic? It could be interpreted as such, but I'm not sure. It's worth a look, but don't buy into the hype. And I hope the don't make another movie. Uhhh..."
0,"twaddle-dee-twaddle-dum Prose that would make a Dungeons and Dragon novel blush, boring , narcassistic characters, plot goes nowhere...1 star"
0,"...sorry... After reading Ender's Game...well, to put it lightly, lets just say I got cabin fever.I admit--I have NOT finished the book yet (a side effect of cabin fever), and I WAS intrigued at first. 200 pages in...and nothing remotely exciting was happening. I argue with myself, wondering if I should finish it or not. Will something utterly fascinating grab my attention just 20 pages on? Or will the rest of the l o n g book be a total drab?Dune certainly has a good plot idea, I'm just not sure that Frank Herbert has the gift of grabbing a reader's attention.Please R&R!"
0,"The Mountain has birthed a mouse Time after time I've seen Dune acclaimed as one of the masterpieces of SF. It consistently tops the charts when readers are asked for the best SF novels. Being a SF reader myself it was almost heretic not to have read it before, so after more than 30 years I decided to give it a try. Awfull, is the word that best describes my experience. I couldn't find any sense of wonder or anything else for that matter that justified such high praises. To compare it to The Lord of the Rings is to commit a crime. This novel is a fraud, a naked king pretending to be wearing the finest clothes. Forget the hype, this is a complete waste of time."
0,"Dune, the book: 5 stars. Dune, the kindle version: 1 star Dune is an amazing journey, and anyone who has thought of reading definitely should. However, I want to know why the Kindle version is more expensive than any other version?! I'm starting to get REALLY sick of all this. Well, Amazon got their $189 out of the person who bought the Kindle itself for me, but they sure won't get any more money from me for books that are outrageously overpriced."
0,"There is no way I am paying this much for this Kindle book Will not pay $17 for a Kindle of a 46 year old book! This is just a trumped marketing scheme. What really blows is the $8 version is available at the Amazon UK. Seems the publishers have blocked this sensible version from the US Amazon site. Finally to top it all off, numerous typographical errors throughout the eBook. More evidence of a poor attempt to simply pull some more money from saps."
0,"An over-rated piece of fiction I had several close friends recommend Dune to me, all proclaiming how amazing it was as a novel, only to hear later that not one of them finished it for the same reason: ""it was kinda boring."" If you're asking yourself why someone would praise and recommend a book that they find to be boring then you're just as mystified as I am. I have yet to meet anyone who has read Dune who liked it or ever finished it.The books major problem is it has too many minor characters and very poor character development. The lead character, Paul, is a good example, as he has no personality, or any interesting qualities whatsoever. Sadly, all the characters are this way.I did finish this book, after forcing myself to keep reading for six months, and I will say that it eventually does get more interesting, but only in the last two chapters."

0,"Battery and screen suck I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, because I wanted a simple phone that is light, tri-band, and with a decent battery (up to 2 weeks standby time nowadays is quite reasonable).The battery in standby didn't last more than 3 days, and if you turn off the phone to recharge the battery, the screen becomes totally dark: it is then impossible to know whether the phone is recharging, or whether it became fully charged, which I've never seen with the other Nokia phones!If these characterstics are generic, then get rid of it A.S.A.P.!!!!"
0,"Absolutely terrible! I have read Jane Austen over and over for years, and really enjoyed the ""modern"" movies Sense & Sensibility, Emma, and Pride and Prejudice (with Keira Knightley, although I think they treated it more like a dramatization of a Charlotte Bronte novel than Jane Austen). I was really looking forward to this movie, but when I was finished watching, I felt incredibly disappointed. Tom Lefroy was portrayed as a jerk, who seemed to have no real appreciation of Jane as a person, but just saw her as a woman to conquer. Jane was an idiot and I never could figure out what she was supposed to see in the guy. The sexual innuendos were thoroughly 2007, and stuck out like a sore thumb. I tried the movie again a second time, and couldn't get through it. Next time I'll stick to my previous rule - rent before you buy! A total waste."
0,"Total rubbish I understand liberties must be taken when making a nonfiction movie. However, this piece of dreck has as much truth about Austen as ""Shakespeare in Love"" has about the Bard. It doesn't even try to show what Austen's world was really like. To those folks who first met Austen via this film, I strongly encourage you to learn about the real Jane. There are several Web sites about her and her works."
0,"Not a Good Investment The purchase of this film was a complete waste of my money. The plot was trite, disappointing, stale and sophomoric, and the acting was no better. Otherwise...."
0,"Disturbing I'm a true Jane Austen fan....have read every book many times over and watched every BBC production. I was completely put off by the sight of Anne Hathaway's thong underwear showing through her cotton nightgown in the candlelight. Am I only one disturbed by this? For me, this was like reading a huge type-o in a pretty good book. It stopped me dead, I couldn't enjoy the rest of the movie and it's the only thing about the film that stands out in my mind. I'm pretty sure that's what editing is for...but maybe this movie's editors didn't know that it was extremely unlikely that ladies wore thongs in Jane Austen's day."
0,"Horribly Disappointing First, I will be upfront: I didn't get very far in this movie. There are few movies that I will stop in the middle (in fact, I can't think of any), but this was one of them. I was very disappointed with this movie. It makes fun of Jane Austen. It criticizes everything about Jane Austen's time period. Everything in the movie seemed designed to mock, from the pond filled with scum in front of a great house to an unpolished mirror that could hardly be looked in to show the sisters reflections. It blatantly attacks Christianity ( or being faithful to your spouse before you ever even meet them, by keeping your wedding vows). As strange as it sounds, I felt like I was being attacked through the movie screen. It is a movie full of lies. Particularly the lie that by being faithful to your spouse you are missing out. The opposite is true. Hopefully, the movie improved by the end, but I couldn't make it that far to find out."
0,Do Not Waste Money On The Blu-ray version I like this movie and my daughter loves it. We were excited about the blu-ray. We have had the DVD version for years. The blu-ray arrived and if you already have the DVD.....please save your money. The image and sound on the blu-ray are no improvement. In fact in many places the image is inferior....far inferior. The DVD has bright colors and has an fun feel to it. The remastered BR is dark and the colors are dead. The image blurs considerably on fast moving scenes. It is the worst BR I have seen since Wedding Singer.

0,"Is King Druse? I have been reading this book and am annoyed that I can put it down and, when I pick it up again, cannot begin to tell whether I've already read the section I begin reading. It is flat, with no real suspense, unless you count the question, ""Was this really written by Stephen King?"" as part of the book. It is pretty far off in its depiction of the paranormal, beginning with the ants. If this is King's work, he has succeeded at seeming to be a complete amateur. If it is Druse's, why is it a work of fiction? Sorry, this book makes me ""harrumph."" I wish I'd bought something else."
0,"What has happened to Stephen King? Journals is nothing more than a teaser for the upcoming ABC movie. The story is not original and, frankly, much of it doesn't even make sense.

After the Ellen Rimbauer dud and now this one, I wonder if King has lost his spark. His writings have, in the past, always had an edge that made you wonder what was going on in his head. This book and the Ellen Rimbauer Diary are like warmed up leftovers. My advice is don't waste your time on this book."
0,"Hated It!!! I loved the television series, so I thought I'd check out the book.Huge Mistake!!This novel went absolutely no where. I hated it!Come to think of it, the book doesnt even deserve the time its taken me to reveiw it."
0,"a sorry bit of commercialism I should have known better after the ""Rose Red"" trash. This is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series. Not only that , I've noticed Stephen King's current writing is concerned more with his pet peeves, political leanings, and predjudices than with telling a good story. Maybe it is time for King to retire."
0,"Well, I read it, not sure why. This book has an incredibly slow start. I wasn't until about page 92 that the story actually got a bit interesting. This book made me remember why I don't read Stephen King. It was just out of despiration, and the fact that I didn't have another book with me that I actually continued to read it. If I hadn't spent $20 on it, I would have gotten rid of it."
0,"Stolen work of Lars Von Trier Else then creating personalities to cover his complexes (first Bachman and now Eleanor), Mr King has now bacame a thief. Go wach the original Tv-series art by Lars Von Trier, The Kingdom. A 8 part post-modern TV series about unnatural events that take place in a hospital.There must be a border between the art of writing/literature and marketing tricks. And Mr.King has just crossed it.Stephen is now writing under the name Eleanor. After Richard he has developed another personality. Just a marketing trick. AND HE HAS STOLEN LARS VON TRIER's work, THE KINGDOM (or did he bought it?)anyway it is all a fraud. Shame on you mr king.You may trick the ""culture-free"" illiterate americans. But not everyone."
0,very disappointing! As an avid reader of the horror genre and scary books I was disturbed that this was neither. One could not even classify this as a mystery or suspense. It is really utter nonsense. It is insulting for the author to claim that he is a trained investigator in any sense. Yet he willingly without any investigation gets involved in blood rituals and seances. Any expert in the occult has a healthy respect for the preternatural. Nany Drew would have done a better job on any one of the highly suspicious and improbable cases. This book should be geared for the 6 to 9 year old age group and unless they are camping alone in a cemetary at midnight on a full moon they would not belive or be scard. This book was a waste of money.
0,"This really doesnt deserve a 1 but it wont go lower First off its in Japanese and didn't come with subtitles (at least for kindle) . Girls get attacked by evil ninjas women who spend most of the movie beating and choking the heroes. The action scenes are right out of 1970's scripted wrestling. Our heroins get punched, knocked to the ground, and kicked repeatedly (usually in the head) then get up and run away. I suppose that getting punched and kicked for 5-10 minutes and not being hurt is easily possible since it hardly ever looked like any of the blows made contact.This movie has no nudity, sexuality, or real plot. Its just a long poor mock combatfest that actually makes the Power Rangers look realistic by comparison. Save the precious minutes of your life by NEVER watching this!"

0,"Five disks, no music! I was very intrigued to see that RCA was offering a CD changer that played MP3. While RCA received mediocre reviews online, and I couldn't find any reviews of this player in specific, I took a gamble and ordered one. It arrived (single boxed), I unpacked it, and immediately noticed its light (cheap?) plastic construction. Plugged it in, popped in some disks, and ... nothing! It recognized the disks, but would not play them. Amazon graciously agreed to send me another unit second day, and paid for the the original's return. The second unit arrived, this time it would not even accept disks. I was wary of RCA's reputation when I ordered this unit. This experience has buried it for good. A definite do not buy."
0,"Happy Anniversary Americans! It was just a little over 13 months ago that Americans flushed this john and voted for leadership. We didn't buy into the lies or false claims of heroism perpetrated by Kerry and writers like Brinkley who rely on their subject for facts (fat chance)The economy is moving well. Iraq is moving well regardless what Kerry says. This Kerry promotional piece did not work and thank God for that.HAPPY ANNIVERSARY AMERICANS! WE ALL ""FLUSHED THE JOHNS IN 2004!"""
0,Kerry's X-Mas '68 in Cambodia LIE has him spending New Years '06 in Boston This book along with the book by George Butler is so full of crap and hype about Kerry that it makes me laugh. Should be listed as fiction and would make for a great novel. Everybody who really knows Kerry laughs whenever mention of this book is brought up.Those who knew Kerry back in 1966-67 knew how much he wanted to prevent being drafted and stay out of the service. Kerry claiming to be a war hero is like Michael Moore claiming to be an athlete. Give me a break!
0,"Not True The truth has finally come out. The Swift Boat Veterans finally got it in the open.John Kerry is a liar, nothing more, nothing less"
0,"This book is being revised - so the FACTS can be adjusted I started reading it, but couldn't continue when I found out that the ""Facts"" were being altered by Kerry and Brinkley. In the meantime, read ""Unfit for Command"". It gives several excerpts from this book anyway. Then maybe when the new version of the NON fiction comes out I'll read it. Although, I thought NON fiction was truth and truth couldn't be changed... I guess it depends on whose truth it is. I gave it one star because it's pretty thick and I think it probably took a lot of imagination to come up with that much."
0,"This book is bull! I never got past the chapters of Kerry's experiences on the USS GRIDLEY. Since I served with him the entire year, I can assure readers that it is filled with exaggeration and fantasy. Kerry makes himself out to be Master and Commander when he was just a goofy boot Ensign. There are a number of things that are just plain not true and lots of exaggeration. It is not a serious work but clearly a piece of campaign fluff.Don't waste your money unless you are Democratic to the core and need some fluff to get you excited!"
0,"Half-Tour of Duty I find it absoultely incredible that someone believes everything that is shoved down their throats. Just because some historian says that he is a hero does not mean that he is. I tried to read this book, but couldn't finish, it was that bad. Kerry's ""purple hearts"" shouldn't even count. I mean, look at the guy. He has NO visible injuries and he got out of vietnam with Purple Hearts???All three purple hearts were signed on the SAME DAY. John Kerry does not deserve to even be called a veteran, much less a hero."
0,"Waiting for the rewrites. After I bought this book and started reading it, I discovered that the author, Douglas Brinkley is doing a rewrite because some of the information provided by Senator Kerry has turned out to be false and misleading. And as I understand it, the changes are still coming. Perhaps Mr. Brinkley should have done himself a favor, and written this book in pencil. It's a lot easier to clean up the errors that way. Are they going to issue free addendums of the new rewrites, or am I going to have to buy a whole new book to get the newest version of Kerry's story?"
0,"Tour of Duty This book is nothing but lies and propaganda. Nothing in this book is factual. Nothing but ""Walter Mitty""."
0,"Total Puff Piece If you believe the picture painted in this book about Kerry, I have a bridge for sale. This is a complete puff piece that no self respecting ""Historian"" would publish. Read ""Unfit for Command"" to get the truth!"
0,"Kerry's Tour Of Duty For North Vietnam The book has no information on Kerry's ""tour of duty"" with Hanoi Jane and her gang.Nothing on how North Vietnam's leader dredit Kerry & Fonda for saving North Vietnam from defeat. Nothing on how Kerry's family financial benefitted from the normalization of relations with his old comrades in the ""new"" Vietnam."
0,"Garbage Nothing but a whitewash of Kerry's military ""career"" intended as propaganda for support of Kerry's political ambitions.John Kerry's entire life is a lie. This book takes from Kerry's writings the false biography of his Vietnam experiences. It is nothing but a rehash of Kerry's false reports and self-glorifying phony biography."
0,"Tour of Duty, offensive and Insensitive As a Viet Nam war veteran, I am completely offended by Tour of Duty, which is nothing more than an attempt to exploit a bloody conflict (in which over 35,000 Americans died) to promote the Kerry candidacy for the presidency. This is not only inappropriate but is egregiously insensitve to both the survivors of that war and the families of its victims! It is exactly the kind of opportunism one has come to associate with that portion of the political spectrum. John Kerry should apologize and immediately arrange for the removal of Tour of Duty from the shelves!!!"
0,"Half the Story I'm afraid that Dr. Brinkley missed the boat on this one. By ignoring the Swift Boat Vets, he lost any claim to having written an honest biography of Kerry's war months. Kerry's unwillingness to release his military file would have signaled to any true biographer that there is more to this story than just Kerry's diary."
0,"Campaign for Kerry To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry's life is extremely naive. From the very beginning it reads like a cheesy campaign commercial. If you like Kerry and his politics, you'll like the book, conversely if you don't, you won't."
0,"Waste of time and money This book is a waste of valuable paper. Kerry is a freaking traitor and only received commendations because he had friends in high places. To anyone who supports him and his too obvious lies, you're dumber than I thought Americans ever would be. Kerry didn't do any more than any of our boys are doing out there every day, and less than most. I hated the book and have no respect for the man behind it."
0,"A Manufactured, Not Earned, Record John Kerry gamed the awards and decs system--I saw it happen during my 12-month (not 4-month) tour of duty in Viet Nam. His book is nothing more than a compilation of fabrications to bolster his image for the 2004 election. John Kerry is a hero? Not! I believe the 250 men of the Swift Boats Veterans for Truth, not Kerry and his bought-off handful."

0,"Kerry Kamera Hound Risking Lives Taking cheap political photo Op's while endangering my fellow Naval comrads' lives was reckless and insensitive. Kerry was booted out of VN due to his reckless disregard for the well being of his comrads' lives. After being kicked out of VN Kerry had a Hissy Fit Snit and Said ""I will show them"", and proceeded to betray his comrads all over again. We do not need a man with 57 positions on every issue that squeals like a stuck pig when the real truth comes out via Swiftees and/or Givem Hell Zell! When $62 million in ""drug money"" was spent to castigeate Bush it was OK; however the boonie is now on the other foot. The boonie now needs to be lodged in Kerry's appropriate 57 part anatomy."

0,"Into the disposal Hmmmm. ""Conservatives"" continue to applaud this sort of rhetoric as ""facts."" I continue to get e-mail from those who resent my characterization of Ann Coulter as a psychopath (""if she really believes the stuff she says, she's not taking her meds"") as if Coulter is a logician, not a hyperemotional media figure with a ""JD"" after her name.Well, this isn't quite as volatile as Coulter, but it's no more ""fact"" oriented. And it isn't ""conservative"" but reactionary statist.Why is it that, while the ""right"" seems to be powerful now, I see their days as numbered? I think it's because they take this stuff seriously. They'll become a product of nostalgia soon just like some from the '60s who're now making car payments, retiring, and living in Florida."

0,"Lord of the Flies... I did not enjoy this book, I thought it was over-rated and quite boring. It has no real plot and the story line is a never-ending piece of text which in all honesty, bored me to tears!.I find that William Golding should not have had as much success as he did because the Symbolism is never ending and I can not handle how he symbolises even a scar or a pair of glasses worn by a fat kid.This book can easily be reduced from 225pages to at least 3pages. They are stranded, two boys die and they're rescued! Hooray! (As you can tell I'm being sarcaistic!)."
0,"Robot Wars a must not see This movie is not very well written in my opinion and is probably a good thing that it is priced so high. Most of it is uninportant dailog that seems to have little or no piont with no story or structure. There is alittle action at the end, but of poor qualaty. To make a long review short, it is basically like a bad episode of G.I Jeo."
0,"Too Expensive, only 1 Sponge! I was looking for a prime-able sponge, and found this. I don't know what I was expecting, 74 sponges for $8 seemed too good to be true, but I thought I'd try it anyway. Well, there is only one sponge. Said sponge is a scotch-brite scrub sponge, which is good, and it is also larger than your average sponge, but still $8 for a sponge?!?Maybe I'm not a sponge expert, but it seems a little high."
0,"Great book, but do not order this edition This edition reads like a photocopy of an early print edition. I am not old, but I had to strain and squint to get through it. No reflection of the book itself, but I nearly tossed it aside a dozen times it was so hard on the eyes."
0,"Worst Scholarship Possible! The author writes this book from a fundamentalist biblical perspective, which makes it like trying to argue the bible with someone who continuously quotes it out of context. The antique references show the author's bias. On reading the second chapter descriptions of ""secret societies"" a person who knows Egyptian history and religion cannot help but feel a twinge of pain at the outright falsity of almost everything he writes there. The same goes for the brief blurb on Gnosticism as well as most of the rest of it. Find a book that has a more balanced view of history and religious ideas and skip this one. If you consider your time of any value at all then reading this book definitely wastes it."
0,"Conspiracy lunacy at its worst Still's book reads like a litany of modern urban legends. The Illuminai, Atlantis, even pre-Columbian Native American Freemasons! If you want to read something worthwhile on prophecy and conspiracy, look at Gregory Camp's ""Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-times Paranoia"", or Richard Abanes' End-Time Visions. William Still shows a chilling willingness to us facist sources to ""prove"" his conspiracy theories. Authors like Nesta Webster (British facist in the 1920's), Abbe Barrel, and John Robison are used as credible sources. Truly scary right-wing ideology, just this side of Tim McVeigh."
0,"High expectations, MAJOR let down well I really expected this to be a funny movie, given the reviews as well as the stellar cast. But, aside from a couple of SMALL laughs and the surprise ending, this movie is a DUD. The jokes and the plot both fall flat. Ugh I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this one. Major disappointment!!!"
0,"This movie is terrible I was looking forward to watching this on DVD because I missed it in the theater, but I got really close to turning it off during the movie. It's just boring, there's no good story, no good acting, nothing worth seeing in my opinion. It's really silly and unbelieavable but not even a fun watch. I would not reccomend spending any money on this movie, and if you get it as a gift, return it and watch something else."
0,"Stupidiest agent movie ever made This movie is literally a copy of James Bond movie.The only diffirence is the agent who tries to be a ""cool""(skater,action renegade,trash talking,...) agent in the name of being the ""new age agent"".Vin Diesel totally ... .The movie is tried to be an original one by having a close-to-teenage guy,who is totally stupid.The story is probably one of the most senseless ones in the movie world.Who would like the destroy all the governments so everyone could be free,by poisioning the world?For the ones still interested in this movie and want to know about this movie:a movie that lacks everything to be a good agent classic.I think Vin Diesel and this movie's makers should watch more James Bond before they shoot the next one."
0,"WHY???? I watched this from a projection booth window. The theatre was filled with young kids (10 to 17). This new ""hero"" is not worth two cents. He can't act and all he knows is violence and we wonder why animals eat their young. This movie serves NO purpose except to promote hate and violence and give our screwed-up youth more sick ideas. I really believe that this new Hollywood is filled with hate and is sending a really bad message to our future leaders of our country. There are plenty of stories that movies can be made about, but this one is pure trash. Bad acting, bad music score (if you can call it a music score) bad directing and the list goes on. And then we wonder why the United States kids are so violent. There is only one thing to blame,,,,,HOLLYWOOD!"
0,"No way Xtremely Unoriginal, Xtremley Boring, Xtremely Bad Acting.After the first 5 minutes i wanted to leave. This movie was that bad. Vin Diesel is anything but inconspictuous, and could never be a believable spy. The Human Muscle would whisper and his bass drop would echo the entire missle silo before he even knew it.This was more like a comedy on spy movies.This movie was flat out bad. Vin Diesel Cannot act, he is a disgrace to movies. Arnold Should beat his bald ass for stepping foot onto a set and trying to make a good action movie. So far his best role was in Saving Private Ryan. :)"

0,"Holy dear God Where to start? How about this. Just as annoying as the super agent who knows everything. Always has the right tools to get the job done & full of witty remarks comes a story at the opposite end of the spectrum. Another attempt at the bumbling-idiot-that-just-so-happens-to-save-the-day cliche. Full of things that go fast, extreme sports refrences, & cheesy over-the-top male bravado. This attempt tries to capitalize on pop culture in every way. Without attacking a particular class of people, let's just say that this will appeal to those that don't mind shallow and mindless action movies. Everything goes boom and the day is saved. Oh yah. Now that's entertainment."
0,"Bizarre and braindead THis movie is one of the dumbest that I have seen in a long time. It is completely lacking in sense or logic. THe beginning was cool becase of Rammstein, but it went downhill from there. Its fine for a movie to have attitude, but this was just too over the top. And the acting was pretty bad, too. No doubt that it is a showy film, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like dumb action movies."

I rest my case.Feel free to click 'Not Helpful' now."
0,"Triple Cheese This is possibly the worst movie of the year. Let's just forget for a moment the outlandish stunts that are for the most part, absolutely impossible and not even close to believable. Let's focus on the writing. This is just a poorly written movie. It's cheesy and disgustingly predictable. It's a great movie for people who don't like movies with content."
0,"Pathetic Attempt at Bond This film is awful. The plot is a twisted Bond-film scenario with only difference being that Disel isn't a professional spy, but recruited by the US Government because he appears to be tough and, at the same time, a criminal. The special effects were okay, but very predictable and hardly believable. The film also had some lines from previous Bond films, and even some screen shots that looked awfully similar to some of the past Bond movies. But Diesel is no Bond. He ... as a spy, and is an awkward actor at that."
0,"<*** This movie is BAD! ****> I was able to see this movie in Europe for free and let me just say it was terrible; big explosions, and big stunts are the only dosis you'll be getting, because as far as a good story or a bit of acting is concerned not a chance!...unless showing off your muscles every second can be call acting.Vin Diesel is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, I wish Hollywood would give a chance to real actors who are just waitingfor the opportunity.Please don't allow this to continue, bad movies must be stopped once and for all.Rent this movie if it makes you happy but don't be another victim, or worst yet another supporter of this movie."
0,"xXxtremely Awful This could have been a Patrick Swayzee flick made for the USA Network. Vin Diesel does what he can with what little he's got to work with here, but he's a star who deserves a much better vehicle than this. Cheesey as can be, bad, no, HORRIBLE acting and worst of all... very mean spirited. At one point, the villans turn on a group of scientists who've made a toxic nerve gas for them and from behind the safety of a thick, glass wall, use that weapon to kill the scientists and mock their deaths, pretending to choke and gag and plead for help while laughing at the dying victims. It's unbelievably sadistic and violent for a PG-13 movie.....On a positive note though, the soundtrack is awesome. Seriously."

0,"Ugggg! My wife said it best ""this movie is for teen age boys"". Sure there's lots of action and stuff blowing up all over the place. Some great effects, although a bit far fetched in the reality department. But the acting... yikes. Diesel takes the 'wood' grammy away from Keanu. They should have given him a role like AAAH-NOLD in Terminator... very few lines. And the female lead...I guess shes good if you're into ""heroin"" chic.Puullllease! I guess some people liked it though...possibly the same people who think pro wrestling is a sport!"
0,"Mindless, Pointless and Insulting Bad. Just plain awful. Please skip this mindless drivel. The only people who liked this film are girls who think that Vin Diesel is ""cute"" and people who liked ""Fast & The Furious"" (another snoozer). I am glad that I saw it on my friend's PC and not at the theaters, so that I didn't waste $7.50. Anyone who watched this film and was not insulted by its mindnumbing dialogue, horrid plot and overall crudeness should be ashamed of themselves. Not even Jean Claude himself could have saved this one. A total waste of time for the thinking movie goer. Hey kiddies, here's an idea; instead of watching this why not see a top-notch film like ""Far From Heaven"" or ""The Hours"" or even ""Minority Report""? Oh, thats right, gotta use the old noggin for that one....never mind. It saddens me that movies have come to this."

0,"::::shakes head::::: First of all, I know Vin Diesel can act, I've seen him do so in other movies. I just don't know why he can't act in this one . . . I blame it on poor directing. If he's going to be this bad in the rest of his movies, he should pull a Fast and the Furious and keep the lines to a bare minimum of monosyllables such as ""yes"" and ""no,"" ""sure"" ect, ect. The only reason I would buy this movie is because he takes his shirt off, and he is HOTTT! Although the shirtless scene only lasted all of ten seconds, it was well worth waiting and hour into movie to see it. Now, if he had just kept his shirt off for the whole movie, or at least pranced around in one of his ""Pitch Black"" black tank tops, the whole thing would have been more enjoyable."
0,"Awful Vin Diesel was awful in this movie. He couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. the fast and furious was over the top and entertaining. Diesel was good in that flick. XXX was a lot of pointless action, no character or story development and unbelieve stunts. a lot of things happened with no real reasoning to why. Stay away. do not waste 2 hours on this one."
0,"Bad....very bad This movie is not worth renting, let alone buying. I returned it to the video store right away because I would rather get charged for a late return on adult movies than this one. It would have been much better if it were shorter and could have benefited from some editing. It would also help if there was at least some realism within the action scenes. I mean motorcycles just don't jump 20 feet off the ground without a ramp or something. Do not get me wrong I love action films but this one just crossed the line one too many times. The action was just not believable, but if you like that then who knows maybe you will like this one. I am not putting my name on this review for fear of people knowing I even rented this. Beware...consider this a warning."
0,"Unleaded Probably one of the most pointless films with one of the most pointless stars of today....and the best thing is we can expect a sequel. Could someone please explain to me the appeal of Vin? I mean, he did show some promise in far superior films like Pitch Black and Saving Private Ryan but enough already."
0,"Triple Bad!!! This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Vin Diesel is the worst actor. For ANYBODY to call him the ""new James Bond"" is sad and laughable. Say what you want about Roger Moore's performances as James Bond, Vin Diesel could NEVER compare to him and he was the worst James bond ever!! The stunts in this movie are awesome, but the acting and plot is HORRIBLE!! I felt ashamed that I watched this movie because it insulted my intelligence. This movie was SO bad and to think it was a block buster hit!!! Vin is sexy (although he sometimes force it), but nothing and I do mean NOTHING should excuse him for making this mess. C'mon Vin, do better next time!!"
0,"Just Bad I will make it short, about half way through the movie I turned it off. Probably one of the worst movies I have ever watched in my life.

Anyway what im trying to say is that my step mothers funeral was more interesting than this film"
0,"apallingly appalling This film could really be summed up in one word ""Appalling"". Van Diesel plays the archetypical 'action hero.' Yeah you've got it, the one whose status is big muscles and has 'I can't act' written all over his face! The trailer for the film looked absolutely awesome, which is the only 30 seconds worth watching for the entire film.I would love to explain in depth the details of the plot, but quite frankly I was too busy laughing at how pathetically shallow the plot was to even remember it.If you are a Samual L Jackson fan don't torture yourself by sitting through the film, not even the master himself can do it any justice whatsoever.Nevertheless as taste is unaccountable I can only recommend you rent this film from your local video rental store or whomever!"
0,"HORRIBLE!!!!!! Well i saw this movie on the night of its release... Just like most women in this world I am a HUGE VIN DIESEL fan... I saw him in the Fast and the Furious, Pitch Black, Boiler Room,and so on. I was SADLY DISSAPOINTED by this movie. It was long and dry. The funny parts were few and far between, and there was sooo much action in it that it was almost UNBEARABLE to watch. Between the mediocre acting and the tired fighting scenes. It leaves u drained. NOT VIN DIESELS FINEST HOUR I WILL SAY.."
0,"Stunts cool? (Someone DIED for your amusement)! For those of you ""ranting"" about how cool the stunts were in this piece of ... movie you should know the truth; one of the stunt doubles for Vin Diesel was killed in the paragliding scene. His name was Harry O'Connor. Knowing this fact will probably make you ... think this movie is even more cool."
0,"Don't buy this book If you are interested in learning about how to conduct option analysis, this is not the book for you. The book never provides you with the details on how to conduct the valuations described in the examples. Instead, they use over 100 pages to reiterate the same points they describe in the first 5. Furthermore, there are plenty of mistakes in the text to add to your confusion.In short, this book is a waste of time and money."
0,"revised from original edition The one star is not really for the novel, but for this edition of it. If, like me, you have read this and are looking to purchase a copy, this has an attractive cover. However, it is not clear from the product description that this edition of the novel is in the form the author originally submitted to his editor, and not the edition originally published. Accordingly, Willie Stark is Willie Talos throughout this novel. Even though this may have been the author's original intention, I absolutely hate that it's a different edition from the novel I read and loved. I will be returning it and purchasing an older edition without this reversion."
0,"Pointless This book was profane and pointless, as is w/ most books I'm forced to read for English. I never knew being in AP ment I had to put up with my beliefs being violated. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
0,"WORST BOOK I EVER READ! This had to be the most boring book I have read in my entire life! We had to read it for school, and a majority of the class ended up just reading the cliff's notes. I do not recommend this book to anyone, except to this one pig-like girl I know. Anyway, I never want to see this book ever again. I'm going to have nightmares about it! A warning to all: Never read this book unless you have to!"
0,"Audio edition--Warning The novel itself turned out to be better than I had expected it to be after listening to the first part on the audio cd set. However, the content of the novel is not the topic of this review, the audio edition is. I had been assigned the book for my Lit class and figured the audio version would help me understand the writing. However, I never even finished listening to the CDs. First of all, the narrator's voice is so gravelly and unappealing that it was a low-level version of torture to listen to. Secondly, the writing is difficult enough to follow on page, but on audio with no writing or punctuation to go from, the story is nearly impossible to follow. Unless you have no other option, go for the print version of this book- the audiobook will only frustrate you."
0,"Sick Movie! If your idea of a good movie is a homophobic film that paints all gay men as either having AIDS or bound to get it anyway, then JEFFREY is right up your alley. For the rest of us it is just a sad joke. The main character is so petrified of catching HIV that he literally comes across as a paranoid schizophrenic! This film is nothing but stereotype after stereotype. Nathan Lane appears as a priest who tries to molest Jeffrey and then lets him in on the secret that ""God is found in a Barbra Steisand album."" Huh?? The only funny parts are teh Sigourney Weaver cameo and the phone call with Mom & Dad. otherwise the writing is just horrid! When confronted by a group of bashers they ask what kind of weapon he has. Jeffrey responds ""irony... adjectives."" Say what? Avoid this at all costs!"
0,"One of the Worst Gay Movies Ever Made I cannot believe that so many people actually liked this movie. I have seen over 60 gay and lesbian movies and this is by far the worst one that I have ever had the misfortune to watch-with ""Chuck and Buck"" running a close second."

0,"0 stars, so horrible Wow my friends, you can't believe how horrible the Rolling Stones have to be. They are so horrible and overrated, I can't stand them. Their newest album is the lamest, stupidest, and lousiest album I have ever heard. I just saw the LP the other day and thought, NO NO NO because it has 16 of the worst songs ever recorded by the worst band in history. They are just asbad as U2, and ACDC. This has to be worth 0 stars because it isso horrible. JUST FOR KIDS WHO ARE A JOKE. Get any album fromDire Straits or Foreigner insted as they are LEGENDS.Four Fourteen."
0,"Not good at all The Rolling Stones' new album is the most horrible CD I have ever heard, plus they never made anything good in their whole career. They suck so hard. Why do people like this band so much?This is noise. Get any album from Green Day, Dire Straits, or Guns N' Roses insted."
0,"Great chops + no songs = one hell of a mess I wanted to like this so badly, but what a flop. The band SOUNDS great, I don't have any problem with the MUSIC here, BUT the songs almost to a one suffer from an acute case of Jaggeritis, an affliction dating back to Dirty Work where the Mick opts to go on for paragraphs when a few well-chosen words would do the trick. Dangerous Beauty isn't bad, great playing, but who is going to remember any of this in a few months? When even the Keith songs don't cut it, what hope is there left? This feels like a half-finished album, a great band playing hot but with too many wordy whiny Mick solo-album reject lyrics to make it worthwhile. This isn't the comeback album or tour of the year. That honor goes to Garbage, playing their hearts out live and with a solid album to boot. What a depressing disc this is."
0,"Dead brain cells. Now Mick Jagger takes a swipe at the Presedent and conservatives in general with ""Sweet Neo-Con"". If anyone needs proof that drugs kill brain cells, they only need to look at all these Rock stars trying to be political scientists. The Rolling Stones should stick to writing songs about cheap sex, boos and partying. anything deeper than that could risk the loss of thier few remaining brain cells. Of course, the president and the conservatives needent be offended. Criticism from a bunch of old brain dead, stoner geezers should be taken as a compliment.after all, advice about character should come from one who actually has some. Womanizing stoners and boozers don't generally make the best judges on such matters. Advice to Mick: leave the political commentary to the professionals. Stick to the subjects you actually know: Getting laid and getting wasted."
0,"THE ROLLING STONES SUCK HOW COME PEOPLE LOVE A HORRIBLE BAND THE ROLLING STONES? THEY ARE MEANT FOR BABIES. AND THEIR NEW ALBUM SUCH AS THIS SUCKS SO HARD, I'D AVOID IT.

Rest of their albums and songsjust stink, including their newest one. Avoid this and get a Foreigner or Metallica CD insted.PS.Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and The Beatles are garbage so avoid allalbums from those bands."
0,"Here they go again . If you have heard any Rolling Stones album that hey have put out in the past 30 years,you have heard this.When oh when are they going to give up the ghost? If you have to buy a Stones album,go with something pre 1973."

0,"The Stones Can Do Better This album is full of the type of crap we have come to expect from Richards, but even Jagger could not pull it out of the doldrums."
0,"Not very good... I consider myself a pretty big Stones fan. They've always been in my life, and I own each record, and can appreciate them all. I actually think Bridges to Babylon is one of their finest record (I don't dislike a single song on it) but A Bigger Bang is just not very good. Stuff like ""Streets of Love"" is just awful easy listening, and ""Sweet Neocon"" is just the Stones trying too hard to create controversy during the Bush Years. I did like ""Rough Justice"" for about ten seconds then realized, again, they were trying way too hard to ""rock"".I think the Stones will eventually admit that this record stinks.Thank God for the second side of the Exile on Main St. reissue. It more than makes up for A Bigger Bang being the Stones final studio output."
0,"should be called a bigger blow Let's face it--the stones are a concert band PERIOD.This cd is pure drivel--sweet neo con is the dumbest song I ever heard with the dumbest lyrics i ever heard.When Mick swears in concert we shake our heads and go that was cool,when he swears on this album i think he did it just to hear the words.They mean nothing.Being an optimist that I am the 2 richards songs with him singing are pretty good--other than that this album is a major disapointment."

Heck, last time around they didn't even have a new studio album, just a massive greatest hits collection followed by a tour and then...A LIVE ALBUM. What bores they are. ""A Bigger Bang""? A BIGGER BORE."
0,"Rubbish As a lifelong Stones fanatic, I'm sorry to say Bigger Bang is rubbish. It joins their other 2 rubbish efforts, Undercover and Emotional Rescue.

Not one single memorable song. One star because you cant give zero stars."

0,"The 'Best' more like the worst compilation! Yes, an overview of latin rhythms but that is my only favorable comment. This is truly a hodge-podge of recorded material and no musical credits are given, as to 'who is playing' or 'when any particular track was recorded'. This disc's 1st track is a piano solo but don't be fooled into thinking that would occur again - oh no - that would be too logical - and logic plays no role here!"
0,the plot itself could make a movie on Lifetime or Oxygen do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book.
0,"Zero stars if there was an option!! This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative."
0,"Do yourself a favor and pass on this piece of garbage I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller. Goes to show you some people have really bad taste. The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog. It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc. I would NEVER purchase another book by this author. Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can... Charlie"
0,"Dense, pedestrian, and boring. A rabid Dana Stabenow fan, I had no idea she had ever written SF. Now I know why this little-known aspect of her past is little-known. Written in 1991, the sequel to ""Second Star"" finds Star Svendotter leading an expedition and ""head(ing) out to the asteroid belt, man's last wild frontier, to make their fortune."" I trudged through this book, looking for any hint of the brillant talent that produced ""A Cold Day for Murder"" in 1992. Nothing. I found nothing. This book's only value lies in what came after it."
0,"Horrible! This was the absolute worst version of Joseph that I have ever seen. And what makes it bad --- the awful performace by Maria Friedman as the Narrator. Anyone who knows Joseph knows that the Narrator must belt, but Friedman simply cannot belt and it brings down the overall production of the show."
0,"Big Disappointment Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school, resulting in unrealistic and cutesy scenes of kids worshipfully smiling at singing adults. The music is good, but the narrator makes faces, and Danny Osmond with long hair and half-shaven looks like he just woke up from sleeping on the street. My advice if you have this video is to close your eyes, and just listen to the music."
0,"tastless movie I have heard great things about Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. This was just not my cup of tea. I thought the singing and the characters were horrible. Some of the clothing was very suggestable in my opionion. I would not recommend this video at all. Though others who gave it a bad review, said they had seen better ones done live. So i am going to try to keep an open mind and try to go to a live one in a theater near by, where maybe I will be able to see what everyone is talking about. The whole movie just left me bored and wasn't a movie that inspired my and my faith. It was cheesy to say the least."
0,This movie stinks! I've seen this play performed in several youth stage programs and I loved it. I saw this movie and was deeply disappointed. The singing was alright but everything else about the movie was horrible. The directing was bad and the characters seemed to be making fun of the story instead of portraying it as a true event that actually happened. After seeing it I feel that the rating should be at least PG-13 because of the many sugestive scenes and revealing costumes. If you are thinking of buying the movie I suggest you rent it first.
0,"Wonderful Play Gone Bad This is yet another example of an excellent musical play made into a horrible movie. The original play was purposefully set in unrealistic situations, but at the same time the music was of excellent quality. The movie has taken the play and turned it into a comedy that is not funny. The music has become farce. Beautiful semi-classical style music from the play has been dumbed down into cheap rock junk. The singers exaggerate emotions so much that it borders on ridiculousness. Nowhere is this more present than in the narrator's horrible exaggerated singing style. The only bright spot in this movie is Donny Osmond's singing quality. He seems to be the only actor in the movie who uses breath support while singing."
0,"thumbs down All the children magically popping up, some bad makeup, and a few sad tries at being funny is what makes this movie deserve such a low rating. I think they could have come up with a better Joseph than D. O.. I have seen it 6 times in live theater, and every time the show was better than the movie."
0,PATHETIC AND AMATEURISH PRODUCTION JOSEPH etc was a great and memorable show on stage (if rather short). This production is appalling and amateurish and the staging is on the cheap side. Many cast members are seen looking directly at the camera when they should not be doing so.It looks terrible.Who directed this rubbish.The Jason Donavan London stage show was far superior.Get a copy of that is you can.It's brilliant.Wait for a better version.This one is woeful and forgettable.

0,"Short but boring. AS an admirer of the great JC Superstar and Cats, I expected much. But, this was really disappointing. What's the point? What's the narrator for? Songs are weak (no memorable song). Nothing special in story. No enjoyable dance. Strange mood of adult (costumes! and even the narrator herself). And school boys and girls...for what? I really enjoyed JCS and Cats movie but I cannot recommend this(Joseph) at all. Boring and nothing enjoyable."
0,"Terrible! I was given this movie as a gift. not only is it inaccurate, but they imply a lot of sexual interest in Mrs.Potifer when Joseph had none! he was trying to get away. they don't do much with the choreography and they have they narrator interacting with the characters. if your life story was being told as you lived it you wouldn't see the narrator. yes, I realize that it's a movie (& originally theator) but really! some accuracy would be nice!"
0,"NOT for children We bought this DVD for our kids -- but I'm glad we watched it before showing it to them. The movie is a ""irreverent"" version of the bible story, and the sexual innuendo, not to mention the revealing and suggestive costumes, makes it unsuitable for kids."
0,"A terribly inaccruate version of the story, not worth it... This movie is not worth the cash it takes to get it, a terribleshowing of the original story -- it almost makes fun of it. It doesall people in it injustice. If your looking for something that gets the bang for for buck, this isn't it."
0,"Waste of money One of the few musicals that I regret spending the money on because of the absymal recording quality. The narrator was fairly easy to understand, but some sound track key singers were almost inaudible.The tunes would have been most enjoyable if the technical quality was acceptable.As one who enjoys musicals and muscial shows, I was very disappointed in the recording quality and video quality."
0,"Terrible sound quality! I had the VHS tape of this video and loved it, so I just recently purchased the DVD. Not thinking there was any reason to do so, I WISH I had read the customer reviews, as many of them commented on how terrible the sound quality of this DVD is. And I'm here to back them up. I have tried watching this on both my surround sound system and the television alone, and in both cases, it's horrible. Background singers and music are barely audible, but the narrator's part will blast out your ears if you turn up the volume to hear the music. What makes this even more disappointing is that Amazon will not refund your money in full."
0,"100% Worthless I bought this shaver because it was cheap. I figured even if it doesn't shave very well, I could at least use it as a trimmer for beard and sideburns. I was wrong.

It's description belies it's reality. If sugar is contraindicated in your diet....steer clear of this product!! It's low in salt and low in fat but so over sugared as to be actually nauseating. It's too bad because it sounded delicious and so nutritious. All I can say is YUK!!! I suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar is good for you."

0,"Don't Bother. This product is pretty much a waste of money. My Walker Coonhound will not stop digging up a huge potted plant in my kitchen. I purchased this product because the label reads that it is gentle on skin, hair and plants. This claim is true - my dog, myself and the plant have not experienced any dry irritation or rashes from this product. However, the product does not live up to it's primary function - my dog does not refrain from chewing anything that I spray the Bitter Yuck on. If anything, she is more attracted to the plant now that it is (literally) drenched in Bitter Yuck. To make this purchase even more disappointing and annoying, I accidentally got the Bitter Yuck on my own hands and (somehow) my mouth and I cannot remove it no matter what I try. In short, if you want to stop yourself from biting your own nails, get this product. If you want to get your dog to stop chewing, I would suggest researching other products or ask your vet."

0,"The second most overrated horror film next to ""The Shining"". This 1974 low-budget horror ""classic"" is yet another overrated horror film. It may have started the slasher genre, but it's no ""Psycho"" or ""Halloween"". Those are the only two slasher films that are actually classics. ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is just stupid ... None of the teenagers in this film are ones that you care about. By the last half of the film, I wanted Sally [Marilyn Burns] to be sawed because all she did was scream for a whole hour. The cannibals were more sickening and laugh-inducing than scary. For a better serial-killer film, go for ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Psycho"" of course. Those films are subtle and truly, deeply scary. ""TCM"" is over-the-top, grainy, crude, and masochistic."
0,"HORROR CULT CLASSIC? WHY? I always hear people say what a great movie this was...a classic...so controversial...so horrifying....THIS IS ONE OF THE DUMBEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. Too bad Amazon didnt have 0 stars as an option. After hearing all the hype, I finally decided to rent this movie, expecting to be frightend to death. Sure the movie had a few OK parts, but I found the movie to be slow and boring. It was like...Kids in a van...Kids find abandoned house....Kids die...THE END. As for the ending...what was so good about it? Guy swinging a chainsaw around and screaming like an idiot? (sorry if I ruined it for anyone). Thank god the store I rented it from had a ""not satisfied? get another movie for free"" policy! If you want to see a GREAT horror movie, buy DEAD ALIVE!"
0,"The second most overrated horror film next to ""The Shining"". ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is yet another overrated horror movie.

If you want a truly great low-budget horror classic, see ""Halloween"" or ""Near Dark"" instead."
0,BAD!!! This is by far the worst texas chainsaw massacre movie ever. The all of the older ones are. If you want a good one get the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Jessica Biel (4 1/2 star). It has the thrill and sort of a love story to go along with it.

SO all in all miss this film I wish I had!!!

Oh, and the title says ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", but only one kill in this whole film is by chainsaw. I have not seen something as falsely advertised like this since Halloween: Resurection. Do not see this deciving and crappy nonsense.P.S. I forgot to mention that the sequels and remake were even crappier than this train wreck. One last thing, if you want to see Tobe Hooper at his best, see Salem's Lot (the original 1979 version) and Poltergiest."

It was hard to follow; I wasn't sure if the corpse at the dinner table was the body of the screaming girl's grandpa or if it was just a random body the cannibals dug up.This movie didn't live up to all the hype; I strongly suggest you look for a truly scary movie. (i.e., 13 Ghosts, House on Haunted Hill, The 6th Sense, etc.)"
0,sick this movie is sick and discusting . nothing butkilling. dosent have a good storyline at all. and thats about it.
0,"not even remotely close to resembling anything great How can you call this movie one of the greatest ever??? That is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard! This movie flat out BITES! It is soooo overrated and boring! It's not even scary! It's pathetic! One of the worst movies ever made! I know I sound bitter but hey, I've seen enough bad movies to know whats bad and whats good, and this movie is BAD. Two thumbs WAY down for this rotten egg."
0,"Graphic Violence Meets the Three Stooges Should anyone watch This? No. If someone pays you to? How badly do you need the money... The acting is absurd, the dialogue is absurd, the story is absurd. The guy with the chainsaw desperately needs a Curly Fine voice over: ""Woob woob woob, woob-woob...""A true masturpiece (sic). With it's main focus being the hatred of women, this movie will especially appeal to guys who can't get a date. I won't say it's a bad film. I will however say it's atrocious, awful, cheesy, dreadful, inferior, lousy, poor, vile, putrid, rancid, rotten, disastrous, painful, terrible, sick, regretful, disagreeable and unfortunate. If I wanted to give American cinema an enema I'd put the needle right here. When I want to punish my dog I make him watch this. Makes me feel like hell when I do too,Get my drift?"
0,Mindless rubbish Probably the most facile and overrated movie of its genre. Idiotic plot. Tired tension building sequences and juvenile script combine to make this one of the most over-rated films ever produced.
0,Chain saw Bad movie.Dont spend your money on this one. The acting is real bad. Not written well and produce.Only a few good scary moments in this one.
0,"the most over rated movie ever I thought that being a film , which hasn't been released on video / DVD format for so long . And the fact the it was said to be one of the most shocking and brutal to be released on video . What a load of rubbish !!"
0,"DUMB DUMB AND DUMB this is by far the worse horror movie ever. the acting is pATHETIC, THE KILLER IS A total idiot, the camera footage suckz and theres no story line that goes with it, itz just about a guy that kills people with a chainsaw. i rented this movie and instantly regreted it. PLEAZE do not DO NOT buy this movie and if u do yer screwed"
0,"Feeling sooo ......never mind This C.D. stinks like rotten potatoes!Jennifer Lopez may produce some albums well but this is not one of them.The sound isn't very good(You can hardly hear it) and the C.D. doen't really have enough hits on it to cost so much(well,not that much really).Save Your mooch and spend it on something else."
0,"Mt Great-Great Uncle I only bought this because my Great-great uncle, Ross Santee, was featured in it for about 15 seconds. The video was made in 1939, when color had just come out, and the quality of the color is awful. Shadows in people's faces are green. The story line is so basic any kid could predict the ending. Still, it was well worth $10 for me to have a tiny bit of memorabilia of my long-distant family member."
0,"Mean Streets After (re-seeing) Taxi Driver recently, I was eager to see Mean Streets on satellite.After 25 minutes, I couldn't stand it anymore, and deleted it.This movie is drivel, about a group of worthless losers who somehow think that their pathetic lives are important to anyone but themselves.Yes, there are some stylistic similarities to Taxi Driver (along with some of the same actors, of course), but the result is dramatically different.I am guessing that a good bit of the dialogue in this movie was improvised, but in order for that to be a success, it would need to have some reasonable framework to hang on.This movie is tedious, a total waste of time.It may be that ""students of film"" find this movie worthy of study, but it's a clunker."
0,Terrible I ordered Mean Streets based on a review I seen on a special on gangster and mafia movies. It is terrible. I do not recommend it to anyone.
0,"Hilarious when drunk This had to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Just because it had big names, didn't make it good. I do have to say however that when hammered, this film is one of the funniest I have ever seen. I mean, it takes a pair to check your pants at a coat check. I only recommend this film to the heavily innebriated."
0,"Horrible film! My only reason for seeing this film is because Robert DeNiro is in it. Good 1960's music and good Italian music, but good music doesn't always make a film good. This is a horrible film. Waste of my time."
0,"not good quality The quality of this item was not up to expectations.The Top was scratched, the hinges did not line up to the pre-drilled holes and the staining was inconsistant. If I saw this item in a store I would not have purchased it."
0,"A Star In Sad Decline It's always hard to bow out gracefully when your time is up, and I just wish somebody would have took Tina to one side and told her how bad this album is. Listening to her ailing vocals is hard, stop now Tina, retire and live on past glories because once the voice is gone...."
0,"what's love got to do with it? Partnered with sadistic old Ike in the `70s, she was R&B's most physically provocative interpreter of howling, cat-scratched hedonism. But Teen's mellowed gracefully over the last two decades, so much so that someone must of forgotten to wake her up for this latest entreaty of adult contemporary zzzzzzz. Strictly speaking, 247 is a embarrassing formula album full of the same old hurtin' songs Turner's being turning out since Private Dancer; muted and predictable shrill globbed up with overripened hip hop/soul and wedding dance beats. While she's still effective when she's engrossed in full throttle balladeering, gone is the Tina who was once able to sing any sentiment and make it sound like it was torn from the flapping patchwork of her soul. Today, she's more like Aunt Jemina, drowning her R&B inclinations in a syrup of stiffened emotions and predictable studio belabourment. What's love got to do with it? Not a damn thing."
0,A real joke to the ANOES series This was a movie turned into a movie that has to be a real joke to the series. This was a movie where the original stars of the first movie have trouble with Freddy and then Freddy comes to the real world and then kills people. The weird part of this movie was how director Wes Craven made the movie like a documentary of Freddy's life instead of a sequel. The special effects weren't too good nor bad either but you could see why the special effects were mediocre because of the low budget. Freddy would star in his next movie Freddy Vs Jason that was a lot better than this.
0,"This is my worst nightmare-------DO NOT WATCH THIS Oh man. Picked up this steaming pile of shart in the $5.50 bin. I watched it years ago, and didnt remeber any of it so I watched it again. That was the worst mistake of my life.This is a bastard son of a decent series. Its kinda like Seed Of Chucky in the way that the prevois seriers were movies. The actors of all the old movies realize Freddy is real becuase he lives in the script, or something lousy like that. Not to mention there are only like 3 murders and Freddy looks totally lame, especailly with that retared Robot Glove.If you like the Nightmare movies, and never seen this movie, DO NOT WATCH IT AT ALL COSTS! It humiliates the memories of all the other Nightmares and will make you despise them all."
0,why wes? WHY! if you are a big fan of the nightmare series FORGET THIS ONE! its because of wes that there wont be a new nightmare on elm street sequel! the plot for this is is that the freddy charicter was reincarnaited into real life and he's stalking robert englund and heather langankamp (the stars from the 1st nightmare) they should of at least left it at 6 or they could of had alices son be stalked by freddy. but noooo! wes wanted to screw up the nightmare series! if you want the entire colection do not add this to it.
0,"Hated it!!! I'm sorry, but I did not like this film. I'm glad I did not pay to see this in theaters. I saw it on TV (cable), and was not pleased with the film at all. Bad acting, and a waste of film. The movie was not scary, and it was predictable. Truth is just watch the first 4 Freddy movies. Those are the BEST ones in the series."
0,"In Fact the Worst Nightmare Movie This movie was absolutely terrible! The only good thing about it is Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund starred in it. Also what's the deal with the krappy new Glove that looks like veins and other organic things are attached, huh LOL! I feel sorry for the Nightmare fans because this terrible sequal was made. It destroys the Nightmare Name and the Original Idea of Freddy being only a dream killer. Don't buy.THIS MOVIE SUCKS!"
0,"This movie doesn't follow the other movies I watched this movie on cable last night; and it was horrible. It was the worst Nightmare on Elm Stret Movies ever. It doesn't follow the story line at all from the past movies. It took forever, for anything scary to happen. Also, the movie wasn't as gory or bloody like previous movies. Not worth buying at all."
0,"Nothing new here! This album is very repetitive, that sums it all up. Every other type of music has changed at least a bit, it has been 60 years since swing came around. Guess what? It sounds exactly the same on this album as it always has. BORING!"
0,"Broke the first law of swing I think that it is absurd that the Cherry Poppin Daddies feel the need to swear though out their album. Swing lyrics are supposed to be fun, light hearted, and make fun of the times both today and of yester-year. I wrote them off my swing list until they can clean up their act - it is a shame because they have a real tight horn section."
0,"This was obscene I didn't pay attention to the reviews, sigh. I tossed the cd. The music may be good, but the concept is creepy. I glad for my naivete, this isn't the sophistication that I want to embrace."
0,"Offensive Content and Language I love swing revival music, but my exposure to various groups has been limited. I bought this as a ""buy it together"" with another CD, listened to four songs, and turned it off. I won't listen to it again. The themes of the songs are sex-charged and the language vulgar. I guess I should have known by the title, ""Cherry Poppin' Daddies,"" but I was thinking more along the lines ""poppin' = jivin'"" rather than it having a sexual connotation. Shows how out of the loop I am, I guess. Some people would probably love this CD, but as a Christian, I'm offended by the themes and the language. There was a low-class knock on God, too, and that was the end of the CD for me."
0,"Warning, if you equate Swing with fun, don't buy this. I had high hopes after reading the reviews, but I really regret wasting my money. If I want to hear about fathers beating their children and the kids' painful begging not to be hit with that thing in your hand, Daddy, I will meet with my clients. Word-pictures to let us all in on how it feels to be abused by a parent is not, IMHO, appropriate lyrics for the wonderful fun I have dancing to Swing. Stick with the classics. Don't let depressed people or children near this. I even hesitate taking it to a CD reseller."
0,"good musical quality ruined by foul lyrics This album was good for music quality but the lyrics were at times foul. There has been a lack of new musical ideas, everyone is trying to make it on shock value and pushing the envelope of social acceptability. People are tired of being screamed at and assulted by ""music"" and that has helped the resurgance of music such as swing. The Cherry Popin Daddies have taken the revival and put some tasteless lyrics to add the 90's garbage influence. I played this CD one time and took it to the local store and sold it."
0,"Go back to ska - wait, they already are I've been swinging for about a year now and I've heard Zoot Suit Riot so many times I figured that I should buy the album thinking that the rest of it is really good too. BIG MISTAKE. This is your typical one song album. You see, the CPD used to be a ska band until the swing revival and then they jumped on the bandwagon to cash in. The whole album is just a compilation from their two past albums, really making this album a ska album. The lyrics are horrible, the songs aren't even swing songs, and the album will give you a headache. If you are into ska, by all means, buy this album. However, by swing standards this album is as bad as you can get. If you aren't into ska, do yourself a favor by not buying this album and by getting a real swing album."
0,"Well.... then there's this. If you're the type that thinks swing dance belongs on the same radio station that plays the top ten Billboard, and/or If you like jazz but don't know who Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and Count Basie are, get this!If it's so good, why are so many people selling it used???No offense to the band, but there are many, many better albums (and bands) out there that are *so* much better. Granted, some of these songs are catchy, this would be my last pick for this type of music. Closer? Big Bad voodoo daddy and Setzer. Even more? Indigo Swing and Rhythm rockets. Ray Gelato. Lavay Smith. Steve Lucky & Rhumba Bums. Want to really get closer to jazz and / or swing? check those out first. Closer? Look into the real evolution of swing dance. But please don't look here and start on the wrong foot."
0,Awful stuff I agree with the two previous reviewers. This is indeed horrendous fake swing that doesn't hold a candle to the original masters. It is also GRATE (not great) modern swing!
0,"Swinging and Swearing Don't Mix These losers have a brain-dead idea. They trot out the old Swing/Jump sound of the '30s, then figure that in order to update it for the '90s, they'd better add some downer lyrics and foul language. This is the modern '90s idea of fun, I guess.No thanks. If I want to listen to Swing, I'll stick with the original masters. Do yourself a favor and buy a Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, or even a Louis Prima CD, and you'll see how lame these neo-Swing pretenders are."
0,"There's much better modern swing out there... The swingin' sounds on this may rock, but the swingin' words on Zoot Suit Riot are simply awful. Abuse and swing just don't go together... this stuff is supposed to be FUN, not miserable. Go listen to the Squirrel Nut Zippers or Brian Setzer Orchestra instead."
0,"Hoku is a hit... with children five and under that is! Hoku's ridicousily stupid ""Another Dumb Blonde"" is possibly one of the stupidest songs ever writen.

0,"Not another note from Another Dumb Blond, PLEASE ! Come on everyone, how can you be writing these praises of Hoku and her debut, ""Another Dumb Blond"". One of the few times Britney Spears outshines another artist can be found when comparing this single to any of Spears' works ! The lyrics speaks for themselves ! The entire song is nothing but ""make no sense"" lyrics and loud background music coming from a keyboard piano ! Not a catchy song, horrible music, no well written lyrics. Simply don't buy Hoku's, ""Another Dumb Blond"" unless you truly are another dumb blond !"

0,"Range is just awful Ok, how do I explain? I've been picked up off and on during the years. Each time I'm picked up, I get probed. And not just by a little gray. And not just once or twice. The whole darn ship of 'em line up to probe me. Repeatedly.So, I bought this device, thinking that if it went off, I'd have time to escape to my lead-lined safe room, or at least grab a weapon. So what happened? Not what I expected. It didn't give me any warning at all. The range is extremely limited. Only later did I see the disclaimer: ""For best results, hold directly under saucer.""Anyway, I woke up in the ship as I was being probed. And this stupid product was beeping. It kept beeping the whole time that I was being probed by every single crewman. Do you have any idea how annoying it can be to hear tinny beeping as you are being probed by a ship full of grays?Worst of all, the company would not give me a refund."
0,"Been Abducted Twice!! After my first abduction I sought out to arm myself with something that would prevent this from happening to me again. Alas, the UFO Detector.Since then my microwave, TV, radio, and cellphone have been causing the device to alarm several times, sending me in a state of panic where I'd hide under my bed for days. Next time it went off it was no false alarm. And I was, again, on board an alien vessle with probes hanging from every opening of my body.I'd guess that for this ""Detector"" to work you'd need to be in an environment free from all electrical interferences. Above all, I DO NOT recommend this product."
0,"This item sucks Seriously...After like two times it breaks. The first time, upon encountering the UFO the device started to shutter and shake REALLY bad and then lost all power. The second time, well...that time was mostly okay, but the third time it didn't work at all. I had to get out of bed with a flashlight and when I finally got the UFO to come over, the device just sat there like it was a toaster or something. Seriously, if your looking for a GOOD UFO detector, look elsewhere."
0,"Got me abducted! I was fishing at a lake not far from me and had the device with me. It failed to detect a UFO, and before I know it, they scooped me up in a giant glowing fishing net and carried me to Neptune where I was then probed, injected with I have no idea what, and mercifully, fed quite well. They gave me steak, they were quite nice after the probing actually.I would not recommend this detector, I would not want anybody else to get probed by it."
0,"Works too good I bought this to see if there were any aliens here, but since I was in Texas near the Tex/Mex boarder, my alarm would not turn off! Every time I went to home depot or walmart it would go off and I could never get it to turn off! Also when I take it near my vegetables and fruits it goes off, so I have to wrap them in tin foil, which is a hassle. I wonder if there going to release one that detects immigrants.....misc was here...."
0,are you that stupid ? Really? The other reviewers bought this piece of &*%$ ? Can you say shills. Rather than buy this why not take your money and flush it down the toilet as a way of communicating with the little green men?

0,"Buyers remorse that inspires anger... I can't believe I bought the back cover hype, and purchased this book. Mr. Roberto should have begun most sentences with, ""Uh..."". Lacking confidence, he speculates on the shallow, obvious sides of Neal's brilliant lyrics. I can only surmise that a Writers Club Press saw dollar signs, conspired with a bogus editer, and convinced Mr. Roberto that his internet thoughts would make a good book. But, c'mon Len, this book is in your name, and your reputation. How could you have not fleshed out this manuscript to make it readable? Skip this book, and read Mystic Rythums."
0,"It's self evident . . . Type this author's name in the amazon search and see what comes up: nothing but books about how writers can get published. I.E. if you want to make a living as writer, then write books that gullible people will buy. If this person is unable to get their work, other than books about getting published, published then it's self evident that one should not take the advice in his books seriously, there is no evidence that it works for anything but books about how to get published (or, it may be seen, he has, technically, published two books about how to make it through college as a student, something that is minimally useful and, also, seems to have gone out of print quite rapidly, i.e. did not sell well).Unless, of course, your only desire is to write books about how to get published, then you should take his advice, in such a particular case as that he seems to know what he's talking about."

0,"Gimmicks don't make good music! It's hard to take the music seriously when I doubt that they're even being honest about their sexuality.Music-wise, it sounds like old-school Britney Spears trying to rock out - horrible on paper, even horribler live (I know that horribler isn't a word, but this stuff is so bad, that it deserves a new word for bad that means ten thousand times worse than CRAP!) Clever idea, trying to capitalize on an industry driven by sex appeal, but little more than that. Even watching them make out on stage gets boring after a while."
0,"TATU This is the worst CD I have ever listened to. First fo all, the translation is just awful. I kind of liked their music when it was in russian (At least it made sense)."
0,"Google search for TATU and Blender magazine You'll find an ""interview"" with the girls that includes maybe two lines actually from the girls. Their manager is their mouthpiece, as they don't really speak english. How convenient for him, I suppose. At least he's honest, though, because he comes right out to tell you that TATU was created as a product, the theme being underage sex. No really, their manager was brazen enough to say it. Now, as to the music, it's so-so. But the whole lesbian act is just that. They don't smooch or cuddle off-camera. They're just two underage girls being paraded around in wet t-shirts and school-girl uniforms. If you want to pay for that, go ahead, but usually it gets you arrested."
0,"Quick! Bring me a bag to barf in! If they really want so much attention why don't they just go jump off a cliff? Britney Spears already did the school-girl act, but now, making out? Who wants to watch two lesbian girls make out in the rain? Everytime I see the video I want a bag to barf in! Now, I'm not saying anything bad about lesbians, but, this is too much! The first time I saw them on MTV I thought, ""Oh look, new singers"". Then --- I saw the video. I went online to read about the interview with MTV and they said ""We aren't lesbians we just love eachother"". Ok, alright....so why are they making out?!

0,"Why didn't they just give us the original movie? There's lot's of problems with this DVD. First of all, they've added some kind of bloom effect that makes everything look glowy. I assume this was to make look new and shiny but it also makes everything look especially dark. You can hardly see the Riddles in the Dark scene because it's so dark!Then there are random edits throughout the entire movie. At the very beginning, the video stops and the frame literally spins around the screen. Why? And there's tons of skips and cuts and audio missing throughout the rest of the movie. Why did they find it necessary to add this stuff? It's like they didn't even watch it and realize how bad it is before they released it. It sucks too because this is the only DVD version I can find that isn't 99 bucks. You're better off finding a download or VHS copy."
0,"didn't see it yet but not buying it It is not fair to call this a ""review"" because I have not watched the DVD. Due to having seen several reviews here and on other websites regarding the lack of good audio and the sadly recrafted movie, I refuse to buy it. I LOVE The Hobbit from my childhood. I have been searching for months for the movie in DVD for my kids and after reading several reviews, I know myself well enough to choose to avoid the deep disappointment that others have related about this particular DVD. I just want the same movie I watched as a kid on a DVD. Is that too much to ask?"
0,"A valiant effort and miserable failure It's been a long time since I attempted to watch this [film], but not long enough. The author is certainly entitled to his own interpretation, but unless it's a vaguely entertaining one I really wish he wouldn't try to foist it off on others. This movie just plain [is not good] -- annoying animation, obnoxious voices, and worst of all, a complete butchering of the spirit of the book."
0,"Not a quality recording I was happy enough to get a DVD copy of this even if it was just a straight VHS rip, but my VHS copy is actually better. The sound and video quality are sub-par. There are moments where awkward video transitions are inserted as if there were cuts in the available print and in places the scene skips or repeats itself for a second. I would not recommend this to anyone. Until someone gets around to doing this movie justice with a real blu-ray, you're better off just holding on to a VHS copy."
0,"Dreadful The one word that sums this movie up is dreadful. I love the story, but the little Nazi-style elves sprouting leaves are just one example of how this interpretation went wrong. With only one exception (The Return of the King, also by Rankin -Bass) it is it is the worst adaptation of Tolkien's works that I have ever seen."
0,dont buy horribel its a copy of the origanal and it is so dark that you can hardly see ant thing that is going on
0,"Bad recording I was very disappointed in this recorded version of the classic animated Hobbit. It was poorly recorded.. it skipped in several places, even cut out some of the Dialog and lyric from the Bard singing. Or it would repeat itself like a scratch on a record player would or a scratch on a Music CD. Which is very strange for a DVD that is BRAND NEW and w/o a mark on it's playing surface. Plus the dark scenes (which was most of the movie) was so dark you couldn't see anything.I would be better off finding me a VHS player and watching mu VHS copy.. or find a place that would be willing to tranfer it to DVD format.DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.. Don't waist your time."
0,"Bad quality! This movie was cheaply converted to dvd. The colors are too dark and it skips a couple times. I cant even get it to look decent after messing with the picture options on my plasma tv. Every other dvd or blu ray that I own works fine in my player, so the problem is definitely the dvd."
0,"Not the best version for this classic. This transfer feels so incomplete compared to the version I used to watch throughout my childhood. This version is choppy, with random bits skipping parts of dialogue and on loop. The worst part of this DVD is the coloring, which is horrible. The contrast is FAR too dark and this causes the scenes to become lost and, more often than not, you end up watching a pitch black screen and wondering if it's your computer or DVD player. It ISN'T. It's the DVD. Brand new or not, it is not worth the ten dollars you would spend for it."
0,"Drained of emotion As many have said, this version of the film is inferior to it's earlier incarnations. I've watched this film on TV and VHS since I was a child. I've loved it ever since and never got tired of it.I was SO disappointed in the Warner's DVD release. Half the music is subdued. And worse, half the sound effects are missing. The clanging of swords. The screech of the Eagles. The sound of Sting slicing up Spiders. The sound of Glamdring cutting down Goblins. Many more. All gone. They even cut bits of dialog. At one point, Bilbo looks like he's just talking to himself because the off camera dialog is gone.The movie has been rendered dead and lacks of emotion. I hope they correct this with a future release. H3ll, if nothing else, they could just get the Laser disc (remember those? *heh-heh*) and rip the soundtrack from that. Anything is better than this, Warner. You're an old company. You know better."
0,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!! I have grown up with this story of The Hobbit, its one of my favorites. I have always had this movie in my collection and know the lines by heart. I have bought this DVD and the DVD stinks! Warner Brothers ruined this story on DVD. How? The sound was re-mastered for the DVD and there are sound effects MISSING! They used an old copy of the soundtrack that was used on a four record set that issued in 1978. If you want the complete soundtrack I recomend you buy the VHS tape. (The older the copy the better) They have also added new sound effects and lines that are NOT in the the original soundtrack! There are also problems with their DVD's of The Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King. (See my reviews for those DVDs under there listings) If Waner Brothers really cares they will re-issue These 3 DVDs after correcting their problems. ~Rob~"
0,"Great Video, Lousy Reproduction This vendor's edition is washed out, grainy, and missing snippets. It looks like a bad copy from a TV broadcast. If you want to enjoy this wonderful video, buy the version from Warner Bros. Classic Tales. It is the same production reproduced properly. I'm going to see whether I can return this version for the good one."
0,"MOIVES ON PARADE! DO NOT ORDER-ITS WORST COPY OF HOBBIT I have seen this moive over 1000 times and thats no exageration! being born in 1972 I remember this film in the theatres and has been a favorite ever since and is a FAMILY FAVORITE with my kids today.This ""THE HOBBIT:THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED 1977 ANIMATED CLASSIC"" as advertised it a complete lie, the film is edited and missing scences,not whole scences mind but enough to make it seem it was chopped to be compadible for T.V. and its commercials to fit in a time slot, not only that the colar is quite faded and not sure if it is due to a poor quality DVD that the moive was downloaded/recorded on but there is a glich, a repeator skip of 1.5 second as Bilbo spaeks to Gandalf and others....I will never order on Amazon again, HOW CAN THEY CALL IT THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED CLASSIC WHEN IT IS NOT!SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR THE REAL VERSION!!!"
0,Tape was broken I bought this tape and it did not even get through one viewing without it being eaten as it was obviously very worn.
0,"Very bad, If you had not already read the book, you would not be able to follow the story line. After Gandalf comes, the next morning the dwarves just 'appear' no knocks, rings, or any of that sort of thing. The elves look like little wizened green men and women, and quite ugly. There are no details, and some of the most important ones are not there. This is a waste of time and money, the books are a thousand times better."
0,"One Star for Quality I bought this because I remembered seeing this as a little kid and wanted to share the wonder I recalled with other kids. Too bad that the animation and picture quality are so poor. It's very dark. There are times when you can't really make out what is going on on the screen. High definition just exaggerates the poor quality. I wanted to love it, but that really got in the way of the overall enjoyment. The kids didn't really care too much though. The story is still good."
0,"Total Disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I do not agree that this DVD is the original ""unedited"" animated classic of The Hobbit. I have the original on VHS and it has better quality then this DVD. The sound skipped and some of the sound side effects were missing. Also things were added or changed. It's annoying and not worth buying. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"awful this is painful to look at-avoid it like the plague-it has not much to do with the Book of the same title,except in some plot details"
0,"You have got to be kidding me. I'll save you the money. But if you like completely horrible interpretations, give a listen to the tune, ""Frodo of the Nine Fingers"" and hear some hack vibrate through one of the worst ideas for a song in at least a century."
0,"Scary as Heck Never before has such an evil, creepy film crossed my path. Years of psychological treatment have not undone the scarring caused by this movie. I first encountered this movie with its terrifying musical numbers and frightening characters at the tender age of 11 and I still suffer the repercussions of it. I do NOT recommend this film to anyone under the age of 17."
0,BAD COPY of a Great Movie This is a terrible copy of a good movie. The film is dark in scenes making some of it unwatchable. Some scenes are cut together in imovie or something. Also (as mentioned in another review) some sound effects are missing. The Rankin Bass cartoon is great but this is a pirated disc or copy of a torrented file. THIS IS A BAD BUY.
0,"DO NOT BUY! This is the worst picture quality on a dvd I have ever seen! Any night or dark scene, like the scene in Golem's cave, is too dark to make out anything. I wish I could have waited for the inevitable release to go along side the new movie's blu ray/dvd release. Terrible..."
0,"It was an attempt...at most Ok I have read the book several times, and enjoy it. Tolkien is great. This movie is not. The plot jumps from adventure to adventure giving no time at all for anything to be enjoyed. What is with the American voices! Gandalf isn't from Alabama! The soundtrack is alright. But I can't believe that they put in that song where the goblins are chasing them with that awful 70's rock drum beat. This movie is only worth it for little kids."
0,"read the book again: the pictures and music are better Awful. Shabby animation, horrid music (the other reviewers impugn hippies by alleging the music is somehow ""hippie-ish"").The story is cut to pieces and the ""acting"" is elementary school quality. It's obviously edited to be shown as a TV series (read: commercial schlock).It's a great story, totally trivialized by this crummy production. Avoid at all costs. The single star is the least I can give."
0,"Movies on Parade VHS - terrible This is a wonderful animated movie in its original form. This particular product (the ""Movies on Parade"" VHS version from [...]) is terrible with poor audio and video through-out - very dark and garbled in sections. I missed the other reviews about this specific product and would not have wasted the money on it.I wish that AMAZON would sub-group reviews by actual product (not the movie, but the actual tape or DVD by a particular company) or allow a dual rating system - one for the movie and one for the media product."
0,Movies on Parade Version. I can't speak for the other version that Amazon is going to group this review in with but don't buy the one with the Orange banner on the top that reads Movies on Parade. The video transfer to DVD is terrible. The pictures varies widely from too dark to see anything to washed out bright. The sound is just as bad. It looks like someone put a videophone on a tripod. Watched a decent recorded a decent version of the movie and then made a DVD of the recording from their phone. It is pretty much unwatchable.
0,"Awful transfer This is an awful transfer from the original source material to DVD. Most of the film is muddy or dark, the scenes with Bilbo and Gollum being the worst. The soundtrack has several errors including gaps of silence, skips and lines being repeated. The movie itself it great, but take my advice and spend the extra few dollars to get the official Warner Bros. release. This version isn't suitable for The Dollar Store."
0,"Movies on parade bootleg? This DVD version was horrible! I vividly remember this being a brighter video. This DVD was so dark in the scene ""riddles in the dark"" you could only see Gollums mouth. Sting didn't even glow the video is so poor. Don't buy the Movies on Parade version. The audio skipped too. So sad Amazon sold this. No stars if it was possible."
0,"Bad copy This movie is good, but this is a review of the copy. This copy of the Hobbit is SO POOR.It looks like a rip from a dying VHS copy. It looks SO BAD. You can't even see what's going on during the dark scenes, and I KNOW it wasn't that crappy originally. I've seen the movie before, and it is not meant to look this bad. It looks like a bootleg or something, THAT BAD.I really regret not reading the reviews before ordering this..."
0,"While this is a wonderful tale and a memorable cartoon, this particular version of the product is horrible. My review is more about the actual product, ""Movies on Parade, the Hobbit""This product looks like a bad VHS copy of a copy of a copy of a copy transferred to DVD... the colors are extremely muted, and barely anything can be seen in the darker scenes, such as Bilbo and Gollum and Mirkwood.If you can find another version I urge you to do so."
0,Very dissapointed I bought this title in hopes that the Synergy version of this movie would have fixed the missing sound effects track which was missing on the WB version. Well it wasn't there. So do yourself a favor and don't buy this version of the DVD if you want to get the missing sound effects track.Will somebody ever fix this!!!???
0,"Not correct product. The product information was for The Hobbit VHS, when I received the item it was on DVD. It was for a birthday present and it's not even the correct item."
0,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD This DVD is terrible quality. DO NOT BUY IT. The volume on the tracks are very low and it occasionally skips as though this was copied from a poor quality VHS. Buy the re-released Warner Brothers edition from itunes its only 10 bucks.
0,"not viewable The dvd I got is too dark and can't be seen any of my televisions, all new flatscreens. Even with the brightness turned all the way up and at night I can't see it. Obviously a waste of money since there is nothing I can do with it now."
0,"Terrible DVD Transfer My experience has been in line with several others here. Sounds are missing from the original version, some sounds repeat. There are several points where the DVD appears to skip and replay a short sequence that it just played. The colors are extremely poor -the cave scenes are supposed to be darker but here we struggled to actually see anything that was happening. I like the film, but the quality of this transfer is just unacceptable - do not buy."
0,"Movie Butchered! This DVD of Rankin-Bass's ""The Hobbit"" has picture quality too dark to view, portions missing, parts repeated, cheesy transitions added, overly saturated colors, pixelation, jerky camera panning that I don't see on my VHS copy, and many sound effects missing. The company who did this, Movies on Parade, should be ashamed. I love this film and don't know why they tampered with it so much they made it unwatchable. This butchered version should not be sold or given away! This wonderful feature was ruined by an idiot ( or team of idiots ) that didn't know how to color correct or export, which is bad enough, but the spinning screen and page peel transitions were like an ungifted child doodling on a Picasso. The Warner Bros. distributed version looks a million times better but sound effects with the spiders, Smaug, and Battle of The Five Armies are missing; leaving long annoying gaps of silence. Maybe Warner Bros. will re-issue ""The Exorcist"" for kids without those scary sound effects."
0,Worst Production value I have ever seen Avoid this edition. Audio doesn't match video all the time and fade outs for 10 second about every 20 minutes. Entire film is to dark to see most of the time. Old VHS version of this movie has much high quality video.
0,"What Happened? I've been a Christian all my life but I realized I had never read the bible, so I bought it and read it front to back and its the damnedest thing... now i'm an Atheist."
0,"wasnt so great So alot of people I know read this one and said it was pretty great. As soon as it started off I was worried it was gonna be like that Friends episode where Rachel asked Joey to kiss her and then the whole thing is just a dream. I hate that old just a dream trick. But anyway this story wasn't at all like that. It was worse! First of all I thought he was going to fall in love with that girl but he doesn't, that was dumb why even bring her in? Then, the main guy dies in the end! Not even in the end, but he dies and the book just goes on and on blah blah blah. I haven't read any of Jamess other boks but who-ever decided to call him King should maybe thing again about that idea ha!"
0,"Too hard to read. I returned it. The print is too hard to see, the cover is too thin, and I didn't like the paper it was printed on."
0,"Lol the Bible sucks Responsible for hate, bigotry, and false beliefs for thousands of years. It is literally nothing more than a giant fantasy book for adults. If you believe in fairy tales and santa, you'll believe this too."
0,"Not that great. I didn't buy this exact book, but I had one similar to it. Would not read again. Very violent, contains incest, beastiality, murder, horrible things that shouldn't be so available to everyone immediately. Promised salvation, so I thought a tv would be okay, but didn't deliver. As far as I can tell, this is just firelighter paper. Don't recommend."
0,"Terrible read. I do not recommend it. I wanted to start reading this because of all the good reviews, but it was terrible. The name of the author is not put there. One dimensional characters, no plot, contradicts itself over, and over. This god character makes no sense. Contradicts modern science. It's just terrible, it promotes genocide, slavery, killing, killing, and more killing, hate, and bigotry. It's a waste of 10 dollars that you could otherwise be buying a better book."
0,Steel shouldn't Break I purchased these in June of 2009 and installed them on my truck to give my truck more support to haul my 31ft. 5th wheel. Today 6/13/2011 a 6 inch piece of one of the leaf spring helpers broke off while I was driving down the road. Lucky for me and other traffic it happened while I was on a less traveled road and only going about 25 mph. These leaf spring helpers are only 2 years old and they broke. I guess they are not made of quality steel. I don't recommend them.
0,"MISLEADING/FALSE PRODUCT ADVERTISEMENT I am a little confused. The camera I ordered that was advertised online, is not the camera I recieved via UPS. I was aware that the camera might not come in the color advertised. But it was certainly suppose to come in the same style. (The Minolta Freedom 70 QD Date 35mm Camera) Instead, I recieved a Minolta Freedom Zoom 70ex.What happened? I did recieve the camera bag at no extra charge. Thank you. But my concern is not recieving the camera I ordered!"
0,"Not for me. I am an adult. This book was not for me. It is a story of a fairly-typical reluctant hero. The main character is serious, but juvenille. Young teen readers may find this book attractive, but for other adult readers: stay away."
0,"a disappointment with the addition of carol berg's books i was hoping that amazon was finally reccommending stuff for me that i would like, but lady of gil turned out to be a real disappointment. it is extremely plot driven, whereas i prefer character driven work. in addition, the characters are unbelievable and the plot cheesy. the author seems entranced with her own cleverness, and i didn't think she was very clever. figures with authority have titles like ""primate"". there is no reason to feel fear or care about the characters and i put the book down before finishing."
0,"This film had a point to make, but we lose interest right.. from the beginning. Because the film is so boring, we don't really care to know what the point was.ASH WEDNESDAY is about a middle-aged woman, who is undergoing a middle-age crisis, elememts of which include her having an extensive plastic surgery and a young lover. It is a ""we have to value what we've got"" sort of thing.Except for the great Henry Fonda, who appears only in couple of scenes, all actors are complete ham. I did not feel any genuine emotion coming from the screen, I didn't laugh, and I was not entertained. On my list, these are the characteristics of a bad movie. I am sorry to hurt the feelings of all die-hard Elizabeth Taylor fans: she is a true star, but even her costumes could not save this film. It is dull and pretentious!"
0,Worked for two weeks Handset is bulky and not comfortable to use. Speaker in handset sounded terrible while it worked. After two weeks the radio no longer produces any sound. Everything lights up like it thinks it's working but there is no sound at all.I hope I can just return this item for a refund
0,"Power from vehicle battery I was looking forward to using this product. When I received the CB Radio I find that it does not plug into the cigarette lighter as I thought, it connects directly to the vehicle battery. Can't do that so it is going back. I give Amazon one star for not making this clear."
0,"Poor design, save your money If you are trying to save yourself some work forget about buying this product. The design is very poor and apparantly not properly field tested before it was put on the market. The unit will get stuck (everytime) on the corner of the pool steps(and every pool has steps). It then sits in that position and grinds away at your pool finish and the unit itself. I haven't had mine for 6 months and the unit is worn down where it rubs against the steps. I must then be constantly be fishing the unit out of its stuck position. I have now resorted to lowering a stone-filled empty detergent bottle in that corner to try to get the unit to bypass the corner....ugly. P.S. it doesn't even pick up medium sized leaves, they all get stuck at the bottom."
0,"Smells horrible - NOT like green tea at all I've been searching high and low for a green-tea scented candle. I have found a lot of ""green tea/citrus"" and scents like that, but not just simply ""green tea"". So when I found this one, I bought it right away. None of the other reviews I read, even negative ones, seemed to mention Beanpod candles smelling gross. So I bought it. Candles cost too much as it is, but when I spend 20 bucks and then get something like this, I'm very disappointed.It did not smell like green tea in the slightest. The best I can come up with to describe the smell (which I could smell before even opening my package when it came in the mail), was some cross between AXE Body Spray and campground latrine disinfectant. It stung the nostrils. Just awful. I don't know how anyone could find this scent enjoyable, let alone claim that it smells anything like green tea."
0,"Encounter With Alien Man I would not recommend ""Space Aliens Took Me To Their Planet"" to those who disbelieve that the earth is being visited by spaceships (piloted by god-like people) because this book depicts such an encounter that took place in 1973 in France. ======= The book's emphasis is upon the alien's extensive message concerning mankind's origins, mankind's religions, mankind's future, etc. ======= If I were to only judge the insights that this book provides into the awesome technology and power exhibited by aliens, a well as the awesome influence that aliens can wield upon human beings, I would have to give the highest rating available (five stars). However, I will only give this book one star because another book, entitled ""The Sacred And The Profane"", written by Desiree Ntolo (published in 2008 and available from Amazon.com), exposes the dangerously evil intentions that form the basis of the alien's message."

0,TERRIBLE This product last maybe a week before it broke. Would not do more then 2 or 3 coins at a time. It is easier to sort the coins by hand!!!
0,"Nice cinematography . . . nothing else Some nice cinematography is wasted by an inane script full of historical inaccuracies, cliches, and stereotypes. The romance begins to succeed in the first 1/3 of the film, but the attempt to add suspense, tragedy, and mystery all fail miserably, and the actors appear to know it. I wouldn't waste a rental fee to see this tripe again."
0,"Save Yourself I saw this and I must say I felt I was trapped in a sophomoric misunderstanding of Ingmar Bergman. If you want beautiful cinematographic postcards of the Pacific Northwest, by all means. If you want a lifeless P.C. apology to Japanese-Americans, by all means. If you want a movie that you can stay awake through . . . run, run, run to your nearest made-for-televison movie . . .you'll thank me."
0,"Crosses line to propaganda. Ostensibly sympathetic to Japanese Americans, Snow Falling On Cedars actually crosses the line to propaganda by failing to acknowledge that there is another side of the story. The Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor is barely mentioned, the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians that led to the unjust internment of Japanese Americans omitted. But the film goes even furher, referring to the camps as ""concentration camps,"" which they were not; this is a deliberately misleading lie. These omissions and false impressions can only stir up bad memories and provoke renewed hatred. My father defended the U.S.A. and the rest of the world from the Japanese during World War II, watched many of his friends slaughtered, and would turn over in his grave if he were aware of this atrocious, simple-minded, one-sided film."
0,"NOT a Tango movie to buy! As far as tango is concerned, this is NOT a movie to buy based on the word Tango in the title. As for the movie itself, we'll let's just say that it is not worth purchasing let alone the time wasted by watching this film. I am a fan of Argentine Tango, and this movie does not have any worthy tango scenes."
0,"Discs are failed!! Be careful when you order this item. Some discs are failed, as the ones I bought. The problem: Image freezes every few seconds, which makes the documentary impossible to watch. This is very frustrating. I understand that -under Amazon's policy- you cannot return CDs once you open them. Buy the CDS rather from a physical store, where you can actually return any failed merchandise."
0,Not What You Think It's little more like for throwing on the back of your seat to sit on rather then to curl up in. It barley works. It takes forever for it to heat up. I'm not really happy about this because I could have got a bigger one for cheaper at my local store and a better quality.
0,"Would not recommend the wide angle lens I have a Canon G9 and I would not recommend the wide angle lens in this kit since the corners of the photos are cropped. The cropping can be eliminated by zooming in, but to the point that the viewport is the about the same as the stock lens, thereby making the wide angle lens useless. I've found other reviews (after my purchase) claiming that the Canon wide angle lens does not have this problem.I called 47th Street Photo to send this back and they are going to charge a 15% restocking fee for a product that I feel is defective."
0,"Universal does not mean universal This item ordered from Amazon is advertised as (Adult Universal)rearm kit, but the CO2 cylinder thread does not fit my SoSpenders PFD and the cylinder can't be returned!!!!!*@#$"
0,"Word of warning! Aspect ratio shenanigans! Just a warning - if this is the same as the English release (and logic would dictate it is), then it has had the top and bottom chopped off to fill widescreen tvs. It was 4:3, so on a widescreen set there should be black space at the sides, or ""pillarboxing"".When will these people learn? Original. Aspect. Ratio!All that said, buy the SD DVDs instead. Thunderbirds is still one of the greatest sci-fi action shows ever! I can wait 'til they get their OAR blu-ray act together. When they do that, I'll buy it in a heartbeat. My dad loved Thunderbirds, I love it, and my boy loves it too. F.A.B.! O.A.R.!I know people will slag me off for writng this before it's out (the British version IS already out and people ARE already upset), but I think it's better that I write this before it's perpetrated on more unsuspecting customers. And besides, everyone thinks my reviews are snobby anyway...Repeat: If they restore the original aspect ratio, I'll buy it in a heartbeat!"
0,The worst movie ever made? Quite possibly the worst movie ever made. It's not funny. The plot is dumb. The acting is bad. Enough said.
0,"If this is good, then I hate to see what is bad This book is a poster child for the classic gibberish math book, replete with cloudy phrasing and examples that match the problems maybe 2/3 of the time, and fail you when you really need guidance. Very little plain English, but instead lots of conclusory assertions paired with rattling off of terms that might make the Math Club all giddy, but that leave you scratching your head at what the heck they just told you. Only when you do a few problems do you realize, oh, [point that could have been made much more clearly], is what they were saying! Truly, a horrible book, one that has inspired me to volunteer for my school district's textbook selection committee. One comment above made a particularly excellent point: this book tackles factoring relatively early. Factoring starts off easy, but the water gets deep quickly. This book is an anvil, not a life jacket."
0,"Out dated I purchased this book because a student is using it in his parochial school. The young teacher seems to be trying to teach with the instruments and style with which he was taught. I see much better recently updated textbooks. This reminded me of why students have questioned ""why do I have to learn this stuff anyway."" There is too much early emphasis on linguistic models and computationally trickery which actually suits later concepts. Other books I use have a more modern focus on functions and applications."
0,"One-dimensional disappointment I eagerly awaited this film as I missed the chance to see it in the theatres. I think I could have gone through the rest of my life content with never having seen this abominable film. I spent money that would have been more wisely invested in a lottery ticket!Besson tries to impress grandeur with a heavy hand and overblown performances from his cast. I felt badly that Faye Dunaway had anything to do with this piece of trash. John Malkovich, however, progressively chooses roles not really suited for his style of acting and he sticks out like an English lance in this movie. I don't know if perhaps the director incorrectly informed his actors if they were in a comedy or not, but man, avoid this like the plague! At least you have a choice - the victims of the plague never did."
0,"Get me out of her head. Visually, this movie is stunning. The performances are good, and it's a technical marvel.However, we spend far too much time in psychoanalysis of Joan. The director is trying to make it clear that Joan's motivations may not have been clear, even to herself, but should it take so long to drive that point home? GET ON WITH IT ALREADY.The humor in this film was oddly placed, and gave a surreal feeling. Whether that was intentional, I don't know - however it further served to detatch me from the subject."
0,Missed the Boat This movie is a WASTE of your time money mind and morals.If Mr Besson doesn't believe in GOD and therefore wanted to know why a young peasant girl would take up arms against the British than he would have to deal with FACTS: The part of France Joan was born in was NEVER attacked by the English but by the French Burgundians allied with them; her village was NEVER attacked by anybody and none of her sisters were murdered and raped (according to this flick in that order) so Mr Besson is not trying to figure out Joan but to trot out a sex and sleeze flick.And by the by the Catholic Church burned no body: according to the law at that time they could CONDEMN but they had to have the SECULAR arm do that. Nice if the audience were a little better informed that the makers of this shlock.
0,"Three Hours and Seven Dollars I'll Never Get Back... This was the absolute WORST movie I have ever seen. I actually warn people in the video store when I see them about to rent it. One guy rented it despite my warning and the next time I ran into him he said he wished he'd listened to me. WHO TOLD MILLA JOVOVICH SHE COULD ACT????????????Awful, awful movie."
0,Horrible... Oh my God!It's unbelievable how this movie could gain so much popularity.I think Luc Besson did not know anything about Joan of Arc.And Milla Jovovich shouldn't play this role.She couldn't expressed her (I mean Joan's of Arc) emotions.She was crying and shouting all the time.Nothing more.Besides she was too old to play 17 years old girl.Only one thing in this movie was impressive - batallistc scenes. I am very disappointed with this movie.I guess most of the people who know Joan's biography after watching this movie would feel the same as I do.
0,"A reason to revive the Inquistion. Where to start criticizing this movie? It fails so miserably on so many levels that it's difficult to know where to begin.It's obvious from watching this movie that the people who made it either didn't read the historical facts concerning Joan or did read them and simply chose to ignore them.Furthermore, you would never know Joan of Arc was a devout Catholic from seeing this movie. Aside from a few one sentence requests to see a priest, Joan's deep faith and spirituality are totally left out. Not that Milla Jovovich has that kind of range as an actress anyway but couldn't they have at least tried?Other than that I don't know what to say about a movie that seems to go out of its way to demonize a young girl who, by all contemporary accounts, was literally a living saint.It's just a terrible movie. Please don't waste your money."
0,"what a waste!!! Waste of time and energy. The main character is an $%#@#$$ing model trying acting and singing (you can't be all, pick one for goodness sake). Her acting abilities are questionable, why? Because I (and many people) have never heard of her. The whole movie is just really badly done. It's too violent for children yet too foolish at times for adults. Especialy a little scene at the begining when Joan is a little girl and she just had that vision with the sword and she comes back home just to see her mother (am not sure if it was her mother or not) killed with that same sword and then raped. The scene is disgusting in that even though it is a bloody and violent scene and the viewer is raging with disgust for the rapist the director decided to make it a ""fun"" scene by portraing the rapist as a fool and clown. Anyway I do not recommend it to any serious watchers of history. VERY BAD"
0,"I'd rather see the Swanson version THis movie was an insulting depiction of the visions of St. Joan of Arc. Looking through the eyes of a twentieth century thinker...the writer and director decided to throw out the idea of Joan and her divine visions and imply the idea that she was mad. The movie takes the Character of a powerful woman who entered a man's world and controled it with grace and strength...and turns her into a childish mad woman who seem to deserve her fate. NO, if you want to learn the Joan of Arc story then read a book. If you want to see a dramatic version of the story...rent the blackand white, or even better rent the Gloria Swanson silent film"
0,"Dissapointing Not very offen I throw negative comments on a film, but unfortunately this one doesn't deserve better. I really expected a better job from Luc Besson. While trying to be defiant and innovative, this film falls into historical incongruence. In order to sustain his picture of an eschizofrenic Joan Of Arc, Besson modifies or distorts historical facts and events already proven. For any person who knows and/or respects Joan Of Arc, or is looking to learn more about her, this is the last source they should look into. On another hand, the performances leave to much to desire, starting with Milla Jovovich, who overplays too offen. The only one who stood up to his name was Dustin Hoffman, a good actor in a bad role. To defy the common beliefs and standards in general, be it on Joan Of Arc or on any other subject, is always good, but only as long as such opinions are based on facts, something that Besson forgot in this movie."
0,"Don't buy! Unless you are a religious fanatics I am a French historian from Canada and I am telling you, the story was more religious non-sense then the real story of Jeanne d'Arc, in the movie the Dolphin future King of France would have to be nuts to believe her! The scenario is bad, monotonous, boring! So unless your name is Pat Robertson and Pat Buchanan or if are a priest. Don't buy that ......"
0,"Worst movie I have ever seen I didn't like this movie at all... and not just because it was so historically inacurrate. I found the acting to be atrocious.. and when Dustin Hoffman did his big ""vision scene"" at the end all I could think was ""sword in a field.. definitely a sword in a field"" (picture a ""Rainman"" type voice here) the only one who had any talent whatsoever was the little girl playing young Joan.As far as historical accuracy, the only thing that had any semblance to fact was Joan always going to confession. The visions weren't correct, the characters were so poorly conceived they were comical.Bottom line, if you know nothing about Joan of Arc and would like to learn more, don't watch this movie. If you want to see this character portrayed in a realistic manner and very close to what we know about her historically, don't watch this movie. If you have any kind of knowledge of this aspect of french history you will be disappointed. You're better off renting the CBS miniseries."
0,Joan ???.... Got to say the video quality was good for a old movie but however I was quite disappointed with the general story line.... a resonable cast but story line was too week ... nothing much but a crazy women going to war.......sad story not a blue ray worth keeping wont be watching it again ......a pity....
0,"Wrong Message What a waste of resources...This biopic is completely by-the-book, telling the story in an academic, uninspired, predictable way. The characters are all cardboard, and lead Milla Jovovich is over-the-top and not credible as Joan of Arc. This movie has no spark or life whatsoever, moving at a snail`s pace and failing to engage. The settings and costumes are decent, but that`s all there is to find here.Director Luc Besson also made the useless ""The Fifth Element"", and the style-over-substance perspective of that movie is present here, too. This is just a bunch of random fight sequences and melodramatic moments that go nowhere and generate a messy cinematic experience. A lackluster movie and one to avoid."
0,"Major FAIL I had to stop after 15 min when the gum chewing mediaeval girls started saying ""YO! DUDE! FER SHURE~! DIG IT!being somewhat facetious but thats how it was"
0,"Worst movie I've ever seen! If it wasnt for the fact that I knew that Joan was gonna be burnt at the stake I wouldnt have made it through the movie! Well....thats not true, IOnce I start ANY movie, I cant stop watching till its over. Anyways, the acting in this movie was horrible, Joans character was so un-charismatic that I would have a hrad time believing that an Army of women would follow her to the mall, yet alone an army of men following her into battle!"
0,"Why isn't there a 0 stars? This is quite possibly one of the worst films ever conceived. Not just made, but conceived. Milla Jovovich can't act her way out of a wet paper bag. I thought The Fifth Element illustrated that. The following people wasted their time and talent on this project: Dustin Hoffman, John Malcovich, TchÃ©ky Karyo, Faye Dunaway. The insane in your face cinematography and the disturbing screaming and gestures of Jovovich's are just awful. Why does Bravo: The Film and Arts Network include this in their 5-Star Cinema series? It's fertilizer."
0,"Miscast This movie was 100% perfect, except Faye Dunaway should have caked some make-up on and played Joan of Arc herself. She has limitless talents and would have brought the movie what is was missing--a truly spiritual heroine. I'm telling you, Faye Dunaway was born to play this part. One can only hope of a re-make, and soon!"
0,"Shame on you, Luc! 8 out of 10 for technos; 3 out of 10 for drama; 1 out of 10 for history. Besson's Joan is a raving vengeful femme and bears no resemblance to the real Joan of Arc, so well documented by dozens of scholars. Don't for one minute be fooled by his revisionist Joan; the real woman was a real star and a saint. I was left with a feeling of anger, as if a fraud had been perpetrated, because Besson's Joan simply cannot have achieved the heroism that the real Joan so patently did. Her trial and life are among the most well-documented of any historical figure, and Besson's Joan disavows or ignores what the best scholarship has long established. A modernist gothic horror it might be, but it's cheap cinema (because this Joan is just not credible) and even cheaper fiction. Don't infect your children with this a-history."
0,"Unwatchable Travesty For the easily pleased, simple-minded, less discriminating viewers only. John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman couldn't even save this one. I even think their characters dragged this story down, but there was so little hope and promise from the moment this movie was conceived. Mila what's her name was so thoroughly annoying and unconvincing throughout this mess I just wanted to fast forward to the end to see her burn. At least it has a happy ending. The best thing I can say about this movie is it took pathetic and lame to new heights."
0,"Horrible Movie I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in a movie. This was historically inaccurate beyond belief. It almost seemed like it was making Joan out to be the villain. If you want to see a good movie on Joan Of Arc, see the ""Joan Of Arc"" movie that was on TV."
0,"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc Well as a student of History, this movie is to say the least, pittiful. The acting is so bad some of the fighting sequences are laughable. The young women who plays Joan, should go back to acting school, she only seems to have two levels crazy, and crazy screaming. The only good thing about the film were the sets and costumes."
0,"Poor Service and Follow Through Can you give less than one star?After ordering the hat, I got an email from Star Struck stating that they were ""sold out"" and made an error.They continued, ""If you find it in your heart to forgive this blunder and allow us another chance to delight you, we would like to extend the coupon below in appreciation of your loyalty and trust...

0,"COUNTRY ""AIN'T LIKE THAT"" Excuse me, but I don't think that ""Hank done it this way""!!!! This album has way too many POP tunes on it! What's wrong with COUNTRY is that people like Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes, JoDee Messina, and Faith are taking the country out of country music!!!!!! I don't think that Reba McEntire (God bless her soul) would ever have been dumb enought to release a COOKIE-CUTTER song like ""THIS KISS""!!!!!! I won't say that every song is disgusting. Hell, I actually like ""LET ME LET GO""!!!! But, people, IT'S NOT A COUNTRY SONG!!!!! WE DON'T NEED 'DVIA'S' IN COUNTRY MUSIC!!!!! PLEASE, STOP BUYING TRASH!!!! IF YOU WANT A COUNTRY ALBUM, PICK UP STEVE WARINER or 'KING' GEORGE STRAIT!!!!!!!! I think that Faith should hang up her invisible Stetson, and stop bringing her new POP-DVIA sound into Tim McGraw's music!!!!"
0,"This is a one hit CD. Very disappointed in this CD. Only one good song (""This Kiss""). Her voice is weak and doesn't have any range. On some of the songs she sounds like she's not even singing in the right key. For REALLY great singers I'll stay with Wynonna, and Shania. What a difference - to listen to one of them after listing to Faith."
0,Poor Quality and poor Customer Service from CAP I recently purchased a 300 lb. Olypic set from a local retailer (not Amazon). Several of the plates would not fit the barbell due to excessive cast material. I contacted CAP and sent pictures. After an initial e-mail acknowledging that I had lodged a complaint I have heard nothing further and in the mean time I have several plates I can't use unless I grind the excess myself. My set has a baked on enamel finish and this would require removing the paint. Next time I'll buy YORK.
0,"Not very easy to read Although meant to be an introduction to Relativity, this book is hard to read right from the start. The formalism used throughout the entire book makes it hard for you to gain the courage to try to master Relativity in a technical depth.It lacks a light introduction to the basic concepts of Relativity (without math), to use as the foundation from which to build the rest of the book. Not the best way for someone to start on Relativity..."
0,"A stinker I like James Clavell. I liked ""King Rat"" very much, and later I enjoyed both ""Shogun"" and ""Tai-Pan"". So why did I find this book so dull, so boring, in fact, that I didn't finish it? The characters are uninteresting, the events trivial, the politics weird. The book's understanding of business and business practice is naive. Really, it could have been ghost-written by Harold Robbins. And the depictions of modern Chinese are not quaint and amusing, as in the distant world of ""Tai-Pan"", but racist."
0,"Monumentally slow and tedious I found the characters amusing for a while, but after it just slowly grinds on and on for page after page I started to just wish they would die.I can't believe this relatively simple story takes so long to tell. Worse than that it is padded with repetition, so it isn't a huge painting with a small and interesting subject, it's a lot of nothing much with some minor relief to the boredom.And then in five minutes it's all sorted out. The main character does the obvious thing, which would probably make anyone else a pariah. Everything before and after those five minutes hardly matters. Even the disasters don't really matter to the story. Though they do matter to the characters."
0,Never got the book and it's been a month... I ordered this book for a friend's son's birthday. I have tried to find out why they haven't gotten it and they say it is still in transit... I can't get a straight answer from anybody.
0,"WHOOPI GOLDBERG AS A BIGOT! The Whoopi Goldburg charter is disturbing to say the least. She wants nothing to do with Albert (Haley Joel Osment the little boy from THE SIXTH SENCE) because the kid is white. Turn it around for a moment, what would we say about a white woman who with holds love from a black kid because of the color of his skin? Are we suppose to think that Osment is responsible for the slave trade of one hundred fifty years ago?The poor kid is dangling from a fire escape his life in danger. Any fan of THE SIXTH SENSE would rush out to save him in no time flat but not Goldburg. All she does is call out encouragement to him.I kept hoping someone from Child Protective Services would show up to take poor Osment away from Goldburg but no such luck. I think the kid deserved much better!"
0,"Great movie, but bad DVD If only this movie came on a normal Region coding i could watch it on my DVD player and not my laptop. This is one of Mamets great films only second to ""Sparten.""

0,"Annyoying 5 year olds movie. This is the typical American family movie that I love to hate. The Little family walked around wearing big cheesy grins, to a point where I wanted to punch the smiles off with my fist. Stuart is WAY too cute for my liking. The only time I was amused was when Stuart got stuck in the washing machine (unfortunatley, Mrs. Little got him out).Thank goodness this movie only went for an hour and a half.

I wanted something hip and current (like most teens want), but that book really wasnt that at all."

0,"Not too good for my tastes I am currently using this item for my introductory Emglish Literature I course. For Beowulf, they spelled Wealtheow and Edgetheow wrong. And look at the Canterbury Tales, they only have the modern English text for the general prologue, where is the modern english text for the miller's tale, wife of bath's tale, pardoner's tale, nun priest's tale, and the parson's tale? The text in the Canterbury Tales is a little harder to understand without the Modern English translation. Even through this textbook has 624 pages, as soon as I finish my English Literature I course, I am going to sell the text because there are too many mistakes on it and I might plan to buy the Norton version instead with the money, it looks better anyway and it has higher ratings than this text."
0,"How about a revision, Mr. Lakein? I found this book to be very outdated, especially in reference to women. The modern household and the roles of women in the workplace have changed dramatically in the decades since Lakein wrote this book. The men in my class LOVED the book, but we women found it to be irrelevant and, quite frankly, patronizing to women. To follow his extensive steps consistently in prioritizing life's responsibilities would take more time than actually DOING those things. Ladies, there has to be a better, more timely volume of advice out there for us on this subject. Mr. Lakein, I believe it's time for a revision."
0,"Another boilerplate piece of corporate denialism More raw meat for the dopes, as the genuflecting huzzahs from the troops above demonstrate.The only good thing about it is it combines in one volume nearly all the salient features of a right-wing corporate handout.It starts off with a lie - that the CMPA is nonpartisan - it's yet another in the stable of Olin/Scaiffe/Bradley funded ""think-tanks"" used to attack science, regulation, and public health.One chapter uses cherry-picking, all of them use weasel words, and most use debauched and invalid statistics.Meanwhile, it tromps heavily on the themes Thomas Frank mentioned in What's the Matter with Kansas - an appeal to you, the common man right-wing crank who's just as good as any pinko academic scientist any day!Oh. It hasn't aged very well, has it?"
0,"Not worth buying Get something else. This is a USB 1.1, not USB 2.0. So, it does not work well with, say, a USB 2.0 flash drive. And, it may not work at all with a USB 2.0 flash drive. Normally, I could plug my USB 2.0 flash drive into a USB 1.1 port and use it, even though I get an initial alert saying a detected device will perform better on a USB 2.0 port. However, a PNY USB 2.0 flash drive I own would not work at all with this USB hub. I can plug the flash drive directly into the same USB port on the computer and use it but it will not work with this hub.The cable on this hub is only about 18 inches long, so you'll probably need to use an extension cable if you want to connect it to the back of a tower PC sitting on the floor."
0,"Run for your life I am currently in the 6th week of my Java class, and I still don't know the difference between a class and an object. This book is a waste of space. Nothing seems to be in the right place nothing is explained well at all. Its so bad that even with some other in my class to explain the concept of Java to me I still am not anywhere near where I should be. AVOID THIS BOOK WITH ALL POSSIBLE MEANS."
0,"A horrible textbook! This text is a nightmare. Terms are poorly defined, if defined at all, and examples are few and far between. The illustrations are laughable. I've seen better graphics in nursery books written 30 years ago. If your professor assigns this text, and you're new to Java, be prepared to shell out more bucks for better sources or cruise the Internet to get the answers you need. This book won't provide them."

0,"An all around bad book As a computer science major, I used this book in an introductory programming course. I already had a fair bit of programming experience, although this was my first actual class. This book taught me nothing new about general programming concepts. Such topics are covered equally well or better in dozens of other computer science books (less expensive ones, I might add).However, I was new to Java, so I had hoped that this book would teach it to me. I was disappointed. The book uses its own package of classes which teach the student nothing of real Java. After using this book, I found that I had to start all over again when I wanted to learn Java, and it took me several months to unlearn the material in this book. If you want to learn programming concepts, learn real Java, and save money, then look elsewhere. I would recommend some of the Java titles published by O'Reilly or Sun."

0,"OUCH! First of all I must agree that these are the best fitting sheets you may ever find in your life. BUT, unless you love sleeping on the beach with nothing between you and clumpy, gritty sand, don't buy them. After several washings the fabric is truly so rough that it hurts. There is a fatal flaw- the fabric- and the manufacturer must change it if it wants repeat customers. Summary: fit is fantastic, sheets are terrible. Don't buy them."

0,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD... If you're a Bob Hope fan, this movie rates at least 4 stars. Bob Hope was on the top of his game in the 1940's, and this is one of his best. Unfortunately, the movie is practically unwatchable due to one of the worst transfers to disc that you will ever find. The sound and picture quality are bad beyond my ability to describe. Maybe someday they'll get this one right, but stay away from this edition."
0,"Keep waiting for a better transfer! I love this movie. Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour, Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney Jr... what more could you ask for! The version I watched 20 years ago on the late, late show was miles better than this horrible transfer. Since this movie (incredibly) got forgotten by the copyright office and ended up in the Public Domain, all you can find are cheap, HORRIBLE tansfers to DVD's like this god-awful loser. It's better you never even watch this film than to see it in this terribe representation. Why Hollywood wouldn't want to protect gems like these is beyond me, but since they don't give a flying leotard, don't you. This grainy, blurry, audibly incomprehensible, hardly watchable transfer is a complete loser. Don't waste your money. Keep waiting for the ""restored version"" which hopefully comes out before 2021.

0,"Great book poorly read. While Night Watch is one of the best of the Terry Pratchett novels, this reading of the book is completely disappointing. Although I have read the book with enjoyment many times I can barely tolerate the audio version. The reader's voices and manners are deep and serious with a downturn to their phrasing which is in total contrast to the tone of the book. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the timing of the changes between readers, attempts at british accents are weak and erratic, and the brilliantly written unique characters have no distinction as read. This is especially disappointing because of the excellence of Terry Pratchett novels read by Nigel Planer. I regret purchasing this item."
0,"Perfect for the narcissistic woman's needs For the last five years I've been well acquainted with a middle aged couple, where the wife has read, and been determined to put into practice all of the suggestions in this horrible book. The husband is a very kind hearted person, who has always been one to pull his own weight, with the children, household chores, shopping, etc. But, no, that wasn't enough for her. The wife runs her own business, and has decided that he needs to buck up and do more. While she sits on the phone with her clients, he has to jerk around his own office schedule to meet her needs. I have seen him go from a pleasant, smiling person to a sad, exhausted, numbed robot. His wife has zero empathy for his needs, or those of anyone else, for that matter. But this book will probably sell well, as our society becomes more and more narcissistic. Sad."
0,The worst design of a phone I got this phone thinking that the name brand would stand for quality but it completely did not. The replacement cost me lots of shipping cost and did not even been to work. My advice it see this model do not buy unless you like pain and suffering with big cost for a truly inferior product. Clearly IBM does not care about their customer base. Their service after the sale is extremely bad. Their design on this phone was so poor that the phone only almost worked for 1 day.

0,"What has happened to changeling? Another inferior product for changeling from white wolf, this one is supposed to be a guide to the ""war of concordia"" but all it contains are the reactions of the kith and assorted houses, a few new art's,weapons,and treasures. It never really states how changelings make war in the 20th century. Things like tactics, what happen's when ordinary people happen across the rather large battle's are all glossed over if they are mentioned at all. One thing I have held that was unbeleiveable about the world of darkness is how people could remain ignorant about the vampires, changelings, wraiths, werefish ,ect around them when there are constantly large to small scale conflicts going on all around them. This book has no information on that or on the war in concordia in any meaningful way so I can't recomend it."

I was greatly disappointed in this copy as it is badly butchered. Not only was it cut down with many segments chopped or eliminated, the editing was a horrible job. It's as though a 5 year old with scissors was turned loose. There are cuts in the middle of scenes, one even in the middle of a conversation. Portions were removed such that some of the subsequent story made no sense, or did not portray the same message as would have come across if the film had been left in its original length.PS if anyone knows of a full length copy out there I'd love to hear about it."

0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court I thought that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court By Mark Twain touched a lot of important aspects that our culture and society faces today while also satirized the times of Camelot. It also contrasted and showed the differences between the medieval times and the nineteenth century.But unfortunately I found this book hard to follow and had trouble getting into it. I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me, but others might find it interesting.But I do have a lot of respect for Twain for writing this. I'm sure that this book caused a lot of controversy since he wrote about a lot of sensitive topics, especially earlier in his time."

The previous review has to have been written by someone closely related to the book.I was a teen-ager during the '80s Ninja Craze and even then, this book would have been seen as a complete joke. I think I was expecting a Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon to turn up somewhere in the book, but was disappointed to not see one.Bottom-line - Stay away from this book. If you are really interested in something about ninja, look into Stephen K. Hayes."
0,BUYER BEWARE I bought this Toshiba DVD Player (3750) seven months ago and now it will not turn on. Of course this is conveniant for Toshiba since it has a 3-month labor warranty and 1-year parts warranty. The local authorized repair shop says labor will cost ... (adds up to the cost of a new dvd-player). So this TOSHIBA dvd player will be going straight to the TRASH and I hope to find a different brand dvd player with a longer warranty.Until then I will suffer with my VCR.P.S. This dvd player had a great picture and sound until it broke.
0,"Toshiba: ignorant and slow I have to agree with the other reviewer. This supposedly forthcoming model isn't even listed on the Toshiba Web site. Furthermore, the SD 4700 JUST APPEARED. This model was announced almost a year ago, and still isn't available. First it was due in June, then July, and I still challenge you to find a dealer that actually has it.It's too bad that Toshiba is failing so pitifully in bringing these seemingly good products to market. These players do supposedly have the essential features: CD-R playback, progressive scan, DVD-Audio, and all the necessary outputs. And the prices are good. But that's irrelevant when you can't buy the products."
0,"Hard to use I would not recommend this phrase book because I found it very hard to access the phrases. It is organized by situations where you would use the phrases, such as counting, traveling, eating, and sleeping. It requires too much skimming and scanning to find what you want to say."
0,Idiosyncratic Book Just returned from Madagascar where French is commonly used. I speak some French but I wanted a small dictionary and phrase book. This book is certainly small but over half of the simplest words I looked up were not there whereas obscure words were. Buy a small pocket dictionary instead. It will be far more useful than this idiosyncratic book.

0,"Not good or helpful for those with semi-decent scores This book might help you if you started with an 800 on the SAT, but I started in the 1200-1300 range and found that the Joe Bloggs method and the other innane tricks taught by the Princeton Review are not particularly helpful. Even their vocabulary list is somewhat simplistic. Honestly, this book probably raised my score no more than 20 points. A waste of money and time.The practice tests are also not like the actual SATs. If you want to learn about how actual SATs are, don't expect to find the answers in the back of this book. If you are already scoring high, you should buy 10 Real SATs and maybe get a personal tutor if you can afford one. Good luck!"

0,Doesn't Work Properly..... Purchased this recently - works fine for my Smart Media card - but can't read or write to my 128MB Memory Stick. Still waiting for a response from Dazzle Support (4 days after submitting query). Will wait a few more days before returning the item.Overall - quite disappointed - had the potential to be a very useful product!
0,"Piece of junk, stay away This item had lots of promise, but it falls completely flat.I purchased the item, followed the instructions to install it, after I restarted my windows 2000 system twice, it didn't work. It kept resetting my powered USB hub.Turns out, this device does *NOT* adhere to the USB specs ... and does not work if plugged into a USB hub.I called thier tech support people, and was told that they only support a configuration where the devices is plugged directly into the USB port of the computer, no hubs.Unforunately, for me, that's not an option ... the USB on my system is way in the back and I don't want to be reaching back there to swap USB devices around."
0,Horton Hatches the Egg I was very disappointed when I received this book in the mail. It said it was in good shape but when I got the book there were stickers all over the front of the book. I was able to take the stickers off but was still disappointed it said nothing about them being on there when I ordered the book.
0,"Worst book from Whitman ever The black and white photo's look like photocopies of photocopies.And to add insult to everyone, the book is printed in CHINA...Whitman has sunk to a new low on this one.Buy any other book other than this one if you really want to use it.The poorest book that Whitman has ever offered, lets hope it's not theirstandard for the future."
0,"Review of book. It was poor at best. It was all black and white, no color. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
0,Not received The seller misplaced my books. Could it be they offered it too cheaply or just poor record keeping?
0,"Broke, will have to be returned Did not have good luck with this unit; after only a couple of uses on car trips with kids, screen went blank, could not get picture back. Hooked up to TV for a few days, then it started skipping and freezing up. Got as a christmas gift, so now we have to figure out how to return it for a refund. Would not recommend to others."
0,"Great while it lasted !! We purchased this unit for Christmas of 2002. In July 2003 the player quit entirely...disc would spin but the screen was flat gray. No picture. Called Audiovox, they had no idea what the problem was and said to ship it back. Spent $10 to return via ups. They could not repair so sent a replacement. The 2nd one worked until January of 2004, then quit also. This time I was told that because the 1 year warranty had expired (from the date of purchase-not the date of replacement) I was out of luck. I could send it back for repairs at my expense. Fortunately I had the foresight to have purchased it on American Express which automatically doubles a warranty up to one year. Amex is going to refund my money so that I can purchase a new unit. The next one will definitely NOT BE AN AUDIOVOX!!"
0,Please avoid this Unit! I bought this Portable DVD player at Super Target on sale and when I got it home it played very well and had a nice picture until I tried to watch a complete movie on it. It seemed like it got really hot about halfway through the movie and when I tried to adjust the brightness of the screen it was unresponsive. Then the movie froze and totally locked up so I had to unplug the unit and replug it back in to get it to work.I took it back to Target the next day and got my money back. Target gave me a little hassle about paying a restocking fee but I talked them out of it. If it locks up the first time you use it what's going to happen a year from now? Buyer beware!
0,waste of money Audiovox should be ashamed of selling a product this unreliable. I think it worked for the first month and then completely went downhill. One out of twenty DVD's (maybe) will work in it and it's practically brand new. I'm super (mad) at this waste of money!!
0,"2nd Unit Didn't Work Either ...I found that it played maybe 1 out of every 3 dics I put in it, and even the 1 it would play it would sometimes freeze up or slow down. Well, I thought that every assembly line is entitled to one lemon, so I returned it to Amazon. Well the 2nd one has been no better. The first couple of discs did play (one with a couple of slow downs), so that lulled me into a false sense of security. Since then, no disc I have put into the unit has played. Tonight I put a brand new disc of the ""Great Escape"" into the unit 26 times and it did not play once.I'm 43 years old and this is without a doubt the single worst consumer product I have ever purchased. As I said above, I'll give every manufacturer one bad product, but not two. And to top it off, I waited too long to really test this 2nd unit out and Amazon won't let me return it. This is the biggest piece of [junk] I've ever purchased."
0,"this product is a bad investmest I bought this dvd player in the beginning of November this year. I got to play about 2 dvds before I startede seeing trouble with it playing movies. Then around the beginning of December, it stopped working. It just loads up and says invalid entry. Now I'm stuck with a broke dvd player and I cant return it because I bought it at a Target across the country."
0,"Skips Repeatedly This unit was a waste of money. After 2 days, it began skipping and would occasionally even freeze totally. The remote control didn't work properly, even within inches of the unit. The included ear-bud headphones only produced sound on one side. Made in Taiwan.... Better go for the Japanese players."
0,"Buyer beware After a single day's use the DC adapter quit working. In order to get the necessary replacement, the warranty requires that you mail the entire unit back to Audiovox.This is a hassle that I did not anticipate having to deal with the day after receiving the player in the mail.Thanks for nothing Audiovox."
0,"NOT Worth the Aggravation! The product was a good price so we purchased it as an intro to portable DVD players. Not worth the aggravation! Has a terrific picture. Easy to operate. Sound/Volume is definitely too low for some situations. BUT this player gets hot way to quickly! We have placed it in well ventilated areas, raised it, kept the lid open when playing it thru the television -- ALL to keep it cool. Not long after purchasing this, it started to malfunction - freeze up - misqueue dialogue, skip. Then very soon after it simply wouldn't play most DVD's. Discs would spin intermittenly while attempting to load - never loading - no way would movies play. Then a few days later, it might work for a full movie or part of a movie. Then nothing. Exchanged it for another. EXACT same problems. It a shame. It had a great picture the few times it operated properly. DO NOT BUY!"
0,"Poor sizing The sizing is seriously off on this item. I am on the small side of a 36D and prefer minimizer bras. Although I always wearing bras on the tightest hook, on even on the loosest hook, this bra was too tight. The D cup fit like a B cup."
0,"Caveat Emptor II (another buy at your own risk) I have had this keyboard for 4 months. I never did like the mouse so I didn't use it other than to verify its function. It worked, but lacked 100% every time precision that a cable-connected mouse has. The keyboard however, worked like a champ for about 3 months. Then for the last several weeks of its life I would have to re-initialize the transmitter/receiver. It would work fine for a day or two, then I would have to re-init again. Then finally it stopped even re-initializing. I did the normal troubleshooting, checked the batteries, connections, interference from other devices that transmit, etc. I believe it has bought the farm."

0,"pleeeezz charleeeezz One has to wonder how a film so bad can be made with so many fine things about it. I see from other reviews that the really horrible actor Stewart Townsend is Charlize Theron's boyfriend. She won an Academy Award so she got to demand his inclusion probably. He cannot act and he utterly cannot imagine what it would be like to be the man he plays in this movie. He has sex with the Charleezz character often. That he knows how to do. And Charlize probably ignored direction because her acting is utterly unaffecting. The beautiful wonderful Penelope Cruz is underused. No gorgeous closeups of her gorgeous face and she dies early. Is this the fault a dumb director/writer, John Dagan? The cinamentography is lovely. The costumes are fine. The story is ok as well. Its just shown in a way that is as boring as it can be and we probably have Charlizzzzz to thank for that for dragging in her idiot boyfriend and rejecting direction. Come to think of it, I havent seen much by her lately."
0,"head in the crapper The people are pretty, the settings are pretty. The entire first half of the film is devoted to gratuitious sex -- gratuitous because there's no chemistry between the lovers OR between them and the audience. Why would hedonistic Gilda fall for an intellectual cypher like Guy? Why wouldn't he be infatuated with the sex, thinking he was in love with her? I WANTED the erotic scenes to move me; they didn't. G&G move in together, life is boring. Mia moves in, life gets giggly. War approaches, Guy and Mia are suddenly impassioned by it rather than Gilda, who pouts. Yaddayaddayadda. No suspense, no depth of character, blahblahblah. I think the fault lies mostly with really poor directing and editing. Can't believe Theron performed like a such ham after her previous roles. Penelope tried and failed to overcome the script. Probably a 17-year-old would think the story everything that it isn't -- exciting, romantic, sexy, deep....."

0,Do not buy this! I saw this on amazon and decided to get it for my dad for Christmas. Big mistake! It broke right away and takes 5 minutes of shaking for about 5 seconds of light. I'm not kidding! I read the reviews but I thought my dad would really like it so bought it anyway. Trust me: Do not buy this! You will regret it.
0,Crap This was a complete waste of money. It does not hold a charge for more than a couple of seconds.

0,poor quality Item is very heavy and does not hold a charge well. illumination begns to dim almost immediately and is never very bright. I would not purchase this item again.
0,"THIS IS A SCAM I am an electrical engineering student and I bought this to study the coil generator for a project I am doing. It turns out this is not a shake flashlight at all, and is powered by little batteries. The ""magnet"" is actually just a piece of non-magnetic metal. The ""coil"" is just gold colored paper. If you don't believe me, just screw off the top and look inside. You don't need to know a thing about electrical engineering to see that there are no wires going from the coil, or that it's made out of paper. This is a complete scam from china. Avoid at all costs."
0,"Shake flaslite In my clear opinion, this product is not worthed at all for any amount of money unless if you plan to spend more time shaking the flash light than using it..even after that the illumination is very short lasting and minimal. Buy Garrity 3 led flash light. It is worthed for the money."
0,"This Item is a Fraud As noted in another review, this is not in fact a hand-powered flashlight. The 'coil' is a piece of foil and the 'magnet' is a piece of lead. The flashlight is actually powered by batteries. Save your money."

I took it out and tried it in my other player, same thing. I then took it to my daughter's home and tried it there, same thing. I need to return it, but I have to go somewhere else and use someone's computer to do this. When I tried to do this from my home, the site said ""printer required"" and mine is not working. I bought several other movies and they all were good, so I am not unhappy with your service. I just hope the return goes well. I have several other purchases waiting in my cart that I will not buy until I see how this is resolved. Thank you."
0,was i so wrong I though the LA basketball wives might be a bit better but i was wrong. This is even worse than the other ones the women act like they are gods gift but they are just a waist of space so do not waist your money on this one. They should call it the Basketball's Trashy wives.
0,"Poorly designed This phone is so poorly designed that I returned it after 1 month. The primary issues are ...(1) You always have to press the ""Talk"" button 3 times (not once) in order to get a dial tone.(2) When a voice message is waiting, the phone beeps loudly every 30 seconds. Very annoying when you let the phone take a message because you are preoccupied or have company visiting.(3) If you have the base wallmounted, the handset does not rest securely in the base -- Half the time it falls off when you set it down."
0,"Don't buy this phone! This phone is c**p. It is outsourced to some company and bears the IBM logo, but the quality is low (like a lot of things manufactured in China). My battery died after 5 months and I cannot find a replacement. I talked to the company that manufactures this phone and they promissed me a replacement but I did not get it yet.The headset works only in one position. If the microwave is working in our house, I am getting static. Sometimes you would have to press a couple of times on the Talk button to get a tone.SKIP IT!"
0,"worthless phone Speakerphone part works alright. If you get the handset to work you have to be right on top of the base unit, sometimes even then it will not work. The phone hangs up on you when trying to connect. You have to push the talk button four or five times just to try to get a line out. If a connection is made it is full of static. My rating would be a Negative 10 if they had that type of rating. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!"
0,"Worthless and Useless Purchasing this telephone was a HUGE mistake. The battery died after six months and looking for a replacement battery is like trying to locate a needle in a haystack! When my microwave is in use; the telephone can't be in use - what's the connection? There is none! When a message is left, the telephone continues to beep every minute until the message is checked. The only purpose for this telephone: batting practice! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME - THIS TELEPHONE ISN'T WORTH IT!!"
0,Where is Voyager? Although I have enjoyed Carey's past Trek novels I found this one to be a bit dull. Voyager's strength is in its' ensemble cast. Writing an entire book around one character (Janeway) with no interaction with other crew members is a mistake. And why give so much attention to aliens? I thought a requirement for Trek novel publication was to adhere to Trek characters...not base an entire story on non Trek characters. If I buy a Star Trek book I want to read a story with STAR TREK CHARACTERS. Are you reading this Pocket Books?????
0,"Low Quality Packing tape I pack and ship items on a daily basis. I bought this tape to seal my packages. It was cheap (so yay for price), but extremely low quality. It will not adequately seal a cardboard mailer without many layers. Even then, I worry that the package will open in transit.Lesson learned. Next time I will pay more for a higher quality product."
0,"Volume too Low I bought this product to put in my work truck. I was having issues of hearing my cell phone with volume. I was not able to clearly hear the phone, music, or GPS. I saw this item on amazon. It was exactly what I needed. I was small and compact with plenty of power. I was so excited when it arrived. What I got was a big and bulky speaker. No problem. I can adapt. I can still mount it in my work truck. I did just that. I put it next to my head rest. Now the moment of truth. I turned the phone all the way up. I plugged in the speaker. What a disappointment. I found no difference in the volume. This wonderful speaker made no difference in the amount of volume. In fact I'm not sure if the phone speaker was not louder. I disconnected the speaker and threw it into my shop. What a piece of poop!"

0,"Died Quickly It quit working completely after a couple months. Of course this was after the warranty ran up. It was used very little if at all during those months. Must have been defective, but what can I do now except buy another one, which i won't."
0,Hard to Program This product has the most difficult programming instructions I have ever seen. Even changing the clock time (which you have to do 2X per year) proves to be a major challenge requiring the manual. The manual also must have been translated from Chinese as it is also difficult to understand...even for someone like myself with a technical degree! I tossed the product out after 6 months.

And speaking of the guy - what happened to Buddy Guy and Bo Diddley? I guess Phil Chess took care of them. I would have liked to see some complete performances, especially of Muddy Waters. There are too many musicians represented here that deserve a movie of their own. How can so many movies be made this way. They know the facts, but refuse to make it right. What bothers me is that someone makes a conscious effort to do so.I like the music, but I'm not grading the music, I'm grading the storyline - 1 star."

0,"Works Great!!! For about 2 months. I installed this wireless network adapter on my desktop (windows xp). It worked very well for two months, then just unexpectedly died. I would try to reinstall it several times off the product CD, each time telling me a different file was missing, even though the files appeared to be installed (at least I could see them in on my hard drive). Downloaded the drivers from the Belkin website, but that also failed to get this thing to work. This adaper would be recognized by XP, detect the network signal, but it would always tell me ""connection failed"". Spend your money on a more robust wireless adapter."
0,Unstable causes sytem to crash in Mac OS 9 and 10 This product is a rip-off. It causes your system to be unstable and crash. I tried it using Mac OS 9.2.2 and 10.2.8.
0,"WinXP + WEP == Choose ANY other product than this one. First, the drivers packaged with this unit DID NOT WORK. Had to go to belkin.com and download the latest drivers (not the simplest thing to do without a functioning network adapter, eh?). While those drivers sort-of work, they are still extremely flaky. Not signed/certified by microsoft.I use WEP to secure my network... this device does not retain the WEP key/settings after a reboot. So, every single time you reboot, you have to re-enter the WEP key and manually start the driver utility.Signal is very weak - if the signal is lost for too long then the system will eventually hang and reboot itself.I've been a computer professional for the better part of 10 years now and I'm convinced that ANY product would be better than this Belkin POS. Avoid this product at any price."
0,"Unreliable This piece of equipment has worked very poorly for us. It works seamlessly for days and even weeks and then suddenly will not work at all. There is no change in the environment that we are aware of, yet a good signal one day is just an impossible signal the next. It begins working again sometimes when we unplug and replug it, sometimes when we relocate the receiver, etc. It is the computer equivalent of hanging aluminum foil off your TV antennae. My husband is a computer professional but this does not have any user accessible parts so when it doesn't want to work, we are just at it's mercy. I wish we hadn't bought it."
0,"Defective product I bought two adapters from a third party site on Amazon. One of them was defective. I tried calling Belkin and after talking to 4 people the problem wasn't solved.The last one asked me to download some software ferom belkin before they could replace it. I called them back when it didn't work, only to be told that, "" They didn't have the power to order a replacement and I would have to wait for someone to call me back.The WORST customer service I have ever come across. I will never buy a belkin product again."
0,"This product is the worst networking device I have ever seen I have been working with networks since 1994 and have not seen a worse network card in my life. It was a pain in the rear to get working with windows 98 and had to actually install windows 98 SE. There was nothing on any website, or in the documentation that stated this. Finally tech support told us it didn't work. Then on a brand new pc with XP we can't get the thing running either.It usually takes me 15 minutes to install a network card.This company lied about their product and it should be recalled."
0,"Doesn't work for ME or XP Like you, i'm trying to set up a wireless network; i'd like to connect my old computer (running Windows ME) to my newer desktop running XP. I bought this device at Staples b/c of its price and because it clearly stated it supported XP and ME. Well the drivers were no good for WinME, even the newest drivers from their website would not install correctly. So it was a dead appendage. Their tech support suggested I try it on a third computer we have, it runs XP. Well it installed fine, but could not link to my network (Netgear router), even after tweaking the router settings. He said he was getting a lot of calls with the exact same problem and suggested I return it and try another device. If possible I'm going to get a refund and buy a little better one - maybe a PCI wireless adapter, instead of the bottom of the barrel cheapo which is my wont. When will I learn? Learn from my mistakes folks and move along - nothing to see here."
0,"Does not work with XP After spending several weekends installing & re-installing this product on my XP Pro box, to use with its sister product (Belkin F5D6130 AP), I GAVE UP. Included CD was flakey -- so, got new driver from Belkin website. Installed & worked -- until I rebooted, then XP froze up. Had to disable an XP service (SSDP Discovery). After reboot, USB device is recognized, but offline, and cannot bring online. I have extensive experience with networking (20 years). Tech support was of no help. Could be an XP problem, but note: Belkin Driver is ""unsigned"". Avoid this product (for XP) until Belkin releases a better XP driver. Going forward, I will be looking for a wireless Ethernet bridge, possibly LinkSys WET11."

Loved the bookks.Loved the films Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Green Gables the Sequel.Hated Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story.This insulting trash should never have been made the way it was.It was Anne and Gilbert's sons who fought in World War 1 and not Gilbert, he would have been too old!And they had Anne acting all weird and out of character so much so that it really has bothered a lot of fans.Dont bother with this trash!"
0,"Anyone who read the books will be highly disapointed When I heard that there was to be another Anne of Green Gables movie with Megan Follows (!!!) I was very excited. But as soon as I began watching this movie I realized that this story had absolutly nothing to do with the books written by L.M. Montgomery. The beauty, tragedy and humor that is found in the novels is tarnished by the film. For those who haven't read the books, read them, and for those who have I'd recommend watching Anne of Green Gables and the sequel again."
0,"How Could You Do This?!? AAAGGGGHHHHHHH! That's the sound of millions of Anne of Green Gables fans screaming in collective disgust. Not only is this last Anne movie bad. It's HORRIFYINGLY bad! I am a strongly against capital punishment but this movie has given me pause. I can't believe the Canadian government didn't put the movies producer in front of a firing squad for the way he thoroughly trashed the wonderful stories of Anne, Gilbert and the gang (not to mention trashing the hopes of millions of Anne fans). How a movie producer could miss so badly after hitting two grand slams is totally beyond my comprehension. Why did he depart from the books and make up a totally different story? The first two Anne of Green Gables movies were beautifully done. This one gives censorship a good name."
0,"NOTHING like the first two wonderful ""Anne"" movies! This movie was a horrible disappointment. I enjoy my Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea movies when I feel like watching a semi-dramatic but otherwise uplifting story. When I want to watch a depressing war movie, I will rent Saving Private Ryan. Plus, the whole story line about Diana being snobby and having marital troubles was just absurd. I wasted my money purchasing a movie I will never watch again."
0,"Dont waste your time As a huge fan of Anne, this movie was the worst ever... There is no romance, and the movie seems thown together rather than thought out. If you are a fan, you will be disappointed, the ending to Anne of Avonlea was far better.. I am going to get the books and read them, hoping to drive this movie from my memory. Very disappointed."
0,"Anne of Green Gables? I cannot even find a proper word to fit the description of this disappointing movie. A complete mess from start to finish is probably the best way to review this. I am not a ""all novels made into movies must be exact"" but this was so far from any of the actual novels that I'm sure poor Lucy Maud Montgomery would have cried bitter tears at this portrayal. How sad when the other two were so wonderful. I think the only thing that was the same as the novels is Anne and Gilbert are together. That's about it. What a shame."
0,"Just can't get into it, a drag I loved the earlier Anne movies in childhood and I still do today. Unfortunately this third film is wrecked by the very unimaginative storytelling. The whole thing is full of cliches. It feels like the story was written in desparation in about a night. I literallly cringed when images from the previous two movies were shown as Anne's recollections, i suppose to make us feel sentimental or something. Just one of the unsuccessful aspects of this ""film."" The film itself deserves zero stars. The one star is entirely for the sake of the cast members, who are not to blame for the abysmal results of this film, the ""plot"" is worthless. An utter failure, a waste of money and talent and time. Why bother?"
0,"Deeply disappointed I am a huge fan of the books and was so delighted years ago to come across the first and second movies. I was so filled with anticipation for the third that I bought it. I was deeply disappointed. Anne, Gilbert, Diana and Fred are all present, but that is the only resemblance to the book this movie has. One of many low points was Anne going across Europe by train dressed as a nun, drinking liquor from a flask (not kidding). The movie makers missed the importance of family and community embodied in the books and first two movies. If they ever make another movie, I hope they return to the books for their story line."
0,Why did Anne go to Europe? THE GOOD: It was fun to laugh at the story line and try to predict what preposterous event would come next :)THE BAD: What possible good would come from a woman pursuing her husband onto the battlefield during a war? How many times did she interrupt legitimate work to ask where her husband was? Was he the only man in the war?THE UGLY: This character (and the plot in general) proved to be too unbelievable for my liking - Anne would have more common sense than to endanger others lives and her own for a nonsensical rescue mission.
0,"Viewer discretion is advised!!! If you loved the first 2 annes, do NOT watch the 3rd one. Personally, I think the movie should be recalled by the FDA due to the hazardous and painful effects on the hearts and minds of Anne fans everywhere. Might as well watch Anne and Gilbert get divorced. That actually might be less painful. They should just remake it. I'll chip in my $0.02(literally and metaphorically) to help fund a redo of the 3rd one; and they should only release it to the unsuspecting public if it's deemed viewable by Anne fans. Anyone want to petition/hold fundraisers for a remake? In the mean time, just reread the books and use your Anne-like imagination.Dear Mr. Sullivan-In case you are listening--I have GREAT ideas for the remake, just email me and we'll talk;-)"
0,"How could they do this??? I was so disappointed to see this movie. I loved the first 2 and was pleasantly surprised to see that a third movie was being made. But, this one had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the true Anne story. I know the first 2 movies had small variations but this was total fiction. I can't believe the took the story of Anne and Gilbert and made it this way. What a sad day for Anne fans when this movie was made..."
0,"Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story I was so dissapointed with this i gave it away unlike the first two i wouldnt watch again, it had not one ounce of the magic the first two had! it was a total waste of time making it!"
0,"Yuck! No Stars For You!!! I grew up on the first two Anne movies and all of LM Montomery's works and this movie just sucked. Big time. Where in the freaking world did they come up with that story line? Ugh. I feel cheated. I want a remake...in fact, let's just start from square one with a filmmaker who cares about getting it right...maybe the folks over at the BBC are up to the challenge??? Anybody??? (echo....echo...)"
0,"Homeless Anne of WW1 What a missed opportunity!I have both the other installments on DVD and watched them again right before I watched the third. What a disappointment it was.There could have been so many other ways to write the third installment of this beloved story but, this writer decided to start a whole new story using Anne and Gil in totally different unbelievable tale of war and unhappiness.Would have loved to have seen Gil and Anne live at Green Gables, raise their family and have such friends as Morgan Harris' sister, a librarian, and Katherine as a school head mistress in Avon lea.This movie has been so disappointing to me it is almost traumatic.Please everyone save your money. I wished i had listened to others before I bought it."
0,"So far from the books. This last installment of Anne on PBS was a complete disppointment. This movie marks a complete departure from anything vaguely resembling what LM Montgomery wrote.The inconsistencies are glaring. Diana and Fred living in Green Gables? Gilbert being the one going to war and Anne following as a nurse? Not even close. By WWI, Anne and Gilbert had been married for years and had 6 kids. The kids are the ones who fought in WWI.There are other problems as well with this movie and it is directly related to the writers not following the books. The movie does not have the same joy and charm that has been attributed to the other 2 movies.If you have not seen this movie and are a fan on Anne, stick with the first two and don't waste your time on this poorly conceived last movie."
1,"Delicious! Informative AND charming... I just learned three new cooking techniques! Loved Julia Child's shows when I was little (in the 70's), but I had not seen the original show (starting with the beginning episodes.) What a treat! This is a must watch for me, and, I suspect, anyone who aspires to become a more accomplished chef."
1,"How wonderful to be able to cook with Julie As a youngster, I was quite unaware of the value Julia gave to those who cook. I haven't cooked for many, many years but was inspired after watching this to actually make the dish AND invite guests. How exciting to having something new to look forward to in my life. Instructions are simple and easy to follow.I watched it first, then went shopping and watched again as I was cooking. Excellent."
1,I love it I seen the movie and then got into the series. Have learned so much from this show. I love it!
1,"Julia is a joy to watch! I can't believe how much I learned from the FIRST episode of The French Chef! Julia Child makes French cooking amazingly approachable and gratifying. I felt like my best friend was walking me through her favorite recipe. Best of all, Julia thoroughly explains (and demonstrates) techniques that will improve even the simplest of meals. Bon appetit? Bon appetit indeed!"
1,"Wonderful! I have tried probably half of the recipes already and everyone has been delicious! The recipes are easy to make and don't require any special, hard to find ingredients. I highly recommend the strawberry bread! It's divine!"
1,"Plain and simple Plain and simple says it all. No complicated diagrams, no professional jargon. Each day gets two-pages: one page to log food and excercise, the other to journal your day. Plenty of space to write and very easy to fill out. Although it might be a little large for smaller purses, it's a perfect fit for any gym bag or backpack -- there's hardly any reason to not keep it with you at all times. If you're looking for something to help you keep track of what you eat plus what physical activities you're doing each day, this book is for you."
1,"very happy Nice rain suit, I am very happy with the purchase. Was afraid the material might be real thin but it wasn't. I've worn it many times in real heavy rain and it has kept me dry."
1,"One of the best comedies I've ever seen! The begining of the film is just fantastic!Dialogs are really intelligent , and Babs and Segale work very good as a couple. She once more proved her acting and comedy talent . Loved it!"
1,"Barbra Streisand in The Owl & The Pussycat. Streisand is young, beautiful and sexy in this absolutely wonderful movie. It's a true love story. But if you would be offended by seeing quite a lot of flesh, mostly Barbra's, you may not want to buy this movie. LOL. I WANTED to see Barbra, so I bought it and I did. This is a 10 if I ever saw one. Check it out."
1,"This is a modern ""Romeo and Juliet"" story. ""Endless Love"" is a fine adaptation of Scott Spencer's novel of sexual discovery. The casting of young Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt is excellent, as well as the outstanding supporting cast. Also, I thought the setting and the background music are fine additions to the movie."
1,"Happy days are here again:) I first saw this movie as a teenager and have loved it ever since. I too, had a very poor copy taped off T.V. that was almost worn out. The songs are wonderful (who can forget ""A bride-finding ball""?) and the scenery is beautiful. I wish that I could give more than 5 stars for this wonderful movie."
1,this is the best film ever this film uis the bvest film i have ever seen the music is so fun and the story is great and so magical. I love the cindrella story and i feel thatthis film expands the story in a very successful way. My favorite part of the film is where edward finds cinderella on his horse. It is so romantic i didnt realise until now that you could get it on dvd but i will be ordering it straight away.
1,"A wonderful version of a classic; more people should watch it The ""Slipper and the Rose"" is a wonderful version of the Cinderella story and it is a shame that more people haven't seen it. It is a musical, so people who don't like musicals should avoid it, but it also has quite a few twists on the original story that I find charming. Additionally, although it is an older film starring actors who were once box office regulars but are no longer, I (who am around 30 years old) still found it lovely. The only thing I would want to improve is to have the film on Blu-Ray instead of regular DVD."
1,"""Suddenly it happens, and the dream comes true!"" ""Wonderfully, beautifully it happens and your world is new,"" says Cinderella in this long awaited film, which is FINALLY being released in its entirety -- the full length, British version! This wonderful, lavish musical of the story of Cinderella, stars Richard Chamberlain as the Prince, Gemma Craven as Cinderella, and a wonderful cast including Annette Crosbie, Michael Hordern, Christopher Gable, Kenneth More, Margaret Lockwood, and Dame Edith Evans. The musical score is brilliantly written by the incomparable Sherman Brothers, who also co-wrote the script with Director Bryan Forbes. This is a great film for all ages, and sure to be a perfect addition to your movie collection."
1,"One of the Best As a child the Slipper and the Rose was always on at Christmas on television in the UK. I used to love watching it.I have now moved to New Zealand and they haven't heard of it! I have been hunting for the film for ages, and someone got me in touch with Amazon. Within a week of ordering it, it arrived and I have already watched it twice.A wonderful movie that will go on and on. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good pick me up and oh Richard Chamberlain is yummy in it!"
1,"This is my favorite album of this year I admit, this is my first Mannheim Steamroller CD, but I am a Disney nut, and buy all there stuff...anyway, now I am a Steamroller fan and looking for more of these CDs. If you like Disney, or Mannheim, BUT THIS...it is EXCELLENT."
1,"These Guys Deliver Quality RocknRoll I am a Djay for a comeback radio show. It's always hit & miss checking out all the comebacks of older bands. This one was a big positive surprise. I like their sound now better than in the 60's, with the exception of the masterpiece""The Letter."" The first 4 tracks of this album are super. Wang Dang Doodle is a great blues song that I liked by Koko Taylor and the Box Tops do a terrific version of it here. As I was listening to the album and enjoying it all I thought that the only thing I hoped they'd do is put a more hard rockin jam song in tthe mix, and then they gave me just that with the last track of 6 minutes called Big Bird. I play this album quite a lot and have played 9 of the tracks on my radio show. I've gotten very good feedback about the songs. The Box Tops are still touring and one more album would be nice. This is a great addition to their catalog of great music."
1,"This CD Rips The Box Tops new CD, and may I say first release in many too many years, recaptures those same good time feelings that seemed to permeate the late 60s. The music, mostly covers, is exceptionally well executed and Alex sounds more focused than he has in years. If you were the Box Tops fan that I was ( if you're over 45 years old how could you not be )you owe it to yourself to get a copy of this new recording."
1,"viva la farberware 1-quart saucepan with lid this saucepan is an absolute delight. everytime i see it or use it it makes me feel good (my life is a simple one. obviously). its aesthetically pleasing, user friendly, and cooks and cleans up handily like the true little workhorse it is. i look forward to many more years of enjoyable saucing in my one quart saucepan with lid and am contemplating adding its big sister (2 quart faberware saucepan) to my repetoir."
1,"The best in stainless steelware Whenever I burn out a pot or want new ones I look for Farberware stainless steel. However, it is hard to get individual pots, especially smaller ones, in retail stores, so I usually get it from Amazon.com. I'd delighted that these pots are available from Amazon.com as otherwise I wouldn't know where to get them. The product itself is the best in stainless steel quality for cooking, lightweight and easy to use and stainless steel is reported to be the healthiest material to use for cooking."
1,"Life changing book... This book was given as a gift to me when I visited a small business for a market analysis project. It was the first time someone had presented the idea that a person can have a successful career not at the expense of pleasing God. While few would be called to Tam's same ministry, many people can be changed by the message in this book."
1,Wonderful Basil Johnson is a master story teller and writer. The legends are all deeply meaningful. He really transmits the spirit of the Anishinaubae in a vivid way. I hope he writes down a lot more of these haunting legends and that his hopes for the recovery of the Anishinaubae language and cultural traditions come to full realization.
1,"Fascinating I just wanted to add (to all of the other reviews) that, while the Dirk Gently books may not be as hilarious as the Hitchhiker's book (and at times verge toward drama), I would say they are much more interesting. The plots are complicated to be sure, at times esoteric and puzzling, and you may even have to re-read, but I find it is well worth it. Fascinating."
1,"Van Damme best films. I have no doubt that this is one of the best Van Damme low budget movies. It have everything you need for a action movies. Amazing stuns, great karate choreography, hard hitting Fx, great story and a lot of heart. And don't forget Van Damme do a great acting in this movie together with an amazing director Ringo Lam.The Blu-ray disc itself is a great collectable transfer of the original movie. The picture look beautiful and very clear. It have a awesome main menu and some great special features like Deleted scenes, storyboards and audio commentary with Van Damme and Michael Rooker. For those who speak other Language it only have Spanish and English Subtitles. That's sad.Above all if you like Van Damme I recommend this movie completely. Have Fun."
1,"Funny and great Van Damme stars as a serial killer and the replicant version developed by gov-t. Van Damme acts well and is very funny to watch as the Replicant goes around learning everything around him and gets himself in funny situations. THe movie has a very positive feel overall and is very well done on the story front. Action is great and Van Damme shows off his gymnastics skills again. Everything about the movie is great, so I'd recommend it. It is a fun action movie to watch."
1,great movie bad blu transfer i Love van damme movies he is the best too bad he is getting old no more slits thats done!! Overall the blu-ray to this movie is horrible same as dvd
1,"Replicant Replicant is one of VAN DAMME's good movie ever made by the ASIAN director RINGO LAM.It's a rearlly movies made ,with plot on DNA cloning,whitch is a real scintific process in are future. He plays this sereal killer,very strong,very smart.he goes all over the world, and can never be caught.The police hunting him manage to get a sample of his blood, and from this they make a duplicate with process of cloning,an exac duplicate of the killer, a Replicant,whitch they use the copy to track down the original killer.Jean Claude playes dual roles again like: DOUBLE IMPACT, MAXIMUM RISK and REPLICANT- revolves aroud this clone and original killer."
1,"This is one of Van Damme's BEST! I saw this movie earlier this year, very good effects, stunts, fights, characters, story, acting and all! The entire package is there! I would recommend getting this movie on DVD. Its one of Van Damme's BEST films ever."
1,Works Easy to use/program. I programmed one using a master remote for a main gate and the other for my garage.
1,"Great deal at amazon only!! There are lot many reviews for this set, but I wanted to specifically mention about the cost at amazon!! I find 'em for the cheapest price here!! I got 2 of them and recieved the 25$ instant discount on $125 + $10 rebate on each set + 10% off offer on all the cookware. Overall I feel it as the best deal.And no comments on the set, it is gr8. Little bit not happy with the skillets, but the rest are shiny, durable, well designed.Go for it, its worth of value!!"
1,Still on the job after 39 years! I've had my Farberware cookware for 39 years and have never had a problem with any of it. It has even heating and cleans easily.
1,"Incredible set of cookware This was my first full set. I've bought individual pieces, but nothing can come close to this for the price.The pamphlet that comes with the product says that the aluminum bottom distributes heat so well, you can cook everything on low to medium heat. They are right.The pots are stylish and well built. The pans are excellent -- eggs just slide off the non-stick surface. I'm very pleased with the set and saved ...at Amazon."
1,"LOVE I use every single piece of this set every week. They have lasted forever. They're easy to clean, dishwasher safe and I have the perfect size for everything I need. I highly recommend every piece in this set."
1,"Farberware Classic 13-Piece This set is awesome. Nice and heavy, heats evenly, easy care. I highly recommend this product."
1,A Great Starter Set of Cookware I purchased this set of cookware for my daughter who is a college student living with roommates in an apartment. She is very pleased with the variety of sizes of skillets and saucepans and is impressed with the way she can cook and not burn food like she did before. A real bargain!!
1,"Not A Cadillac, But Not A Yugo Either.... Farberware has been a mainstay in the American home for years. Although I am disappointed that it's now made in Thailand, what isn't? It is still good quality, heavy, transfers heat extremely well and is a joy to use. Whether one uses this set as a 'second', or as their primary cookware, one can't go wrong. Extra piece's are available on amazon, or at your local [store]. When buying cookware, remember one thing, a $10 fry pan or a $100 fry pan cooks a pound of hamburger equally well."
1,"I love farberware's pots! You really can't go wrong with any of Farberware's pots! They really last a lifetime! I have the 3qt,6qt,8qt,1qt,and 2qt. The 3qt is the best for everyday! They will last for generations! My mother still uses them and I grew up with her cooking with them when I was a child and they still are excellent!Believe me you get your money's worth with Farberware! The classic collection is excellent! I know my sets will last as long as my mother's."
1,"Great Stockpot. Farberware Stockpot arrived in pristine condition. Has been used so far for boiling shrimp and pasta and as pot with vegetable basket for steaming vegetables.Cleans very easily and continues to look terrific.This product was puchased at Amazon, a site where I have also purchased Grandchildren Toys, Movies and Books."
1,"Giving is an important part in one's life. Max Lucado's ""Jacob's Gift"" was the best book I've read in a long time! It shows how a young boy gave his project to the couple who needed it. I recommend this book to all young readers and teachers of all grades."
1,always amazing one of the best shows ever. dvd showed up fine with no problems. make the right choice. buy the dvd.
1,"completely tight butthole In my opinion, the first season is the best. But this show makes me laugh every time i watch it. I've watched seasons 1 and 2 multiple times, and this show isn't old yet.Hopefully Amazon Video gets season 3 for complete purchase on here soon."
1,"Refreshingly funny This show is hilarious without being obnoxiously or ridiculously offensive. It's refreshing that it can be humorous without offending half of the world's population. It is not a particularly mature show, but it's meant to be light-hearted and not taken seriously. Every episode will make you laugh out loud."
1,"The best season We're 4 eps right now into season 3 and it might turn out in the end to be the best season yet. But we'll have to wait and see, until then this is the best of the show so far. Along with The League its the best show on cable (Always Sunny is terrible now). You will especially love this show if you grew up in the 90's, tons of references."
1,"Should be three books Three great essays, each of which should be a book by itself. I would love to have read much more about about the frightening religious fervor that permeates so much of American politics and which he describes so well. I often wonder what happened to the separation of church and state.We are becoming no better - or worse - than the third world countries, be they in the Arab world or elsewhere, that base their political, social and most frighteningly, their penal system on religious fanaticism. Of course they don't call it fanaticism. I perused most of the other reviews on Amazon, and it is interesting how members of the religious organizations Phillips describes are offended by the book. Well, what else is new!"
1,"thought provoking helps to make sense of the insanity that's infested USA politics domestic and foreign policy in the last quarter century, with emphasis on the last 6 years."
1,"Eye Opener This book will change what you thought you knew about gov't and special interests. Everyone thinks the gov't has always been controlled by special interests, but most don't understand how deep the connection is. And how long religion and oil(whale and from the ground)has controlled and steered this country from it's inception. This is not a politically motivated book, it's a ""history tends to repeat itself"" book. You will definitely learn a ton from this book. Top notch, but definitely not a optimistic view of the fate of the United States."
1,"Prescient Drawing on historical precedents, Kevin Phillips paints a stark picture of the U.S.A. in her twilight; overburdened by an outrageously large and growing debt, dependent on a diminishing resource, and blinded and misled by fanatical religious elements. This book should be required reading for all high school seniors - we may be able to ""dodge the bullet"" if enough Americans understood the situation - but, alas, this will not happen soon."
1,"American Theocracy I've been reading a lot of political analyses lately (Thomas Friedman's The World is Flat, T.R. Reid's The United States of Europe to highly recommend two) but for sheer, weighty scholarship this one takes the prize. Phillips' critique of an oil-based economy, religion in politics, and the American addiction to debt is meticulously cited, exhaustively examined and ultimately devastatingly conclusive, with a final paragraph that nearly moved me to tears. I wish I could say that I found it comforting to be told that this has all happened before, to the Romans, to the Spanish, to the Dutch and to the British. What really stings is that this guy is a Republican with serious street cred. He's not some wild-eyed way-to-the-left liberal, he's my dad."
1,"""Mr. President, Do You Believe We're In the End Times?"" That was the question the president couldn't answer in his press conference earlier this week. If you want to understand why he couldn't just say ""No, what are you, nuts?"" - the answer's in here.Highly recommended!"
1,Great for fans of Tenchi Universe. This CD is great if you're a fan of the Tenchi Universe series. I highly reccomend it.
1,Princess Leia costume The item was just what I ordered. It came on time and was new and packaged well. I was quite happy with this product and ths company.
1,AN EYE OPENER! Beottner does well to present the factual attributes of the Roman Catholic system. His writings are very easy reading- hard to put down. Artful comparisons between Protestants and Catholics.
1,"A summation of the false doctrines of the Catholic church As a Roman Catholic, who during my early adult life was searching for spiritual truth, this book helped me to learn of the anti-scriptural basis of doctrines of the Roman Catholic church. If you would like to seriously study Roman Catholic church doctrines, and how they compare and contrast to the truth revealed in the Bible, this will be an incredibly important book for you to read and study."
1,"If half of this book is true.... I am a young reader in high school. I attend a Classical School, study Latin, Greek and the Great Books. If half of this book by Boettner is true, it is enough to condemn this church. The chapter on the Confessional appears more hideous than all the gods and goddesses in all the ancient civilizations. I am very interested in this subject and will be getting more books. I am planning to get a degree in classics and ancient literature. If just half of this book is true.....well, one must love slavery."
1,"Great, observational documentary One of my favorite documentaries, ""Startup.com"" follows two high school friends as they create an internet business together.Besides catching history on film, the filmmakers document what happens when friendship enters the business realm."
1,"Sturdy, well-made ergonomic handle This is a good button hook. the zipper pull is handy, as well. Sturdy and the handle is a god design. The shipping was outrageous, however. No fault of the product, though."
1,"Must have for any kitchen This stockpot is a good size for making soup, stew, pasta & chili. It can be used to make two very satisfactory portions or four normal portions (for normal eaters, unlike myself). It is not too large and unwieldy, especially loaded with food. It is simple to clean, conducts heat very well and a delight to use! An excellent value. Farberware also makes a nice pasta insert which is a great addition to this pot."
1,"WONDERFUL POT You really can't go wrong with any of Farberware's pots! They really last a lifetime! I have the 3qt,6qt,8qt,1qt,and 2qt. The 3qt is the best for everyday! They will last for generations! My mother still uses them and I grew up with her cooking with them when I was a child and they still are excellent!Believe me you get your money's worth with Farberware! The classic collection is excellent! I know my sets will last as long as my mother's."
1,"A huge success I bought this for my mother and father who love the Open Road song in the car advert, but had never heard of this gentleman. This CD has been a huge success with them."
1,"Farberware 3-Quart Saucepan I had been reluctant to order this Farberware pan because someone had said it was not the heavy duty pan of a few years ago and that the handle was flimsy. I finally bit the bullet and ordered it because I have another one this size and it is my most used pan. I have a new glass top stove and some pans will rock on the burner and not heat well, I needed a completely flat, heavy bottom. This new one is all of that and more. I could not be more pleased. it is super quality. I highly recommend it.Rita"
1,lasts forever I received farberware pots for shower gifts 42 years ago...I use them everyday and they still look great...I haven't lost a handle yet. Picked up this 3 qt because I did not have that size...love it!
1,"Farberware Classic S/S 3-Quart Covered Saucepan Compared to other products on the market that sell for an outrageously amount of money you can't beat Farberware. I have been cooking for over sixty years and I have always bought Farberware and would not waste my money on any other brand.,"
1,Perfect fit and operation Perfect replacement to my worn out and dead blower assembly. Fairly simple to install in my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Classic once you figure out the best angle to get the old one out. There are only three 8mm screws and one wire harness to remove and re-attach. Save money and do it yourself.
1,"Grab a Canadian dictionary I really enjoyed this book, but reading it at 23 was a small challenge. I didn't know if it was the author, the time, or the region, but I found there were many words that I just didn't know. Some could be deciphered by reading the sentence or paragraph, others I wrote down and looked up; even that was enjoyable. I had done a research paper on Cabbagetown, but really enjoyed a novel written by someone who lived it and loved it.Wonderful story, cool history, great writing."
1,"the best so far I work in a Hastings store in the USA, I was stocking some books one day and as an avid zombie lover, I read the back cover, I decided to come back after work and by the book as I would get a good discount anyway. After it set on my shelf for about a month I decided I wanted to read it, I picked it up and within moments I was hooked! I went back to the store to see if he had any other books out that I might like and to my surprise there was not one but two sequels on the shelf, I bought them up write away! I finished them both in an afternoon! Looking at the back page my heart skipped a beat when I found out there was a fourth book so I instantly got online and found out there were two more!!! But then I discovered I would have to wait for them to release..... the anticipation is going to drive me crazy! I must know what happens next!"
1,"Original and difinative rock & roll-Nazareth Nazarteh, one of the only few whom is distinct, just hear the music and you know whose singing. Nazareth music is powerful but not with alot of ""noise"". Just plain good music, in other words just let the music do the talking."
1,"LoL Comedy Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim was an amazing novel written by David Sedaris. I enjoyed reading this book from cover to cover. The humor was never ending. He took real life stories and told them bluntly with a humor that not many authors can match. The randomness of the novel was what made the novel unique. He talked about the little things in life rather than the big. He told about his family relationships, finding his sexuality, and growing up. The continuous culture shock that is David Sedaris's life was intriguing and hilarious. If you like roll on the floor comedy you will love Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim by David Sedaris.By: Kassie Forman"
1,"David and Amy Sedaris- A modern American treasure The Sedaris clan have easily transmorgified into the Glass family of the Post-ironic set. Between Amy's raucous television appearances and David's inimitable readings these two are quickly becoming the Franny and Zoe, the Ernie and Dodi, the Kukla and Ollie for the clued-in readers/viewers with a taste for the absurdly hilarious. ANY creation these two produce, either independently or in tandem, is sure to delight. Buy it all: read repeatedly."
1,"Very. Good. I've read half of this book and already know that I love it. It bothers me that everyone tries to label David Sedaris as a ""humor writer"" and then come to only expect him to churn out ""humor books."" Sure the books are funny, but a lot of his writing is deeper and serves a more significant purpose than trying to make someone laugh. Also, I like how he is a ""gay writer"" who doesn't just fit into the cookie-cutter by writing ""gay stories."" He branches out...and he loves to explore the psychological implications of situations from his past. Overall, buy this book, and buy Barrell Fever, and expect to laugh, a lot, but don't approach Sedaris's writing as you would, say, Bozo the Clown's work."
1,laugh out loud funny David Sedaris is an absolutely hysterical writer and this book does not disappoint. His stories are always quirky but yet truthful and make me laugh out loud. The only thing better than reading a story he has written is listening to the audio version of it b.c there is just something about his slightly annoying voice that makes the stories sing.
1,"What? Me funny? For self-deprecating laughs and family novelty, read this book. Sedaris is a master at it! You'll find yourself thinking of the funny things that have happened in your life and make comparisons."
1,"This book is a truly enjoyable read. If you like the dry wit of David Sedaris you will love this book. Even if you don't know who he is, once you have read the first page you will probably love this book.Seeing the world through the author's eyes for a while helps us to remember the little absurdities we experience every day and, somehow, cherish them for a moment rather than let them drive us stark, raving, looney.Thank you Mr. Sedaris, for reminding us to treasure even the stranger moments that make up the life of a human being."
1,"Who ever gave this less than 5 stars is an idiot I quote this book more than I quote seinfield. I have become addicted to it, to David's twisted use of the English language. I have read all of his other books, and I highly recommend his cds."
1,"The Best Yet This was Sedaris's best book by far, which is saying a lot since his other ones were great too. I laughed out loud at least every few pages. One story even made me misty-eyed. I haven't enjoyed a book this much for a long time."
1,"An excellent read Another excellent book by David Sedaris. I couldn't put it down until I finished. Anyone who truly understands his humor could in no way be dissapointed by this book. The hilarious stories of his family give you a more personal look into his life. While the stories are amusing, at the same time you're able to see how much he truly cares for his family--despite all their visible flaws. The humor in his writing is matched by few. Definitely an enjoyable read."
1,"Only Sedaris... Only Sedaris could come up with some of this stuff. While I wouldn't say this is his best yet, they're all awfully close to each other and all awfully great reads."
1,"Lovin' Sedaris This was the first David Sedaris book I ever read. After reading this book I bought and read three other books of his. This one has turned out to be my most favorite. Once you start reading you won't want to put down. Sedaris will have you laughing over and over again with his bizarre and intriguing memoir. If you read only one Sedaris book ever, choose Corduroy and Denim."
1,"Different... very readable. I'm a huge fan of The Truth Machine and The First Immortal, and this book was unlike Halperin's novels in some ways. For one thing, I don't think he rewrote it as many times. It's much less intricate and maybe not as polished, yet he displays the same ability to put you right into an imaginary situation and convey an astonishingly logical, believable future. The three stories present a benign, moderate, and terrible outcome of the Y2K bug (not necessarily in that order). My only complaint is that they were too short -- I finished this book in three hours, and it felt more like 30 minutes. Anyway, it's very easy to read, and now I really think I have a more balanced view of the risks of the Millennium Bug. Maybe I'll read it again tonight to see if I missed anything. And even though I'm not as scared of Y2K as I was before I read the book, I'll probably still stock up on bottled water and canned goods, and maybe buy a few gold coins and a generator, too, just in case..."
1,"Always reliable. This pan is perfect. It's large, holds a lot of food and cooks evenly after the pan is warmed up. It's easy to clean, comes with it's own lid, which is always desirable, and it's attractive. To add to this review: I've had this pan for four years now and still love it. However, I was in a kitchen store recently and looked at the Farberware collection and found that the quality had gone down, way down. So those purchased some time ago will find a sturdy pan, but the products coming out of Farberware now (as of May 2011) are low quality and not as durable."
1,"Easy to follow, step-by-step instructions for young people Written and illustrated by Michelle Eva Portman, Compost By Gosh! is a simple, rhyming children's book about the joy of making compost - the process of letting worms eat leftover food and turn into that material into something which is perfect for fertilizing plants. Easy to follow, step-by-step instructions for young people who want to make their own compost (under adult supervision) round out this excellent and very highly recommended instructional book for budding young gardeners."
1,Vermicomposting made fun for children As an environmental stewardship educator I use this book all the time when teaching preschool - 4th graders. The rythming text & quality illustrations works well with the early elementary audience. The rich vocabulary and detailed explaintions appeal to the upper elementary student.
1,"Great Book! Compost, By Gosh is a wonderful read-aloud book for young learners. As an informal educator with a non-profit organization, I need read-aloud books that get across environmental messages in an entertaining way. Because the story rhymes, it's easy to get into that read-aloud groove. This is my go-to book on vermiculture (worm composting) - students love the story and illustrations. Excellent resource for a library or teacher and just a fun read for kids."
1,"a Jewel I have owned this book for years. I've read it six times. End up with tears in my eyes every time when the King and the Primate look back over their lives together, fighting for the freedom of their beloved country.A HUGE story that will totally engulf you in the lives of the characters. If my house were burning down, I would return to rescue this one!!"
1,"Excellent quality and value I bought this in my Gold Box values because I own other Farberware products. This particular pan is not only up to the quality of what I own, but I think better."
1,Daughter in Law Loved It My DIL loved receiving this as part of her Christmas gifts. I have had Farberware for 46 years and it looks as good today as it did all those years ago.
1,"Sanuk Sandal 5 STAR! The Sanuk Sandal is so comfortable! The description of the sandal, size, color and comfort was right on the mark. The sole of this sandal has a slight sponge however does not leave permanent foot marks. The fringe fabric strap between the toes is very comfortable and the sole on the bottom is constructed to conform to the bend of the foot when walking. Unlike some sandals which are bulky the Sanuk conforms to the foot and is true to size. It fringe is suttle and the colors are faded. As a surfer, this is one of the best kick back sandals I have ever own! I highly recommend this sandal. I purchased 2 pair just incase someone removes their shoes and borrows mine!!!!"
1,"These little boots are awesome I got these for my grandson. They are the cutest ever, so soft and so flexible, great for just starting to walk .... the lining is so soft and cozy. I highly recommend this item!"
1,"Tenchi Muyo is the anime for the best J-Pop music! Another great Tenchi CD, and I wasn't surprised that it would be. I'm glad to have both the english and japanese versions of Washu's Lullaby and the opening theme to the Mihoshi Special. Just as good as volume 1, if not better."
1,Awesome! I totally love this CD and watched the entire DVD last night....AWESOME!!!! Hios best record in years if not ever as far as i am concerned.
1,"A Captivating Experience I bought Neil Young's 33 1/3 album, 'After the Gold Rush,' in April 1972. Until April 2006, I had had no further contact with his music. At that time, I just by chance chose to see the documentary, 'Heart of Gold,' at a movie theater in Knoxville. It was a captivating experience. I felt I had been lifted into the presence of honest, powerful art and pure poetry. I buy few DVD's and own few; this was one I had to have. Now I am in danger of over-playing it and wearing the edge off my enthusiasm."
1,"Prairie Wind A must buy. Neil Young is an enduring classic and if you've enjoyed his folk rock over the years, you will certainly mellow out when you listen to his latest CD. ""Just a Dream"" is especially good listening."
1,"Essential Neil Young-Success I have long been a Neil Young fan. His music ""rings home"" to me. The music resonates as far back as the ""Crosby,Stills,Nash, and Young"" days. ""Prairie Wind"" is one of Young's best works. The album is one excellent performance followed by another.The music is symphony-like and captivating.I purchased the CD and the ""Heart of Gold"" DVD the same day. Subsequent to listening to ""Prairie Wind"", I said, ""Wow!"". I like the inclusion of the lyrics on the CD jacket. After viewing the DVD, I said, ""Spectacular!"". If a singer/songwriter should write about that which he knows, and a performer perform with both knowledge and heart-felt emotion, then these performances define success. As a son of the Prairie, I say ""Five stars."" and ""Two thumbs up!""."
1,"Great for the preschool imagination. This is a toy that the 4 year old loves and plays with a lot. It has no moving parts and nothing he can take off the vehicle (he likes to remove the wheels and tractor treads from his vehicles). It is made of a rubberized plastic, but in my house that is not a problem. I prefer toys that allow the child to use his/her imagination and in my household this fits the bill perfectly. The quality of the toy was not an issue. There are more than enough details painted/stenciled on the shuttle to make it look realistic. This is our second shuttle. The first shuttle got destroyed when the puppy got a hold of it and used it for a chew toy. So my only warning would be not to let the dogs get hold of it. It is made in China."
1,Awesom book I've been reading this book for a week and I am not done yet but I wanna say as a college student this book has really touched to me. I think everyone should read this book to understand how could affect a mid-age crisis to a person.
1,"very happy We loved the movie and watched it several times. It came in the mail very quickly. In fact, it came in the mail a couple of days later. The movie was good. I liked how the young man kept his head and worked with the police to get not only himself but his fellow classmates released from the hostage situation."
1,"Prinze and Schroder deliver amazing performances I was impressed with the leads and this is a movie based on actual happenings. Prinze in one of his better roles and Schroder has never been better. the school shooting footage themselves might disturb a lot of viewers and it puts thoughts in your mind. Schroder is electric as the kid who was once a student at the school, comes back. Henry Winkler is great also as the police chief. powerful, violent to the extreme and a shcoking end that will leave you hanging."
1,Canopy screen panel I was real pleased with this screen panel kit.It was easy to install and fit perfectly. I wassuprised that Amazon carried these.
1,"Loved it from 1/4 in through the end. Creepy thriller; Bermuda Triangle(implied); Time Loop; Dollars-to-doughnuts you will not see the ending coming, and it doesn't feel like a cheat."
1,"Very good... First off I have never felt the need to write a review before this movie but I see so many people giving this a bad one I wanted to add my 2c.This may be one of the best ""loop"" movies i have ever watched. It has so much going on inside of that I found myself constantly wondering what would happen next and how it was going to happen. By no means am I a film critic or would ever claim to be one, but the acting in this movie seemed very spot on to me. Watching a woman struggle with so many emotions that she seemed to play so naturally was a real pleasure.I really dont want to say much because anything I do say will almost be a spoiler to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. If you're looking for a new movie to try and and are into a sci-fi/fantasy element then I would definatly give this a look. Very well made and one that you will be thinking about for a long time after watching it."
1,"Awesome grip Very comfortable, had carpal tunnel surgery and this makes a huge difference, especially on a longer walk. Love the gold accent too."
1,"Palm Grip Cane This is a great cane - very light weight , colorful and the palm grip is great. My PT person recommended this grip because I have minor issues with my hand but it would work no matter the issue . Hope you enjoy!"
1,"Impeccable musicianship and phrasing These are wonderful historical recordings that are very well transferred. Most enjoyable is the patrician 'pianism' by both Horszowski and, particularly, Szell (in K454 and K481.) While the uninitiated may find Szigeti's astringent and somewhat insecure tone unsettling, the reason for purchasing this set should be the delight imparted by the impeccable musicianship of the artists."
1,"Beautiful watch I love this watch. It was much less expensive here. When you put it on, you'll fall in love with it. The color is a deep navy and the luminescent hands are very easy to read. Also, it's Swiss made. I like bigger watches(40mm) and this one is perfect!"
1,Excellent I wish I had not read it so that I could read it again for the first time. It was an excellent book.
1,"Great Historical Novel entertainment! Reading about court life from Anne Boleyn's sister, Mary's point of view was great fun! This was the first historical novel I read, and since then I have read 20 more, yet I am still yearning to find something as spellbinding as this one."
1,"Wonderful Historical Novel This is the first Phillipa Gregory novel I read, and I tore through it. I really enjoyed how Gregory takes actual historical events and then uses her skill to create a story that absolutely captivates. It's hard to remember, at times, that it is fiction, and wonderful to learn more about a period while enjoying a fantastic read."
1,"A simultaneously informative and torrid read This book was incredible-- hands down one of the best pieces of historical fiction I've ever read. Not only does Gregory nail the pliable nature of sisterly rivalry, she succeeds in bringing an unknown heroine to life. I could hardly put this book down. Little known detailed facts about the life and daily tasks of those in Henry VIII's court arise throughout this story making every page essential. And at the book's harrowing, bittersweet and shocking end, Gregory masterfully handles a situation you have to read to believe. I was moved and educated by Gregory's tale and urge everyone to delve into this worthwhile novel."
1,"Great historical fiction. Read it! This book was so very interesting. I highly recommend it to historical fiction lovers. I couldn't put it down and when I did, I couldn't wait to get back to it."
1,"A magnificent page-turner, wow! This is by far the best book that I have read in a long time. A beautiful historic novel, couldn't put it down. Never a dull or boring moment, just flawless. Highly recommended!"
1,"fabulous! I absolutely couldnt put this book down. I was sad when I was done because I didnt want it to end. Afterwards be sure to read The Queen's Fool or The Virgin's Lover, loved those too! I have even contemplated re-reading all of these because they are so great."
1,"Loved it! I don't usually read historical fiction books. I primarily read fiction action/mystery books but my friend convinced me to read this one. Boy, am I glad that she did! Every page kept my attention. I couldn't wait to read what debauchery, deception or plotting was happening next. Highly recommended."
1,Fantastic! This is one of the best books I have ever read. I could not put it down. Excellent to say the least.
1,"Great fiction with a historical basis This was a wonderful book, hard to put down. The author very effectively blends historical fact with her own imagination of characters' motives and feelings. Very well done and enjoyable."
1,"Great Read I quite enjoyed this book, my first by Gregory. The way she tells the story, from the point of view of Mary, created an easy to follow flow throughout the book. I read it in 3 days, finding it impossible to put down. It was scandalous, heart-wrenching, and entertaining from start to finish. While I can't attest to the historical accuracy, I was looking for a good historical fiction novel and found it here."
1,"Enjoyable historical fiction I purchased this book some years ago to read during a long car ride because the book was long, and I am a fan of historical fiction (and non-fiction too, for that matter.)I was pleasantly surprised. The book is well-written, engaging, reasonably fast-paced, and I didn't notice any jarring anachronisms or inaccuracies of the sort that usually ruin historical fiction. The story is interesting, to boot, although I was not especially gripped by the love-story aspect.Having not had the privilege yet of reading any Jean Plaidy, the closest author I can compare this to is Sharon Kay Penman, and I have to say that if you like Penman, Gregory's THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL will not disappoint you."
1,"I couldn't put it down I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much. The greater than 600 pages was a ""quick read"". After finishing I was interested in researching the facts about that era."
1,"Best book this summer I read a lot of historical fiction -- and more than a few about Henry the 8th and Elizabeth I's time -- but this was by far one of the best I've ever read. I couldn't put it down, and stayed up all night two different evenings until I fell sleep. Even knowing that the general outcome of Anne Boleyn, it was completely fascinating the way Phillipa Gregory developed every character in this book. Each person became alive -- good and bad, villain and angel -- so that you felt like you actually could see these people, hear them talk and knew them intimately. It's a tale about the human spirit, and a wonderful love story that is intricately woven in with a great deal of historical fact. Anyone who loved the trilogy about Josephine Bonaparte will especially love this story."
1,The Other Boleyn Girl Enjoyed the book. Easy to read. Read this book even if you have seen the movie. Gives you more details and makes you understand the time in history better. I highly recommend this book for leisure reading.
1,"Loved it, sad it had to end! I am such a huge fan of Phillippa Gregory -- and this book started it all. This historical fiction is exceptionally well-researched, and keeps you caught up in the sexy drama of the relationships between Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn & her sister Mary Boleyn, while offering some insight to the powerful family leaders trying to influence the king. Offers a beautiful feel for the period. Even though you know what's going to happen to Anne, it's a joy to read, and I hated for this book to end!"
1,"The Other Bolyne Girl If you like historical fiction, this is a ""must-read"". You can't put it down once you get started."
1,"What a great read! Don't be deterred by its length, The Other Boleyn Girl is a worthwhile read. With this novel, the reader gets history, mixed with drama and adventure. As a reader, you grow to have true feelings for these characters, while you might know what historically happened to them.A fine novel!"
1,Stunning! I had given up on finding any more books that suited my liking. After reading this novel I became obsessed with obtaining the rest of the Philippa Gregory works. I'm currently reading The Queen's Fool and The Virgin's Lover at the same time. They are fabulous books and brought me back to reading. The politics are exciting as well as the love stories that made history.
1,"A brief review and account of reading experience I read this book twice. Each experience was rich, and in the end of each serving, I remebered the mood from the story and it stuck with me. I'd have to say I quite admire the stubborn spirit of 'nan bullen' and also the wisdom of her sister, mary.Not only is this book detailed historically, it serves for an excellent experience. As an avid reader, I am usually going on from one book to the next. This book, however, proved to be worth a second read AND one of the most cherished it my library collection. If ""nan bullen"" still lived, (impossible nonetheless)I would thank her. Thankyou, Nan, for teaching me ambition and flirtation!**** GRUDGE WHO GRUDGE"
1,"more than your normal historical fiction This novel is so JUICY! It was reccommended to me by one of my best friends who is a history buff, so i had my reservations about reading it at first, thinking that it would be a bunch of facts thrown together with a simple plot - But as soon as i picked up this monster of a novel, i could not put it down!the relationships are intricate and the characters are fascinating... overall a really great read."
1,"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL Marvelous, fresh version of the Anne Boleyn episode of history, narrated by her younger sister, Mary. I found myself totally caught up in the story, even though I've read and seen many versions of the tale of Mary's sister Anne, Henry the VIII's second wife. I had a difficult time putting the book down and could not wait to get back to it. The times and lifestyles are so clearly dileneated that I felt part of them."
1,"A fascinating glimpse of history ...but an even better story of a girl's journey to womanhood. Philipa Gregory's Mary Boleyn was a three dimensional character who sprang to life in the pages of the book. Mary Boleyn was her family's pawn, married off at an early age and tossed in the king's bed shortly thereafter. But as the story unfolds, Mary finds herself and finally has the strength to marry for love.Gregory's ability to weave a fictional story into a historical work was breathtaking."
1,"One of the best books I've read in a while The story of Henry the VIII is so convoluted that it can be hard to believe it actually happened. Based on historical facts, with the dramatic flair and touches of a true fiction novel, Gregory does a wonderful job bringing everyone back to life and depicting the relationships and situations that made Tudor England so memorable."
1,"A Very Good Read Being a junkie who loves to read about British nobility, I have found some books on the subject to be big yawners, much like college text books, but not this one. Philippa Gregory has a wonderful perception of the lives of her characters, which is evident in her writings. They have become more alive for me than with any other author.I would highly recommend this book and am looking forward to reading the others she has written."
1,"the other Boleyn Girl I really liked the book. It is a story that is a romanticized account of history. She uses actual bits of history, but fills in the time in between with fiction. I thought it was very entertaining, I would recommend it and I would read her other books."
1,"Awesome This is the first book in the series ofthe Boelyn girls that I was referred to.I liked it so well, I have since readthe others!"
1,"the Other Boleyn Girl - Better than the Movie! I initially picked up this book because I loved the movie. I immediately realized that this powerfully written book far eclipsed the movie. Set in the court of Henry VIII, this is the intriguing story of the Boleyn Girls, Anne and Mary. The characters come to life as they fight for the King's affection and advancement of their family. I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction."
1,"The Ofher Boleyn Girl This book captivated me. Although, this book is a fiction, it provided historical information on the wives of Henry VIII. The Tudor dynasty has intrigued me throughout the years and this book gave me information which I did not know and it provided a wonderful novel to read. I truly enjoyed it. My next will be The Boleyn Inheritance, which I understand is as good a read."
1,Couldn't stop reading! This book is great! I love all of Philippa Gregory's books but this one was just amazing. I was having a hard time putting it down! She did a wonderful job at taking you into the time of King Henry's court and making you feel that you were actually there listening to the conversations and watching all of the scandal unfold before your eyes. I recommend this to anyone!I am a BIG fan of Anne Boleyn. I actually make Anne Boleyn jewelry based on pieces she wore on the tv show The Tudors. [...]
1,Rich and sumptuous. If you loved the other books by this author you will love this one. A definite page turner. I strongly reccomend it!
1,"One the best books I've ever read. I can't say much except that this is one of the best books I've ever read, hands down. I can read it over again and again and feel like I'm actually living during this time period and understand the author trying to captivate my emotions. It's a truly brilliant novel. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
1,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!! Okay, so while you may not use this novel as a reference while writing a paper on English history, if you need a book that will keep you enthralled you have most certainly found it.The Boelyn family wants nothing more than to elevate themselves within the English social hierarchy. As players in the court of Henry VIII from a very young age, siblings Anne, George and Mary know how to play the game well. When young Mary catches the eye of the King while at court, the family, under the guidance of their ruthless uncle, meet to determine how to best use Mary to further the family's social agenda. What follows is a thrilling tale of love, murder, betrayal and sibling rivalry. Descriptions of the English court and the actions within will keep readers immersed and interested. The horrific exploitation of women and children and the social acceptance of it all is both riveting and nauseating. An excellent piece of historical fiction, not to be missed.DYB"
1,"Awesome! I loved this book. Bought it on a whim, I was in the mood for it for some reason, although I've never enjoyed historical fiction before and have never wanted to read it. After a few pages I was hooked and can't stop reading her other novels. I hate history, but this book got me interested in this time period and I can't get enough. It was very interesting, a real page-turner. It made me feel smarter for reading it. I can't compare her with other historical fiction authors because I haven't read anyone else yet. I have to get through all of Gregory's stuff first, then maybe I'll try others. But I truly truly loved this book. So far, my favorite of all of her novels."
1,"Two thumbs WAY up Having never read historical fiction before, I was marveled by Gregory's work. I started it wondering if it would grab me enough to hold me for 600+ pages. Instead, I found I was drawn to this book like practically no other - every spare moment I had was spent reading it and I finished it in under a week. Gregory spins her tale seamlessly and enchantingly and her book has piqued an interest in Tudor England that I never would have had otherwise. She made every character spring to life and I felt like I was inside those courts everytime I opened the book."
1,"GREAT views I have always had problems with binoculars, and I always figured it was because I had a vision problem in one eye and that must have affected my viewing through the tubes.WRONG!I had just been too cheap to but good binoculars. I bought these for my wife, and I could not believe that I could actually use them as well. These are great for all purposes. We both love them, I need to get another pair!!"
1,"I'm used to Walmart Clearance rack stuff.... It's only been the last 7 years or so that I've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house, I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning! All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks, and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart. I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe, when it got here and I wore it for a couple days, I really like it.I bought the Large Black robe; I'm 6ft, about 200lbs, a little heavy around the middle, and the robe fits pretty well. The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist. The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs. It ""flows"" nice too, when I walk, not like the heavier terrycloth robe. And the silk lining makes me feel ""rich""!Overall, I like it!"
1,"Hefner aint got nothing on me! Wow I am completely impressed with this robe. I bought the silver/grey robe, and one big thing to note is that the picture just doesn't do it justice. The outside fabric (mainly wool) has a pattern that is hard to explain but looks very sharp. The seams are silk and really accent the robe in the right way. The inside of the robe is smooth silk and the entire robe is not heavy or light its right in the middle. I bought the medium size and it fits perfectly. I am 5'10 and the waist/arms were a spot on fit. Kudos on the fast shipping as well to Amazon!"
1,"Classic Cleopatra So many use the word Diva to describe the movie and recording stars of today. Well that last time I checked in the dictionary the word Diva had Tamara Dobsons picture by it. I saw this film the first time in the early seventies and I still think it was ahead of its time. Shes awesome to look at, has martial arts down to a science. I think an updated version would be a great vehicle for Rupaul. Do you agree? Can't wait to get it on widescreen."
1,"A BLAST FROM THE PAST We saw this movie in the seventies and were blown away with Tamara Dodson's presence. I was excited when I found the movie on this site. I am glad we found it because when we need a seventy fix, it right at hand (You won't be disappointed). Outstanding movie. Thanks"
1,"13 Ghosts is Scary & Fun Another chilling low budget horror film from William Castle and Robb White. This one has the penniless Zorba family inheriting a haunted house that contains 12 ghosts. They need a 13th to set them free. This has some interesting casting. Margaret Hamilton, who is best known for playing the Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 Wizard of Oz, appears as Elaine, the housekeeper who is also a witch. Very fun movie with real ghosts. It can be scary at times, especially the scene where Sy Zorba is locked in a secret room and sees all the ghosts. The spectre of a butcher with a meat cleaver is frightening. Good family entertainment for a stormy night."
1,"Illusion ""O"" is Illusion ""No"" with this DVD,but still a great flick!!! Okay,like many reviewers have stated,no 3D glasses are given with the product,sort of a letdown(since the DVD packaging said it included a pair of glasses!),but if you can find a pair of 3D glasses sitting around the house,they should do the trick,saying that it's still a nice widerscreen transfer of the film in BOTH Illusion O and w/out Illusio O.The DVD does have some nice supplimentals,just not the darn glasses,guess like William Castle himself,this DVD must have had a small budget,tried to contact Columbia Home Video,but they did not contact me back,oh well,still a great cheesy little horror flick!!! The Tingler(Also from Columbia Home Video) is also good fun too!!! Still very recommended!!!"
1,"Filmed in glorious B/W and in ""ILLUSION-O"" Some folks may consider this movie over the top, over the hill or just lame but I---who saw 13 Ghosts in real time (1960)---considered it the best of the spooky matinee fare of its day. It had a fantastic built up to the climax of the story. All the actors and actresses were top notch. But the true power of this movie was that it filmed in glorious B/W and in ""ILLUSION-O."" You can't beat that combination! And those who are critical of this movie ought to take a time out from their self-imposed and sanctimonious attitude and appreciate it; directed and produced by William Castle himself. They don't get any better!"
1,"very inspirational My hobby is studying missionaries, especially videos, and this video is the most inspirational video I've watched. It clearly shows the power of God through a humble servant who sacrificed all to lovingly care for the precious people of India. His faithful ministry yielded great fruits! You will be amazed at the ending and his accomplishments."
1,"Nice Great item. Easy to use, I didn't get any ink on my fingers or anywhere else. It really is simple to use. I've used other refill systems, usually just with a needle attached to a squeeze bottle,but this automatic refill system is so much cleaner and simpler. Once your ink cartridge is full the refiller automatically stop putting ink into it. The instructions don't say to, but when finished I put a small piece of tape over the fill hole. Give it a try."
1,This was easy The shipping was faster than I expected. GEAT shipper. At first I thought that this would be complicated and won't live up to expectation from the reviews that I read. Well it was easy once I read the instructions. There was no mess and I din't get a drop of ink on the sink or on my hand. I highly recommend this ink refill kit. Just follow the instructions. I'll be returning to purchase more.ChuckW213
1,"Love it! The oil rubbed bronze finish of this floor diffuser is perfect. It is well made compared to the cheap contractor grade one I was replacing and looks spectacular on my tile floor. It dropped in perfectly and matches all the hardware, fixtures, and lighting I also have in the oil rubbed finish. A great addition to my kitchen!"
1,"A must-have for any breastfeeding mother When both mom and baby are inexperienced at breastfeeding, the last thing you both need is to be fumbling around trying to get comfortable. The Boppy is just the right fit for everybody and there is no baby product that I used more than this pillow. If you're looking for a practical shower gift, get her the Boppy. Mom will use it 8-10 times a day and take it everywhere she goes!"
1,"I couldn't live without a boppy. The boppy has been a wonderful purchase. I actually have 2 here in the house, one upstairs and one downstairs. I use them every time I nurse, and my husband uses it when he gives our daugther a bottle. We also have 2 additional boppy pillows that were hand-me-downs. I keep one at each of the grandma's houses so I don't have to cart mine around. I find that the boppy luxe is well worth the additional cost over the regular boppy. The fleece texture and the velvety texture are wonderfully soft. The cover is extremely easy to remove, wash and replace. We purchased an extra cover to rotate with during washing."
1,"Couldn't have nursed without it! The Boppy Luxe was my best friend while nursing. It's fuller and firmer than the regular Boppy. I have a long torso, so it put my son at the right spot for nursing, however a friend of mine said her son was too high to nurse. It's also great for babies with acid reflux or gas who cannot tolerate being on their backs. Some days it was the only place my son could sleep comfortably.I got this as a shower gift and went back and purchased another to keep at Grandma's! It's well worth the $$$!!!!"
1,"You should be ""bopped"" if you don't get one One of the best things created for moms in the last few years. Definitely a must have. It makes breastfeeding so much easier, plus it has other functions like propping baby up and to introduce tummy time. I absolutely love it, and there are so many different designs or covers. Great registry item!"
1,So useful I love my boppy. So much that we have two for different parts of the house. I use it for nursing and as a seat for my baby. I have been using it recently for tummy time as well. He is 4 months and leans his chest on it as he plays with his toys over the side.
1,"if i coud give more than 5 stars, i would! i love this boppy, i use it every day. i have two of them so if i stack them and sit my son in the middle, he can sit almost upright and not fall over. he loves this. he also gets tummy time laying on just one of them with his arms over it."
1,"A must have! I use the Boppy pillow everyday to nurse my seven-week-old son. He fits perfectly on the pillow (the pillow is the right height, length and firmness). When I was at the hospital, they let me use three pillows to sit him on while nursing and he would sink down or start falling off. Pillows just aren't as effective for nursing. The Boppy is also great for tummy time or to help him sit up for a moment. I highly recommend that every mom (nursing or not) get a Boppy pillow, it's a great investment!"
1,"A MUST HAVE!!!! I love this product. Infact, I have two of them- one upstairs and one downstairs. They make life so easy when nursing or bottle feeding."
1,"Boppy Pillow not Recalled Just read the review that the boppy pillow had a full recall on it. Went looking for more info, ... and there is an impersonator pillow from some boston company that is the culprit... not this one. This is the original one and currently has no recalls on it. This one is ok!"
1,"Great Product We have used our Boppy for 3 mo's. We don't breastfeed but we still find Boppy to be indispensible. When Isaiah was born, Daddy made a special trip home just to get our Boppy for us to use at the hospital. Everyone loved bottle feeding with it. It has just the right smooshiness for supporting Baby and helps old Mommies and Daddies like us avoid those numb arms and crimped necks. We enjoy it for tummy time and sitting practice, too. During pregnancy, it was a mystery to us when friends told us to register for a Boppy and it seemed expensive but, once Isaiah arrived, we learned very quickly that a Boppy is worth every penny. Other friends have tried the Boppy competitors and not been satisfied. It's hard to believe that the smooshiness, shape, size, fabric type, etc. are so critical but, when you feed a baby round the clock, they are, and Boppy has them mastered."
1,"Great pillow After my c-section this pillow was a godsend; trying to hold a child in the correct nursing position with your abdomen stitched shut can be incredibly painful those first few weeks, especially when they take a few times to latch on correctly. This pillow supports their weight for you so you don't have to. You can also use bed pillows, but my son is now 5 months old and I still enjoy using my Boppy. It still positions my son just right for nursing even though he's grown quite a bit. I definitely recommend this product."
1,A Must Have For All Moms This pillow is great for breast or bottle feeding. Comfy and soft and big enough to fit around my still swollen abdomen!!! The cover washes easily... I got mine as a gift and would buy one for any mom to be!!!
1,"Can't live without my boppy! I've had the boppy for my most of my kids. I LOVE IT! When they're newborn, you can use it for breast/bottle feeding, and I could let an older sibling hold the baby by putting this on their lap and the baby on the boppy. Once they're old enough to start trying to sit up, you can prop them up on this. It also helps for tummy time. My older kids use boppies sometimes as pillows while watching tv! Boppies come in a ton of wonderful designs and covers! I Love Boppies!"
1,The BEST invention ever!!! This was our life saver for our sons first 9 months!!! We used this for ever bottle feeding. Our son was super comfortable and relaxed during feedings. Was especially great those first couple months during the night feedings. I could sit up in bed and feed on this him well I was still relaxed!!! The fleece cover is the best too. Super soft!!! The other covers feel kind of scratchy and are definetly not as soft as this one!!!!
1,LOVE IT! This boppy is by far the best! This particular pattern is so soft and beautiful. My daughter looks so comfortable when she lays on it. It is a must have when you feed your little one.
1,"The best soft cover boppy around Even though this one was a bit more than some of the others out there, it is the most soft! I have talked to other moms who have different ones and they say the fabric isn't soft enough and they need to use a towel on top of it."
1,"This thing is great! Okay, so I'm not a nursing mother. In fact, I'm a dad, so I guess I can't speak from personal experience about the usefulness of this product for nursing. I do know that my wife loves it, though. And I even use it sometimes when I'm holding our son--I find that it is just high enough to set on my lap, and I can rest my arms against it and hold the baby without tiring my arms.The boppy has many uses, one of them being that you can put the baby in the hole in the middle and sit him up in a sort of reclining position. Our son finds this to his liking, and we often sit him up in it while he naps.Overall, this is an excellent product, highly recommended for moms (and dads)."
1,nostalgia This book brings back lots of memories for anyone interested in major happenings of the mid-twentieth century. There is something of interest for everyone. It is worth a look and makes a good gift.
1,"another delightful book by Atwell I love how Atwell sees the world from a long term perspective; it did not begin when we did but long, long before us. It will go on long after we are gone. It is up to us to be stewards for all time. Atwell conveys that message nicely in this book."
1,"Prisoners enter the Hampton Court Flower show In a medium to minimum security prison in England, a new program is started to teach inmates how to garden in preparation for their parole. In the meantime, they make the prison grounds look nice. This is an unlikely group of gardeners, one short timer and three lifers, one of whom is dying of cancer. The four of them learn gardening from books written by a Ms. Woodhouse, who later hires them all in a sort of work release project renovating a garden in a local estate. There are many twists and turns and surprises, but the gardeners find their way to Hampton Court and happiness in the end. Helen Mirren, Clive Owen and the rest of the cast are perfect in their parts and the story is very good."
1,Such a good movie! Why more people haven't heard of this movie I can't imagine! It is such a good movie and I never tire of watching it. Clive Owen and David Kelly were particularly good in it. Worth every penny and then some and please do not stop the movie when the credits begin to roll at the end otherwise you will miss a very funny remark that Clive Owen makes. I love this movie.
1,"This was so funny I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute, original story and all the actors were great. Clive Owen (who was in Croupier last year) was especially good - he is going to be a big star. This is a movie for everyone who loved Saving Grace and Waking Ned Devine."
1,Lovely More people should see this delightful movie. The storyline is a bit unusual keeping you interestedThroughout and cheering for everyone in the show. A true delight to watch!
1,"Unexpectedly delightful The Princess of Dhagabad is a joyful tale, not your average every day Genie in a Bottle, grant me 3 wishes formula. Besides the imaginative storyline, the book leaves you wanting to go back to the Ancients Sands again. Finally, it makes sense why this incredibly powerful being, a genie, would be in a bottle. The story develops both the genie and the girl who is his master, as she learns from him and learns about herself and he learns from her. A fantasy story that is NOT based on Tolkein."
1,"A classic! If you are an adult who loves Harry Potter, you should definitely read this book. It is set in the ancient Middle East instead of modern day England, and it has those sensual parts that are definitely not appropriate for young adults, but this book has the same genuine purity of an all-time classic. It tells of a princess growing up in a richly described world of the Arabian nights. She is a shy and quiet child with a lot of responsibilities, but her life completely turns around on her twelfth birthday when she finds herself in command of an all-powerful djinn who obeys nobody else but her. It is not simply an adventure book, although you will find plenty of magical adventures an near-death experiences there. It explores the meaning of wisdom and suffering that comes with it. Also, the meaning of true love. The book is beautifully written and deeply moving and it will leave you wanting more."
1,"A Classic Sometimes you just happen upon a book that just draws you in and becomes an important part of your bookshelf. This happened with Lord of the Flies. I'm normally one who steers away from literature in the 'classics' section at Borders, as it gives me memories of bad books that we've all been forced to read in high school (then again, maybe I'm just to young too appreciate The Awakening or Mainstreet... ) I just happened to randomly pick this book off the shelf and start reading while I was waiting for a friend to find something. By the time she came back, I was so engaged in the first chapter that I bought it. I enjoyed it...it's the type of book that you can ponder about afterwards and it's not a boring read (*cough*Lord of the Rings*cough*). In fact, I ALMOST enjoyed writing a paper about it senior year! If you'd like to read something unique, disturbing, and thought provoking, then this something you should read."
1,"Huh? Oh, I get it! This book has too much symbolism if you can't think deep enough. The book is mainly about human tendencies. It could be read on a political level, but that takes too much brain power. There is some killing and graphic violence. Above all, the book is one of the best books period."
1,"The Head of an Animal . . . Well, most people in America have already read ""Lord of the Flies"" by William Golding, which is definitely a classic. So I'm not going to give a synopsis, just a general appraisal of the work.The main characters (Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Roger, and many more) are very complex and very riveting. You can clearly observe their distinctive personalities with their actions and their dialogue. And you feel sorry for these characters when something goes horribly wrong.There are many symbolisms in this book (the conch, the pigs, the flies, etc.), and they work very well here. Interpretations are open (except when it comes to the obvious ones). Tensions are high as we slowly move towards the climax. No Hollywood ending here.Golding has created an influential work of art, as highlights in this book are many. This isn't an innocent story, and it's no clichÃ©, either. Kudos to the author.A+"
1,"A Great Read! I read this book a year ago, but I still remember almost exactly what happened. The book is burned into my memory. That's how good it was. It's a tale of a boy growing up, and the evil in our society. We see how the boys decivilize during their stay on the island, and degenerate into savage groups. As in Jack London's ""The Call of the Wild,"" the characters revert to their natural instincts. In this case, the boys become savage group hunters, similar to eary humans thousands of years ago. This book is hard to understand; cryptic, but will give you a new view of the world."
1,"A REVIEW OF THE BINDING The novel itself is excellent, a modern classic. But what I always want in a book review is a description of the binding, so here it is. The Classics of Modern Literature Series has done an excellent job in printing handsome modern classics, including 'The Godfather' and 'The Once and Future King'. This book has no dust jacket, the colors and lettering are printed on to the cover. I find this preferable, because dust jackets are a bit of a hassle. There is no lengthy introduction, and the last page of the book that has writing on it is the last page of the novel itself. So this book is very straightforward. It does have a bar code printed on the bottom of the back cover, which may not bother some, but I don't like it. Other than that though, I don't see how they could have done a much better publishing job. This is a great edition of a great novel."
1,"Survivor Explained I was fortunate to read this book in the 8th grade, it explained all the social interactions of Junior High School. Unfortunately many people never get past Junior High society. The popularity of Survivor has demonstrated this, the weak, the different, and the above average are rejected by the collective might of the average and mediocre. No dissent or thought is encouraged or permitted. An elite few determine what is correct and acceptable. Here is the social model of Liberalism, Socialism, and Communism, you are free to say whatever you want, as long as you agree with them. Personal attacks replace any debate on issues. It is no wonder this book is no longer used in public schools, it raises to many embarrassing issues."
1,"The reader from St. Louis is dead wrong Hey, reader from St. Louis: I don't think so. Yeah, forget Lord of the Flies -- just read Into Thin Air! Are you kidding? This is one of the greatest works of the 20th century. While you are at it, why not read some Danielle Steele -- it's better than this Golding garbage!"
1,"Review/Blog The book is about a plane crashing leaving a bunch of kids stuck on an island. They are celebrating their independence at first but after a while their chance of being rescued is slim. Day to day, they create their own laws and rules to somewhat form their own government. The moral of the book is the importance of the government and how it regulates the rules and laws.I would recommend this book because its very suspenseful and leaves you guessing. The Morals and values can relate to my life and may relate to yours too. The value of the government is often taken for granted as we don't follow the Laws/Rules. The book teaches the importance of how you should follow the laws and to not be a menace in society."
1,"Lord of the Flies tells about what it takes to be a leader. I just finished Lord of the Flies not more then 20 mins ago.I had my doubts on this book very much.I have read many books in my life but this one had one of the best endings.I wasn't that happy with the book for the first 100 pages or so,but the rest was all good from there.Lord of the Flies shows the meaning of the struggles it takes to be a leader.There were key moments in the book nthat foreshadowed the ending.One was in the Beginning when Jack Showed a certain quality that showed that he had the quality to be a leader.When Ralph blew the Conch the First words that JAck said were ""Who is the man with the trumpet?""That foreshadows the leader qualities he has by his curiosity for his choir's sake.I am not going to go any more into detail but you should buy this book and do not give up on it.It has a great ending that you will enjoy."
1,"Excellent Depiction of a Cruel and Barbaric Society A great book... A wonderful depiction by Golding of a group of teenage boys that are supposed to be ""civilized"" boarding-school students but turn wild and barbaric as a result of the harsh island environment that they are set in. This book provides a powerful representation of our own society, and how these animalistic natures all exist in the underlying shadows. Although the adult in his ship rescues the kids at the end, the point is made by Golding in the Epilogue that, even though the kids are rescued, who will rescue the adult? Lord of the Flies connects all readers with its harsh, gritty setting and the personalities of all characters"
1,"A must read! I've been meaning to read this book for a long time now. I've heard about it since my school days but never really had the urge to pick it up. Honestly, I'm glad I waited. I don't think I would have appreciated the novel quite as much as I do now if I had read it in my teen years.Though this book was published in the 50's, it is relevant today. It is raw human nature at its finest. It is audacious, and I love it! It is a haunting depiction of society - an allegory of civilized mentality, which is revealed here as chaos.I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
1,The truth of man lived out in children This book is a classic because it shows how human flaws and strengths can lived out and experienced by mere children
1,"A thrilling journey into the dark side of the human psyche. 'Lord of the Flies' was written to show that no matter how civilized the human race thinks it is, it is all an illusion created for our own safety. We are all animals in soul, if not in mind. I was drawn into the book, I thought of the characters as real people, with real problems, and real personalities. I feared for the characters lives, for Golding's one-in-a-million writing style brought the story to life. 'Lord of the Flies' had to be one of the most believable books I've ever read. With an exciting, realistic plot; well-thought out characters; excellent imagery; and superb symbolism. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to see the hidden side of the human spirit."
1,"""All we have is the rules"" Ever fantasize that you are on an island free from the restraints of society? William Golding has taken that scenario to the nth in this story of a bunch of English boys, plane wrecked on an island during WWII.We see the fabric of society slowly and most assuredly ripping as the rules are discarded one by one. Golding is very graphic in his description of the demise of pigs and plants.One will never look at fun and games in the same way.Lord of the Flies: Essential Art House"
1,"My time to hold the Conch A true masterpiece. To me on par with ""Heart of Darkness"" and ""Crime and Punishment"" on the subject of human nature. Each of the boy's, or groups of boy's, personalities are spot on in representing individual human traits. Death, innocence, jealousy, it's all disturbingly spot on. This is a must read for anyone."
1,"A Classic Lord of the Flies by William Golding 5/5I first read Lord of the Flies in high school, as do many Americans, and recall being the only person in class who actually enjoyed the book (and also the only one who disliked Frankenstein). I picked it up off of my shelf a few days ago (cracked binding, faded glue, and all the pages falling out) and finally reread it: I still like it. It's the story of a group of English boys trapped on a deserted island. In an attempt to be rescued, the boys being to cultivate their own civilization with structure and orders. This all to quickly falls apart. Lord of the Flies is a short masterpiece of children's lives mirroring the adult sphere and, like so many other books lodged in the annuals of high school literature, too often is read at an age when a person is most likely to lack the understanding of the full implications of the book. A splendid read."
1,"THE Boys Own Adventure I will first of all admit that the book is a trifle overweighted on the symbolism angle - notwithstanding, it remains a superb adventure, fable, morality tale and social examination. As for being put off by having read it at school, I can only assume that it was taught too early, or by a bad teacher - I stole my copy after the end of the school year and have been reading it ever since!"
1,"Just a school book? I dont think so! I am 14 years old and loved this book. I have read many books and liked and hates some. But this book I loved!! When my friends and family told me about it it made me sick to think of KIDS killing each other. Once I read it I loved it. Golding really understood that kids will only want to have fun. I recomend this to anyone who likes to read and to anyone over 13 years old. Most teenagers thought it was stupied, but you got to remeber that, that is how life is, there is good and bad people, most peoples like the bad people because they make life seem easyer. If you put kids on a island they would do what happens in the book. Any thing to say to me you can e-mail me at angel73339@hotmail.com I love to hear what people have to say."
1,"School student gives Thumbs up It is evident that many high school students do not appreciate the artistry and terrible truths that Golding has demonstrated in this Ballatyne novel. I, for one, a normal 13 year old, highly recommend this book for all readers. The story line is intricately weaved together to form a tragic, provocative, yet beautifully written novel. The story revolves around a a group of marooned English schoolboys. It follows their struggle to maintain order and it allows the reader to reflect on the state of man kind. I am a school student and give this compelling novel and thumbs up! Buy this book and you too will be spellbound by one of the most celebrated of all modern novels."
1,"One of the best books I have ever read!! What can I say? I LOVED this book!! I read it in my own free time and not for school, perhaps that is why I liked it. But I also found the story line gripping and Golding's style of writing with his descriptions excellent! It seems to be the sort of book that you either hate or like, and I'm sorry that there are people out there who, unlike me, thought the book was awful."
1,"Poetic, Powerful, Authentic writing Not only does this book deserve 5 stars, but it is books like this one that should be the criteria for awarding 5 stars. When I read a book, if it doesn't move me like The Lord of the Flies, I hesitate to give more than 4 stars. However, after reading Golding's novel, I rushed to award top marks. An airplane full of English schoolboys has crash-landed on a deserted island. As their condition detiorates, loyalties and protocols begin to crumble and the animalistic side of human nature emerges within the group. As I stated in the title of this review, the writing is authentic. You won't find the string of cliches like you see with other authors. The story is beautiful and terrifying at the same time. One wishes for 200 more pages as the story climaxes with page-turning exitement. Golding's use of symbolism is genius. This book is on my ""must reads of a lifetime"" list. Put it on yours."
1,"Shocking I loved this book. It explores social interactions between young males, and the limits of the conscience. The ending was shocking... be prepared for an exciting story! (This is middle school reading)"
1,"SPELLBINDING I'll make this short, because there's lots more 5 star reviews to be read! The Lord of the Flies is simply amazing! The way the boys turn to savages presents a chilling reality of the human race. Read it. Now."
1,"Fire on the Island . . . Well, most people in America have already read ""Lord of the Flies"" by William Golding, which is definitely a classic.

1,"An excellent peice of literature! I think that the author believes in original sin, because it portraits this in the book. This book has lots of themes, and I think that it also shows the loss of innocence. The author Mr. Golding described the setting so detaield, that you could watch a movie in your head. Each character represents a meaning. For example, Piggy's glasses represent clear-sightedness and intelligence. An MUST READ book! Not boring at all!"
1,"One of my all time favorites It doesn't get much better than this. I just read this book for the 4th time and still get chills at the end. True to human nature, Golding has tapped into his youth and the selfish and brutal nature of a society that fails to speak up and defend its weaker parts. One of the best examples of the birth of a dictatorship. Loved it."
1,"extremely interesting This book is quite interesting and does indeed depict society to a great extent. its point to the fact that given a small population isolated form external influences will bring out the primeval and basic instinct with which we are all born...in other words we revert to forming our own society, based on our so called strength at the time aka aggression. In ""polite"" society today this is largely masked and the aggressor does not literally kill the weak, but subdues, dominate etc by economic power."
1,"the what ol' days? I cannot say enough about this book. There is so much depth in it and so much ot think about. There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader, Jack, becoming the most evil on the island. I think Golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion, as shallow as the choir boys' outfits. Being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school, I would vouch Golding's implications hold true even for kids who aren't lost on desserted islands. Ultimately, the island signifies a pre-adolescent's experience, as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions. I'm glad this book exists, because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth's experiences."
1,"A Lost CCM CLassic One of Glad's early recordings before they became an acappella unit. I did not recognize it at first due to the change in cover artwork (my old LP had the band in front of an old juke-box but without the green border. Superb songwriting, musicianship and vocal harmonies are what's in store on this excellent recording of diverse tunes assembled in a attention-holding mix.. The music style blends rock, jazz and pop styles effectively. This disc should be re-issued if it hasn't already, but then the CCM record industry seems reluctant to do so with many if not most of the early to mid-era classics. Get it when you find it!"
1,brilliant as 2 A-level students who were not at all interested about history or the second world war we were made to read this novel. It's the best novel we've ever read and laughed and cried throughout it. We either loved or hated each of the charecters and were drawn into their lives. We realised the sadness of living in war times. However we felt the brutal beating of the pine martin Psipsina was unnecessary. We also found it disrespectful when a stray cat was given the same name.
1,"A great book which will turn you inside out... This is a great book with strong characters and a riveting story which evokes thought about life's rich, historical context. The characters are so real and well-developed they seem like you truly know them. Some are lovable, some are charming, and some may be detestable, but all are unique and interesting. The story is fascinating... set in a small village on a greek island where the reader experiences the village's sleepy existence, its turbelent military occupation, and the outcome of those (and other) events. The history of the island and characters evoke thought about life's rich, historical context. It shows how history shapes nations and races and how personal experiences shape individuals. Importantly, it also illustrates how each individual plays an important role in defining both the present and influencing the future."
1,"I Loved It!!!!! This was the best book that I have ever read. After having read it, I couldn't stop thinking about the characters lost and all those years of seperation between 'Barbara C'relli' and his 'kotitsi'. Pelagias life really made me come face to face with reality and sometimes I wondered 'why couldn't things just stay the way they were?' Unlike Louis de Bernieres, I really can't find the right words to express my feelings about this book; sometimes I think back to it and cry whilst other times I remember the more humourus stages such as Stamatis and Kokolios, psipsina, Iannis and the priest (but then I come to remembering that they were all lost lives and I get depressed again). A beautifull story! I'm going to read it over and over again but this time, I'll leave out the last few pages and try to pretend that those events didn't occur."
1,"Absolutely Beautiful My Wife, Girlfriend at the Time, introduced me to this Album back in 1998. I remember she told me that she wanted to show me the most beautiful music that she had heard. When she played it for me I had to agree that it was indeed beautiful, I had never heard anything else like it. Soft Black Stars has never lost that for me, no matter how matter how many times I have listened to it."
1,"Awesome book to learn by. Not just for kids either! I've never found books to be too terribly useful until I came across this one. I work at an ice rink in my local town where I teach basic figure skating and coach hockey. My boss had a copy of this book and I started to look through it just for tips. I found so many things that I had wanted to learn - the mohawk, three-turn, and waltz jump - as well as things I hadn't thought of. If you want to advance your skating skills, no matter what your goal, this is the book for you. There is everything from stretches and balanced diets, turns, skating techniques, and even pairs skating. It's a wonderful learning tool for all ages (definitely not just kids!!)"
1,"Great Movie, DVD Only Makes It Better ""Franklin and the Green Knight"" is a top-notch production in so many ways. The story itself is very charming, captivating and enough to hold the interest of a wide variety of viewers. The music is well-done, from the feature's vocal musical numbers to the excellently scored background music. The animation is bright and colorful and the characters are all well-suited to their roles. The DVD enhances all of this. One of the best special features is a ""making-of"" featurette, which includes interviews with Paulette Bourgeois (the author of the ""Franklin Books""), Noah Reid (voice of Franklin), Kristen Bone (voice of Snail) and many other crew associated with the program. Also including is a ""music video"" feature which lets viewers quickly view any of the movie's musical numbers. For those that have a DVD-Rom on their computer, there are also games."
1,"great dvd we have viewed this dvd several times , and each time pick something new we really enjoy this dvd and each time we watch we pick up something new, it was a replacement, and we are glad we reordered it"
1,"A wonderful insite to the mind I'm a HUGE fan of Baum.Always have been. Ever since I was a kid. Reading Baum in published order is an ever ongoing project with me. Now I'm not one who wants to take apart the wonderful stories and put all the elements into little boxes and find out what they are make of, but this book does something that is just the opposite. It takes the stories and looks at them in the order in which they were written! This book is a wonderful look at the ""periods"" in the Baum Canon. This is a great look at how say something like the Life and Adventures of Santa Clause and Queen XiXi of IX relate to each other. Great writing and research makes this book a MUST for any Baum collector."
1,"So You Wanna Be a Comic Book Artist This book takes you all the way from inspiration thru getting your meterial out there to be evaluated. Chapters include: starting a studio, tools of the trade, illustration tips and tricks, creating the characters, creating the story line/scripts, putting it all together, copy-shop comics, promotion and getting publicity for your work, submitting your comics to publishers, video game designing, sources and essential comic book terminology. The book is a complete source for anyone interested in pursuing the field, old or young--anyone."
1,"Spellbinding - a must read! Here's a true realization for that tantalizing opening of Jane Austen's last novel! Critics have always agreed that SANDITON would have led her into new territory. Not only would it have taken her out of her bit of countryside into a bigger geography, but invited her to venture further into the realities of her Regency world. The Sussex coast bring her into the mania and speculation of the new health faddism and more.Julia Barrett has taken Austen's themes up boldly, and carries them to the conclusions she had in mind. And, Barrett's done it with bravura, wit and style. Better still, all this serves as a background to what always concerns Austen: that age-old game lovers play."
1,Extroidinary Novel This book was beautifully and passionately written. It is a love story unique and philosophical. Do we choose our own fates? Alvina will tell you.
1,"Numark PT01 Portable DJ Turntable Excelent product. I connected to my computer easily, could play LP's, 45's and 78's, has speaker; earphone connection, does not need pre-amplifier and once you get the music in your computer with a program like Audacity or DAK Editor you can copy, edit and put into Wave or MP3. Highly recommended for the price, if you're a high tech person this might not be that great but for must of us it works perfectly"
1,"Numark PT01 Portable DJ Turntable Review Excellent value.I have over one-hundred 78 RPM records. I copied the records onto CD's using this turntable connected to my computer and Microsoft Plus software. The result is a sound that was better than the original and much more convenient.The turntable is very compact, easy to set up and operate. I had no trouble at all."
1,"A rare find I found this album only because it was playing in a local record store when i was there. I immediately loved it and purchased it that visit. This album has a very downbeat sound that is mostly instrumental. The lyrics that are included are very fitting and the music never seems to get beyond a pleasant, soft, and medium speed. With mellow and almost hypnotizing rhythms, it is perfect music to listen to in the evening, and mellow enough to sleep to. Apparently there are two good things out of Iceland."
1,"One of the CDs I'm really glad I bought. ""Everything Is Wrong"" is my personal favorite of Moby's albums. It has such techno as ""Feeling So Real,"" such minimalist classical as ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters,"" and many more. It's one of the CDs that I listen to constantly, and yet do not tire of."
1,what would be better title than Review For everyone who was too young at the time for listening him.For everyone who got to know him only by that time when his creations started to belong to up-to-date and soooo cool outfits.For everyone who is wondering what's this special music that's coming out of the speakers in Target.For everyone who wants to know how his whole masterwork started.But most importantly: for everyone who is able to recognize that he is a real genius -and it is really rare today...
1,"WITHOUT A DOUBT MY FAVORITE ALL-TIME ALBUM! I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM BACK IN 1995 AFTER LISTENING TO ONE OF THE TRACKS AT LA BOOM IN CANCUN, MEXICO. IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT AN ASTOUNDING ALBUM. I COULD NEVER GET SICK OF IT. THE DAY THAT I DIE I'LL TAKE THIS TO THE GRAVE."
1,"Excellent Read for Mom & Sons Me and my 2 1/2 year old boy just LOVED this book. He is very much into numbers and has been counting for a few months, so I got this book for him. It's one of the few books he sits for through the whole story. He especially loves the page for ""four"" ;).It is also good for his older brother, who is in kindergarden and learning how to read / spell the number words."
1,Another road classic A great gift for someone who is a huge fan of the road pictures. This is the last one we have yet to see and I am sure it will be great.
1,"wonderful I had all the movies in this ""road"" series that spanned 20 years, except Road to Rio. So glad to have found the DVD version as I only had the VHS one and it was worn out. Love Hope and Crosby and Lamour in all their road movies and will share them with all my friends."
1,"The Wolf's Swan Song This is the last album The Wolf recorded. It has some top-notch songs on it, and a couple of not-so top-notch (the electric harpsichord is overdone!)For any Wolf fan, this is a must. Even after a heart attack or two and kidneys that no longer functioned, Wolf showed on this album that he could still howl like no one else.Recommended"
1,"...whoa. I watched this movie yesterday. um.......wow. Weirdest thing ever. It should be rated R. There is only one word in the entire video and it's ""Help"". Personally, I think this movie was made by a very bored animator who was not doing what he was supposed to and was in the middle of a phsycotic breakdown.Yup.Buy this movie.It is worth your 85 cents."
1,"a great book A very good book indeed, it brings in a lot of information,although there is no way one can confirm it or not."
1,True Gospel I really love this CD. The songs will not only get you through the week but the month and year. Vickie is really encouraging the songs give hope and joy. This is a must have for everyone.
1,"Great book! The book essentially describes our three and a half year boy. The first chapter is almost a biography of him. We have gone through some of the same frustrations that other parents have had (especially with an incompetent audiologist). The book confirmed what we always suspected that our boy is a very bright and very analytical child (very good with computers, etc.) that just happens to be a late talker. We will have him evaluated by a pediatricain specializing in a development clinic just in case but we are convinced that there is nothing wrong with him. This is a great book!"
1,"Answers with a twist A FANTASTIC read... The ""twist"" is that it bases the core reason for late talking on heredity ~ specifically tying in close family members with analytically-thinking/based careers and abilities (engineers, scientists, mathematicians, pilots, musicians, etc.) I didn't know this when I purchased the book and wanted to share that specifically. We got a lot from the book because our daughter falls into that category (otherwise the book may not have been as useful to us). ""The Einstein Syndrome"" provides great insight on ""why"", what can be done in the meantime and on ""early intervention"". If you have a late-talking child, as well as analytical minds in the family, this book definitely provides answers. **Also recommended for speech therapists/pathologists who aren't familiar with these recent, brilliant findings."
1,"TAC from California is an idiot! This Triumph DVD is not staged or studio recorded or anything of the sort. It is a live concert in Halifax. The times have changed and yes the material, music and sound are dated but it is what it is. An amazing 80's cocert that held it's own and despite the less that Stones budget Triumph used to record it, the concert does them justice. Yes, Rik Emmett was Triumph and without him they would never have existed. Anyone who knows the band knows Gil Moore and Mike Levine were no Neil Peart or Geddy Lee. but they banged out great 80's type rock that people all over loved jamming to. Buy it! It is Triumph at it's best live and you're not going to find anything better if this is what you're looking for."
1,"Brings it all back Ordered this in June and finally had a night where I just needed to forget about the day (can you say Presidential Debate) and enjoy being 21 again. Well this brings back 1986 at the Rosemont Horizon (not where the show was filmed but where I saw it).Lay it on the Line people, these guys just had fun and made great rock and roll.Dave"
1,College for Free This book is an excellent choice for the parent and the student to read to get a good background prior to researching and writing good scholarships. The book was in excellent condition and the delivery was earlier than expected. Thanks to Amazon
1,Attending College for Free This book was worth purchasing. There are some great suggestions in this book for applying for scholarships. I would recommened this book to future college students. Book was shipped promptly and received in great condition.
1,"Great 'how too"" college bound text for Juniors and Seniors The perfect text for juniors and seniors planning to attend college. Lots of useful information organized in thoughtful chapters. I highly recommend this book for any high school staff working with students planning to attend college. Also would be very useful for parents wanting to collaborate with their son or daughter looking to reduce the cost of attendance."
1,"Will Get Your Kids Scholarships Hello everyone,I just wanted to write in and recommend this book. It is great for those parents who want the best for their kids and who want to help them take some initiative with scholarships. This book helped get my son off the couch, and he's already won several scholarships. Now that's what I call a gift for parents! :)"
1,"My Coffee Tastes Good Again I have a small Cuisinart 4 cup coffee maker with the metal carafe. After having 2 Cuisinart 12 cups, bite the dust in less than 6 months. I had to rely on what I considered my little back up. I refuse to buy another Cuisinart 10-12 cup again, unless they bring the manufacturing back to the USA.But, I digress. My little metal carafe was black from coffee stain, and no amount of Dawn and scrubbing would get it clean looking. I purchased the Dip it, filled my little carafe with boiling hot water and added the Dip It. 20 Minutes later the water was pitch black when I poured it out, but my little carafe was clean, all the stain was gone.Made a pot of coffee right after it was cleaned, I'd forgotten how good coffee can taste."
1,"Best thing to remove coffee stains from your pot We bought a new coffee maker that came with a stainless steel carafe. After six months or so, the insides started getting dark no matter how many times we washed it. My wife tried vinegar and a bottle brush which helped a little. I remembered a product called ""Dip-it"" my mother used to use. I looked in grocery stores, department stores and specialty stores. No one had heard of it. I should have gone to Amazon.Com first.Following the directions on the box and letting the carafe soak for about 1/2 hour, it was spotless, like a brand new pot. I'm glad I opted to buy a box of 8. This is the only cleaner I'll ever use on my coffee pots."
1,Dip-IT Food and Beverage Stain Remover Dip-It Food & Beverage Stain Remover: 5 OZI love this product! Try it to remove the residual coffee stains from an insulated coffee pot! Your coffee tastes fresh again!
1,"So what? Okay, ditto on the Spencer/Stone/Parker fan interested to see how he handles a female heroine. Okay, ditto on the similarities between Spencer/Sunny, right down to the dog. But to it all I say a resounding so what? By the end of the book, I was so interested and attached to Sunny, Richie, Spike, Brian, Millicent, and ever her mother, I didn't care! So, write on, Robert (all puns intended)! Long may you type!!"
1,"Parker's back, full throttle! The best Parker I've read in ages, tho even his lesser books are great fun. Sunny is sharp, wise, funny, tough - the writing sings, and the character descriptions made me laugh. I'd rank this right up there with the best Spenser (Early Autumn, Looking for Rachel Wallace). Parker is back in touch with his twinkle, and his love of women -and at the peak of his form. Best in genre I've read in years."
1,"The very best of Moby...if you are not the usual Moby fan. If you are not interested in the dull, grey, median, this cd is for you. Moby is flirting with the edges of the extreme, from trashy songs like Someone To Love and Heavy Flow to songs that are themselves a mix like Say It's All Mine towards the more usual Moby stuff. A pity most Moby fans don't like this.I don't see him do better than this ever..."
1,"I love this one This is the perfect marriage of heavy and soft via Moby. Who knew that the little electronica man had metal in him?It's amazing, and remains my favorite Moby album by far. ""Face It"" is the best!"
1,Great Series and Great Author I have enjoyed every book written by David Moody and the whole Autumn Series is awesome. He does a great job writing about human reactions to desperate situations and if your tired of happy endings then you will love any book by David Moody.
1,"Excellent product If you are like me and hate your foot slipping to the front of the shoe, this product is for you. It also provides extra cushioning and works with pumps, peep toe, sandals, boots and sneakers mary jane style. I've used it for years and so far no complaints!!!! This product is available at drug stores but a much higher price (between $6.99 and $10.99). For me the affordability offered through Amazon is the cherry on top!! I recommend this product!!"
1,"Excellent book for history buffs and sci-fi fans Harry Turtledove, master of alternate history, shows his flair for writing with this tome. This book shows what would have occurred had aliens attacked the Earth during World War II. Turtledove's grasp of history shines through with his treatment of major figures (FDR, Churchill, etc.) and weapons. Among the strange things that occur (and they are legion) is a British bombing raid protected by GERMAN fighters. In this first of the Worldwar series, the aliens attack and the Earth desperately tries to unite to repel the otherworldly invaders. Read this book."
1,"A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE Being a WWII buff I was in the bookstore one day picking up books about WWII that I thought might be good reading. When I got home and looked at the cover of WORLD WAR: IN THE BALANCE I saw the words ""alternate history"". That's when I said to myself ""OH NO!, What kind of silly book did I manage to pick up this time?"". When I started reading it though I became so captivated that I literally couldn't put it down till I finished it. I was so addicted that I had to read TILTING THE BALANCE, then I had to read UPSETTING THE BALANCE, and finally I had to read STRIKING THE BALANCE. The worst part is waiting for the sequel books to arrive after you've ordered them if you've already finished reading the first one. Excellent reading, and highly reccommended to all people as a must read...."
1,Skijor with Your Dog Love this book! Used it to gain plenty of knowledge as to the fun sport of Skijoring. I was able to confidently start up this sport and referenced the book many many times...we better understood how to set up our dogs for the sport without the trial and error process. I loved being knowledgable about the sport while introducing my dogs to it. Did this for fun..never tried it for the racing aspect but I would have felt very confident moving towards this aspect of this sport.
1,Great messenger bag!!! Bungalow360 makes great stuff! This whale bag was a great gift idea!!! They offer bags with different animals that are cutely designed!
1,"Great songs with an even better twist! All of the songs on here are covers of older song except for the last one ""Brave Reality"", but please do not let that stop you from getting this CD if you are a fan of Evergreen Terrace. They have done an exceptional job at makeing some good classic songs even better. They still manage to keep that sound we all know, love and expect from Evergreen Terrace. This CD gets better and better everytime I listen to it. It has from Tears for Fears ( Mad world) to Smashing pumpkins and offspring. Its a little sort only having 10 songs but what would you prefer, a CD with 10 great songs or a cd where you only listen to one or two songs then switch cds? Ill let you decide but I give this cd my full recomendation."
1,"In case of fire - grab this cd first I love these guys. They're extremely tallented and they put a spin on songs that are at best mediocre and make them phenominal. I know this wasn't meant to be a huge cd for them, but damn skippy, they did it anyway."
1,"excellent l love this bracelet, everybody in my office asked me where i bougth it...I recommend it to women that want to look fresh, nice and well dressed..."
1,wonderful Idea especially for Hill Side Landscape As I web searching a lot of Hill side design and idea. Finally got this wonderful / Beautiful design. I can't imagine moving thousand and thousand stone and set up on the Hill side. Made the slope become beautiful just by 2 manpower. I like it !!
1,sacred tune i just started it but already enjoying it - i really enjoy all of her books and the book came in very good condition
1,"Weeds Season Four This wacky series of soccer mom, Nancy Botwin never seems to disappoint. Wildly entertaining."
1,"Simplemente maravillosa Esta serie ha sido desde la primer temporada simplemente adictiva para mi, se las recomiendo a todos..."
1,"Great show! Great cast! Cant wait for season 5! The first time I watched weeds I didnt like it. For some reason I watched another episode and absolutely fell in love with it. I now own seasons 1-3 and have just preordered season 4 (which I have already seen on showtime). The cast is great. I really like Kevin Nealon's character, absolutely hilarious!If for some reason you are having doubts as to buying this season, believe me, it is as good if not better than the other 3. I would encourage you to start from season 1 (which is also cheap on amazon.com) so you can see all the character development. Season 4 is great on it's own(it was the first season I watched prior to buying 1-3) but watching the other 3 first would make it even better!"
1,Great series A must have series. On the lines of Sherman Oaks if anyone actually saw it). Hats off too showtime. I only wish i could find the Sherman Oaks series on Amazon.
1,"Great series..... The video is in good quality and DVD was shipped in 3 days without having to pay for extra costs. It was hard finding Season 4 at any department store, book store or electonic store. You'll definately enjoy season 4 it flys by and you'll be tired the next day cuz you stayed up all night watching ENJOY"
1,"realy great show realy liked the show, was nice to watch when the boys where at school or sleeping, always kept me wondering what was next.!"
1,"Grinning ear to ear If you liked ONE LUCKY LORD, you'll love THE ABDUCTION OF JULIA. I found myself laughing out loud in some spots, and falling in love with the hero, Alec.The only bad part was that it ended too soon. This is one reader who is eagerly anticipating Ms. Hawkins next release."
1,A KEEPER! I enjoyed this book immensely. The characters were very fun to read. The heroine was very spunky and hero was wonderful. She is a dedicated reform worker from America and he is a rake from England. She marries him so he could take possession of his fortune. She wants a portion of the fortune so she can continue her charity work. She has loved him for many years and he falls in love with her after he marries her. Her cousin and his cousin are trying to foil his attempts at getting the fortune. This was a great book. I cannot wait for her next one.
1,Wonderful read! I thought this book was wonderful. It captured my interest right from the beginning and held it to the end. I was able to connect with the characters right away so I felt like I had a vested interest in the outcome. Karen Hawkins is a very talented writer. When I got to the end of the book I found myself wishing she would do a book on Alec's friend Lucien. I picked up the second book of hers I had ordered that day and it was about Lucien! I am reading that now and am just as enthralled with it.
1,"love it This ink is so durable and the color is great. Just what I want. Oh, I bought several bottles in 2006. It is still good."
1,"Wonderful book! This book arrived really fast. I already had a copy of this book; I purchased a copy for a friend because I think it's great. It's great for beginners, or writers who feel blocked."
1,"Wanna see it in use? I really didn't plan on writin a *movie*, but I was looking for something that would serve as a cheerleader and coach, a mentor with a deadline, to get me to write and finish SOMETHING, hopefully in a relatively short about of time."
1,"If you can't get past page 60... I am a working screenwriter, and this is the only screenwriting book I recommend. Why? Most of the screenwriting books out there are very useful - for rewriting. This book actually gets you to complete the first draft - a huge hurdle for beginning writers. You probably won't finish in 21 days, and the draft you write probably won't be very good. But that doesn't matter, because you will finish a draft, and then you can rewrite it and make it good.I still use this book to clarify my thinking, or if I'm on a tight deadline."
1,"Awesome, ignore reviewers that DO NOT read the manual I personally have been using this fountain for three years now and PLEASE read the instruction manual PEOPLE! ( im only saying this because I know for a fact ppl did not do it correctly and made a bad review for their ignorance)You have to put the pump in the water for it to cycle the water back into the machine, once the pump is placed CORRECTLY you will hear no sounds of the pump. You also can control how fast you want the water to flow , which is wonderful. You may have slow flow which sounds like a slow moving creek or turn the water up and you can enjoy sounds of rain, from sprinkles to raining hard! Hope this helps, and everyone please read manuals when you buy something, haha :)"
1,"Not just for women This book has turned my head around concerning marriage, love and sex. Even at 58 years old, she taught me about things that I always had questions about but was unable to even formulate the REAL question so I could deal with a long term marraige that has become boring. I now have direction and purpose. This is a must read for all genders and ages if you want to, really live life."
1,"Love these! I love these, they making shipping items so much easier and are a lot cheaper than bubble envelopes. I don't have to worry about them getting torn and products being lost or stolen."
1,Great buy These mailers are a great value. They are thick enough to hold items securely and seal well. I would reccomend them.
1,Favorite Christmas Album! You'll love this album! I have lots of Christmas music but 'Christmas Under the Western Sky' is without a doubt my favorite! It's a collection of Christmas classics performed in an easy listening but upbeat country instrumental sound that is never tiring.
1,Replacement Cord This cord has a straight plug into the back of the receiver. Much better design than original cord with 90 degree bend.
1,"Surprized If you like campy, independant horror flicks, you should enjoy this one. Not too cheesy and not too serious- The acting is pretty good and the special effects are decent. The storyline is fairly well-developed for a movie of this nature. I thought the ending was very good. Also reccommended: The Seven Doors of Death and The Dead Hate The Living."
1,"Not what you think-100X better! I bought this book because I needed some motivation in life and was expecting just that. What I got was a book that motivates, clarifies, and changes your perception, which if you think about it, when you are lacking motivation that is usually the cause. Each section, their are 100, tends to blow my mind in some way, and causes me to think-Wow! I have recommended this book to everyone I love. Do not call this a self help help book! This book clears the dust out of your mind and makes you feel a little bit superior, because you may be thinking better thoughts than the rest."
1,"very effective simple. states the obvious, but easily forgotten ways necessary to achieve success.very practical, with nice analogies and specific examples from life."
1,"Shocked. I'm a reader of self-help since the 80's and am not usually shocked after reading a self-help book, but I am with this one, this book actually left me feeling happy, motivated and inspired. I can't say I feel that way every time I'm done reading a book, but with this one I was, so if your feeling stuck, lost or unhappy then this book may be for you. I Loved the format, short and to the point, great references, tips and ideas, it's a fast read, a book you can't put down."
1,"100 Ways to Improve Your Life One could easily pass over this book by simply looking at the title. Chandler's suggestions will not just motivate you, if you follow them they can change your life. His suggestions are based on his own experience. He is passing on what has actually worked for him and his clients so his comments are rock solid. One of these suggestions is worth the price of the book"
1,"the best This is the best book for motivation. It's easy to read, but the sentences keep in your mind for months (maybe for years) so you can practice them."
1,"LOVE BARBARA HAMBLY For years, I have loved Barbara Hambly's fantasy novels, but wasn't sure how I would take to a non-fantasy from her. I shouldn't have worried - she has such a magical way with words that she could probably write a cookbook and make it spellbinding. Sold Down The River is the fourth book in the Benjamin January novels and, like the first three, will keep you up all night reading."
1,"atlanta/time A excellant CD/DVD single,from these extremely talented musicians,there stage performances like there music is exciting ,and an extravaganza .If you liked there follow up album SHINE these two extra tracks are BRILLIANT!too.A welcome addition for a devoted fan like myself of these dashingly beautiful talented ladies.GREAT MUSIC."
1,Good start When I purchased my LRH Magic Molder I purchased this and several other plug profile cutters.One reason is I used this to find the centerline of the unit on my tablesaw with a zero clearance insert and also needed it for a profile in molding I am making. All profile cutters are sharp and cut well with no chatter. Nice product and well worth the money spent!
1,Work great I purchased one of these last year for a relative who lives abroad and she is very happy with it and uses it a lot. Her daughter who also has neck problems tried it and loved it too so this year I am sending one to her as well. Good stuff.
1,tall stainless pasta canister is a must have Excellent product for price. Great storage for long pasta products and is a sleek and updated design. I will buy more!!!
1,"Pumpkin sexy hair Love this product. My hair is soft and smells great. I looked everywhere for it but sadly, it has been discontinued."
1,Very much worth the money! Our daughter is 6yrs old and this is her 1st musical instrument! She has played none stop for the past 3 days and has already picked up the flash cards that came with the guitar. Next are guitar lessons!
1,"A poignant book from the best! Roger Tory Peterson author and artist of many bird guides, writes a wonderful 'chapter book' with wonderful illustrations for the young. It brought back memories of my father, my first fellow birder. An excellent book!"
1,"Barely behaving This is a great read as everything written by Jennifer labrecque. This writter cautivates the reader through the whole story with sensuality and laughs.The moment veterinarian Niall Fortson spies Tammy Cooper sunbathing in the nude, he knows his new neighbor is naughty-and a knockout. With a bad reputation and a bad attitude, Tammy has trouble written all over her. And though Niall isn't looking for a scandal, he can't resist her. Luckily Tammy has a solution to cure them of their mutual case of lust-a two-week secret affair....before they were barely behaving!Tammy soon realizes the boy next door is almost more man than she can handle. And she's enjoying handling him -a little to much. After all, someone with her track record is all wrong for a guy dreaming of white picket fences. Still Niall's determined to be more to Tammy than just a boy toy. And with the way he makes her feel, Tammy's inclined to let him convince her..."
1,"Terrific plot and acting, wise and warm - a classic! I never write raves. But this is a very underestimated film. The screenplay is spare and polished. The actors - sublime. Regina Case is amazing in this role. Should have won all kinds of awards. Completely absorbing. Best film I've seen in a long time.No violence, restrained sex - real life, with somebody you are really rooting for."
1,"AWESOME i hate american rap. it is so lame. it was hot when it first came out like 25 years ago, now its just lame. now Uk heads are making this sick grime stuff overseas, i think US needs to watch out and rethink where we are heading."
1,"Still an excelent book Almost in each project which I write I find this book to be valuebale.If you are willing to put more time on ant than just to know the trivial parts, than you must read this book, no matter what.You will learn how ant works on all types of projects (web, EJB, web services etc...).D. Orbach[...]"
1,"The Worst Witch Collection - very nice short stories. Very nice stories. Liked the 3-volume box set. Wish it came in DVD format. Nonetheless, it is a great product. Enjoyed very much. Sincerely, L."
1,"The best reference for medical transcriptionists. Since I am new at transcription, I needed a great reference book to be at my side. This book is great because its sections are in alphabetical order - if you need to find out the correct spelling for ""mid portion"" you simply turn to the ""M"" section, and there is ""mid"" and the different and correct uses for the word. I have used this book frequently and I haven't seen a book for transcription that has been this useful."
1,Easy to use and very informative! I was surprised by how easy this book is to use. I can very quickly find the information I need and get back to work. I love having the AAMT style guidelines at my fingertips!
1,Time Life Presents: Soul Celebration Vol. 2 Yes I enjoyed it very much. Yes I would recommend this to someone. I am a fan of old school.
1,"Deliciously inventive and surprising What a treat this collection is.Deaver is lke a masterful pitcher who keeps changing speeds and spins to keep you off balance. Almost every one of these stories delivers a twist that is deliciously inventive and surprising. As a previous reviewer wrote, ""Triangle"" is particularly clever.My least favorite was the Lincoln Rhymes Christmas tale, which was too long and sentimental. But that's a small quibble. Overall, Deaver succeeds marvelously."
1,"nice I liked this. I read it twice & gave it to a friend to read. It had some surprising endings, and what I liked best was I didn't have to read through lots of details to get to them."
1,"A treat and another star in Deaver's crown for this O.Henryesque anthology of short and yes, very twisted and unique short stories. Each one can stand alone; yet packaged and tied with a bow in this manner, they give the reader a present that opens anew with each and every turn of the page.If you imagaine that you can outwit this author and surmise what the twist will be, you have another think coming. How versatile Deaver is in his range of scenarios, in his wild and wonderful surprise endings; in his choice of characters and his imaginative prose!I recommend this collection to anyone who wishes to be entertained, enlightened and absolutely thrilled to the bone. An exciting and memorable read by the author who has easily soared to first place on my list. I had just finished his 'Speaking in Tongues' when I picked up 'Twisted' and was given hours of reading bliss. Don't miss any of Jeffrey Deaver's works; he is truly gifted!"
1,"Pravana Leave-In Treatment is a necessity for me. My step daughter introduced me to Pravana Intense Leave-In Treatment several years ago and I've been hooked on it ever since. I have dry, natural wavy hair that is frizzy when it's humid outside. Pravana helps control these frizzies. Several of the girls I work with complained of static when brushing their hair so I gave then samples of my Pravana. They too are now faithful users. Oh, and it smells wonderful!!!"
1,"Detangles My Long, Thick, Wavy Hair It really did a great job detangling my hair, actually better than most other products I have tried. I like how it makes my hair feel soft without weighing it down."
1,"Perhapsnotwhatyouexpected...... As a recent ""first time listener"" to this piece (shame on me), I was most pleasantly impressed. I expected the music to be more challenging to the ear. That's usually just fine but the dominance of melody in the songs definitely wasn't a hard thing to handle. Each song seems to have its own individual approach - superb orchestrations by the legendary Mr. Bedford, some tender balladry, some Frank Zappa stylings, some blaring ""War of the Worlds"" horns (after all, we MUST have a few challenging parts). Well worth repeated listenings. I know that for long time fans of this music, the alternate song versions are deservedly welcome, but I would have wished for some unreleased original studio material."
1,wow really good songs I didn't think there is any good rock coming out new anymore this new Saga cd is really good. well musicianships really good and the songs I was surprised how good the songs are. they are still putting out good music which is why nobody will hear it cuz if you have talent and if you play good it won't be heard. you play like you don't know what you're doing then you make money I'm glad I got this saga cd if your a fan of good songs good musicianship or saga you'll love this CD
1,"Through the Narrow Gate In ""Through the Narrow Gate,""Karen Armstrong gives a poinant description of the 7 years that she spent in a convent. She entered an especially austere order with precepts based upon the military, predicated upon Victorianism, upon the misoginy inherent within the patriarical structure of the Catholic Church, upon a revered masochism, and upon a form of brain washing meant to destroy the ego of a novice, supposedly in order to fashion that novice's personage into a more humble, more devout entity. Ms. Armstrong herself is not harshly critical of the Church or of the particular order, but readers no doubt will come to these crucial judgments themselves. We can only rejoice that such contorted religious training has been abolished."
1,"Through the Narrow Gate This book is very simply written but portrays the joy and difficulty of being a religious sister at the time this young woman entered. Since I was a religious and left, I found a lot of what she said helpful in validating my experience."
1,"Great skillet for cooks This is a very good skillet. It retains heat well, cooks with little or no oil and is a breeze to clean."
1,"Ms. Freda Chao Madden This skillet is perfect for a large omlett which you can put anything you like. I love it. I hope it will last longer than my last one which was as heavy as this one, but only lasted three years."
1,"Perfect little non stick pan Great construction, great coating. My wife said it is the perfect fried egg pan, she said she has yet to burn something in it."
1,"Best Non-stick I've ever owned It's a bit heavy, which I actually like in comparison to my cheaply made lighter pans. After about a week of daily use, this is absolutely my favorite pan. Heats up quickly, totally non-stick, so much that you don't even need half as much oil or butter as usual, nothing burns on, and it cleans up easily. The soft grip handle is comfortable, a nice plus. Would definitely recommend."
1,"A surprisingly nice pan I've gotten spoiled by >$200 Demeyere stainless/copper cookware, but needed a non-stick pan for eggs. From everything I've read, non-stick pans all eventually scratch, flake, or otherwise wear out, so it's not worth buying a $200 lifetime pan in non-stick. For the money, this is an excellent pan -- I'd compare it against anything else. The handle is firmly attached, comfortable, and stays cool, while the non-stick surface is smooth and non-stick.The one thing I miss about Demeyere vs. this pan is the rivets vs. welded attachment of the handle. Especially for non-stick, having an entirely non-stick interior with no odd shapes would make the pan even better. I'm not sure why other pan vendors don't weld their handles on -- it takes a little bit more work, but it makes the pan a lot more functional and easier to maintain."
1,"Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized 8"" skillet The fry pan was really well. It doesn't stick and you hardly have to use any butter or oil. I works so well that I'm going to order the next size up to complete the set. I wanted to make sure it worked first before purchasing a larger size. I bought two other skillets that didn't work at all."
1,"Great Skillets I have bought all three now: 8in, 10in, and 12in and they are the best skillets I've ever had. Very heavy duty."
1,excellent. great pan This is my go-to pan. Cooks great for one and cleans in a snap. After much research--this is the pan for me.
1,great cookware this is my 4th anolon advanced purchase. they are made to last. i am slowly replacing all my pans with these.
1,"Sex Pistols live! Filth and the Fury is a great documentary from director Julian Temple on the Sex Pistol's.Film shows how the Pistol's became England's public enemy#1 in 1976 and 1977 by shaking up the status quo.They went against the grain and took no prisoners. The main speaker is Johnny Rotten,and he gives his version of the story,which sounds a lot better than their manager,Mclaren.Has a great interview with Sid in 1978,a year before his death,he seems quite lively and funny, and it's quite sad that he died at 21.Overall a great flick."
1,"great docu Great docu on the band. With great footage of England in the 70's. Great band footage and lot's of great interviews. I laso reviewed the book. It's pretty cool, but this dvd is awesome. Great insight into the whole time period of how bleak everything was. And how they came together to create something that no one realized would become the voice of the youth for a decade. Great film."
1,"Hunting Badger Scores High Tony Hillerman scores again with his riveting tale of greed and pursuit in the American West. His descriptions of the landscape of the Navajo reservation are just masterful. The characters are well developed and the story is beautifully crafted as usual. If you haven't read any of the Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee stories this is a good one to introduce you to the world of the Navajo. Hillerman is a great story teller and ""Hunting Badger"" will keep you turning pages until the end."
1,This book makes you think it out! I hated for the book to end. It left waiting impatiently for the next one.
1,Nu-salt This salt doesn't have any sodium chloride in it and something else in it that gives it a little tingle on the tongue.
1,"Great Album for new aged music lovers! I bought this CD 1) because I love Cibo Matto 2) Because I am a new aged music listener my self, and 3)Cibo Matto`s lyrics dont have to be understandable to say what is said. The beats and techno style music I think is going to be the music people in the future are going to be listening to the most. NOT COUNTRY!"
1,"I Can't Stop Listening to It I had never heard of Cibo Matto, but I read a review of Stereotype A in the LA Times which seemed to indicate it would appeal to me. So I listened to some sound samples and then took a flyer and bought the album.All I can say is I am absolutely under this album's spell. I cannot get over how good and interesting and moving and funky it is. It is fantastic and has rarely been out of my car's CD player. When friend's hear it they all say ""This is great. Who is it?""...""Cibo who?"" Best Album of 1999 in my opinion"
1,">_< This is dne of the best books in the world!!!! I fell in love with this book as soon as I read the 5th book, A darkest hour! I've been reading all the Warriors series ever since!!!! Please don't stop writing these excellent books@!!!"
1,"Just sample it.......please ! I iâ€˜m the biggest â€œhunger gamesâ€œ fan ever, but i would have to say these book are almost better! You have showed me erin hunter â€œnever judge a book by its cover â€œ so please just sample it."
1,"warriors rule! I havnt yet read this book (and i cant wait to) but i read all the warriors books up to this one, and i enjoyed every one of them. Me and my friens even made up numerous names for ourselves and clans. i am Pinestar leader of ForestClan and Mintwhisper medicine cat of FroestClan. i love so many warriors characters such as Leafpaw, Sandstom, Sorreltail and more. buy this book and the entire rest of the series youll enjoy it!"
1,Txighovohckhvkhvkhvihi It was really good I think people will like this book bchchffbbfhfh Chubb church. Changing funding. Find entrenched this finch fish disobedience
1,"Romantic minimalism at it's best! One of the calmest, yet vibrant collection of songs I have heard in years. The way it presents itself is at first almost unnoticeable - like a rain in the forest which plays itself out and crescendos like the force of a waterfall. Meditation music has never been so beautiful."
1,"For Christians who like Classic Rock I'm a long time listener of Glass Harp and Phil Keaggy. I'm not a music critic, so this review will be simple. This is a good classic rock album for people who like the Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel. They're kind of mellow on this album. Phil Keaggy has some great guitar solos (made even more amazing by the fact that he has only 9 fingers)."
1,"THE definitive study of monastic life at the high tide of the Benedictine tradition. The most compelling feature of this relatively short book is its level of detail about monastic life at Cluny over two and a half centuries. I've read several books on the topic, and none match the granularity and scholarship of Evans' work. Why is this book out of print?"
1,"Best of the Year! alittle bit of everything Llanas's sings with so much emotion, every song is believable"
1,"Grammy winner - just needs promotion! Sam Llanas of Bodeans displays his immense songwriting talents - a personal album, but addicting, as the best music can be. Thanks, Sam & Absinthe boys (& girls), keep it up...."
1,"Sweet sword must buy i bought this same sword at the mall. it is a fine quality sword good balance, a fine piece."
1,"Bronson's Final Bow Charles Bronson gives his final performance as Police Commissioner Paul Fein in this very good telefilm. It may not be the best movie, but Bronson gives it his best and goes out in style. Highly recommended for any Bronson fan."
1,"first soundboming 2 now sway & tech 99 seems to be the year of mix tapes first soundbombing two now this what next? this cd is phat from what ive heard. ive already heard the anthem, get you mad by Eminem, and Chino XL's joint and belive me ill be picking this one up."
1,"Fresher than fresh! To all you gangsters out there! This is hip-hop in its purest form and this is how it should be. All this gun, money, Versace, and crystal talk in today's rap just plain wack. So, know your hip-hop and buy this dope mix tape! (ya heard') P.S. Watch out for those ""sucka emcees."""
1,"Blew Me Away I am going to keep this review brief, but if you are on the fence about buying this stop thinking and do. It's one of the most poetic and musical film(s). Although the films are short they are dense and pack just as much of a punch than any full length film. Definitely worth it."
1,"Best Shoes EVER I have always had problems with shoes fitting. These have been the best shoes I have ever had. I have problems with my left foot after tearing all the ligaments, these have been a life saver."
1,Excellent shoe for the price This shoe is cushiony and comfortable. Rooming toe box is a plus also.As good as Nike TL4 for less than half the price.
1,"This cd is raw! i just bought this cd, and i can alreayd tell that this cd is as good as his last. i just listened to track 17, that is the chillest SONG EVER! if you are a no limit fan this is a must have!"
1,"GET THE ALBUM I DO NOT KNOW WHY YOU, MR. EAGAN,MN,IS DISSING FIEND AND HE'S NEW ALBUM IT IS GOING TO BE THE BOMB. AND SO WANT HE HAS TO MUCH SWEARING WHO DOES'NT. SO WATCH ""STREET LIFE"" IS GOING TO BE 2x PLATNIUM JUST WATCH, YOU'LL SEE."
1,Babe review This is a very endearing film. This is a movie any one of any age can enjoy. My toddler watches it and has learned alot about caring and kindheartedness. My 68 year old father in law watched it and loved it just as much! It's one of the few films you can feel good about seeing and can watch over and over again and enjoy it every time!
1,"One of my favorite movies of all time. I'm a 22 year old guy, and I love this flick, it's great family fun, and Even I like it haha. It's got a ton of adorable animals and a pretty good story line. A must have if you have any kid under 13 years old, or just dorky kids like me!!"
1,"the movie is the best, and better than the new one! the talking mice are hilarious!The pig thinks he's a sheep pig!The movie is the best of pig movies! The puppies are so cute!!!!!!!"
1,"Pig of Destiny A fable celebrating the triumph of the improbable in the face of convention. Clever use of storybook titles, narrative, lighting & music make this a captivating experience. Ntl Soc Film Critics, Best Film. Golden Globe Best Film (music / comedy). 6 Academy Award nominations incl Best Director"
1,"Who can forget the goose having a hissy fit at the window? The movie Babe is so completely filled with memorable and hilarious gags and scenes and one-liners that it's hard to pick a favorite.I'm a sheep pig.Baa-Ram-Ewe.The goose flapping outside the window.The farmer's wife passing out on the motel bed.Etc., etc., etc...Marvelous, marvelous tale of a little pig on an Australian farm who is adopted by the farmer's border collie and trained to herd sheep. The improbable movie turned into the surprise hit of 1995, the video has probably been bought by more families than any other film of recent memory. With its message of hope and salvation, it's a hilarious and sentimental film you can watch again and again."
1,"Amazing and moving! The dvd is great for Spanish as well as English speaking households. Both languages are well dubbed and the cinematography is magnificently beautiful. The Spanish version contributes a quirkier, more ethnic humor that just cannot be translated into English. Highly recommended, you will want to see it over and over again. Wish there was a widescreen version."
1,"A TRESURED, CHARMING, & SO CUTE! This has beed on my top favorite movie lists since i was 2 years old. the songs are GREAT! It reminds me of my childhood. This story has talking animals but they don't talk to humans. It is very sweet and charming and you will be missing out on a lot of you don't watch it! Great family movie!"
1,"the best! suitable for wide span of ages, adults included... beautifully made. One of my favorite ""kid"" movies of all time! watch it"
1,Perfect Classic This dvd should be in every collection of great movies. We loved it the first time andactually re-watch in at least once a year. Good old fashion love story between man and pig.
1,Voted movie of the Decade in my hometown In my hometown of New Brighton Pennsylvania Dundee 2 was voted movie of the decade. The story line was a bit complikated for most of us to handle but we felt it was the movie that best represended our small town. Hogan was brilliant. A must see.
1,"Better than advertised This is my second piece of Analon cookware and I really do ""love it"". It's just the right size for not worrying if something is going to run over the sides while cooking on high heat. It's heavy duty and nonstick as advertised. I will buy this as a gift for someone else in the future."
1,"No more burning things, easy cleaning I've used this pan a few months now, and the non-stick part is still working just fine. I usually just rinse in really hot water, and wipe it clean. This pan heats evenly, and has solved my burning problems on my all electric stove, especially at the center of previous pans. I has nice square sides so the food isn't always trying to slide to the middle, so it effectively gives you more usable cooking space. One hidden gotcha, the manualy saw to never use more than medium heat, but it cooks just fine at medium since the heat is spread out better. You might need another pan if you want to seer something over high heat, however, but that's probably true of any non-sitck coating."
1,Walking the walk you talk. I appreciate this author because he speaks from experience. He uses a straight forward approach which I also relate too. The book is in excellent condition as have been all the used books I have purchased. Thank you. Signa
1,Raw & Ballsy Raw & ballsy... Jimmy at his best. Like no one else. He'll rip your heart out and rock you out of any stupor you may be in. Get it and be amazed.
1,"Geezers stay excited... Excellent album after a few listens. Love the concept of how Brits ""invented the language"" not us Yanks so don't tell us Brits how to speak. :-)Each album has been different, and that shows artistic development (not that Mike Skinner needed to prove that to me).Would be nice to have some Grime or Drum'n'Bass remixes to play in the clubs. How bout it Mikey?"
1,music raw&hard jimi talks and plays with the crowd and then explores and unloads then steps back and re-aims.that's what this disc sounds like to me.he can solo and groove and keep people in the palm of his hands and then stop on a dime.this is a must have for folks who enjoy sheer raw talent and history .jimi was ahead of the curve.
1,"EXCELLENT, BUT DISHONEST A good mix, much better than the '94 botch-job. A few criticisms however. Kramer did make tracks like 'Spanish Castle Magic' & 'Lover Man' listener-friendly by editing out Lee's lead guitar, but in doing so he has altered the character of the original performances. They are good examples of Gypsy Sun & Rainbows band workouts. [Brilliant but flawed.] Why alter the truth? 'Jam Back at the House' could have been left unedited too. Gone are both the percussionists' solo and Mitch's drum solo. Why? The lax percussion break offers the song a little space. Apart from these minor complaints the rest of the tracks are well edited."
1,great I love this book just as much as i love 'The Last One.' I feel that this is a great book for all guys and girls that like things about angels and demons. it is very well written an d while reading it i found myself not wanting to stop. so for a short time i was late doing my homework as well as my lesson plans.
1,"great movie i love this movie, the second one isn't that great but the price was so great for the double feature that i opted from purchasing just the 1st movie, great price"
1,"Kevin Ayers and this whole world How one band, let alone one English town, could've produced both a Robert Wyatt and a Kevin Ayers is beyond my imagination. I'm not familiar with Kevin's later works, but of his early post Soft Machine work, i find this to be the most challenging and rewarding. The album is four tracks long, though all are the containers for several lovely songs that are pieced together through sound collages and disjointed jams. Fans of Gorkys Zygotic Mynchi, Super Furrys, and OTC should definitly give this a try. I would suggest also ordering it directly from the label's (BGO Records) website where it can be purchased for 10 pounds."
1,"Excellent, Fun read This is a cool book. I love his writing style and the information was very helpful to me.PLUS, I worked with Ken for years and never knew he was a mountain man with a beard!!"
1,"A MUST For Any Library This is one of the BEST books that I have found. Not only does the author tell you important information, she has a great sense of humor and style. This book not only tells you what herbs to use for what purpose, she also tells you how to grow them. I found this book just in time to start my own garden. I found so much important information, and now have a great garden growing. I have recommended this book to all my friends."
1,"garden witchery As a beginner, I found this book informative and enjoyable.It was easy for me to understand and i came away with wonderful ideas for my small Magikal Garden.I now also understand why I feel so good in my small Garden space!!!Chalice"
1,"Perfectly Magickal ~*~ This was my first introduction into the world of Ellen Dugan and a pleasant surprise. I was excited to find a book that combined my love of gardening and my growing curiosity of Wicca or the Pagan lifestyle. Ms. Dugan writes in a simplistic manner that is very easy to follow. She includes humor, folklore, and shares her experiences, thus making for an enjoyable read. I also find myself using this book as a reference of sort. She includes items such a flower correspondence, spells, rituals, and creating an environment. This book has suggestions for everyone!You may be surprised...you may have a new sparkle ~*~ when working out in your garden!I would recommend this book for the new, emerging, and curious reader. Someone with an open mind and who can appreciate all that nature has to offer. Take a stroll down the garden path and create a little magick of your own.Enjoy..."
1,"Informative and Pragmatic I also would like to disagree with the reader from Jersey who completely slammed Garden Witchery. As a gardener with a couple years experience, I found this book to be quite useful. This book includes help/ideas on how to plan a garden, it goes over the different types of gardens, has info on pH levels in soil, fertilization, how to take care of your garden (i.e. pruning, dead-heading, etc.) and also includes fun ""magical"" correspondences to plants, flowers and trees. If you love to garden, you will enjoy this book, even if you're not into the whole ""magical"" aspect of it all. Even then, that information is at least fun and interesting to read. Honestly, when I was finished with the book, I wanted to run out and plant pumpkins! Read the book- you'll see..."
1,"Outstanding cookware This is my first piece of Anolon cookware, and it definitely will not be my last. While a bit pricey, it is an excellent piece of workmanship, heats evenly and fairly quickly, cleans up very nicely with just hot water. It has become my go-to pot for items like hot cereal, rice and thick sauces. The lid fits beautifully; the lid's handle will get hot during long, slow cooking (no surprise), but the pot's handle usually stays quite safe to handle (unless I let the gas flame get too high, and overlap the sides of the pot).Definitely gets my evaluation of excellence."
1,"The Best Place to Learn About Reformed Christian Theology I have been reading through this edition of the Institutes for a little over seven months with the goal to finish it within a year. I have finished the first volume and have started the second. I am learning so much from Calvin's writings which teach me why I believe what I believe. I am much better informed when defending orthodox Christianity than I ever have been before. You can follow my progress at [...].This is a very easy to read translation unlike several others I have looked at before. The index is great for looking up doctrine based on key words or Scripture passages.If you are looking to purchase a copy of the Institutes, this is the one that I would recommend. It seems to be the one that most seminaries are currently using as well. There is a book calledAnalysis of the Institutes of the Christian Religion of John Calvinthat is a perfect companion to this edition of the Institutes."
1,"The only reference you will need for the exam I'm somewhat of a certification junkie (MCP, MCSD, SCP, and now SCWCD) so I've had my fair share of good and bad certification books.With a basic understanding of JSP and this book, I took the exam and broke the record for the highest mark at the testing centre.This is one of the few books that will likely get you certified without prior J2EE reading or experience. (Assuming you are familiar with J2SE)"
1,"Excellent book I work as a contractor and I had to get the SCWCD certification because my company forced me to. I bought this book mainly for this purpose and I am very much satisfied with it as I passed the exam with 93%.I have been working with JSP/Servlets for an year now, and I had no intention to spend a lot of time in studying for the certification. I just wanted to cram the required stuff and get it over with. However, while reading this book, I really felt like reading it because it is filled with information and the writing style is so easy going.I would recommend it even if one is not studying for the certification."
1,"A must have book for certification This is a best book i have read for a long time. A must have book for SCWCD exam. All aspects of an exam are covered throughly and in depth. I recently passed an exam just studying this book.The language used is very easy to follow and all examples are explained fully. I think it would not be wrong to say, anybody learning Servlets and JSP must read this book before refering to any other resource. I give 6 stars to it out of 5.Looking forward to some more good things form the same Authors. I will be the first one to buy."
1,"Perfect book for SCWCD as well as JSP/Servlets in general!!! I just took the SCWCD after finishing this book. This is THE book to read for cracking the SCWCD! And not only is this the perfect study guide, but it also explains in a most lucid manner several aspects of JSP/Servlets that may have been difficult to grasp before. In short, as good as it gets!"
1,"Great book!!! This book covers pretty much all areas in JSP and Servlets for Web developers exam preparation. It covers J2EE and even Tomcat in details. Worth buying not only for exam preparedness, but, also as a reference guide for all your answers to the Web development using Java."
1,"best certification book I've read Many others have sang praise of this book. Suffice it to say, they are correct. This is a great book -- not just to pass this certification, but also a great reference.I passed with 93% after studying it for 12 days and it took me 43 minutes to write a 90 minute exam.I know this exam can be passed by doing a brain dump. But I didn't do that. I read and understood all the concepts in the book, and it was more than enough to do well on this exam."
1,"Awesome book - recommend for every J2EE programmers This is the best Servlet/JSP book I have read - I read so many other books but no other book duplicates the coverage and depth of this book.I passed the test using this book but I am happier about finding this little treasure. Currently, I am converting WebSphere to WebLogic application and I'm keeping this book right besides me. I'm refactoring this old legacy code and converting to the latest standard.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn servlet and JSP. It may be not for the beginners but definitely you need to have a copy of it if you are serious about servlet/JSP."
1,A Book with both EXAM & REFERENCE COMPONENT. This is an excellent book. I would recommend to carry this book even after passing the exam as it serves as a good reference on many areas within the J2EE.
1,"Best Test Preparation Material for SCWCD 1.3 This is not only a good book for SCWCD 1.3 exam, but also a good reference for web application development. I read this book thoroughly and took some mock exams available in the internet, then i appeared for the real exam. I got 98%. I would strongly recommend this book for customers to buy."
1,Passed with 98%!! A great book not only for the exam but for future reference. The writing is precise and concise. The material is well laid out both for the exam as well as for a quick lookup for information while at work. A great bridge between the person taking the test and the dry and boring specification from Sun (they are meant to be that way). Their handling of JSP tags is better than the 2 books I have on Servlets/JSP.Wish they had a book for the Sun Certified Business Component Developer exam.Raj Auradkar
1,Way better than shaving and/or waxing!! I have owned this product for a month now and I love it. I was tired of shaving my legs every other day it seemed. Waxing was too expensive to have done professionally. And I found it too messy when I tried to do it at home. So I went searching for another way to solve the problem. I stumbled upon the Philips Norelco HP6409 Satinelle Soft Epilator. I did some research online and decided to give it a try. I totally love it. It works really well. At first it hurts a little but I didn't think it was as bad as waxing. After a few times though you really hardly feel it anymore. I like the fact that you don't have any sticky wax and you don't have to have water and soap or shaving cream. You can just whip it out turn it on and away goes the hair. I have only used it on my legs so I can't comment on using it for any other hair removal. If you are tired of the mess and hassle of shaving and/or waxing I recommend you give this a try.
1,"A classic. Not for everyone This is agreat book for anyone who has a good understanding of behavioral psychology. If you do, this book will help explain the concepts employed by psychologists today. It also gives the reader a good feel for the attitudes that prevailed in psychology in the 1950's. If you do not have a strong background in this area, I would suggest reading one of Skinner's later books first."
1,"my favirote craft book this is my most favirote book ever. love cabot's writing, even though she seems a little strict, but i look past that and i look at what the book really means."
1,"One of the best for beginners I read the reviews on this book and decided to purchase it and couldn't be happier that I did. I love the way the chapters are set up so I could jump around if necessary and I love that it included aspects of Wiccan history and the science behind some practices, which many books don't include. Although it may not include absolutely everything it includes enough of a background on everything to help a beginner start their studies. I would definitely recommend this book it is one of my favorites and up there with Scott Cunningham's work."
1,"Required Reading This book is a MUST. It grounds Witchcraft in both Science AND Image-ination, a balance absolutely necessary for anyone practicing the Magickal Arts. From there on it's up to you, but this book is one of the best ways to start."
1,"Good Morning! This was my first book of this subject, actually given me by a friend. CAbot's writing is super, and this book taught me a lot. It's informative, instructional, humorous, and very useful to me. Thumbs up ^"
1,"Power of the Witch by Laurie Cabot and Tom Cowan This was the first book I ever read on Witchcraft...my life has not been the same since. I see the world through different eyes now. Laurie Cabot does a wonderful job of dispelling the myths about Wicca as she unveils the beauty of it. Power of the Witch is a must for anyone seeking the truth about Witchcraft. This book is easy to read and follow. I have read literally hundreds of books on Wicca and Witchcraft....Power of the Witch is still my favorite, and I recommend it to all. Just reading this book is a magical and transforming experience in itself. I have never read any book that has had such a profound effect on my life. Absolutely the best!!!"

1,"Guiding the Family - excellent Very good reference for this chaotic world. Teachers, parents, and caregivers can learn a lot from this insightful book. It would give you an idea why being permissive to children is not advisable. Each adult should be responsible in raising children. You can just imagine yourself like a shepherd and guiding your flock of sheep towards the right path. If one sheep strays away, you pull it back again to follow the flock once again.Excellent reference even for teachers. It provides a deeper insight on families. It will help teachers on how to relate with their students and their families more effectively. Advice, suggestions, comments, and biblical teachings included. Truly, it shows the many support groups, institutions, and organizations in the community that you can collaborate with."
1,"praising The LORD every song in this collection is inspiring! One of my all time favorites. All of the songs are good, unlike some collections that only have a few good ones..."
1,"This Book Rocks! A new twist on the Fantasy genre, this book literally transforms the modern world into a magical setting. The idea of America losing technology, and magic returning to earth is brilliant. This is no generic hack and slash novel, and it isn't some boring philosophical treatise, either. The characters are real, and have both strengths and flaws. They get in fights, yet have to rely on each other for survival. There's plenty of action, but there's actual substance between the battles. Oh yeah, one more thing, the magic ROCKS. If you like Weis and Hickman, McCaffrey or Jordan, this book's for you."
1,"Excellent! Highly Recommend! This is one of the most unique stories that I have read in a long time! Not since Stephen King started his Dark Tower series have I read a book this intriguing and different. The characters are all very interesting and the story is quite compelling. It was hard to put the book down! If you are looking for a great science fiction story that's a cut above the rest, this is it. Can't wait for the next in the series!"
1,"Excellent Biographical Documnetary I am lucky enough to have an 1822 published book by Duke & Brown of SC and purchased another newer reprint to read. This book is told as a matter of fact document about the remarkable life of Archibald Campbell as he spent 6 yrs at sea. It does not have an emotional quality and reads dry. However, reading between the lines you begin to get an insight into the hardships, perseverance and tenacity of this man. A truly inspiring biography. Books like this should become part of a well read library."
1,Great movie My mom died and recommended this to my siblings...I can relate to it!DeNiro is fabulous...and many families may experience this scenario.
1,"BIG SHOW AND BIG WINS I have bought many wrestler specific dvd's over the years, most I have rated three stars or less, this is a five star dvd no doubt about it. Most of the time when I buy a dvd about one of my farvorite wrestlers the match selection is terrible because which ever wrestler it may be the Undertaker for example wins about half of the matches on the dvd. Another negative about wrestler dvd's is too many of the matches are of little or no importance. The Big Show A Giants World does not have these problems, as this dvd has the best match selection I have ever seen, and The Big Show actually wins most of the matches (18-3-1). The matches on this dvd are also some of the most important of The Big Show's career these include, 5 world title wins, 2 world tag team title wins, 1 united states title win, and some successful title defences. If your a Big Show fan this is must have dvd. If I could I give it ten stars."
1,"More than any website I've read the websites, and I've read this book, and I have to tell you the book is better. It's easier to read (duh) plus it has stuff that I've never seen on ANY any web site. Not to mention that you have to reread and study this information if you want it to work--and that's way easier with a book than on a screen."
1,"Great for the price. These Batteries are worth the money. They are cheap and you will not go wrong.I did have a problem with 2 of the 4 I bought, but it is minor. The Batter Indicator will not show up and is showing ""Invalid Battery"". It works fine, sometime the indicator will work and sometime it will not. I can get a good 4 days out of it with no problems."
1,"Very Good Read on 8th Air Force B-24 Missions I really enjoyed this book. I have read several autobiographies and accounts of aerial combat in the ETO and this is one of the best. The author describes his experiences in details that kept me aware of what was going on and how he felt.Also, it was a great read about the ""other"" bomber in the ETO, i.e. the B-24 Liberator.Thanks Keith!"
1,"Vivid This is an amazing novel containing unforgettable scenes in unexpected places: Angie as a high-schooler at a keg party in a field, her father ice-skating on a frozen river, her brother and his girlfriend attending a family wedding in Iowa. Funny, convincing, and gripping."
1,"Well-earned great reviews These folks have earned great reviews and deserve them. They are prompt, and their product is ""as advertised"" or better."
1,"Better than swiffer I have had no problems with swiveling the mop head, as another review had suggested. It does a fantastic job of dry mopping the kitchen floors, and wet mopping worked extremely well. Just some generic pine-scented cleaner, hot water, and the mop pad. When I'm done, I just toss the mop pad in the wash with the towels and it's ready to use again. Great for the environment and great for your wallet."
1,"microfiber mop This product is fantastic. For dusting, pollen, dog hair and everything else on the floor or walls this is the go to mop. Very wide head and mop head adheres to handle by velcro. Washes beautifully."
1,"A masterpiece, pure and simple. Buy it. Gervais and Merchant prove that their combined Midas touch works as well on the big screen as the small. I had tears in my eyes from laughing so much it hurt, and also because they just know how to create those emotionally poignant moments between characters that send shivers down your spine - as anybody who has seen episode 12 of 'The Office' and the Christmas Special of 'Extras' will already know. Everything about this film is perfect, and the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission. Buy it, and love it."
1,"Wow, now thats a shave!!! Clearly the mach 3 is better than the rest, more is not always better dude, the mach 3 is like.......well, it's like one of those sleeper razers. You know, your like getting ready to shave and in your mind your thinking, ""Three blades? this can't possibly...WHOA!, what the heck was that?"" Well Mr., that there was a quality mach 3 shave."
1,it's all good I was hesitant about the size chart because I ordered as a gift but I had no problems.
1,Fantastic Products The clogs are perfect. They are very comfortable and the color is exactly what I wanted.
1,"A most inspiring story by a most courageous woman The story begins when Ruth Bohle, a young American woman falls in love with a young German businessman. She moves to Germany, marries and starts a family. And lives in Berlin during WWII.Through Ruth's eyes, we experience the wartime hasrdships of raising children with coal-gas-food rationing, daily bombing, family separations, foot and train travel, a husband who becomes severely wounded, homelessness, and fear as an American in Germany.We also see the goodness of family, friends and strangers...and how important this is to Ruth's survival through continued adversity.Ruth is the glue that holds her family together during those difficult and emotional times.Ruth's account is REAL!!...Real people, Real feelings, Real war...experienced by a Real American wife and mother.A wonderful read -- the absolutely best book I have read in many years."
1,"Amazing - Motivates kids to eat healthy and be more active! How many ways are there to get our children to read, eat healthy, and be more active? Answer - NONE, until I found Race Against Junk Food. The story is wonderful, action packed but non-violent, and it gently moves a child's belief system into a mode that encourages a healthy lifestyle. What could be better? Read it with your child and see if you don't become more active and eat more fruits and vegetables (and leave that couch & cheeseburger behind)."
1,"Awesome candy snack Unfortunately I can't see to get these for some reason, but when I did try some samples around Christmas, they were super. I have been looking for a store that sells them without any luck. I hear I can get them from Japan, but at what price?"
1,Great book! This is a must have for all x-philes like me! I love this book! this one is so awesome! I always make sure I have it when watching and old X-Files rerun!buy it!
1,"Ethnography with tables of offsets! I hunted this book down after seeing a beautiful ""rodney"" boat from New Foundland on the internet. I didn't realise it was an ethnography when I ordered it, but now that I have it I appreciate it for what it is. I enjoyed reading about the boats and the vanishing breed of men who built them. One of the things that makes this book so interesting is accounts of the use of archaic methods that result in very sound, beautiful, useful boats. The author does go into the building procedures and provide lines and offsets for a few boats."
1,"Great author...great book...Top of the list! This guy is simply my best author of all time....I like his style. He gives me hope that there are people out there who make use of their hearts and brains in seeking after God. His books generally stimulate me to search beyond the usual all-so-familiar religious stereotypes. Larry is honest and clear. He has set his heart on pilgrimage and has drawn those of us who feel him towards the same road.I first read his book ""Inside Out"" about 10 years ago and since then, I buy every book he writes or has ever written. For some of his books, one needs to ""spiritually grow"" into them before you can actually comprehend his line of thought.Anything less than a five star would be an injustice to a man who has poured out heart and soul into seeking God and being honest!"
1,Terra Cotta Garlic Roaster I ordered this item so use in my microwave. It works perfectly and I am very very pleased with it.I would recommend this Roaster to my friends and family.
1,"Terra Cotta Garlic Roaster Purchased this for my sister-in-law for Christmas and it is exactly what she was looking for. I was looking for a small one to use with one bulb of garlic, but this will be able to hold two, possibly three small bulbs of garlic."
1,Windows Vista It is so great that I want to install the Interactive Multimedia DVD in my new PC but seems it doesn't work with Windows Vista. Did anybody solved this problem?
1,"Excellent! This nine-part documentary is not only a history of the Jews, it's a history of the western world! Hundreds of thousands of dollars were probably spent in the production of this series. Abba Eban takes the viewer all over the world to examine one of the world's most gifted and intriguing people - the Jews. These tapes will not put you to sleep. The music and images allows the viewer to relive Jewish history. And consequently, come to understand the world we live in today much better. I know the tapes are pricey, but own this documentary if you ever have the chance. You'll never regret it."
1,"Recommeded!!! It takes 9 hours to watch a complete set and it worths it. It interesting that my 6 years old daughter was watching some parts with me and we both enjoyed. There are a lot of reasons to watch the program. First, it gives a good overview of the western civilization from sumerians. Second, the quality of the material is superb. You'll see a lot of beautiful places around the globe. Third, you'll learn about the jews.Some things are quite surpising. The program is focused on dates, places and events. It tells you what happened and where but not much about why. Also it doesn't tell much jewish religion or traditions. If you want to know about jewish holidays, what kosher is etc, you'll need to look for other sources.Overall, it's a great history program!"
1,"A fabulous soulful album! This album definately lived upto expectations. I also purchased some of the album for gifts and were received with great thanks, and the reivews I had back were very favourable. Definately worth buying!!"
1,"Back where he belongs! It's taken him 26 years to produce a new album but it really is worth the wait! Always too good to be a side-man in my opinion, he has worked along side the likes of Eric Clapton, George Harrision & Roger Waters playing guitar but his marvellous distinctive voice has gone unheard for too long. This album is a breath of fresh air for those who like me are rather depressed at the lack of real music out there, Every track is strong and you can tell that he has worked very hard on producing such great lyrics. It's musically sweet alright and deserves to sell by the truck load. So buy it and buy your next door neighour a copy too!"
1,Golden Secrets of Mystic Oils: Over 550 Oils and 1300 Spells Golden Secrets of Mystic Oils: Over 550 Oils and 1300 Spells is a great book by anna riva for her oils. A must have reference!
1,"I AM THE SINGER""S (jack russell) SON THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST. IT'S GOOD FOR ANYONE (i'm 12). TELL YOUR FRIENDS, TELL YOUR ENEMIES."
1,One of their best if not their Best!! What an incredible CD. First time through it I loved it. But as I listen to it more and more I feel that its probably their best Album yet. In my opinion this band is one of the best they have been around for awhile and continue on putting out great albums. Their style is just to sweet. Lets hope they keep the great albums coming. This CD offers their hard rocking style as well as their softer ballads.
1,"Rock is back! This album smokes from start to finish!! The first single is killer ""Rollin' Stoned!!"" This could be one of Great White's best performances in years. Rock on guys!!"
1,Legion It as everything I thought it was I enjoyed very much. I like movies that I can watch more than once and still enjoy them
1,Marvelous Characters This is the first of Miranda Jarrett books that I have read and will definitely read others. She with a wonderful flair. Her love scenes are stirring and the interaction of the characters is very nice. Franceseca and Edward are definitely meant for each other.
1,"Honest and Daring This wonderful book, about a relationhsip with one of the most mysterious and charismatic rock stars, is blatant in its honesty. Often, through her perfectly timed and wickedly dry sense of humor, Ms. Huddleston simultantouesly shows us her naivete in direct conflict with her alter ego which knows better than to think for a moment that Jim Morrison will actually rise to her girlhood-like expectations. Revealing in every way, funny and touching, I read this one straight through!!"
1,The Only Review Book You Need This is a great resource!!! I recently took the ARRT board exam in Radiography and I used this prep book to prepare for it. I scored a 98% on the exam. I would recommend this guide to anyone who wants to rock the boards. AsB
1,Great Resource I was in retired status for almost five years. Had to re-test in order to get my registry back. This book is the only resource I used and I easily passed the test! It had been around thirteen years since my original test date.
1,"Love the stuff I bought this at a local Walmart, but had to share how much I love it. I got it w/the purpose of trying to help control my acne prone skin, dryness and facial redness. All the ""typical"" acne cleansers & moisturizers you find out there either make my face super red (compared to the mildly red it usual is) or makes me break out more.This stuff may not end all blemishes, but I've found that the blemishes I still get aren't noticable at all, and my facial redness is finally under control. Not to mention my skin looks worlds better now that its not dry (I was never able to use a moisturizer bc they always make me break out, even the ones that aren't supposed to).I now use this in combination w/a tea tree oil fash wash."
1,Very Nice Product I have psoriasis. This is the product I reach for the most. Releives the burn and itching. My doctor is also a fanof tea tree oil. This blend works the best!
1,"Exactly What I Wanted This is a great set of pots and pans. Not only did I get this set, but I also purchased about 5 more pans, and love them all. I was comparing this set to the Calphalon Contemorary. I went to various department stores to talk to sales people that work with both companies, and they all preferred Analon Advanced. These pans are truly nonstick inside and out. The only place where food gets stuck is on the bolt(s) inside the pan that hold the handle(s) on. The handles on both the lids and the pans never get hot. I have even put them in the oven, and they work perfectly. The only thing that has happened is the bottom of the pan where the flame hits it has slightly discolored. However, I keep my pans in the cabinets so it's not an issue."
1,"Don't waste time buying anything else but this Analon Advanced I have waited about one year before writing this review to observe the performance of this cookware over time and.... I loved it the first time I used it.... and I still love it today ! This cookware is heavy duty and is a joy to use and clean. I love the nonstick both on the interior and the exterior, after 11 months of use, they look just like they did when I took them out of the box. This would be an excellent choice for the novice or the professional cook."
1,Great Item I got this to convert some floor speakers to mount on pole stands. They were just what I needed and expected. Very good quality and even come with the mounting screws. This was a great buy!!!
1,Love to cook in large amounts This product was purchased to match previous pieces in a set. I love the size of the stock pot
1,Excellent book Very pleased in service and product. Product was shipped quickly and was well wrapped. It is always nice to have this kind of service.
1,"Steve Wozniak, Inventor of the Apple Computer This book is perfect for a school book report! It is both interesting and easy to read. Though it is written for older children, it is sophisticated enough to be appreciated by adults. It includes many details about Wozniak and how he became involved in creating the original Apple computer. The author writes in an easy-to-understand style with touches of humor and details that make Steve Wozniak come alive as a ""regular guy."" Includes many black and white photos and a great glossary of terms."
1,"Great book! I have been using this book for several years and absolutely love to make gifts for my friends using the book. The recipes are easy. The book describes how things are to be stacked in the jar to look their prettiest, and the instructions are very easy to follow. My friends love the gifts. I have used the prepared jars for my own ""quick"" cookies and the cookies are delicious! I highly recommend the book."
1,"Exelent album The best album of Peter Tosh,and my personal all-time best reggae album.Incredible songs like No Sympathy,Burial,Why Must I Cry...incredible meaning lyrics and phenomenol music and sound efects.It really is a 5 stars album."
1,"Great Peter Tosh Debut Album Legalize It could very well be Peter's best album. There's a little bit of everything on this album, including the humorous Legalize It, the excellent Igziabeher, and a softer side of Peter on Ketchy Shuby. But some more real talent is on the old Wailers classics, Burial, No Sympathy, and Brand New Second Hand. My favorite track is Why Must I Cry, co-written by Bob Marley. Every track is good in it's own right, and this is a great cd to buy for any collection."
1,Gloria****** Is truly a God honoring song. This couple is definitly glorifing God. The cd is FIVE STAR
1,GREAT SAW THEM LAST NIGHT IN CONCERT THEY WERE GREAT. THEY LEFT THERE WATERMARK ON ME WISH THEM ALL THE LUCK MAY GOD BE WITH THEM
1,"Worth every penny. This cookware set is simply wonderful and is a delight to use. The pots and pans are heavy (which I like) and very well-built. The stay-cool handles are an added bonus. I own cookware sets by Calphalon and Lagostina, and I have to say that the Anolon set is my favorite and the set I use everyday. I can't recommend it highly enough."
1,"Great Product. Great Price I bought this cookwear for my wife last year. It cooks well, it washes well (that is my job) and it looks good and we display it on a pot rack.We had bought some individual pieces of Anolon, but the 10 piece set is a bargain.Almost every time my wife cooks with these pots, she thanks me again for buying them."
1,"Terrific cooking tool. Makes cooking more fun! I bought this set almost a year ago, after having used a set of old-fashioned pots and pans for many years. These are a delight to use! Sunny side up eggs, which always stuck in the old pan and were often tough and rubbery, come out tender and I love just sliding them out of the pan onto the plate. I don't even have to use a spatula to loosen them. Even for food that doesn't slide out, clean up is really easy.I did take the time to not just read, but actually learn the manufacturer's instructions for taking care of them and follow them to a T. (My Dad taught me that if I take care of my tools, they'll take care of me.) So they still look and work like new.I enjoy cooking much more now that I don't have to worry about sticking. I'm more adventurous, because I know that even if the food doesn't turn out great, at least it won't be a hassle to clean."
1,"Excellent Home Gourmet Cook Set I spend some time researching to finding the right set of non-stick for someone who wanted to do a little more than boil water at home. My final authority was Consumer Report, who ranked this set very highly in terms of quality--and it was cheaper than some of the more prestigious competition.I have been using the cookware for a month and so far, I have not been disappointed! The non-stick works beautifully, although I have been trying to clean up quickly after use (this may not last long). I have even sauted vegetables with no oil sucessfully. The handles stay extremely cool and the glass top lids make staying in control easy.Not necessairly negative but prospective buyers should be aware that they are noticably heavier than cheaper cookware.From my view, the only negative (minor) is that the two sauce pans are a little slimmer/taller than I would like, although total capacity is fine."
1,I got what I wanted...*smile* I got the product I purchased and in a timely manner. The had one small stratch from handling but nothing to make me regret my purchase THANKS!!
1,"The Best criminal investigation show out there. This is by far the best criminal investigation show out there. The characters are very good, and the show never dies down. It's never predictible and there are so many twists and turns. One of the best shows out there!"
1,"ncis season 3 well first of all ncis rules!! i adore all the heroes, the story and especially gibbs!!Its not just a normal criminal series, it is funny and keeps you anxious! buuuuuuut it was really sad that kaite died i liked her ncis will never be the same:/"
1,movie series-NCIS Fantastic DVD..........hope to buy all the other DVDs. Good price and very quick shipment.
1,"Great series Great series, love it bunches. Purchased it for a gift. Arrived quicker than expected and was well packaged for protection."
1,"NCIS great The third season NCIS arrived right away, in excellent condition, and it has been very entertaining. We especially like the added features (visiting with the cast, etc.) in addition to the series itself."
1,Love NCIS I LOVE this series. The characters are all so great. Getting the DVD for the season was even more enjoyable ... no advertisement interruptions. Waiting anxiously for the next season ... on DVD and TV.
1,"Great Show - Fantastic Season!! I just recently discovered NCIS (I know - where have I been?). It is just a really wonderful show - funny, intelligent, engaging. This season is better than the previous two, for two main reasons: 1) Character development of the leads is hitting a ""high point"" & 2)Ziva...great character, big improvement over Kate. Pick up the 3rd Season and ENJOY!"
1,"Great Purchase I was so excited to have recieved my DVD's of NCIS. I have watched all the episodes already, and I'm really happy with the condition and the packaging of the product. Really happy with my experiance, overall.Thank you:))"
1,"An Excellent Season of NCIS! Season three of NCIS is great! So much suspense, adventure, excitement, Tony, Gibbs, McGee, and Abby! Great new characters, though I think that Lauren Holly should have never cut her hair."
1,great price The price I was able to get for Seasons 1 and 2 was great. The 3rd season price was a great buy and they shipped it very fast.
1,action movie If you enjoy war movies you will love this one. This is without doubt the finest production of any war movie ever made. The cast is star after star after star and the action is realistic including some actual footage taken during the war.
1,"One of my favorite movies Movie showed up on time and in perfect condition. As much as I enjoy this movie (and have for years), the producers comments about the making of the movie were even more enjoyable and interesting then the movie itself. I will not give away any of what I learned. Also the comments were quite substantial. So I spent one evening watching the comments and another night watching the movie."
1,Another great war movie This is one of the best will watch it over again enjoy the old cast of actors They don't make them like that any more... SORRY to say..
1,"FROM THE DOLITTLE RAID TO MIDWAY ISLAND... When I first saw this film, I was blown away! But after seeing TORA! TORA! TORA!, I must now say: I'm, still blown away! The film is a masterpiece! It has great acting (which TORA! TORA! TORA! lacked), great visual effects (several borrowed from the aformentioned TORA! TORA! TORA!, but hey, at least SOMETHING good came out of that film), and historical accuracy mixed in with great fictional characters (which is what made PEARL HARBOR, the best film of 2001, an instant success). Anyone who loves war films and dramas will love this film! Count on it! Grade: A+"
1,"The resource on Carson City Gold A wonderful book with accurate, awesome information thatwill definitely please the reader of this book. DougWinter and James Halperin are two of the highest regardedexperts on mintmarked gold known today...Pick it up! You won't be disappointed."
1,"excellent introduction to Weber's work Gerth and Mills' reader provides an excellent introduction to Weber's life and thought. This edition includes excerpts from _Economy and Society_, the brilliant essays ``Politics as a Vocation'' and ``Science as a Vocation,'' plus a brief critical biography and material from other sources.Weber had so much to say about so many subjects that any anthology would require a well-considered method of organization; this book has that. It is easy to navigate. When I want to know what Weber said about a particular subject, I look in _From Max Weber_."
1,Scrolls of the Prophet: The Best of Peter Tosh THE MAN IS A PROPHET. Anyone who loves reggae will love this album
1,"Excellent Box-Set! This 2 DVD Box Set of The French Connection I and II is very well packaged and has lots of intriguing extras. The films themselves are quickly becoming classics, with Gene Hackman putting in stunning performances- especially in The French Connection II during his rehab sequences.I am most impressed that the film took advntage of the gritty and confusing street layouts of both Poughkeepsie and Marsellaise to add to what is an already filmatically challenging spy/crime story.Very good collection- would recommend to those who like good 'private investigator chasing dangerous drug lords' crime films."
1,"the best slow movie ive ever seen A lot of these older horror films fall into the rut of being slow involving little dialogue with long stretches of setup for the messes, but I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE manages to have enough intrigue to hold on. I have a horrible attention span for movies, usually finishing them in several sittings or not at all, but this one was definitely a sitdown watch it all the way through movie.Obviously, it is about rape and revenge. It's incredibly graphic in the rape, and just as heartless. Then it's those long stretches of setup, but the payoff is great as we see her inflict double the terror upon her assailants."
1,"Not as squeamish as everyoneis saying Rape is nothing to joke about. However, I found this movie not as graphic, compared to today's fare. I was excited to get to the part where she gets her revenge and they all deserved it. Parts of the rape scenes especially in the woods, I did feel uncomfortable, because the whole scene went on for like 15 minutes. I first heard of this film when I was 13 and I avoided the film until now, but since I saw Serbian film UNCUT I felt like nothing could be as graphic as that. I don't recommend I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE for sensitive viewers, however if you like justly deserved revenge films this might be your type of movie."
1,"for my husband My husband was very interested in rewatching the original version again after the recent remake was released. He loved it, and now has both films in his growing moving collection."
1,"Not dissapointed I read reviews and asked a couple of people about this movie. I was very impressed. I have already watched it twice and i'll watch it again. Every woman should watch this movie. It was a very real situation that is never dealt with in that way.A woman leaves the city for some quiet time to write a book and runs into some problems. 4 Guys decide they want to rape her and they continuously do so. But they don't do it back to back. They toy with her. They beat her. They leave her for dead. Only, she isn't.She takes matters into her own hands and exacts her revenge on these guys. Every revenge scene was great. One particular bathroom scene, especially.This isn't really for the weak hearted. But it is a good movie (to me). My suggestion, watch it."
1,"A Fascinating Book About a Little Known Woman The Case of the Pederast's Wife, by Blossom Elfman, is an incredibly well researched and written book. the first thing one notices is the quality of the writing and of the scholarship and research. Oscar Wilde was a complex and intereting character and until I read this quite marvelous book, I had no idea that he had a wife! He was, after all, an avowed homosexual. As one reads the book one comes to understand the restraints of the time Wilde and his wife, Constance, lived. Many books, plays and films have been written about Wilde, but Constance, his wife and mother of his two sons, has been neglected, even avoided. Applause and kudos to Ms. Elfman who had the intelligence and wit to discover Constance Wilde and to bring her to life in a wonderfully written book."
1,Organic and tastes great! I love this product. I am very excited to keep ordering this product. All the seeds grew. I will order again from this person.
1,wheatgrass Seed sprouted easily. I am very satisfied with this wheatgrass. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone desiring to grow their own wheatgrass at home.
1,"Wheat Grass This grass grows very well and very quickly. I just use it for ornamental purposes, and it looks great!"
1,"Met my expectations Just what I ordered...seeds. I planted them and within 7 days they are green and several inches high. i am growing this for a wedding centerpiece and It's beautiful, so I didn't eat it. but my rabbit did, and she approves!"
1,"From seed to grass - HOLY COW! As I am writing this I can see these seeds growing. Just kidding but it has been 4 days and each and every seed has sprouted and is over an inch tall. I cannot believe how fast these are growing. I am looking forward to juicing these seeds. I have 2 15x9 plastic containers sitting next to myAeroGrow AeroGarden Pro 200 with Master Gardener 1-Season Kit and Gourmet Herb Seed Kit. The light from this bleeds over onto the wheatgrass seeds. I dont know if its the lights, the soil or the seeds but these are amazingly fast growing seeds.I didnt even bother planting the seeds. I just sprinkled them on the surface (like in nature), of damp soil and covered it with a cellophane covering. They have all dug in and have jumped up.I will update this review after we try the first juice from these.Overall a fantastic product, performs better than advertised!Thank you for reading my review."
1,"A Great Book This was my first time reading a Kristin Heitzmann book, and I loved it. I stumbled across the title at a library book sale and thought it looked interesting. Once I got started, I couldn't put it down. I look forward to reading more of her books!"
1,"Lifetime Keeper Give one of these to a very special person only, never give it lightly. They will keep it for a lifetime. I got one years ago and I paid it forward. I know the person appreciates it because when she is feeling low, I see her using it for her coffee."
1,"Blue Sea Voltmeter Well made and reliable instrument. I used it to measure the state of battery charge on my boat. I would prefer that it had a red, yellow, green indicator overlaid on the scale to make it easier to know the battery condition."
1,"It's a re-release, so what? Yes, this is a past collection with a new title, but that doesn't mean it's a bad book. All three stories are terrific, but different enough to keep the reader from getting bored. I like the new title - it makes it easier to distinguish it from the other Long, Tall, Texans anthologies."
1,pleased as always Was very excitied to find this book on amazon was here within days. Have found this very helpful with this being my first mastiff pup thanks again for being there amazon
1,Great Present for my Grandkids I read this book to my daughter when she was little and now 20 years later I am enjoying it with my own grandchildren. Fun story and illustrations.
1,"Great for beginning readers!! My first grade daughter really enjoyed reading this book. There were many words that were repeated which really helps out first time readers. In addition, there were enough new words to keep it challenging for her. The book was just long enough, not too short and not too long. I highly recommend this book for beginning readers. A plus for us, this book was on her AR list."
1,"Straightened hair the easy way I have wavy / curly hair and had all but given up on ever wearing it straight besides when my stylist blows it out after my haircut. Well, after receiving this styling tool, I have had great luck! It is super easy to use, if you can brush your hair, you can use this styling tool. Great, easy results quickly. Definitely love it."
1,infiniti I have used many hand held dryers over the years. This is the only dryer that dries and straightens at the same time. Cant find in stores now. But excited I found it at amazon.
1,Best hair appliance ever! I have fine frizzy wavy hair. Flattening irons tend to leave my hair without any body. The Infiniti BC173 smooths my hair and still gives it some lift. It's very easy to use which I like since I don't enjoy spending a lot of time styling my hair. I've even used it when I've let my hair almost completely dry naturally and it has already started to be curly and frizzy and this dryer smooths it out. Amazing!!! I've been using it for about 3 years now and it still keeps working like new. I've been thinking about buying another one in case Conair quits making them. I'm sure the one I have won't last forever. I hate it when I find something that works this well and then the company stops making it. Hopefully that won't happen. I don't usually bother to write reviews but this product really deserves a good one.
1,"Infiniti ROCKS! I've never been able to use the brush stylers so I was kind of skeptical about this one but it's a great hair dryer and straighter in one! Don't use it with your hair sopping wet though and you'll get better results. I have thick hair that's wavy, not super curly, so it works perfectly! Need to get a second one for the road!"
1,This is the one! My wife has owned and used this model since it first came out. It is the easiest one to straighten and style her very curly hair.
1,"Top-shelf fountain pen ink Noodler's Black Bulletproof is my go-to ink for serious work. It's waterproof, fraud-proof, and will write well on any kind of paper. This is the only fountain pen ink I know that can be used for crossword puzzles on newspaper pulp without feathering or bleeding through. Once the ink dries on the page, it's not removable. I once ran a note through the laundry in the pocket of my jeans, and the writing was still perfectly legible when I discovered the washed piece of paper in the pocket later.This is well-behaved ink, with only one minor drawback: it exhibits nib creep in most pens. If you don't care about seeing a bit of ink riding the top of the nib as you write, this is not an issue, and the great properties of Noodler's Black more than make up for it.If you write with a fountain pen, and you want an ink that's smooth, waterproof, and rock-solid permanent once it dries, there's really only one pick...Noodler's Black Bulletproof."
1,"great ink at first i was slightly disappointed as i thought it wasn't waterproof like it claims, but i later realized i must have had some old ink still in my pen barrel combining with the noodlers. completely satisfied with this product, just make sure you don't mix it with any other ink... it loses it's ""bulletproofness"" if you do."
1,Quality Ink. Good ink. Just make sure you shake it. I've been researching the blue bullet proof ink as well. Main reason why I buy this particular ink (among the many Noodler's inks) is that this one is bulletproof. I learned that it is non-messy to use a syringe to refill the pen.
1,"Great Fountain Pen Ink!! This is very good ink for fountain pen, and it has 3 oz compare to parker bottled ink only 2 oz and for almost the same price, and best of all, it is made in U.S.A!!!"
1,"a most excellent ink. This a most excellent ink. If you don't believe it, write on a piece of paper then submerge it in water overnight. It will not run and it will not fade. It's the only Ink I buy now. Excellent range of colors and ink options, eel, baystate blue, etc."
1,"Excellent Value I bought this ink for use with a Cross fine nibbed fountain pen that I use on a daily basis in my work. This ink is excellent, it flows immediately and smoothly with no skipping. Its a very dark black that looks great on almost any grade of paper from the cheapest recycled copy paper to heavy cottons and linens. It also completely lives up to its bulletproof billing; for my own amusement I've tried everything from ammonia, bleach, carpet cleaner fluid, gasoline, kerosine, lighter fluid, etc and nothing I've tried will get this ink to budge from any paper I've used. Also, when they say 3 fluid ounces they mean it, the bottle is filled to the very brim so exercise caution or you'll spill some."
1,"Excellent product, will continue to use this brand. Ink is of excellent quality; does not run or easily smear. On most paper I do not require a blotter. Flows smoothly and consistently, and tint is very dark. Happy to find an inexpensive, high quality product made in USA."
1,"Great product Used to fill up a Waterman. A bit messy since I haven't manually filled a fountain pen for a while, but the bottle seems to last several dozen fills easily (unless the cap does not seal properly and the ink evaporates, which seems unlikely given the quality of the bottle / cap).Great color consistency and richness."
1,"Great Product As a college student I do a lot of writing in the form of notes and tests. I use my Lamy Safari pen with the converter and this ink. I love the deep color of it, its a nice dark ink. I don't have problems of bleeding through pages with regular store bought college ruled paper either so that means I can write on both side of a sheet and not worry about my notes turning in to a muddy mess. I will be buying this product in the future and I highly recommend it."
1,"A great, easy flowing, black ink I use this ink in a Pilot Plumix with a converter (not exactly the most high brow pen) and it flows like a dream. The is nice and dark with out spidering out, even on some pretty crappy paper I have used. It cleans up pretty easily with water if it is spilled on plastic or other similar surface, but is very durable on paper. I haven't had any problems with smearing even a few moments after writing something."
1,"We love cooperative games! Once you get over how cheap-looking the game is (so you may not want to buy it for a gift, if that would bother you), you'll realize how refreshing it is to play a cooperative game! My daughters loved working together to save the princess! Another friend likes playing it every time she comes over and has requested it for her birthday, so we're buying another.We also really like the ""Max"" game and ""The secret door"" from the same company. I think ""Max"" is the best game we've tried so far."
1,"Great It has so many parts. Colorful. Very nice for small and even older children. My grandchildren love the animals, also how they can set it up. Great for take along!"
1,A+ tribute to the Duke The CD has awesome jazz vocals from some the greatest. Is has quickly become of my favorites.
1,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS!!!!!! i adore this book and hope you will give it a chance. because out of the three hundred books i have read this is one of my very favorites.
1,"FIRST RATE THRILLER John Dahl should smash the box-office one of these days because he truely deserves it. Unforgettable is his best work effort, a gripping suspensefiul script supported by an excellent cast and a director who knows how to keep you on the edge of your sofa. The Dolby Digital track is very dynamic and does justice to Christopher Young's remarkable score. This widescreen edition is not anamorphic, as marked on the back cover, but the image is sharp."
1,"I love to watch Mr. Liotta act.... It is a pleasure to watch him act and how he responds to each scene, and how he responds to everthing around him and how he wants the scene to be understood and the emotions he wants the viewer to feel....this is a good movie if you know what you're looking at."
1,gret album from Mr.Excitement Jackie Wilson was one of the baddest Musical artists ever. the Man was smooth and could Sing/Sang with the best of them. he was in the same class as Sam Cooke and James Brown back in the day. He truly had a unique style about him. this album is smooth and on time. the Motown band is on here and Jackie is leding the way. the Man could sing anything and make it sound so smooth. a Must have. the Brother is so underrated.
1,"Solid I took this book from a neglected stack in an Acupuncturist's office, and was struck by the repugnant cover (imagine the worse possible detail job on a van from the 70s - it was an earlier edition than the one you see on Amazon). But the information is solid. Good understandings of time, healing, choice and destiny are woven throughout the material. Simple exercises are presented with direct and encouraging language that does a good job addressing the problem of doubt.Not at all pertinent to this book, yet Interesting to note: this Amy Wallace is the author of The Sorcerer's Apprentice, a memoir of her years as a follower of Carlos Casteneda."
1,"""Till all are One"" One of the best cartoon movies to be made in my time.Transfomers The Movie if you didn't see it as a kid you have a chance to make up for it and do yourself a favor and buy this movie the price is great."
1,Everything I expected This movie is everything I expected it to be. Certainly brought back memories from my childhood. The extra features are very nice. A must buy for any and all Transformers fans.
1,"it was the best cartoon movie ive ever seen i saw it a long time ago, and have been looking for it ever since. all i can say is that i loved it and i wish i owned it."
1,"Greatest Cartoon Ever Okay. I am 13yrs old..and I have watched this movie since I was 2 EVERY day. When this comes on DVD(IF, OF COURSE IT WILL!!)I am getting it and taking it everywhere..MAN OH MAN This is a great movie..Think of it as a real movie with robots only animated. Most of my favorite characters died..but of course this came last after the real series..then the cartoon show that took place right after the movie..think of Transformers as a never ending universe...5 stars. Great. BUY IT! Best movie ever!"
1,"Took me back to my childhood If you are a true Transformers fan, you will appreciate the movie, commentary and extras that were included in the DVD. This is truly a prize for Transformers fans of all ages!"
1,"excellent Every male from the age of 20 to 25 should love this movie. I remember watching this when I was in kindergarten, and have wanted it ever since. I am so excited that the DVD is finally coming out. I think this movie will make an excellent gift. It also sheads some light on the new transformers that is out now and provides background for that series."
1,"The best American animated movie, PERIOD. This has got to be the best animated movie of all time. You can't get better story, animation, soundtrack, voice acting... With numerous stars as the lead roles this movie delivers. If you are looking for fast paced action, lots of cool robots and great animation look no further."
1,"classic one of the best movies from my childhood. I remember going to the theater to see it when if came out!( the theater isnt there anymore, its a Layzboy store now.)"
1,"Transformers-The Movie is just AWESOME! This movie is the best cartoon ever. Autobots Vs. Decepticons in the war for Earth Megatron's plan after he already won Cybertron from the Autobots. And if you really want to see Optimus Prime and Megatron fight, this is your movie. And of course we can not forget about Orson Welles's voice as the evil monster planet Unicron. This is a must see movie for all ages. ( Including the uncut version too ). To find it you can search The Transfomers The Movie. ..."
1,"small correction as any knowledgable ""transformer kid"" will tell you, altough i am now no longer a kid... SoundWave is NOT an autobot he is a deceptacon. Just a fix for all you transformer guru's who were angry. 8-) there problem solved"
1,"Transformers the Movie If you were a kid during the 1980's and you loved Transformers like I did, this is a must own."
1,"The best version of this film on DVD yet! To drum up publicity for the live-action Transformers movie next year, Sony Pictures has given the 1986 animated movie the deluxe treatment. This two-disc version promises a remastered, anamorphic widescreen transfer with ""corrected colors"". No word yet on a remastered 5.1 audio track to go with that improved picture. Sony does include a fullscreen version of the film as well as a third version that borrows from VH1's ""Pop-Up Video"", adding interesting facts about the movie and other Transformer-related information while the movie plays. Other special features include toy commercials from back in the day and a commentary track with producer Nelson Shin and voice actress Susan Blu, who was the voice of ""Arcee"". If you're a fan, this is a no-brainer. Pre-order today!"
1,"Amazing! Quality is amazing, looks brand new even though it was listed as Very Good. Shipped same day as order, and came earlier than expected. Extremely satisfied with my purchase and glad I chose Knick Knacks!"
1,"Just a tiny point Yeah I'm sad for pointing this out, but maybe there's loads of others have too,I just haven't been botherd to check. Soundwave wasn't an Autobot as the editorial comment states, he was a Decepticon as far as I can remember."
1,"Without the shadow of a doubt, the greatest animated film ev First of all, in response to anyone who dismisses the graphics as mediocre,.. this film was made in the mid-eighties...I believe that when you look at it in a more relevant eye, it more than holds it's own. It's a great period piece. The visual esthetics are nothing short of artistry. Imagine someone seeing Orsen Welle's visual masterpiece 'Citizen Kane', and putting it down for not having any color... Also, whether you prefered if Optimus Prime didn't die or not has no bearing on judging the quality of the film. It's unbelievable to me how ignorant some people are..."
1,"Brings Evolutionism to it Knees! Straight to the Jugular! Dr. Sarfati, clearly demonstrates to his readers that evolutionism is nothing more than a belief system, and therefore inaccessible to empirical science. A must read for anyone who is truly a ""freethinker"" or someone, who just wants to know what vital information has been censored in ordered to keep evolutionary interpretations and beliefs alive. After reading this book, you will understand evolution so well you will know why it is an absurd interpretation for the origin of the world and the life on it."
1,"Scientific Foundation for Faith If you want data and science to help enlighten technical-minded friends and family about the Truth, this book will help. It still takes Faith though, but no more Faith than arguing that evolution has occurred, as humanists proclaim. There is no absolute physical Proof either way: either you have Faith that Creationism is the answer, or that Evolution is the answer..."
1,"Life sprang from nothing- right genius! One strand of DNA holds as much info a set of 26 book encyclopedias. And not random info either. Change one sentence and the whole thing falls apart. Yet idiotic evolutionists believe DNA magically came into existance by random chance and then went through billions of positive mutations to advance to all the different stages and types of life today.One genetetist said that's about as likely as a tornado going through a junk yard and producing a fully assembled and functioning 747 aircraft.Sorry, I don't have enough faith to believe in evolution; I'm only a Christian."
1,I love it! My wife bought me this drill in 2002 for Christmas and I don't think I will ever need another one. It's the perfect size and weight for almost any job and has more than enough power to keep up with tough repetitive tasks without overheating.
1,"Great Voice - Great Pop Song This is simple a beautiful popsong sung by one of the most beautiful voices in modern pop-rock. Nash, best known as the singer of Sixpence None the Richer, is here into a more mainstream pop-style than she's usually known for. But as long as the material is as great as in this case, it doesn't really matter."
1,Great Merchant I purchased this as a gift and my wife loves the fragrance. Dealing with this seller is a pleasure and I will most certainly do so again.
1,lovely I only wear Annick Goutal and this is one of my favorites. Citrusy and not over-powering it is a lovely clean summer scent.
1,"Fantabulous! Super duper! Oh the JOY of reading Doctor Dolittle books! This is a great one. How can it be no publisher(s) have reprinted all the books including the zoo, the moon, the garden, the post office, puddleby adventures etc.?? Are they mad? These books are timeless stories that appeal to animal lovers everywhere!"
1,"SEXTETTE: Don't Let This Happen To You! That Greta Garbo retired from films in her mid thirties did more to keep her memory and ""the mystique"" alive than anything else she could have done. That Mae West decided to film ""Sextette"" in the late Seventies, when she was in her mid eighties, is the flip side of Garbo: the Baby-Jane-Norma-Desmond syndrome descended upon a new world with new values. And to pair West with the young Timothy Dalton and expect the audience to take the romance seriously further complicates this already messy film. Part musical, part comedy, part Grand Guignol, this film should be seen for the five-star lesson it presents: know when to gracefully retire, leaving only the fondest of memories, Garbo-like, captured on film forever."
1,"Petzold as always Whenever you hear the name Petzold, the only thing to examine is if the subject is for you. This is for beginner programmers who want to start in C# and not ONLY for beginners in C# but otherwise experienced in other environments. All negative reviwers here state that simple fact!So if you are a beginner in programming who wants to start in C# this is the absolutely FIRST book you must own. PERIOD.Also, dont think that the material is outdated, since it covers the basics."
1,"The Writer of Writers Wilbur Smith is the kind of writer that makes every other writer want to break their own fingers and take up goat herding. He's that good and Men of Men clearly demonstrates that talent with its unique storyline, remarkable history, and great adventure.Does he measure up to every reader? Probably not because he tells epic adventures with hardships, battles, love, sex and violence that's not for everyone's palate. But with millions of books sold and a fan base that spans the world a few times around, he apparently reaches a lot of readers who keep coming back for yet one more adventure...readers like me."
1,Awesome from begining to end Caviezel and Quaid are simply awesome. The movie keeps you in suspense and the end is the best. This movie is a must see for anyone and everyone. (Especially if Caviezel is your favorite actor...sigh*) But seriously no Bias. If you dont see it youre missing out.
1,"A great movie, kind of unexpected Frequency is a very good movie. It's entertaining and suspenseful the entire way through. The actings great and the story's even better.I'll admit that the beginning of the film starts off kind of slow. They really try to develope the characters in a great way. There are a few moments were I wonder why it wasn't edited better. After the first 40 minutes the movie really picks up and it doesn't stop until the end.Quaid gives the performance of his career. Caviezel puts on an excellent show in his role. Andre Braugher gives an outstanding performance also. There were a few weak performances, but not many.It's a great story. One that really draws you in each second you watch. Definitely worth a rent or buy."
1,"Brilliant thriller - one of Quaid's best I've been a fan of Dennis Quaid through some good movies and some not-so-good movies, but here is a role just perfect for him, as a 1969 NY fire fighter. Jim Caviezel is great as his cynical, 36-year old son in the parallel 1999 storyline. The time bridge is well done [willing suspension of disbelief required, but easy here] and the palpable link between father and son -- the son's loss at his father's early death -- is heartbreaking but ultimately life-affirming. Buy it, rent it, borrow it -- but see it. You'll be on the edge of your seat, but the payoff at the end is worth it."
1,"Kept me at the edge of my seat! I have to say that the plot to this movie is original. It makes you realize that one decision you make can change your life completely. I really liked the pace of it, and I felt involved watching it. Because of the nature of the plot, you cannot really predict what will happen next. Five stars!"
1,Very Intense! WoW! Great movie! Ok... its a tad hooky and it moves a little slow... (Just a little) but there are parts that keep you watching the whole way through that are just intense!!! Of course when the plot begins to unfold you are on the edge of your seat the rest of the way and the ending is unbelievable! I was just amazed at how wonderfully entertaining and clever the entire movie was. If you watch this movie STAY FOR THE END because this movie makes you feel great!
1,"Frequency Frequency is a totally different story-line than the usual fair anda much overlooked fantastic movie. It certainly never received theattention it should have. It is a movie you'll never forget anddefinately want to own. If it seems slow at the beginning, staywith it -- it gets really dramatic and when you figure out what isgoing on, you'll be intriqued. Great Movie!"
1,"The reason I read Scifi When sorting my search results for science fiction books with telepathy as a subject, I was not a bit surprised to see Catspaw come up as readers' number 1 selection. I have a bookself with my all-time favorite scifi books, the ones I would lend to someone who hadn't read much scifi, and this book is the first I would pull out. It has a sympathetic character, great world-building, and a fabulous premis that starts you wondering about the future and possibilities beyond the everyday experience."
1,"One of my favorite books, ever I have been trying to figure out why I love this book so much. It obviously has to do with the main character, Cat, who is at times the quintessential underdog, then the hero of the universe (for at least fifteen minutes). Ms. Vinge creates characters (major and minor) that you not only want to know, but you want to become in some higher sense. The action, intrigue and adventure in Catspaw are also incomparible.I also highly recommend the prequel and sequel to Catspaw - Psion and Dreamfall, respectively. They are both wonderful books, but Catspaw remains my favorite."
1,"Coal Miner's Daughter - Great Reading For All Ages The movie is good but the book is excellent. Perhaps the best autobiography ever written. The chapters flow with stories of sadness and humor expressed in Loretta's one phasing. For someone without much of an education, the wisdom and values Loretta shares within the book is inspiring. You will be left wanting to read more about this wonderful lady. This book does not disappoint."
1,Great condition This book was in excellent condition when received. Some of the poems are interesting. Many provoke thought - leaving you wondering what mind set was the writer in when they wrote the poems.
1,"Yeah Silver! Now We're Talkin' Hello everyone,If any of you ever want a great book (no matter of length) on Wicca this is the one for you. Yes its lengthy but you can do it. The best book for everything Wicca, it has eveything (short of wands, athames, etc). Even a section on herbs. Lots of Mythology too! Can't stress how great of a book this is enough. Love you Silver. Blessed Be"
1,Great Book I highly recamend this to anyone interested in the field of wicca or witchcraft! Excellent book. Very good condition.
1,Excellent book If you are into Wiccan rituals or want to learn more on spells to help with health ailments or protection it is worth buying. I found a lot of useful information in it. I initally found this book at a national book retailer and decided to look on amazon.com just to see if amazon would have a lower price on it and my hunch was correct. I received it sooner than expected.
1,"Great Book Great book, received in great time. I haven't finished but I know that I will truely enjoy it."
1,"An Encylopedia of Knowledge They aren't kidding; it really is the ultimate book of shadows. It covers just about ever topic in magic/Wicca imaginable. It's rather hefty, and it takes a while to read if you read it cover to cover. But, it's well worth it. I refer back to this book all the time. It was one of the best buys on the topic I've ever made. I highly recommend it!"
1,"Pro Silver! I was going to buy this book long, long ago but fell victim to the opinions of others before finally deciding to give it a go myself. Silver Ravenwolf's 'Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows For The New Generation' is everything a Witchcraft 101 book should be; an absolute must have for the aspiring Witch. Ravenwolf writes with the perfect combination of joy, humor, wisdom and fact, and this book is no exception. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this book and already refer to it on a daily basis. Don't be put off by negative reviews. Silver's books are FUN (I can't stand a typically boring book) and hugely resourceful!"
1,"Silver's Best Efforts Yet! I am always amazed with Silver's work, but this book absolutely blew me away. Silver has a rare talent of taking some extremely tough subjects and putting them in a way that anyone can understand. Although this particular book has a leaning toward teaching the teen witch, it is also an indepth study for us crones :-) After all of her books over the past 12 years or so, I can't imagine what she could possibly write next - but believe me, I'll be first in line for her next book!"
1,Wonderful book! I was so surprised with this purchase. Raven Wolf is an exceptional author and teacher. I was also thrilled with how quickly this book arrived and the condition it was in. Fully happy with this purchase!!
1,My go to book When I need help for guidance this is one of my first go to books. I love the information that is in here and have been able to use some of the referances as a guide to start my spells. Also use the blessing water a lot with my spells. I love Silver as a writer and recomend her.
1,"perfect This book was listed in good condition but not 1 single flaw on or in it. Amazing book in amazing shape. Thank you. Oh, and it arrived ahead of schedule."
1,"A great game for families with young kids This game basically combines the games Memory (where you turn over tiles to make matches) with Clue. The production value is low, but the game play is good and the artwork and theme are fun. Makes me want to try other games by Family Pastimes."
1,"Fun for everyone My 10 year old son and I have played this game and found it alot of fun. Not only the game is fun, but it is fun to play a game where you work things out together. You either win together or lose together. It is a great game for anyone who has a problem playing games against another person or anyone who is a bad loser or a bad winner. It comes in a heavy duty box which is great for those of us who have spent half our lives taping game boxes back together."
1,"If you're into this sort of thing... Then you'll love it. If not, then rent Bambi. For those idiots that STILL believe all those lame rumors (removing ribs to perfom felatio on himself) well then you shouldn't be watching this sort of video and should probably stick to wrestlin' anyway. It's a show...it's for shock value....GET IT?!?! Why do you think he does all the ""bad"" stuff (ripping bibles, giving oral sex to Twiggy on stage, self mutilating, etc ) he does? TO GET PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION! Wake up America....this isn't the wonderful place many of you seem to think it is....he's trying to point that out...trying to wake people up. Do some history on the guy before you rip him, he actually went to a CHRISTIAN school...yeah that's right......and there he learned how cruel this world can be. It's a great video depicting an over the top performer.....but as I said...if you're into this sort of thing then you'll love it!"
1,this video shows marily manson at their best. This video shows Marilyn Manson at their best. The sound quality and video quality are excellent. Pick it up if you like Marilyn and after you have watched it...You'll like them even more. END
1,it rocked harder than manson himself i liked this video because it showed his better songs.it rocks and if you don't believe me watch it for yourself.
1,"SHOCK ROCK AT ITS BEST This film is a night on the barricade taken a step further. A bit short, but a must-see for all Manson fans."
1,"How did I not discover Lee Smith a long time ago? Deft storytelling, timeless truths about women's lives, and an authentic voice that I can vouch for, having spent time with family in that part of the world. Ivy's story helps me to finally understand a lot about my own late mother, who grew up there and would have been only a few years younger than her. Like Smith, when I went to college and read Faulkner, I wondered what South he was talking about, since what I knew was Appalachian Virginia. Finally, this wonderful writer has captured the essence of that other, fascinating ""secret"" South, which has little to do with the Civil War and is more than just Hatfields and McCoys. I cannot heap enough praise on this book."
1,Highly recommended Demo releases are often for fans only and reveal blemishes that are later fixed by clever producers. I find the opposite here. The slick production on the studio releases removed a lot of the personality of this band. This CD includes what I consider to be the best versions of many Records songs and makes me wish I had seen them live early in their career.
1,"I agree - Amazing DVD - Amazing animation I agree with the other reviews that this is an amazing DVD, and want to mention that it has incredible animations of the Qi energy in the body, as well as easy to understand diagrams of the the brain, glands, and internal organs while the instructor explains how these internal exercises work.Also, many of the exercises are taught in three stages, beginner, intermediate, and advanced, and each stretch is held for three minutes, so I doubt many of us will work our way up to the advanced version of the three minute exercise very quickly.Its a DVD that you can really grow with!"
1,"great story I usually don't like heroes to be princes and royalties from some unknown kingdoms but Rolfe was a great one. I liked his story and his behaviour (or at least I could understand why he behaved the way he did). The same goes for Angeline - she was a strong woman who was able to stand for herself and still stay gentle and caring. The story was full of action and though Jennifer Blake used quite flowery language, I really enjoyed reading it. Very well-written and believable with a lot of interesting side characters (the royal guard). I definitely recommend this book, and also Surrender in Moonlight from Jennifer Blake. (but beware, the love scenes are pretty steamy :-)"
1,"Great Romance This was the first romance novel I read, it got me interested in the genre. I loved the characters, they were more developed than other characters in subsequent books I read."
1,"Great intro to the genre. I bought this book way back in 1986. I was 18 yrs. old and had just gotten over a case of the flu that was so bad I thought I was literally going to die. When I was finally well enough to leave the house, I bought this book at the supermarket to celebrate my coming back to life, so to speak. It was my very first hardcore (read: steamy and sexy) romance. Unlike so many others, it had an interesting plot and characters. RS was the perfect blend of good storytelling and steamy love scenes; it's an excellent introduction to the word of romance novels."
1,"Why is he always so right? As always, Lewis Black never fails to deliver, and this album is no exception. I learn more about politics from him, than from any other source! (kidding.....but you have to admit, he gets to the core of the issues) This album was much better than his performance on Last Laugh 2007. Now....if only he was not such a hot head, he'd make a good president!! Enjoy!!"
1,"Plain out great X-Files book! What else can I say, Ground Zero is an oustanding book. Great literature, etc."
1,"Loved this Harlem Globetrotter story when I was in 8th grade Been 30 some-odd years, but this book inspired me to play basketball when I was in school. Definitely had an impact, and I remebered the book but not the title, till yesterday I found my 8th grade journal and I had written excitedly that my book had arrived (shcolastic books) ""Go, Man, Go!""It Chronicles the story of the Harlem Globetrotters, how they got their start, how they improved, and how they forever changed the game. Now I am ordering a copy for my kids. I cannot say if this is a book adults would enjoy, but I loved it as a kid."
1,"Refreshing and reality based It's not very often that you are able to come across a writer who is so charming and, at the same time, pretty far out there. I absolutely loved the book and, will truthfuly say that it has significantly changed my life for the better. It is a quick read. You will however, be tempted to read it over and over again. I won't go into what it's about. Just read it! I consider myself to have moderate to conservative taste in my reading but, this one really blew my boat totally out of the water. One warning, if you are one who is not even the slightest bit spiritual, you might not like it. Ya now, meat and potatoes only types of folk."
1,"The greatest book I have ever read!!! The greatest book I have ever read! Without a doubt Carlos Castaneda's best. This book made me SO sad it is unbelievable. Once you understand everything that is involved in becoming a man of knowledge you have to ask yourself 'am I willing to give up EVERYTHING?' After reading this book I have made loads of progress in my own spiritual quest, no, I haven't stopped the world, yet. But at least I know now which way I am heading. If your leaning is towards sorcery and the revelation of it's secrets, you simply MUST read this. I have read everything on the occult (I kid you not) and I have to say that this was the one book that 'did it for me.' God (or nagual ) bless C.C."
1,"Best movie we've seen this year I love Danny Kaye! This movie has everything - witty music, great dancing, funny repartee, and Danny Kaye at his best. Lyrics by Sylvia Fine kept us in stitches. A great family movie, although kids might not understand some of the lyrics."
1,"Life Could Not Better Be I have to say that the Court Jester is my favorite movie. It will keep you entertained, and it is full of laughs. I don't need to say anymore, except that you will love it, and cherish it."
1,"Magnificent Comedy A pleasant mix of slapstick and word play, this movie ranks up there with iconic films like the Princess Bride and Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail. Danny Kay and Angela Lansbury are brilliant."
1,"Perfect This movie is a gem. Danny Kaye plays Hubert Hawkins, Who joins up with a band of Robin Hood Clones in order to place the Real king (The baby with the Birthmark on his bottom) on the throne. He ends up getting into the palace, where he meets Sir Ravenhurst (Basil Rathbone), the Evil Bad guy. The Whole movie is a jumble of hilarious medeival misunderstandings The songs are awesome. The best part in the whole movie is the fencing scene at the end. I laughed SO hard!I highly reccommend it."
1,Fun for the whole family! This was a family favorite for me growing up and we still quote several lines from this movie. I recently introduced this movie to my young children and they liked it as well. Danny Kaye is amazing!
1,"One of a kind by a one of a kind star My first taste of the comedic genius of Danny Kaye was when I saw this movie late one night when I was about 13. I waited anxiously for the movie to be on again and thus began my life long addiction to the sweetness of Danny Kaye. This movie is an absolute must for anyone who loves to laugh. This is one of the best musical comedies I have ever seen. The songs always manage to tug at my heart especially the lullabye. Danny was truly a one of a kind, I have yet to see an actor reach his level."
1,"Great! I've grown up on this movie. I've loved it ever since my dad sat me down to watch it at age 10. It's got everything you would want. And my favorite line: ""I found a bow and arow and learnd to shoot. I found a horn and I learned to toot. Now I can shoot and toot; ain't I cute?"""
1,"Funniest film ever??? If this film is not the funniest film ever made, then it certainly has the funniest scene ever filmed. The ""pellet with the poison"" scene is truly hilarious, and it goes on for about 10 minutes. I can't think of another picture with a scene that will make you laugh that long. Also, the image of the baby pig coming through the gate instead of the wild boar in the nighthood test makes me laugh each time I think of it. The old adage ""They don't make 'emlike this anymore"" is certainly true here and applies to the cast as well as the script."
1,"Comedy Could Not Better Be! Danny Kaye stars in this uproarious, hilarious, witty, timeless comedy about a Jester embroiled in affairs of state, romance, and laughter in a medieval kingdom.This is a film to watch over and over again!""Life could not better be, better be, better be..."""
1,"Classic comedy One of the best films Danny Kaye appeared in, and backed by an equally fantastic cast in top form: basil rathbone, angela lansbury, etc. Great comedy, great musical numbers, and a healthy dose of action. This movie is seriously funny."
1,"The BEST prog with a pop edge! The Morse bros. and company continue to grow and grow musically, with this easily the strongest material to date. Their last effort ""Kindness Of Strangers"" (still an unbelievable disc) was strong but seemed to lack the direction that ""Day For Night"" displays. Awesome vocals, awesome musicianship, awesome arrangements,......AWESOME! If you consider yourself in the least to be a fan of the modern prog movement DON'T let this one pass you by. PROG RULES!!!!!"
1,"The best prog band in the world outdoes itself Spock's Beard is the best progressive rock band to burst onto the schene since the music's heyday in the 70s. With Day For Night, the band has made its most fully realized album yet. Incredible musicianship and songwriting meld seamlessly into a listening experience unlike any other in contemporary rock. If you enjoy beautiful melody, virtuoso technical mastery of instruments, amazing vocal harmonies, thought-provoking lyrics, and great pop mixed in with the intricate musical passages characteristic of prog, Spock's Beard is a must-have, and so is DFN, their best album to date."
1,"This movie is real life... First of all, i like to state that Larry clark's ""kids"" is more like vision of how real kids act who barely enter 10th grade act nowdays and when i seen it? I was suprised that it was made few years ago because it seems like it was made just today because thats how kids realy act...Specialy the white boys who act black its so true and so real i relay ddi like it for that part.. Watch it! It's f*cking sick..."
1,"If you don' see the brilliance in this film, you're crazy As I said above, if you don't see the brilliance of this film, you're crazy. This film is NOT at all influencing teens to act the way the teens in the movie did. This movie is a wake up call to parents. The last line in the movie is a teen saying ""What the hell happened?"" Think about that as you watch this movie, I guarantee that you'll love it."
1,"KIDS I first heard about the movie ""KIDS"" from the Logo Channel in kck and wanted to see it so i could see just how others viewed teens and the ever so frightening subject of teen sexuality and the scare of contracting some sexually transmitted diseases. It was very interesting to see how they actually picked up on how the young kids of today really act in big cities, and most likely in small towns also. Makes one want to be able to keep a watchful eye on their children alot more. I thought it was a good movie and very informative to parents."
1,"Life in the big city? This would have to be Larry Clark's best movie. His other movies are very good too (Bully, Gummo), but this one stands out a little bit more. In most movies, the characters are people you can either (a.) relate to in some way, (b.) sympathize with, (c.) feel absolute pity for, or (d.) absolutly loathe. I think in this movie, you can sometimes feel all those emotions at different parts of the movie. But in the final analysis, you tend to think that these ""kids"" are just super predators headed to a life of crime.... But the beauty of this movie are the small scenes of urban decay and deliberate dialogue. Observing them interact is very watchable, and you can also pick out scenes where they behave in a very normal fashion. Their brutal, conniving, sexual way of living life in NYC may or may not be typical for kids their age, but in this story, at least some of them will pay for their ignorance and apathy with the ultimate price: their life."
1,"excelent movie I believe that this movie portrays real life adolescence, and they're views on life. Many people believe that the video is a fallacy, however from the perspective of a teen growing up on the streets, the movie couldn't have hit the nail any closer to the head. Unfortunately teens believe they're invincible and will go throughout life bouncing from wall to wall until they crash. I believe that this may as well be a documentary on the street punk/skater teenage subculture."
1,"A Real eye opener and truth to the consequences of ""kids""! When i first sat down and watched this movie i was utterly indistgust and suprised, it really opened my eyes, im 18 male and improud to say that im a virgin and other teens should know that this is a bad road to go on if you are doing this behind the backs of your parents, To the parents, you should get your kids and sit down together and watch this movie, It's a real eye opener and see that this a wrong path to go on having unprotected sex, drugs alchol. all teens should look at this movie. Unproteceted sex can get you killed it's a death warrant and suicide."
1,"everyone needs to listen up! the first time i saw this movie, it really gave me a reality check as to who i was as a person. it appears as though the people who are always putting this movie down are people who either grew up in a very secluded neighborhood, or people who think that their kids could never get involved in an atmosphere such as the one seen in ""KIDS"". What people do behind their parents backs, is most of the time expected to be undiscovered and Mr. Clark has given today's society a very long-overdue wake up call to the parents out there, so that they are more involved."
1,"I think it is a wakeup call for every teen, and parent. This is a movie that i will keep, and watch with my children in their teen years, or maby preteen years.This is a movie that every parent, and teenager must see."
1,"It May Not Be Your Reality But It Is Mine It kills me when people say that Kids is an unrealistic discription of teen life. For one thing, the people who say that are 40+ and are hoping this is not what their kids are doing. Second, these kids were not living in the cornfields of Ohio, they were in the ghetto. They were not acting psycho, they were just being kids, reckless, searching kids. Just like me. I never once doubted the reality of this movie. I was just wondering why someone took so long to bust the Breakfast Club bubble of the 80s and tell the truth about the 90s teen. We do stupid things and think we have every right to do it. Why should anyone have control of our lives, it not rebellion, its God given freedom. This is how the teenage mind works. Those miniture ""psychos"" are going to grow up and inherit the world. BE PREPARED!!!! If your kid doesn't know people who act like the characters in Kids, they ARE the person who acts like that."
1,"Realistic niew of adolescence Ever wonder what your kids are doing when they say they're staying at a friend's place over the weekend? Ever think to yourself ""Im sure i had another $10 in there""....This movie is not only entertaining, but educational to both parents and adolescents. My only quam is that in some cases it glorifies the life these kids are living. No doubt in their own mind they are living in glory, however, the stark reality is quite the opposite, and i think this message gets blurred at times."
1,"It is an excellent book. This book is a well-written critique on character education. It realistically categorizes the popular sects of moral philosophy and gives each one a fair yet tough analysis of it's strengths and weaknesses. The writing itself is very good, and makes a relatively dry topic entertaining. If you are interested in understanding the trends of contemporary moral education, I would suggest buying this."
1,"AMAZING! When i found this Cd i was so excited because i fell in love with the song, ""Thunder"" for it's romanticness and the rest of the CD IS INCREDIBLE> Upbeat, fun and very very catchy! I have it all memorized!!! It's easy to relate to and to sing along to!!I love Be my escape, Hero/heroine and Thunder~~ The whole cd is wonderful.Keep Rocking guys!"

1,The Semite people are our friends This book finally reveals and understands the in-depth relationship of Christianity and its roots. There are millions of people that have lived before Christ was on Earth but they believed in the same God. You will see them in heaven although they have never met Jesus personally while on Earth since Jesus was born after they died.Other recommended titles by Christian authors:Apocalyptic Secrets of the Hebrew Sanctuary
1,"Excellent insight into Jewish lifestyle for any Christian I have purchased 20 of these books and given them to friends. The search for Christians to reach out and understand their Jewish roots is vital for the correction or misapplication of some of our beliefs. This book points toward a more powerful and insightful lifestyle, and brings understanding to a much needed area."
1,"Well read and enjoyable. This is a lovely version of, ""Emma"", by Jane Austen. However, I discovered it was one of my least favorites by her, so I now have ""read"" it via audio book and can now say I don't need to buy the hard back version. Thank you for your great service."
1,how chick flicks should be! Jane Austen gets it right again with the heroine being worthy of the great guy. Fun story with good characters.
1,"Great regency novel Emma is a favorite in our house, and it's great to have the text in a free Kindle edition. Thanks."
1,"Please...it is Jane Austen, what isn't to love? Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors and I'm tickled my oldest daughter also loves her novels. I prefer paper books, but nothing beats a Kindle loaded with amazing books when you are traveling and don't want to carry the bulky dead tree editions."
1,Great Service I was very impressed by the response time and professionalism of the seller. I would definitely buy again from this seller and appreciate someone that takes online purchases seriously.
1,"This was a wonderful book, no matter what others say! This book was wonderfully uplifting and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely, and I believe you will as well, if you like amusing stories dealing with romance, confusion, friendship, matchmaking, and true love. Do not listen to some of the other reviews that say this book is a rip-off of Clueless. Obviously the people who posted those are incredibly ignorant, especially since Emma came out a very long time before Clueless, and if anyone was eligible to sue, it would be Jane Austen (if she was still alive) suing the makers of Clueless. Again, this was a very enjoyable book, and I would definately recommend it to anybody!"
1,"Austen Lover ""EMMA"" may very well be my favorite Austen novel :) ""PERSUASION"" may be a close second, or possibly a tie for first!Jane Austen was so witty and engaging. I really come to care about her characters. It may be harder to read for someone who doesn't enjoy the language of period pieces.The social structure is also sometimes hard to stomach!AND, I might add, that anytime a classic is ""free"" for kindle, you should at least give it a try! How easy it has become to be ""well read""!!"
1,"Excellent and arrived earlier than stated My son and I just received the bokken set and are quite pleased with them. They are well made and very well balanced. Better then most that I have had over the years. So far they are holding up nicely to impacts, though we really aren't trying to hit them very hard as we purchased them for Kata practice. The black finish is excellent which does make it heavier than the natural one. The guard fits tightly on both and needed no glue to hold it in place. Our order was shipped the day after we ordered it and it arrived a day earlier than stated. They were well wrapped to protect them and the box arrived with no damage. I will be purchasing more from them in the future as long as their quality maintains at this level."
1,"A REAL love story What is *real* love? In this film, it means: 1. the willingness to let yourself be killed by and for the person you love, and 2. the willingness to kill a person (that you once loved) for the person that you now love. Altogether a brilliant and arresting concept of love...utterly at odds with the usual kitschy notions of love.Why oh why, can't Hollywood make such startlingly original, beautiful and haunting love-stories like this, instead of ""Pretty Woman"" and its ilk?"
1,Obsession or Love? This is an unusual film about a man who gets out of the service and begins to look for a job. His girlfriend Trini recommends a landlady Luisa to him. He rents her room and trouble begins. He has difficulty making up his mind what and who he wants. Same goes for both Luisa and Trini. See this film!
1,"The Rescurers Down Under My five year old grandaughter really got into this book. I think this was much better than the original""The Rescurers"". It teaches children to respect animals."
1,"DVD movie This was a gift for my granddaughter. The movie arrived inpristine shape and very quickly. She loved the movie. Funny,her daddy did too at the same age. Some movies are ""timeless.""This is one of them.Would recommend the seller."
1,"cave twins review from grandkids. Or rather my Granddaughters love it. Recommended to them by Grandma who has fond memories of reading it when she was their age. The feedback from Heidi ( to whom it was sent ) was "" Wow Wicked Brilliant !"""
1,"A ""MUST READ"" for all Home Inspectors! This book is the premiere reference book for new Home Inspectors. The authors' knowledge is based on thousands of inspections. The layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference. There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ"
1,"Awesome Game of strategy My 5 year old grandson absolutely loved this game and didn't want to stop playing. I thought it was great because we worked as a team to beat the cat. It wasn't about winning as an individual, but winning for the critters so the cat wouldn't catch and eat them. It was great fun to watch my grandson think through what he should do next in order for the critters to get home safely. I would highly recommend it for children ages 4 to 10."
1,Great game!!!! Our kids grew up with this game and always loved it. We plan on keeping it for our next generation. Now I am getting it for another family to be able to enjoy in the same way.
1,"A great series for early language acquisition I have been using this entire series with my son since he was born, and he is now 14 months. He loves the pictures and turning the pages. The books use the format of one word per page and it gives both the English and Spanish form of the word. This is a great series for early language acquisition."
1,"A Prophetic Film -- 35 Years Ahead Of It's Time This film should be required viewing in every high school or college in America. Aside from being one of the first animated British feature films, as a poignant parable, it so perfectly explains how the Russian Revolution turned a bad situation into one of the three worst of the 20th century (the others being Nazi Germany and Communist China). Reviewers harping on the film's ""upbeat"" ending sound unaware of just how prophetic that ending turned out to be (remember what happened to Soviet Communism in 1989). This is a great film which -- incredibly -- may have now slipped into the public domain. (...)"
1,"Then and Now I have never seen the movie before (the review is more for the book since I didn't see the movie), but I read the book. Before you can read the reviews, you must remember that this book was written during the Age of Communism, and the movie also set during the Age of Communism. So, before reading or watching Animal Farm, just remember.....the book and movie take place in the past, and that is how they should be watched/read."

1,"Awsome learning aid, great format, clearly spoken. This CD travels with me from car to home to work. I enjoy the format and timing. I hope they followup with a quiz CD that says the word in spanish and allows you responce time, then immediately says the same spanish word and the english word and it is catagorized like this CD is."
1,"Egermeier's Bible Story Book When I was little, my dad used to read this book to me every night before I went to sleep...I enjoyed it very much! I wanted the same for my grandson, so I bought this for him...It is wonderful! Just the same as I remember! I'm happy that I bought it for him."
1,"Classic Bible Story Book Excellent Bible Story book for cildren over 8. Our church gives a copy to each family with children. Only negative, a few extra textual comments that fill in the story line nicely but are not in Scripture."
1,One of my favorites from childhood. This book is fine for any age that would like to learn Bible history. The stories go from creation to the early church. Children like the stories that follow the Bible very closely and adults get a great over view of Bible History...now it is easy to know when the divided kingdom started and who were the kings of Judah and the North and when the different prophets had their time of ministry.
1,Excellent The stories are well written covering the major points and simplifying the story to captivate and hold the young reader.
1,my son's favorite and MORE This was my son's favorite book for many years. He now reads it to our grandchildren - his neices! We run a full-blown preschool with an average of 110 children each year and I read it to each class every year and they all LOVE it. I lost our copy at the preschool and NEED another one so I'm buying a second one. WE LOVE THIS BOOK!
1,"One amazing book! I love this book. I could not stop reading! At one point I read 80 some odd pages. Man if it was my choice make more books especailly about RIVERCLAN! Please,I beg of it! I mean Thunderclan's cool but seriously. The book get's scary. JUST AMAZING!"
1,"Great Book!!! I think that this is a very good, thought out book. When I first saw it in the book store I was sort of interested in it but I didn't get it. I thought about it for awhile and the next time I came back I decided to just buy it and give it a try. I am glad that I did because it is turning out to be better than I thought and I can't for the next book!!!"
1,Best book ever! I read this book in 1st grade and I still like it now! As soon as I read this book my favorite animal became a cat. I liked how Erin Hunter told the story from Rusty\Firepaw`s view.
1,love it!!!!! could not stop reading until i had read them all i loved this book because it gave me a resonable idea of what my catcould be thinking my cat is dead now but i have 2 newborn kittens who love the out doors i just hope they do not go join a clan!!!!!
1,"For Readers of all Ages. I started reading the Warriors series when I was about 11, and I was immediatly captivated. First off, I was searching desperatly for an animal-fantasy book, so this series was like a miracle. I started to read the book, and I couldn't stop. Each character is so interesting, and the chemistry between each was wonderful. I read the whole series as fast as I could. It's been two years, and I am still a faithful Warriors fan. The stories themselves have interesting plots that twist and turn in every direction. These are still some of my favorite books, even though I'm 13. These stories are a good pleaser for all ages."
1,"A great book!!! This incredible journey will take you and Firepaw on an amazing adventure. This book is fun to read because Firepaw goes on so many different adventures. He starts out as a normal house pet and gets invited to a clan. This clan is called the Thunderclan. At first he is teased and insulted, but ends up as a great warrior. You will never ever want to stop reading this incredible journey!!"
1,Amazing! A adventurous and heart warming book that will keep you glued! If you love cats and clan loyalty you'll love this book
1,I love cats This book is amazing I can't wait to get the 2nd book I love firepaws New name fireheart is the perfect name for him I give this book......................5 stars hands down I love your work Erin Hunter
1,"5 stars hands-down! i love this book! when i bought it, i never put it down! and i really agree with the review before me...it really is almost like harry potter! of course..what beats harry potter?..though this series keeps the fantasy world of books with a fresh story. erin hunter.......keep on writing!"
1,My daughter devoured these! Excellent series of books for a pre-teen reader. My daughter has read all of these several times to where the bindings are starting to give out.
1,"An Excellent Story for Adults as Well Let me start this review out by saying that I am 21 years old and I do read a good amount of ""adult fiction"". However, the child in me likes to delve back into books about animals on occasion to keep my book selections fresh. When I first picked this book up years ago, I was very worried that it would be too childish for me and I would get bored with it quickly. NOT THE CASE! Ha, I was very intrigued with this story and found that I couldn't even begin to put it down. I love the story of Rusty the house cat finding his true calling out with the wild cat clans. I've read almost every book in all the series and I'm telling you that they are definitely worth it!!! Very satisfied!!!"
1,i love this book this is an amazing book with great action and is a pageturner with a great plot and lots of supense.
1,"Calling All Cat Lovers I recommend this book for ages 8-Adult. If you like cats, animal books, fantasies, and battles, you will like this book.It is a tale of loyalty, friendship,and survival, all told from a cat's point of view.In this book, Rusty, a housecat meets some wildcats while wandering in the forest behind his humans' house.He decides to leave his life as a housecat and join them.Rusty soon learns of the four warrior clans who live in the forest, each with its own speialty: Thunderclan, the bravest of the clans, Riverclan, Knowing the ways of water, Windclan, the swiftest of clans, and Shadowclan, the strongest of the clans, and they all must fight for the prey the foest contains.And so Rusty enters the world of the clan cats, and he has more to worry about than the strange belifs these cats share, for Rusty soon realizes he has left his esey life and steped into the brutal outside world: the world of the clan cats."
1,Great Book This is book is a great read. The series is wondeful for any age. I am a college student but I still enjoy it. Not a difficult reading level but quite a catchy read. I recommend starting at the beginning of the series. I am a dog person but still love these books.
1,"Book 1: Into the Wild This book is the best 5star book have ever read.This is a great cat book. You get to see are main character. Rusty is a dream with cats fighting.In the forest the next day a cat jumps on his back.That went he meants Bluestar,Graypaw,and Lionheart.He go to the clan and earns his warrior name Fireheart.We have some sad times cat died and Fireheart meants some new friends. Warrior Cats For Ever!"
1,Warriors #1: Into the Wild Personally I think this was a fantastic book and it deserves a 5 star rating. And let this book nourish young creative minds. I think it will go far. In a kids mind at least. I believe in Erin. ;)
1,"Into The Wild... This book will capture your imagination; you will look at the old house cat in a whole new way! It is for more than just children, although they love it too! Hunter dose a splendid job in creating a fantastic world of culture and legend for our feline friends. I highly recommend this series, for all ages. You will find it captures train of thoughts and keeps you thinking of the characters and what you think may happen even when the book is closed. Splendid, no animal and fantasy lover's collection is complete with-out these! A Must Read!"
1,"Great Series Perfect for Anyone To all those reading the reviews and hearing the constant ""it's too childish"" or ""the books are poorly written"", I find those to be wrong. I started this series as a senior in highschool and have enjoyed them the whole time. I never had gotten hooked on a series before this one. It's possible that, if you read a lot of longer books, you would find it a little boring, but I thought it was great for any age of reader."
1,"Amazing Book! Warriors #1: Into the Wild (Warriors)This was a very fun book to read. It is about Rusty, a cat that wishes to catch a mouse. He leaves his home and joins a clan to save all the Warriors in it. He must please everyone in the clan. He must hunt for the clan and train to be a Warrior. His best friends in the clan are Graypaw and Rayvenpaw. The clan leader's name is Bluestar; they must always protect her. I loved reading this book and if you like cats you will love this book! I can't wait to get the second one!Fire and Ice (Warriors, Book 2)"
1,warrior cats WOW thats all I can say... I think Im gonna make this short. OKay here are the best things about warriors to me. you never know whats going to happen even if you think you do.warriors really lets you get to know the charicters unlike other books.and lastly .........Its amazing. you might think Im saying that because Ive run out of things to say but im not. I highly encouage every one to read these books.........I already got my friend hooked.
1,"Awesome!! 3 words, BEST BOOKS EVER!!!! Warriors is a mindreading series for all cat lovers. If anyone asks me ""What book should I read that is mind blowing?"" I would recommend Warriors."
1,"A Pre-teen Review This book was amazing. I found that this book was hard for my class mates to understand/absorb. This book was a real jump from the spicy romance novels and fantasy novels I tend to drift toward. At first, it was hard keeping up with all the new referances/names.But, once I caught on, it was hard to even rip my eyes from this book. I read this in one sitting. I recommend this for everyone. I think most of the challanges I had were because I am dislexic. I really liked the fact that it was flawlessly written. Plus, even a person who shows some dislike to cats would find this interesting. But, be ready to buy the whole series, I promise you, it will be hard to go without. Such a captivating series."
1,"Asome This book is one of the BEST BOOKS I've ever read. It is fascinating and makes you look at the world a new way.This book is interesting to both kids and grown-ups. Be-warned, there's some violence and death in the book."
1,"Best. Series. Ever. All right, down to business...Rusty, a house cat, joins a Clan of wild cats. He becomes Firepaw and is mentored by the Clan leader herself, Blue star! He learns that Tigerstar, the Clan deputy, killed the former deputy and wants to kill his apprentice (Ravenpaw) because he knows the truth. A former Shadowclan medicine cat, Yellowfang, helps poor Ravenpaw escape but is blamed for the disappearance of some kits. The clan wants to kill Yellowfang but Firepaw saves her. The tyrannical Shadowclan leader is driven off and Firepaw/ his friend Greypaw are made warriors."
1,Great Book It is a awesome book. It has everything a book needs. It is a big tale of bravery. I love it!
1,"Wow! This book kept me interested with all of the action. The book was very discriptive. This is for sure a book thay I would read over. In fact i just bought it two days ago and i have read it 1 1/2 time. This is a great book. Will keep Harry Potter fans at bay while they wait fir the new book.It is very similer to Harry Potter just without the magic and with cats. I actually have some charecter comparisons. Firepaw is alot like Harry, they want to prove themselves and are adventurous. Grawpaw is just like Ron, they like to joke around and are almost always thinking about thier stomachs. Ravenpaw is just like Hermione they are cautious and are clever and quick. Tigerclaw is like Snape, they are cruel and dark. Bluestar is like Dumbledore they are both witty and fair. Lionheart is like McGonagell. Everybodyshould read this book. Cat lovers will love this book but just awarning there are cats that die!"
1,"Warriors! Five Stars! Amazing book! I loved this book I am going to keep reading the Warriors, they are awesome! Amazing"
1,Amazing. A fantastic book for those who love adventure and action. I would recommend that those who have read this read the entire series.
1,I Love Warriors I love this book a little more than the other Warriors books.In this Firepaw has to go through the trials of being a Clan cat.
1,"*Warriors- The absolute best books ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* *This book is about a house cat named Rusty. He has always dreamed of becoming something grand and heroic. His adventure begins! Rusty takes off into the wild, (hence the name), leaving his warm house life behind. Rusty meets more wild cats living in clans and joins Thunderclan. The local everyday orange housecat becomes Fireheart, a strong loyal wild cat! Fireheart's story is one of courage, friendship, loyalty and beliefs. Don't miss the next few books in this magnificent series.I love this book (and all the others) so much, it really makes me think differently about my two cats! This novel makes you wonder about how the cats' mind really does work...By: Ariah Colt, B.C. Canadap.s:I LOVE WARRIORS (and my dog Finni!) *"
1,"Love at First Read Wonderful book, I was at a book store looking for another book saw it, bought it, and read it. To sum it up I was there for Number Two the next day.Although the story is black and white, the characters are very likable. Cats would not live in tribes, but hey it is fantasy. Firepaw gets away with alot of stuff but when caught is punished like anyother cat would be. The only really stupid thing is having Firepaw should not be apprentinced to Bluestar. To much destiny stuff. Quiet oblivisly he will become a great leader-hero to the other cats, not to mention getting the girl. Atop of all that this is a loveable book and a must read for anyone serious about fantasy.=)"
1,"Got him reading!!! My fifth grade son has always had a strong aversion to reading...then he picked up this book! He went thru the first two in record speed and we had to go, at 8:30pm, to pick up the next... only to find the shelves empty!!Its a WONDERFUL thing to write such an exciting and captivating story that a non-reader simply can't get enough!I HIGHLY recommend this book to any parent looking for a book to captivate their 5th -7th grader!"
1,"Cat story Everybody should buy this adventurous book Into the Wild. This book is about cats fighting for survival. These cats follow a law of a clan named Starclan. Starclan is practically heaven but with no God only cats. A cat named Rusty lives with people, or Twolegs, and that makes him a kittypet. Rusty goes into the woods and joins a clan named Thunderclan. He is supposed to promise to protect his clan with his life. He makes new friends and finds out treacherous secrets that only he can reveal. He gets a new name from his clan and before he came the clans medicine cat had a vision that only fire can save the clan. Rusty is worried but will be ready when war comes to his clan."
1,warriors I really love this book. It reminds of a book i once read. It has alot of action. Its also interesting how clan cats live without depending on humans. I suggest getting this book.
1,"loved it!!!!!!! This book is the begining of a interesting, actionpacked, and fun series! I could not put it down!!!! the plot is intreging and it is like notting I've ever read befor!!"
1,too great I have read lots of Warrior books but this book was just well like I said TOO GREAT!Or maybe even well I just cant explain! I wish I could be a ThunderClan cat! I wish could be Spotted leaf she rocks! And if your reading this Erin Hunter I cherish you.Please keep rocking out on those Warrior awesome Warrior books!
1,"great book this book is great for ages 10+. keeps your mind on the book and doesn't get boring. by the end, the reader is left astound. it is about a young half vampires journey to the vampire kingdom, vampire mountain, where he is welcomed warmly by other and gets to see many of his kind.There is one problem though; he was blooded (when blood travels from the vampire to the soon to be vampire) too early. Therefore, to prove himself worthy of being part of the vampire clan, he must engage the trials of initiation."
1,"Love 'Crimes of Passion!' Quite simply, I'm glad that Big Head Todd and the Monsters are still doin' it! I've had 'Crimes of Passion' since first released, and it remains a constant play selection for me. Any BHTM fan that doesn't quite 'get' this CD needs to keep listening (while giving thanks that Todd and the gang have found a way to keep their fans in grace). 'Imaginary Ships' is one of their best ever. ....LOVE this CD and can't wait for the next one!"
1,very good game for someone that loves the series story keeps you on the edgeyou feel your actually fighting due to actual combatand if you like mysteries this game might interest you too
1,"Jakks delux talking pokedex My daughter really loved this game... she was really into pokemon at the time and used it alot...It really holds up...It still looks about as new as when we purchased it... If your child loves pokemon, this is a great game."
1,"My son loves it!!! I don't know much about this toy, but my son has enjoyed it very much. He has speech impairement and that was the reason I choose this toy."
1,Fun for any Pokemon lover My nephew gave this toy to my son when he out grew it. MY 6 year old is now very much in to Pokemon and he loves this thing. I would have to say it is very durable and works great since it is a hand me down and has already been through one other loving it. I found this one on Amazon because my other nephew wanted one too. It doesn't seem they make these anymore so I came to Amazon to look and I think the price was really good. I don't know the original price was when it was bought by my nephew but this seemed very reasonable. If you have someone in your family who loves pokemon and finding out info on all the different ones this is the toy!
1,"The power of observation Alan Hollinghurst has been a fine novelist for many years, starting with ""The Swimming Pool Library,"" but in ""The Line of Beauty"" his powers of observation and insight are at their height whether writing about the mundane or the consequential.Is in not a matter of what this book is ""about,"" it is a work of art and an experience that you don't want to end."
1,"Best Novel of the Millenium, So Far There's no way to know how long LoB will hold the title but no novel written since 2001 is any better than this one. Hold Hollinhurst up against any of our so-called genius American novelists writing today and see the truly impoverished state of letters in the U.S."
1,"What a Beauty indeed. In my estimation this will go down as one of the best pieces written in the English language this or any other century. I found the charaters believable and highly entertaining. I would imagine that many, many people, particularly gay men, would find Nick to be alot like themselves. I wanted to keep going back to the book, night after night as I was entranced with the story and the characters. Well written and thought provoking, what a beauty indeed."
1,"Toffs, Poofs & Allegators For all you time poor 21st C ites. This is book is brilliant so go read it."
1,As described. Good price These met the requirements of what I needed and a good price. They are a bit thinner than regular ones but I just needed a lot of them to hand out papers/ course material at school.Great for report covers too.
1,"The Best Book I Have Ever Read! On a scale of one to ten Henry and Beezus by Beverly Cleary is a twenty. That is why I am going to try to persuade you to read this wonderful book. The first reason you should read this book is because once you pick it up you just cannot put it down. It has so many funny things that happen to Henry, Beezus, and Ramona that you cannot wait to read what happens next. Now I am going to tell you a little about this book. It is about a boy, Henry, who wants a new bicycle. His parents cannot afford to buy him one so he decides to find a way to get the money himself. If you want to know how he gets the money you will have to read the book. But don't think that reading a book about a boy that gets money to get a bike is boring. In this book Beverly Cleary makes it so much more interesting. So if you want a book that you can read that will bring the kid side out of you again, read Henry and Beezus by Beverly Cleary."
1,"Grandson enjoys!!! I LOVED these books as a young girl! Now I can pass them on to my grandkids! Boys or girls, all love them!"
1,The best laugh you will have with your clothes on! Craig is absolutely hillarious. This is a must item for all to have especially at your next get together with friends. Guarranteed to put a smile on everyone's faces.
1,"High quality, helpful for leveling and front wheel stability Lightweight but high quality, stable unit. I bought this go go with my CycleOps wind trainer. Glad I did because otherwise I'd be riding downhill the whole way. Yes, this is a ""leveler"" and you would need to stack another to go ""uphill."" Keep in mind that if you raise the entire bike up, it may be harder to get onto the bike if the top beam of your frame is already high for you. Can't imagine what could be better. Recommended.Update: I still think think this is a great item and worth buying with the trainer, but more for stability than leveling. The trainer only raises the back wheel a little bit so the downhill sensation I was worried about isn't so much of an issue. The bigger problem is that without this item your front wheel may be wobbly."
1,"Perfect Design I purchased this with the Kinetic bike trainer and i could not imagine riding without this. Not only does this hold your bike on par with the trainer, it also supports more of the front tire than the rest of the products sold out there. Keep in mind that the pressure that you are going to be placing on the front tire the entire off-season. You want as much surface area as possible so as to not put too much strain on the front rim and tire. This works out perfectly!"
1,Bike block You MUST purchase this if you plan on getting a bike trainer. It is great and really makes the bike stable. I was surprised by the size of it - it looks like it would be small but is in fact fairly large. Great product!
1,CycleOps stackable climbing block The block will level out the front wheel of your bike while on your trainer or will give you the feel of an uphill climb. Great buy as a trainer accessory.
1,Great product and deal Works well with many different bike tires. You can buy more and stack them for great challenges while riding on a trainer.
1,they rock Mest is an awesome band. I think they live up to what real punk is. Go buy their albums its way worth the money!
1,"Mest- Destination Unknown This is one of the best Cd's I've heard in a long time!! I usually get a Cd and there's only one or two songs on the whole Cd I Like, but I like all the songs on this!! Plus I've met the band before and they're really cool and down to earth! I love this band and you will too!!"
1,"Mest ....amazed once again!! I picked up the new cd DESTINATION UNKNOWEN,by the crazy guys in mest and i ould liek to say i was amazed. Thsalbum shows a more mature soun , yet ep sthe same energy and feeling as the firt cd ""wasteing time"". With driving songs like Opnions and catchy punk/hip hop songs like cadilac, the cd has a fresh new sound and shows mest in out to take over the punk scene, an then the world!!!awsome cd you should make sure to pick it up as soon as possible"
1,"Mest is the best! Mest is a pop-punk quartet from Chicago's south side. This album really shows their development as musicians and lyricists, as well as reaffirms their talent for writing catchy songs. Perhaps you've heard their singles ""what's the dillio"" or ""Cadillac"" on the radio, but they go deeper than that on this album. Mest's music can appeal to all types of people; part of their greatness is their ability to write songs that any listener can relate to. The lyrics are simple but truthful. I suggest you check out Mest, they are one of my favorite bands, cool guys, and great live."
1,"Mest is WICKED Mest takes every genre and mixes it together. They have the pop punk edge, of course, over thuggish R&B;/Rap beats, and they have some raggae and ballads mixed in there as well. This is teenage angst, with the humor of the Beastie Boys, and the angst of Good Charlotte.They're really eclectic, and not too hard on the eyes either. :)"
1,"MEST woohoo Destination Unknown was an instant hit with me I loved it! After listening to it for the first time I was wanting to roll in a cadillac down the small town streets of Iowa where I live....Ok so maybe Iowa isn't the best place to roll in a cadillac but that doesn't matter! what matters is that this CD is just the coolest thing. the instant it was in my CD player the volume was cranked up to be sure and vibrate the floor. The CD was fun but also had a lot of truth to it as in the songs Another Day, Fucted up Kid and Mothers Prayer just to name a few, but its hard to name specific songs that should be listened to because the whole CD just flat out rules and I highly recommend it!..."
1,Way to go Mest! WOW! This cd is awesome! I have all of theirs and this one is by far the best. Anyone who doesn't have it should go and pick it up today! Mest is a pop/punk band who has an awesome style of music. Their lyrics are true and hit close to home. Please buy this cd! xoxo
1,"Mest is the Best First of I have to say, I don't personally own the Destination Unknown cd, but I have heard the songs from it and let me say that they are great. I recently saw Mest in concert and the songs from Destination Unknown were so awesome. Personally, anything from Mest is good to me, but the difference and variation of these songs is just the best. If this is your type of music, I'm sure that you'll love Destination Unknown."
1,"Punk Mest's new album ""Destination Unknown"" is one of the best punk albums out there. They have a mix when is comes to their lyrics, they have some love songs, fun/funny songs, and those other songs that you just don't get. They have a great band that is really close with their fans, and they are always on tour, so ppl go out and see a show! You can also go to the website and join their street team!"
1,"Ashleys review Destination Unknown~ MESTThis album is a mix of punk, pop, and emo. Its a kick[s] album that will keep u hanging on for more. Its a continuation of thier first and great album, wasting time. if ur into punk at all, this album will keep u banging ur head all night. its got great lyrics! but it and u wont regret it.keep mest going!"
1,"mest pure excellence!! hello everyone this cd ""Destination Unknown"",the latest from Mest is sheer brilliance at the least.It starts off great and ends better with every track getting better and better every tme you hear it.It is by far one of the best cds i've ever purchased i know ill never get tired of this masterpiece.So if you dont have it two simple words GET IT."
1,"Mest Rocks Hey dudes u should all get this cd, its got like everything in it and i cant stop listening to it myself, the guitar melodies are awsome and the singing is great, so r the lyrics. well later"
1,"The Best... Ok, peoples.... Mest is one of the greatest bands. I've been a fan of there since last October when I saw them in concert with Good Charlotte...with songs like ""Caddilac"" and ""Mothers Prayer"" what more could you ask for in a band. Great sound, awsome personalities!, and so far fans that would do anything for them. And they are rock'n without losing who they are, their roots. They know who they are, they know the sound they are, and wont change it for anything! The cd is one of the best Album's i got this year! The song are really catchy and you'll know all the words and backround music in about a day or two! This band... This CD kicks...Rawk ON!"
1,"Simply Amazing Another amazing CD by Mest. Destination Unknow is by far the best cd I own. With songs like ""Reason"", ""Cadilac"", ""Without You"" and ""Yesterday"" its hard to find any band that comes even close to Mest. If you're planning on buying a CD that has great songs you'll never get tired of, pick up Destination Unknown, along with Wasting Time, and Mo Money Mo 40'z."
1,Great Book Like all of Agatha Christie's books this one is very good. Written to make you think. Takes you to a different time in history. Quality work. I will collect all of her books. Well worth reading. Makes you think.
1,"packed well - arrived in time specified I'd worn out my 1960s purchase of this book..........reread one of Delderfield's ""sets"" almost every winter........THanks for having it!!"
1,Fun for many ages My grandson loves to fill this with everything he can find. It is light weight and great for the toddler age.
1,"The Treasure Trove of Eastern Christianity Western Christianity in its quest for a ""rational"" spirituality has lost the rich tradition of meditation and contemplation which was presevered in communities in the Mid-East since earliest times.This work introduces spiritual practices now seen as ""New Age"" or non-Christian oriental religious practice as bone fide early Chrisitan practices of our ancestors in faith.Reading this book will re-inforce that Christian spirituality must transform the totality of the human person: body, mind (rationality) and spirit."
1,"Profound and Informative As a Roman Catholic graduate student in philosophy of religion/theology, I rarely find books on spirituality/religion that are written for non-academic audiences to be much good. This book, however, is a notable exception. Its exposition of Eastern Orthodox spirituality (especially hesychasm and the Jesus Prayer) is moving and clearly written. Usually, Western Christendom has spoken condemningly (if at all) of hesychasm. This book opens up the deep, Christocentric, ancient practices of Eastern Orthodox monasticism for anyone to see and understand. I found much in this book to challenge me and surprise me. I cannot recommend it strongly enough for anyone who is interested in taking a good, long look at practices of prayer and Easter Orthodoxy. A must-read for Christians."
1,"Best Video Ever!! My son is 18 months old and lives by this video!! He rolls a ball across the floor and calls it his meatball as he crawls to get it like Mr. Snuffaloughogus. I thought he wouldnt like all the kids who sing their favorite songs, but I think he likes to watch the other kids. It has a lot of great songs to sing along with and it taught me some new ones to sing with him too. I find Sesame STreet a good learning tool for those who allow their children to watch tv. Obviously, its worked in my case since my son repeats things he sees on the show. Highlyrecommended by a greatful mom.Billy's Mom"
1,LOVES IT!!!!! MY son absolutly loves this video!!!! He liked the first one and I saw the second and he was so happy. I think that he likes the kids in this one. He laughs when they laugh and starts dancing to the songs. I would HIGHLY recommend this video.
1,"Brilliant I can say quite honestly that this is one of the best books I have ever read, though I'm useless at placing books in top-10 charts. Most books I've read have something, Ulysses has more or less everything. I recommend the use of notes of some kind, especially for the ""Oxen of the Sun"" chapter, but I think people shouldn't be too frightened to dive straight in, it's really not such a big bad scary monster!"
1,"the minor proves the major Is Ulysses the greatest novel of the century?Yes, surpassing all other literary endeavors in scope, depth, and intelligence.Is it unintelligible?No, nor is it undecidable, but only pointedly, significantly ambiguous.Why this quality?So that the reader must work as hard (if not harder)than the author himself did when composing the novel. And it is a composition.Why should the reader work?So that he/she might learn something substantial; so that he/she will be able to view the world with a new mind's eye.Does it suffice to read the book only once and quickly?Nope.Diagnosis for anyone who assigns the book less than five stars:idler; incapable of intense intellectual effort; probably likes vonnegut."
1,"Operatic! This, as it is for many, is a wonderful and challenging read, forcing you to work at reading at creating and meeting up with the author in this wonderful and truly rich fiction that truly is fiction in all senses - not following but breaking up, re-casting fictional elements as he goes. Fiction is not doing this challenging, and upsetting of fictional expectations so much I find, and when I come across any writer who does I have to read and read them over - for fear of how long it will be until I next meet with something that challenges, that moves things... recently I have enjoyed Ben MarcusNotable American Women: A Noveland also Jayne Joso'sPerfect ArchitectANDSoothing Music for Stray Cats- I strongly recommend both authors and these works - after your 1st or 3rd reading of our wonderful Joyce."
1,"joyce is beyond all else For someone to revolutionize an artform is unique. But James Joyce did it with every book that he wrote. It is too bad he only wrote four but i guess between Ulysses and Finaganns Wake, a reader could spend his life decifereing them. On to Ulysses: this book is incredible. It is like a puzzle that is too large and complex to ever be finished, but at the odd moment that two pieces fit together, it is a revelation that sparks the mind and soul. Probibly the greatest peice of art that i have ever absorbed but to readers beware; it is more an art than a typical novel. Poetry, prose and passage all in one with spiritual interpretation to be discovered and shakspeare to be dissected. if you love the english language than read this book with an open mind and a hopeful heart. The book that shows the diversity of our language."
1,"If you want to know more... If you loved what you heard from Norton and Riordan but want to know more about the literary bones and puzzles in Joyce's Ulysses, I highly recommend the course ""Joyce's Ulysses"" taught by James A.W. Heffernan of Dartmouth. It is only available from The Teaching Company and it goes on sale once a year. Listen to the book several times before you listen to Professor Heffernan. The Heffernan lectures will greatly increase your understanding of the work."
1,"A 45 hour trip for a first time reader of Ulysses I offer the following advice. Read Ulysses while listening to the Donnelly, Healy-Louie narrated audio-book. Other reviewers suggested reading aloud, which is good advice, but this excellent audio version of the book will greatly improve your reading experience and understanding."
1,"Definitive, Unadulterated Compared to other editions of Ulysses, this one does not take the needless and mildly obnoxious liberties with the text that certain other editions have--no fancy typography and unnecessary section dividers to be found here. This is (thus far) the unchallenged, definitive edition, with helpfully numbered chapters and the corresponding Odyssey chapter titles in the table of contents. The introduction and forward, while in no way revelatory, are informative and interesting enough."
1,"Nothing could compare Ulysses is the greatest thing (in all of arts and sciences)ever created by a man. I have read it all the way through once, and have re-read the individual episodes plenty of times on their own. A whole part of my life was defined by the reading of this book. It is no small undertaking to construct a universe. Ulysses is more than a machine, more than an organism; Ulysses is a universe. If you want to read deeper into things (which of course you do, if you're reading this book), then the most indispensible of the commentaries is Stuart Gilbert's, which was written under Joyce's supervision."
1,"Not For Everyone This is a fascinating book for those who have the patience and time to explore its intricate chapters and themes. Yet, it should not be forced upon anyone as required reading or for that matter anyone under the age of 21. The richess and complexity of the Circe episode alone earns a 5 star rating. Other episodes such as Cyclops, Ithica, Nausicaa and (of course) Penelope are memorable. There were times (Oxen of the Sun, Scylla and Charrybdis) that I just did not have the energy required to continue, but on the whole, a worthy venture.It particularly helps if you can identify with the eroding dreams of either Leopold Bloom or Stephen Deedalus. That is why it may appeal to those who their 20's just making their way out in life or those who middle aged such as myself, who reflect upon what has gone down and what is yet to come."
1,"""Ulysses"" by James Joyce - Gabler Edition BOOK WAS IN LIKE-NEW CONDITION AND WAS PRICED AT $8.50 RATHER THAN $19.95 AT BOOK STORES."
1,"What a great rendition! I have listened in the past to the taped rendition of Ulysses, and I pushed my way through it for the bragging rights. This new version is just so superb and so amazing in its vitality.While at times Ulysses is still a challenge to grasp, I can guarantee that the whole book is much more comprehensible, and wonderful, to hear it read so well. It suddenly makes sense.As a by-the-way, the Naxos packaging is second only to Apple's iPod in the pleasure I got from handling it and opening it."
1,"British and Irish Cooking I have had this book for years and love it. Well, I've loved it to death - the pages are all falling out so I looked on line to see if I can replace it. The one copy costs $64 ! I don't quite love it THAT much, so will soldier on with the one I have. But, really, the recipes are authentic (I am British with some Irish roots too) and reliable and there is a good variety."
1,Quality product This is a high quality product that we love to use. It arrived on time and as expected. No problems whatsoever.
1,"The Greatest Generation Speaks How wonderful it is, as a result of Brokaw's first book, that so many communication barriers have broken down and that so many people have shared their previously untold stories with us. I was moved beyond words by so many of these first-hand accounts. As a 47 year-old daughter of a WWII veteran who has never spoken of his wartime experiences, Brokaw's books have provided me with a deeper respect for and understanding of my dad. This past November I viewed Veterans Day in a way I had never done before. Thank you, Tom Brokaw, for contributing so significantly to our appreciation of this generation."
1,"Honored Memory In 1987, my mother, brother, and I walked through the American Military Cemetary in Luxumburg - where thousands of men are buried from the Battle of the Bulge. It is a peaceful, dignified place. We met a women who had finally found the grave of her brother who had died in the battle more than 40 years before. I cried for these men who gave the supreme sacrifice nine years before I was born. Thank you for your sacrifice. Thank you, Mr. Brokow, for a well written book that gives honor where honor is due."
1,"Both heartrending and uplifting After the publication of the bestsellingThe Greatest Generation, Tom Brokaw received mail from readers across the country. The letters provide accounts of WWII soldiers who reconnected after fifty years because of a name mentioned in Brokaw's book. Children and grandchildren wrote of the deceased soldiers they never knew - and how important the book was in understanding their ancestors. Others wrote of similar tales mentioned in The Greatest Generation, or pointed out areas of the war that Brokaw overlooked. At times heartrending and uplifting, Brokaw's follow up to The Greatest Generation is truly inspiring.The audiobook is a great way to ""read"" this book. Brokaw reads the introductions to the chapters, while a supporting cast reads the letters and accounts featured. The various voices allow the listener to move between stories with ease."
1,"Extremely interesting book, combines history and information Sisters: Catholic Nuns and the Making of America is anoverview of the influence and contributions of nuns in thevast American land. There are a few statistics, someinterviews, and a great deal of history. History can bea very slow read. It can be to dense to wade through.But Fialka does a great job of presenting history in away that is not only interesting, but also enjoyable toread. The only sad part, of course, comes in the latterpart of the book when he writes of the decline of somany of the sisterhoods. Some of the decline was fast andintense, some has been slower - but all of it seems tobe painful. There are a few glimmers of hope, though.Some of the work done by the Dominican Sisters of Nashvilleand the Oblate Sisters of Providence is wonderful."
1,Boys My son is really into these types of moves. Always good for a laugh. Not sure he understands everything but that is probably a good thing.
1,miles of memories This albumn is another collection of great songs from Dierks! It flows well from beginning to end. I can really feel the heart and soul he put into each song.
1,"Soulful. Easily, great country music. Dierks Bentley's ""Long Trip Alone"" is a wonderful listen.The songs take me back to roadtrips and good times.I love the effortless mix of modern country and old time bluegrass.Bentley's voice is rustic, but enjoyable.Worth every penny."
1,"Great Read! Simply put, this book is excellent entertainment. It is definitely one of our familiy's favorites and one that I can see myself reading again."
1,"Absolutely wonderful! ""The Alliance"" is defiantely one of the best books I've read (And I read ALOT of books. Can't help it). Having first read ""The Work and the Glory"" and ""The Kingdom and the Crown"" series by the same author, I was a bit surprised when I found that the book took place in the future, but it was absolutely wonderful. The moral issues explored were very interesting, and the plot was fast paced and exciting. You should definately give this book a try! (P.S. I love Eric Lloyd[the main character]! He's awesome!)"
1,Love this book! This has been a favorite of mine for years. It is a great story about liberty and the consequences of trying to take away liberties to make society better. Highly recommended.
1,"Only Thing That Works For Me I had dry eye problems that caused filamentary keratitis (little tunnels from the surface of my eye inwards), after having them removed (painfully) several times I went to a different doctor that suggested I try Theratears Omega-3. They are a bit pricey (check your local Walgreens and keep the coupon for a $1 off that comes inside the box) but they are the only thing that have worked for me.I tried switching a few times to other brands that costs less and I immediately noticed a difference. The Omega-3's also seem to help with mood and joint pain. If you have stomach problems taking them at first just start with one pill at night and after a week go to two, and after another week 3. You can also split up the doses though I don't recommend 3 a day at first unless you are already on Omega-3s.I felt such a difference after a few weeks of taking these that I found a reputable supplier of childrens chewable Omega-3s for my son!"
1,"Best product for eye health. I had severe dry eye and found this to be the best product to help restore my eyes to health. I did have to have punctal plugs inserted, but I feel that I would not have been able to go back to wearing contacts without these supplements. I tried other fish oil products, but they did not work nearly as well, leaving my eyes more irritable and itchy. Good for blepharitis as well!"
1,"Greatest product for dry eyes! I have suffered from dry eyes for the past two years and i have tried numerous products. I have tried supplements, eye drops, compresses,etc. The thera tears have been highly recommended by my eye doctor. My meibomian glands are not releasing the oily film effectively so it leaves my aqueous tears unprotected and so my eye dries up faster.Ever since I started taking thera tears I was able to feel and see a difference within 5-7 days. I don't wake up with my eyes dry shut anymore and my eyes aren't blurry anymore.Pros:1.Can tell a difference and my eyes aren't as dry as they were before2.It contains fish oil which is also great for your heart and vasculature3. Price is great and cheaper than store prices4.They don't SMELL like fish pills5.It's dosed once a day versus other products that are 2-3 times a dayCons: only 11.They tend to cause you to belch some fishy smell.I highly recommend this product!!"
1,"EXCELLENT BOOK!!!! I was given this book as a gift from a friend who said, ""Now you'll understand what's going on with your life, Diane. You're a mustang. That's not a negative."" When I read Fawn Germer's Mustang Sallies, I knew what she meant. I've always felt misunderstood and underappreciated. Now I realize I am what Germer calls a ""trailblazer."" I've never been one to go along to get along, and I don't kiss up to move up. That's hurt me in the past, but Mustang Sallies is filled with strategies to make me succeed without selling out. I love this book. (...) It's phenomenal."
1,"oh yes Ladies be a mustang sallie but read this first! This book has all kinds of insights on what we as women do in the workforce to make it work and our own ways we subvert our own success. Read this women, you are in this book."
1,"Provides great advise Had this book a longtime on my wishlist. Finaly got it.I like the way it's written. It's very clear, and well structured. Full of advises and tips. I especially liked chapters 5 and 6, on ""Setting your fees"" and ""Finding your Markets"". But the appendices are really amazing! List of fees (!), Sample contracts (!), Sample promos, model documents,.... you can just use!!!! I mean if you ever wanted to make a jump-start with writing,... this will certainly help."
1,"You Should Read This! Considering a freelance career in copywriting? Then you should read this. Once again Bob Bly has come up with a clear, concise book that touches on all the basics you need to know to get your new business up and running.I bought this years ago when I was starting out as a professional copywriter, and it was--and is--an invaluable resource."
1,Tailored to perfection The Tailor of Panama is an excellent and entertaining film. Both actors Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush bring a great sense of enjoyment to their characters. Mr. Brosnan brings a great sense of wickedness to his character Andy Osnard. Mr. Rush brings a great sense of naivetivity and at deception to his character Harry Pendel.When Harry begins to spin his lies to Osnard both men know what's going on.But they allow each other to keep going just to see were everything leads to. I really liked the ending of the film. I also enjoyed the way it was filmed the scenery of Panama is breathtaking and the music adds a sense of mystery and excotic feelings. Also the story is very interesing. Although at times the movie kinda drags along it is overall very enjoyable.I really liked this film and I think it's a very enjoyable movie.
1,"LOVE I LOVE THESE SUNGLASSES!! These are my second pair, I left the first on top of my car and drove off. I am small, 5'2"", and they still fit good. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT"
1,Great for heavy scrubbing I added this brush to my cleaning kit to aide in stubborn cleaning and those extended shooting trips to the range. I also use this brush as a secondary cleaning brush in my method of cleaning
1,A safe way to clean your gun It's much more gentle compared to phosphor bronze or SS. They say it's safe but I still prefer a nylon since it works just fine if you don't postpone the cleaning for too long. Takes care of residue in a couple of swift passes and preps the bbl for further treatment.
1,Houseboat Great pair to put together. Grant is alway excellent and Sophoia was at her best. Great family entertainment which there are few to choose from today. Recommend it most highly
1,"A Bing Bang Bong... Sophia Loren and Cary Grant team up in this hysterical movie. He's a widower with three children and his widow's sister after him (since she was four years old). Sophia is the daughter of a rich Italian Band conductor - she runs away because she's tired of being told what to do - and becomes the nanny for Grant. The only problem is she can't cook or clean. But the children love her. And soon Grant does too. Two things I learned from this movie: Never park your house on the railroad tracks, and always tie your house tightly to the dock."
1,"The Movie 'Boy on a Dolphin' is Sophia Loren's Best The Movie 'Boy on a Dolphin' is Sophia Loren's Best.But Houseboat is almost as good. If Sophia Loren is your cup of tea, (how can't she be?) then by all means feast your eyes. She's at her luscious prime here.God did some of his best work when he made Sophia Loren.A wonderful movie, lots of fun, and beauty."
1,"Excellent, accurate, and detailed This incredible book is a gem. Filled with black and white illustrations from the period in question, the fashion plates, drawings, caricatures, and portraits help create a strong sense of the 19th century. This book follows the gradual changes and shows the overall shape of each chunk of time in the form of silhouettes (The author prefaces each section with a gray on white figure outlining the nature of that time's costume). While this book may be out of print, it is well worth the search if your passion is costume history through primary resources, particularly that of the 19th century. The approach is purely pictorial, but if what you want to know is the look, this book is excellent."
1,"I LOVE THIS NEW ARTIST!! I picked up this album on a recommendation from a friend and was pleasantly surprised at what I heard! As I listened each track became my favorite song. It's got a lot of depth and variety with everything from pop to blues to ballads...and then there's ""Tangier"" which has a latin/world music feel all it's own. Each song tells a story through visual lyrics and beautiful arrangements that really show off the versatility of Holly Light's voice. In a nutshell it's got great music, great lyrics and a great vibe. I can't recommend it highly enough!!!"
1,"This still remains my favorite Steve Howe solo album I know, I must be a freak, but I have grown to love Steve's off key warbling. I love to sing along in the car (but get in big trouble if someone is in the car with me...) These are all well crafted songs, not just showing off his guitar talents."
1,"dvd of 1999 sandra bullock film...brand new, shipped on time, exclellent wrapping. prodict arrived early, and was brand new....expected a reconditioned used version...was quite pleased with price, delivery, and product.chris"
1,"An Underrated, Underseen Gem Apparently this movie got lost in the shuffle somehow (see other reviews)and it is a shame, because it is a very funny, semi-black comedy that deserved a broader audience. While Liam Neeson is not usually cast in comedies, he should do more of them because he was very good as Charlie, the burned-out drug agent and he was surrounded by a great cast, topped by Oliver Platt, who was, as usual, excellent, and Sandra Bullock, who had a small but effective part as Charlie's no-nonsense girlfriend. Mary McCormick was hilarious in a tiny, almost unrecognized part as Fluvio's (Pratt's) caustic wife and the group of sadsacks who made up Charlie's therapy group added their own comic note. I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to relax and have a nice, uncomplicated laugh and enjoy two very attractive leading actors."
1,"Interviews with Americans tell the truth about Individualism This book is about the inevitable conflict between American Individualism and the fact that humans are by nature social. We hunger for relationship yet we want it only on our terms. Bellah and his team of reseachers take on the enormous task of interviewing people from all over the country and the results of these interviews are presented factually and then analyzed. Whether one agrees with the book's conclusions or not, the interviewees speak for themselves, and they speak for a majority of Americans today who are often torn by conflicting authoritative messages and motives from without and within. This book is a marvelous and sometimes unsettling mirror into contemporary American society."
1,Excellent This album is excellent. The Coconutheads are a terrific Florida Reggae band. I recommend this CD to all my friends who enjoy light reggae. This is great summer music.
1,THE STANDBY I have used this product for years. I personally enjoy having a few quality lubricants available to me at any given time. Eros Original is always the ONE that I never rotate in my search for the best lubes. Enjoy
1,"Never fails It's great stuff for the intended purpose. Never dries out, very little needed. Because you use so little, it's actually very inexpensive if you buy it in large containers like this one."
1,review bodyglide Pjur Original Bodyglide is probably the smoothest and most comfortable personal lubricant ever in my experience and I am on my second bottle. Pjurfect
1,"BEST LUBE EVER This lube is wonderful. It does exactly what it needs to do. The best quality lube I have ever used. Your skin even feels smooth after using it, instead of slimy and gross like other brands.This lube makes everything feel better.Great!"
1,"Clean, Scentless, Wife is not allergic My wife is highly allergic and it has been quite difficult to find something that is ok for us to use. This is the only product that isn't sticky and fits that profile. Worth the higher price..."
1,"Great Love Story This is the ultimate movie experience; they just don't make love stories like this anymore. I feel that William Shakespeare himself would have given the screen play five stars if he were alive today. This is not the original version of this movie but I feel that it is the most entertaining of the bunch. The costumes, the music, the surroundings all fit perfectly to accomplish a work of art. This would be the ideal movie to watch on a rainy night right in front of the fire place. I recommend it highly for those of you looking for the ultimate love Story."
1,"Always so good! I went to see this movie when it came out in 1968 when I was 12. This is the best ""Romeo&Juliet"" movie ever. Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting are forever. Actors/actresses, music, costume, location and so on... Everything was perfect. Love this movie."
1,Romeo & Juliet This was the absolute best production of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet made to date. Hard to obtain from any other source. A truly cherished movie.
1,"Great Deal This video was on our daughter's Christmas list. Found it on Amazon, ordered it and it arrived in mint condition and in a timely manner. Would order from this dealer again!!!"
1,"Romeo and Juliet My favorite version of this oft-filmed classic is Zeffirelli's Oscar-nominated version. Starring two unknowns in the title roles (17-year-old Whiting and 15-year-old Hussey), the movie remains true to Shakespeare, while making the language more accessible to modern audiences. Both Michael York (as Romeo's nemesis, Tybalt) and Milo O'Shea (as Mercutio) lend strong support, while Zeffirelli's unabashed romanticism is enhanced by magnificent period detail and a sweeping score from Nino Rota. The story of youthful rebellion also spoke to basic issues arising in the restive sixties. A top-notch rendering of an eternal classic."
1,"The definitive Romeo & Juliet! Italian director Franco Zeffirelli did an outstanding job of bringing Shakespeare's romantic tale to life. It is THE definitive version of Romeo & Juliet, in my opinion. The fact that the actors were so close to the age of the star crossed lovers adds realism and freshness to the story.Shakespeare's words flow so naturally that you forget that it is a classic play and just get lost in the story. The cinematography is beautifully done and the wonderful customes are a treat for the eyes!You will enjoy this movie ... again, and again ... I highly recommend it!"
1,"Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet As a high school English teacher, I show this film every year to my students and they love it. Some even love it more than the Luhrmann version in 1996. What is so helpful is that now it's on DVD-rather than VHS-I no longer have to fast forward and rewind to get to the right part. Plus the wide-screen layout gives more of the picture and the beautiful Verona scenery! This is a must for any English teacher or Shakespeare lover!"
1,"Romeo and Juliet directed by Franco Zeffirelli The scenery, cinematography, and music all serve the story so well. If one is a little bothered by the fact the first part of the film is slow paced then be patient for the pace and drama appropriately intensify toward the middle of the film. The relatively unknown actors are perfect in their roles - even the minor characters are excellent and add so much to the overall effectiveness of the drama. I highly recommend seeing this one."
1,"Human Emotion transcends time............ I first saw this film in eighth grade for an English assignment,and now nearly 20 something years later it is still powerful. The movie is beautifully filmed ,the actors are each perfect for the roles and the costumes are gorgeaus. The spirit of the film ,of youthful passion is felt and the two lead actors-Leonard Whitting and Olivia Hussey portray that effortlessly. Even though the film is 37 years old today it still grabs your attention and leaves you rapt in emotion - exhilaration, adoration, passion ,sadness, disbelief, and finally regretful grief. The director has made a classic that transcends time because he makes us see what the characters feel."
1,"This has been my favorite movie since it came out in 1968! This is a movie with virtually no flaws -- the casting is superb, the story is, of course, classic, and the settings are beautifully rustic. Even the music is perfect."
1,Romeo and Juliet This product was delivered in great condition. I have had no problems with the disk itself at all. Great movie.
1,A real winner Watched this while a senior in high school. One of my all time favorites. Can't say enough things about customes and acting in this one. Get it.
1,"Have always loved this movie This movie never disappoints. It is classic, well done and the music is great.Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey are Romeo and Juliet."
1,"THE BEST VISUAL INTERPRETATION OF ROMEO AND JULIET SHAKESPEARE, WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD THAT THIS MASTERPIECE WAS VISUALLY SCULPTED WITH THE AUTHENTIC DIGNITY AND PURE INNOCENCE AND BEAUTY, THAT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT COULD NOT COMPETE WITH SHAKESPEARE'S GENIUS VERBALITY."
1,"Romeo and Juliet (the good one) This is a masterful work of art. Franco Zeffirelli did a breathtaking job of interpreting the play just how Shakespeare would have wanted it. Olivia Hussy makes a breathtaking Juliet, and the chemistry between the two young lovers was portrayed beautifully. All in all it is a wonderfull veiwing experience and I highly recomend it."
1,"Romantic and fantasticly portrayed. It impacted me like no other version of this fabulous piece by the great Sheakespeare. Fantastic; it made me laugh, cry and kept me glued to my seat the whole time. The acting was great quality- I recommend it for study or even if you are just looking for entertainment. Much better than the Leonardo DiCaprio version."
1,"Gorgeous My assessment of Olivia Hussey's acting fluctuates every time I see this but, if nothing else, the fact that she can draw your attention away from the visual magnificence of this film must say something. It's the most lively of Shakespeare movies, in part because the language is beautiful, as is the scenery, the cast (who wouldn't fall for Leonard Whiting?), the costumes, and the music. It was rightly popular."
1,Romeo & Juliet DVD I have loved this movie since I first viewed it in the theater in the 60's. It's my favorite version and the actual DVD is perfect in every way.
1,"The Best Movie Version of Romeo and Juliet Yet Romeo and Juliet has been remade over and over on film, but this version with Olivia Hussey as Juliet is the one that embodies the play as classically as possible. The sets appear authentic, filmed in Europe, and the actors close to the age and description as the play. Olivia Hussey as Juliet is lovely and sweet, just as we imagine Juliet to be."
1,"Brilliant, timeless, the reference! This is the definitive Romeo & Juliet! It's so brilliantly made. Absolutely stunning. It's so bitter sweet. Olivia Hussey is perfect and Leonard Whiting equals her in this timeless story. One of those extremely rare films that can bring me to tears..."

1,Great product This is a great briefcase that looks very well made. We have tried many different types of briefcases throughout the years but hope this one last until retirement.... his first case was a Samsonite and hopefully his last one before retirement!
1,"Changed my life I won't bother to repeat the rave reviews, but suffice it to say that this book led me to read others including ""Your Money or Your Life"" and ""Natural Capitalism"". Additionally, I have decided to leave my cushy job in the auto industry to go back to school to study more sustainable and sane means of transportation. I ask many people close to me to take a look at this book; if nothing else, I hope it opens their eyes and makes them more aware of their everyday actions."
1,"American Booksellers Association rates Herb tops. Each year the ABA (The American Booksellers Association, which is a respected group of independent booksellers) picks out what they feel are the best books of the season and prints the list in their weekly publication, ""Bookselling This Week."" Cooking With Herb, The Vegetarian Dragon - A Cookbook For Kids (we're pleased to announce,) was right near the top of their list of the best picture books for children. As the publisher (Barefoot Books) we're very proud of that."
1,Great Book! I appreciated the hands on positive examples this book offered. It gave me new hope in becoming friends with my teens and raising them with a positive attitude.
1,Love this movie! I love that I can find the older movies here at Amazon. I have bought several from different sellers and all have been great! I just love Spenser Tracy and this old b&w is one of my FAV's
1,FATHER OF THE BRIDE THIS IS THE ORIGINAL VERSION. VERY GOOD. ALL THE SITUATIONS THAT GEORGE BROOKS FACES ARE RELATABLE TO EVERY FATHER WHO HAS A DAUGHTRE GETTING MARRIED.
1,"That's Joan Bennett, not Katharine Hepburn. FATHER OF THE BRIDE is not a Tracy-Hepburn film. That is Spencer Tracy, giving another peerless performance in the title role. But that's Joan Bennett, perfectly cast as his wife, making a brilliant transition here to mother roles from the femme fatales she played in classic Fritz Lang film noir films of the forties. The bride, of course, is lovely Elizabeth Taylor. They're all first rate in this top notch Vincente Minnelli comedy."
1,THIS IS THE BEST MADONNA VIDEO!!1 THE STORY IS WELL-WRITTEN. ABBY(MADONNA) IS A YOGA TEACHER AND ROBERT(RUPERT EVERETT)IS A LANDSCAPER AND IS GAY.

1,"engaging I purchased this book as part of my homeschool health curriculum, but I found that I didn't even have to assign chapters out of it. The kids would just pick it up and read it at will. The writing style is engaging for teens, the subject matter relevant, the theme positive. The kids themselves started initiating changes in their food choices after reading it."
1,"Wonderful perspective shift! After reading the Ophelia books and the studies on the many and varied problems teenage girls face, this was a wonderful and refreshing perspective. Teenage girls who are self-confidant, not worried about pleasing others with who they are, eloquent, etc. How encouraging! I'm looking forward to reaping some of these benefits of homeschooling..."
1,Case of the Missing Secretary Loved the book but then I love everything written by Diana Palmer!! Bought over 70 books for my Kindle in the last 3 months.
1,"Tingling Shampoo My grandpa (87) was looking for some shampoo that would help with his dandruff, and he had noticed that at the barber shop they washed his hair with something that was tingly.I immediately recognized that it was tea tree and bought him a year's supply of shampoo. He loves it and says that it fixes his dandruff issue."
1,"Insightful and Encouraging! Spiritual Gifts is the first book I have read that deals specifically and exclusively with the many gifts of the Holy Spirit. Although I have been a Christian for many years, I never sat under extensive teaching on the Gifts of the Spirit. Mr. Carraway's book not only describes spiritual gifts in detail but it also explains the importance of determining what one's own gifts are. You turn the last page feeling not like you have just snacked on a superficial read but that you have really eaten a full spiritual meal.After reading the book and working through the questions at the end, I believe I have a better understanding of the gifts God has given me and how I can use them. Moreover, the book encouraged me to dig even more deeply into God's specific purpose for the gifts He has given me through His Holy Spirit.This is definitely a book that is well worth reading!"
1,"Musical Perfection To hear someone describe their music, it just sounds unappealing. But that's where it ends. Their blend of music, with acoustic instruments, and that WONDERFUL violin. It's musical perfection. The lyrics are powerful. And the instruments blend perfectly. It's amazing. Give it a listen! The Mirror, Teen, and Miss You are by far my three favorites."
1,"This tape really works for me. I'm really out of shape, though was very athletic in my youth (I'm now 57 years old). As a recent birthday gift to myself, I bought 6 fitness videotapes from Amazon, and this was the second I put on. And now that I met it, I'm not even going to bother to try the others until I'm really tired of this one. Kathy Smith is wonderful -- intelligent but not schoolmarmy (as the first tape was)and challenging but not out of reach. Kathy runs you through the beginner level and then proceeds to advanced level, but encourages the beginners to carry on at their level until they're (we're) ready to move on. I don't like getting interrupted every 20 minutes for a health lecture, but I just fast forward to the next segment. I like doing two 20-minute workouts (cardio and weights+bones), which just fits my schedule. I'm writing this to encourage myself to stick with it, but if anyone can keep me conscientious, it's this excellent tape. I strongly recommend it."
1,"Best version yet. It is true that you miss some of the more humorous moments and side character development scenes, but the sound and visual quality can't be beat and you can get through the main story line much faster this way (around 100 episodes total) compared to the original version (291 episodes)."
1,"To europeans customers, that its allsome!! I dont know if every FUNIMATION Bluray have A/B Region but that is the coolest thing that FUNIMATION have ever make, because in Spain we dont have this anime series relesed on dvd or Bluray (we have dubbed for TV, but not more).Thanks for everything!"
1,"WE'RE IN LOVE NOW! Kai is simply amazing. It's a revered and respectful follow-up that the original DragonBall deserved. The audio and animation are spot on in here. No edits that I can detect. The only downside that I can think of is that there isn't an option to view the episodes in a Marathon mode or watch them with the TV Version opening instead of the DVD exclusive opening. Sorry, but I prefer the TV version over this one. But please, don't stop-don't stop WE'RE IN LOVE NOW!"
1,"Critics, Schmitics....The movie is good As one who never pays attention to what the critics have to say about the movies (I mean they're critics, come on, all they do is criticize). If everyone listened to them, the movie industry would be non-existent. I mean hey, Ebert co-wrote Beyond the Valley of the Dolls..........need I say more, but, back to the subject at hand. The Mummy Returns is a great popcorn movie. Enjoy it for the great ride and then make up your own mind if it was worth the purchase. Personally, I think you'll be glad to add this to your collection."
1,"The Mummy Returns. Great Movie Cast and Crew were great! Especially Brendan Frasier good guy I met him once. I heard the news a Mummy 3 is in the mix. No not The Scorpion King (April 2002),but a 3 Mummy sequel to Mummy Returns. Brendan Fraser will be in it. Any other cast I don't know I at least look forward to a 2003 Mummy 3. ..."
1,This is a Pretty Good Movie Mummy returns is a pretty good movie but there are a few things Iwould change. Number one I didn't care for the way that they made Seti the First into a total bastard. Number 2 the ending was a little depressing. I think Imhotep and Ancksunamun should been able to have a happy ever after too. Also they should have made sure thatthe Princess was called by the same name through out the movie.On the up side using the ancient language of KMT (Ancient Egypt) was a wonderful touch. I also enjoyed the Ancient Egypt scenes. They did a good job bringing Ancient Egypt to life again.On a scale one to 10 I would rate this movie a eight and half.
1,Better than the first The special effects were better than the first. There were far more action scenes. The storyline was more in depth. The Scorpion King was a great villain. This was just a better all around movie than the first.
1,"what a toptastic movie For all of you people who have not seen this movie then shame on you.This is possibly the best movie of the last 10 years (yes i know i have just angered all you star wars fans but please let me finish).The original left you thinking that there would be a sequel and they did'nt dissapoint us with this.The cast were very good because they never changed any of the original characters and it went along on a variable joyride of thrills and spills.This movie has something for everyone and is no doubt the platform for bigger things for world wrestling federation star The Rock who was only in there a short while and was very good at hamming up his role as the scorpion king.All in all a great film with laughs,scares.thrills and spills a definate classic.Ronnie Birmingham England."
1,"The Mummy Returns and beats the first Loved this movie. Usually sequels are not as good as the first show, but this is an exception. I enjoyed it as much, if not more than The Mummy. You learn more about the characters' history in this show and their characters are fleshed out. The story itself is as good as the first, with new evils and characters to keep you on the edge of your seat at times, and the mix of suspense and humor is there. There are no dull spots it the movie. It keeps your attention from beginning to end. The bad guys are marvelously wicked. It's worth the price, you will watch it more than once and each time you watch it you'll notice something you missed the last time you watched it."
1,"Are you kidding? This movie was great! I loved this film - the action, the effects, the cast and crew - everything was marvelous! And the pace was perfect - exactly what you expect from an action film. It was fast and furious, but it made me want to come back for more! And I guarantee you, I won't be the only one lined up in October to buy this DVD. It's a real treat!"
1,"My Mummy Review I thought that this was a great movie because it had a lot of action and i just really really liked it.(Brendan Fraser is hot and my mom thinks that Arnold Vosloo is handsom.) When it first came out in theaters i wanted to see it but i didnt see the first one so me and my friend rented it and really liked it so maybe a week later i went and saw it thought it was awesome and at the theaters i saw it nine times. I bought the first one and i watch it over and over again. I cant wait untill October second, my dad even said that he would watch the Mummy and right after that the Mummy Returns. The thing thats bad though is its on a Tuesday so I'll probably have homework, and then four hours of movies. So for everyone that hasn't seen this movie I think you should its a very good movie and the kids would like it too, but there is violence and swearing depends how young they are the might be scared. So i say go and see it. They are my two favorite movies."
1,Enter The Scorpion King The Mummy Returns is an awesome movie. and it brings the start to The Scorpion King. this is an awesome Movie. I Recommend This Movie For Everyone. If you liked this movie check out the other two Mummy MoviesThe MummyThe Mummy 3: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor
1,"Finally the Mummy has come back to Video. Awesome movie, but was I the only one who wanted that little kid to die? Really it was all his fault, the Kid should of had his head cut off by the Scorpion Kings Pincers or one of the Anubis Army Guys, and What's with Imenhotep? In Love, get the hell outta here, I wanted to see him lay a little smack on the Rock but that never happened, they made the Mummy in the Wussy, but the movie still rocked. BUY THIS MOVIE, it's worth the money, and it's alot better than ""Ernest goes to School""."
1,"Not An Oscar Winner, but a Great Action Movie If you are expecting great serious action then this movie isn't for you, but if you are like me an enjoy action movies this is one of them. While a typical script this movie offers non-stop action, it kind of reminds me of the Indiana Jones series. It kind of brings back the kid in me. A terrific film, I personally would recommend it."
1,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid! This is way better then the first! It is so awesome Brendan Fraser did even better in this one than he did in the first. It is fun action packed amazing adventure movie! THis is one of the best movies Ive ever seen!
1,"Loved the first and this one!! I like The Mummy and I really loved The Mummy Returns. These reviews that talk about no character development, story development, blah blah blah, the movie is suppose to be entertaining and it delivers that hands down. All of the original cast returned and you could see the chemistry between them which was great. Brendan and Rachel were great so was Jonathan and bringing back Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay for the sequel and giving him a bigger role was pure genius. He is fabulous, incredible not to mention gorgeous. And Brendan Fraser is as adorable as ever. The movie kept me hooked from start to finish and was pure fun."
1,"PURE, NON-STOP ENTERTAINMENT! Now this is what I call a movie! Not one of these boring, no FX movies! It's pure action/adventure from beginning to end. The story is a lot better than the first Mummy, and so is everything. The story is a continuation of the first story. Archeologists Rick and Evie have found an ancient bracelet which the reincarnated Mummy wants to use to take over the world. Sure, the dialogue is thin, the effects are cheesy, and a two-year-old could have thought of this plot, but who cares? It's entertainment, pure non-stop action adventure entertainment, and that's what it's all about."
1,Great Special Effects Great photography and outstanding special effects. A move to see over and over just to enjoy the visual presentation.
1,"Yes! It's even better this time around. Less gore, more fun. Of course it's campy--it's supposed to be. But aside from the not-quite-there later version of the Scorpion King, this movie's a romp from start to finish. Most of the main folk are back and there's ""you know...mummies...pygmies...big...bugs."" Give me this over any of those stupid dumb-joke popular flicks any day. Amusing, worthwhile characters and plenty of action. And thanks, Mr. Sommers, for bringing Ardeth Bey back. He's got too much talent to waste."
1,"It's perfect and great... This movie was perfect and great. This movie was special because the sport wrestling star playing in, that was good. I was exciting and I like it. This movie was making up well. This movie CGI was great. This movie so cool, everyone enjoyed this movie. My favorite movie."
1,"Rare Sequel that surpasses the original. This Film And Shriek were the ONLY Great films we had this summer, and were the only films in general that delivered what it promise. The Mummy Returns is a super charge spectacular that surpasses the original In every way. The acting is top notch, and the girls are beautiful (Rachel Weisz is HOT). The Special Effects are top notch, and the action is amazing. It's probably one of the best sequels ever made, and it's definitely one DVD to own. Get it and prepare to be blown away by it."
1,Finally a tea kettle that works!!! I love my new tea kettle. I have had several and been dis-satisfied with the way the whistle is much too weak. I need one that sounds the ALARM! This one is terrific. I highly recommend it!
1,"A little hard to fill It is a little hard to fill, other than that, it's a great, solidly built kettle. The pick me up feature works great. Keeps you from having to get close to the steam and burn your fingers. We fill ours from a water filter, which may make it more difficult, so I'm still giving it 5 stars. If you fill from a kitchen, it would probably be just fine."
1,"Oxo Good Grips Tea Kettle It's excellent, and much lighter than other models. It works just as well, but there's no strain lifting the full kettle."
1,"Good action movie Its really a collectors edition. All the 1st part of the movie series are the best, like wise.........."
1,Mission Impossible This movie stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt who's Covert Team have all been assassinated..And everyone thinks he's done it..So he's on the run and trying to find the real killer..This movie has great special effects and gadgets that u would only dream of..
1,"Mission Impossible I is back with a vengence! This DVD is really great. That's just about all there is too it. You can choose to watch the widescreen or standard versions of the movie, and both show up beautifully. There's not much more to say. Sound is awesome, video quality is awesome - and the Mission is Impossible! Get this DVD if you liked the VHS version, or if you wanna try it, or if - if ANYTHING!!"
1,"Great Movie Because the movie didn't feel like the show is irrelevant. In case some have forgotten, we're in the 1990's. I will admit that I had to watch it twice to get the story right, but that doesn't take away from the movie's intrigue. I bet most people who watched this movie never saw the show. Good. Mission Impossible 2 is in the works and I can't wait."
1,"Simple Plot, What's The Problem? I've heard from so many people that the main problem with ""Mission Impossible"" is its plot, that it's ""impossible"" to inderstand, when in fact it is very easy to understand. In short, Tom Cruise is trying to clear his name by finding the real traitor of the team. Redgrave knows who that person is and promises to tell Cruise, but in return, he must get her the noc file, that's what that whole ""acrobat"" seen is about. They plan to meet on the train, and the rest is history. Okay now?"
1,Just as Expected! We received Mission Impossible Blu-ray edition in a timely manner and in perfect condition. Was new and had never been used and works like a charm. No complaints.
1,"High-tech High-spy High-good This is a high-tech spy movie that is very good. Cruise puts in one of his best performances and the other actors perform excellently. There is enough variety to keep some suspense going. There is certainly enough action, without having to resort to blow up everything in sight (like some other ""summer"" blockbusters). The transfer to DVD is excellent and the other sound and editing are very good."
1,"necesssary read Every citizen of the United States would benefit from reading this book. If only our politicians would read it as well. Clear, concise, well argued, Sowells book is an excellent, informative and thoughtfull read."
1,"How not to be fooled by the politicians Great book written for non-economics students to understand the long term effects of popular issues. The chapter on housing costs simply but brilliantly explains the folly of rent control, zoning control, hi-rise prevention, etc. and how they hurt the common person.Great read if you don't want to remain in the fog of the political vote buyers."
1,All you need to know to live in Mexico I spent three months living and working in Mexico and this was a great guide to get settled in with a lot of relevant information! A great read!
1,"The Best Having read a variety of handbooks for travel in Mexico, this book is by far the best. This book is about Mexico, not Mexican hotels, and equips the reader to move respectfully through Mexico viewing events there with a fond but clear eye."
1,"nice my husband is going to love it ... great presentation - fast shippment - just nice ... ,,,, ,,, ,,,"
1,"I loved this book, it was exactly what I was looking for! This is the best career resource I have ever read. It was packed with detailed information and resources about medical transcription, setting up a business, taxes, education - you name it. I found it all in this book. The authors tell it like it is and are clearly are keeping abreast of the industry trends and they live and breathe their topic. I highly recommend this book to potential MTs, MT students, and seasoned MTs. There is something to learn for everyone here! Thank you for this outstanding resource! KM, South Lake Tahoe."
1,"SOS: A Girl's Guide Sex, Optimism, Surviving 21st Century Clever, funny, witty and full of contemporary wisdom, this book is a must for women of all ages. From how to change a tyre to how to change a man, this is the ultimate how-to for modern living. Give it to your best friend as well as your grandmother. An enjoyable read."
1,Much better than the modem from the DSL provider! I had a Westell modem which liked to simply disconnect from the internet whenever it felt like it. The download transfer rate averaged around 40k and I was told this was as fast as I could possibly obtain due to my address being along the fringes of the DSL coverage area.After getting fed up with the Westell I purchased this modem and my download transfer rate now averages in the 300k range and jumps over 1MB quite often. I know a lot has to do with server location but nothing else changed but the modem. My browsing habits have been the usual for the past week.Installation was very easy. Very. It performs exactly as I expected and the price wasn't bad either.
1,Really good Product This product is just how they said it is.I really like how it fits and it is not very heavy.I recomend it.
1,"Good ole Rocker and soft in places Back To The Egg is Back To The Roots!, March 4, 2001I rate ""Back To The Egg"" as one of McCartney & Wings best (in my opinion). I rate it with ""Ram"", ""Wildlife"" & McCartney. It's production is raw and gives it a live take feel. If you like some good ole rock, this is a good'n! ..."
1,Great CD I left this review before but here it is again. This CD is more from the Great Sir Paul. Arrived on time.
1,"Those were the days.... As a 16-year-old Beatles fan, I bought this album the week it appeared in stores. It's kind of dated now, but I'll never forget imposing it on my girlfriend on a trip to Six Flags; it sure beat the Bee Gees, her favorite _du jour_! It would do until the Beatles reunion I was sure was around the corner. Nice tunes, nice guitar, great voice, cool artwork, nice concept -- I'm probably stretching, but I give it a five."
1,"Back to the Egg I received fast, courteous service from the seller, and the product was just as it was advertised. Thanks for making my Christmas shopping easier!!"
1,"A Very Infectuous Record Well, when I first heard this album, I was ecstatic to see Paul still had a hard rock edge after all the interim between the Beatles (i.e. Birthday). This double-album hearkens back to the old notions of hard rock and fuses them with the then-modern licks that Zeppelin and Alice Cooper had set into motion. Much heavier than most of Macca's material, each song on this album GROOVES, at least up until After The Ball (incidentally, an odd but pleasant ballad).A lot of reviewers (not for this album per se, but on reviews for other Wings albums) like to talk smack on Back To The Egg. they say, for instance, that its hard rock efforts fall flat on its face. and I say that's cobbleswattle! this album vyes for the top of the Wings catalogue, and is very nearly their most satisfying musical experience.Its good, if you haven't heard it, but it now!!!"
1,"Good book, lots of pics. I really enjoyed reading this history on Saab cars. There are plenty of pictures and the chapters are well organized."
1,"A Classic Piece of Nostalgia As an underprivileged child (who didn't know it), I had been blessed to have been exposed to this book at the neighborhood Head Start. Although I could not read or remember the title, the images, characters and plot stayed with me well into adult hood. As I was randomly scrolling for dolls for my daughter on Amazon.com, this book came up, and I just had to purchase it for her. She fell in love with the book, and asks me to read it to her every night. I do not blame her; I'm sure she finds this piece of literature as alluring and fascinating as I did. The black and white photography is genius and memorable, adding awe to this timeless childhood read."
1,"Lovely Book (forget what the PC say) This is a lovely book as are all of Dare Wright's. Forget what the one-star PC-types say, children understand more than you think and all you have to do is explain to them that spanking is ""something we don't do anymore and this was written a long time ago (1957)."" If they cannot read, just skip that part of the text. Fairy Tales contain more weirdo stuff. You cannot shelter children from literature or what the real world is like forever. They will only rebel and find it anyway, even small ones. I raised three well adjusted daughters so I'm not just speaking out of school."
1,"I loved this book when I was a kid!! What I remember about all of Dare Wright's books was that reading them made me happy. The Lonely Doll did all the bad stuff I wanted to do but never did, like writing bad things all over the bathroom mirror with lipstick. Even as a five-year-old, I related very strongly to the story of The Lonely Doll, and recall finding some strange comfort in the images, which are all high-quality black-and-white photographs.However, I can't say if the images in this book are developmentally appropriate for pre-K or K-3 readers, nor am I certain whether I would read it with my own children. For those of you who don't know the specifics, the Lonely Doll named Edith misbehaves, and she gets her butt spanked by the authoritative Mr. Bear. He then promises her that he will never, ever leave her. It may not be the kind of message we want to share with our little girls. 'He hits me but then he says he loves me, and he promises that he'll never leave me'."
1,"A Fabulous Book! I had vaguely remembered these from childhood, when my little girl and I stumbled upon it at the library. To those of you who see this as absuive and sending a negative message--please consider: A) It was written when spanking children was considered perfectly acceptable (and no, I don't condone that, my daughter has NEVER been spanked) and B)my kid found the spanking thing quite amusing and smacked the picture of Mr. Bear to punish him back. In other words: It's a pretty book, with lovely photographs and THAT's what the children enjoy.Oh, yeah, my daughter ADORES the books and her Edith doll that goes with."
1,"After 30 years, this is one book that still makes me smile! When our first granddaughter was born 4 years ago, I started to look for a copy of The Lonely Doll for her, just as I had read it to her mother. I have searched old bookstores and tried to find a copy, and am just delighted that it has been republished. It is a thoughtful, quiet, lovely book and I enjoyed reading it to them as much as the little ones enjoyed hearing it!"
1,"Silly Old Things This book is a sort of time capsule of childhood in the 50s-60s. We were spanked. Would you ban Oliver Twist? Or Harry Potter? Or ""protect"" your children from all realities of life?Edith is a doll. But she is an adventurous, creative and ultimately honest character. She expresses herself. As in most families of the day, there wasn't a lot of explanation for anything. Things just were. This was long before psychotherapy was en vogue or children had rights. And yet it still speaks truly to children of today. At least to children young enough to know better. Many parents don't seem to get it."
1,"History Repeats Itself Nightly, my little one wants me to tell her a bedtime story, so as we lay in bed together I try to come up with a sweet little story that will soothe her to sleep. Last night, I couldn't come up with one of my own, when suddenly I remembered The Lonely Doll. I retold the story as I remembered it fondly, and when I was finished she said, ""Mommy, you tell the best stories."" And she soon fell asleep. It was a childhood favorite of mine, and is now a favorite of my daughter's. I couldn't wait to order it for her. Thank You Dare Wright!"
1,"The best book of the genre Time travel is one of my favorite sci-fi themes, and I've read dozens of books on the topic. Most sci-fi books are like James P. Hogan's hard sci-fi books, full of technology and long discussions between physicists. While There Will Be Time has some tech and some science dialogue, it's really a story about some very human themes like good vs evil, finding your purpose in life, and what obligations the strong have to care for the weak.I read this first as a teenager, and thought about it for years. I found a used copy in my thirties that I've re-read several times, and I'm starting to wear that one out. This is one of those rare books that I know I'll read over and over until my eyes give out."
1,"Shelly Laurenston books ABSOLUTELY LOVED (HERE KITTY, KITTY, PACK CHALLENGE AND GO FETCH) THIS TRIO AND ALL THE REST OF HER SHIFTER SERIES BOOKS. THE AUTHOR HAS AN AWESOME SENSE OF HUMOR THAT CONSTANTLY IS MAKING ME LAUGH, PLUS THE CHARACTERS ARE SO LOVEABLE. THEY ROCK CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE JUST LIKE THEM."
1,Inspector Morse is a very special detective Typically wonderful Colin Dexter story. Complex plot line with a minimal number of red herrings. Well worth the read and investment of time.
1,"Cute - I used them to decorate a cake. I used these to decorate my boyfriend's birthday cake. I have to admit, they were a bigger hit than my cake! lol!"
1,Michael Mann is a genius. 'The Insider' is certainly one of the best films of 1999. There is not another director working today who can match Michael Mann's eye for detail. Example: Little Debbie wrappers only used in Louiville. He rules.
1,"Woah i could hardly believe how excellent this film was when I saw it. I already knew the story that it's based on, and although some things were slightly changed, its for the better.Old Al does a fine job here, hes not the typical yelling loud character he usually is and carries the role perfectly. Russel Crowe's face is also 100% neccisary in the movie.Michael Mann's direction is also pure genious. Every scene is done perfectly.You won't be dissapointed."
1,Fantastic The Insider is a first rate movie with great performances from Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. The movie is about the man who blew the whistle on the Tobacco industry. It makes for a gripping tale in which justice prevails. It most definitely features as one of my personal favorites. I generaly only dont't watch movies a second time but this one has had repeated viewings.
1,Powerful A gripping film depicting the terrible cost paid by those who dare to expose the underhanded tactics perpetrated by the tobacco industry. Pacino and Crowe are excellent in the leading roles. This is one of Pacino's best performances. A film well-worth seeing.
1,"An excellent movie! The Insider is a powerful look into the tobacco indestry, and how they lied about the nicitene. Both Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are fantastic in the film. This movie is for anyone who enjoys a deep look into a very contraversal subject."
1,Russell Crowe steals this show! Can you imagine a scientist standing up against the tobacco industry? Can you imagine this scientist recorded a segment on 60 minutes and that 60 minutes refused to air the program because of political pressure? This really happened. Russell Crowe is fascinating in this study of a man caught between morality and saving him self and his family from psychological torture. Al Pacino plays the producer who ultimately gets the scientists testimony heard after going to the New York Times with the story. This is a story that every one can relate to. It is gripping. Crowe should have won an academy award for his performance.
1,"Saved My Life Dear reader, I was a 5 packs a day man when the insider moved my insides and thus forced a desion from within my soul barren to quit this awful fart inhalation. Well I didn't quit but I changed from a Brown and Williamson product to a Philip Morris product and I now smoke the great Marlboro Reds(recommend by me).But in our hazen discovery of the truth lest us not neglect our shakeperian duty to rise and fall like an empire of sand, liquid sand. dissolving me and you and the constipation and lts us have our deeply desired laxative, yes dear reader, a laxative is what THE INSIDER reminded me of and it is the best laxative of 1999. But crowe has acne, but I dug venora you know."
1,"You Have To See It More Than Once... ...to know what the movie is really about, and even then I'm not sure I caught everything. There were some great movies released in 1999, but as far as what movie had the most balls, for me it's a toss-up between Michael Mann's meticulously crafted ""The Insider"" and ""South Park"". Personally, I see this movie as an indictment of all corporations, be it Big Tobacco or the CBS Television Network. It's up to strong-minded individuals like the Al Pacino character to keep these bastards in check."
1,"The ""Bible"" for all Quilter's This is definately the best best best quilting book I have ever invested in. If you're looking for the history and outline of a quilting block, this detailed and incredible book will almost certainly have it. Set out in a logical manner, this book is a must-have for anybody interested in tracking the origins and names of antique and vintage patterns as well as newer creations. AAA+++"
1,"Winged Pirate Ships and The Art of Far Seeing!!! Not really an audiobook, this full fledged RADIO PLAY brings to life an amazing cast of characters. Complete with talanted voice actors and a producer who truly understands the art of telling a story through sound, this is a grand adventure of the mind. Imagine huge sky galleons doing mid air battle with cargo holds of winged sheep. Have a bad day at Dragon's Breath along with Little Frieda, she of the piggy tales and huge Havana cigars. Learn the Art of Far Seeing from that old caretaker, Far Seeing Art. Bargin with the Lords of Death along side the Marquis of Carumbas. Or just nestle back into a Overstuffed Green Velvet chair and just let your mind take off. I could not recomend this enough!"
1,"BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO HOLLYWOOD Only Wenders could have done it: shoot a film in Hollywood that is 100% non-Hollywood. And that is the best part of it! Even Mel Gibson plays a different role, perhaps one of his best - not a super hero, but someone with a human face, a human story. The music is fantastic, the story is well told. Hate to discuss the events, in case you still have not seen the film. If you are looking for something different than the usual senseless blockbuster evening entertainment with pop corn - see this movie, and you will never forget it..."
1,Norelco HP2843 Satinelle Epilator It's the best epilator I've ever tried.The result really lasts about 3 weeks
1,"I can't believe I waited this long to try an epilator! This product is awesome. It is definitely more painful than shaving at first, however, after a week of using this product, I can go several days without epilating, and I used to have to shave my legs everyday to keep the stubble at bay. It is a little time consuming until you've completely transitioned, but it's worth it. And I'm going to save a ton of $$ on shaving cream and I feel really good about not having to discard the metal cans they come in!"
1,"An amazing CD I first heard mention of the Thickets on an Internet newsgroup. I thought it was a joke. Who the hell would make a rock band that pays ribute to HP Lovecraft? Napster was still around then so I downloaded some of their songs and was floored. I then promptly bought every CD of theirs I could. They are that good. The Thickets produce these great, clever, catchy pop punk tunes that remind me of the Smithereens in their heyday. The latest CD is the best one yet. Its polished, tight, and addictive. A week doesnt go by where I don't play this CD. Buy it. Its that good."
1,"hillarious I'm so glad that fluffy has his own show, i did not know that he had his own show i thought that this was another special. even though fluffy did not do many jokes his friends were funny. i do hope that he gets another season. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"
1,"Hilarious! Gabriel is hilarious and his friends is a lot of fun! The only bad side of buying this movie is that I live in Norway, and then it doesnt work on our dvd players without installing something."
1,"Fantastic Holiday Music First of all, I absolutely love Christmas music. It's one of the things that I look forward to when the holidays roll around. It's also a time when I go searching for new music to listen to.I came across this jazz CD when I was browsing through the Jazz MP3 section. It's fantastic!! I absolutely love it. There are some upbeat songs and some really mellow songs. It's exactly what I had hoped a Christmas jazz CD would sound like.I was going to rate a couple of the artists, but there's really no need. The songs flow very well unto each other.I would definitely recommend this to all you Christmas song loving people out there. Even if you just need some background music for your holiday parties, this is the perfect fit."
1,"Fantastic Perfect Christmas Jazz album! As the other reviewer said, a good mix of upbeat and slower tunes. They all flow very well with each other."
1,One of few pass-through cables! Was looking for an ipod power cable that would let me also plug in a microphone. This is one of the few that I could find. As a bonus it's a general purpose USB charger for your car!
1,"Awesome This game is awesome, i only paid 15$ and the game was in perfect condition. i think it came in like 4 days. 5/5 overall"
1,Fast and Fun! I love this game! It is fast and has lots of action. Love how you have to run down the cars to gain them into your garage!
1,"One of the great novels of the Roaring Twenties. This is the classic story of an artist who devotes himself to his art and dies young -- only the artist is one Rick Martin, one of the best trumpet players ever, and the art is jazz music. Reading this book -- though the prose is so lyrical, you don't read it, you hear it -- you will find yourself in a world of speakeasies, big bands, and the Harlem Renaissance; but the story is universal, and Rick Martin a tragic hero on par with Jay Gatsby. Highly recommended, especially to fans of jazz music and anyone who wants to know how the ""Jazz Age"" got its name"
1,"Tripnotic Trance...Blue Foundation ""Sweep of Days"" my FAV so far! Blue Foundation is a new band for me, I discovered them from Twilight movie soundtrack..their first song I heard ""Eyes on Fire"" captured my attention right away! I then started listening to other songs, downloading 99 cent songs here and there through Amazon..but this album..I bought in entirety! All the songs are GOOD...I love their style."
1,"ummmm...wow i'm always skeptacle on mordern movies and to be honest if it wern't for the numder of films awards this movie won i never would've bothered i'm glad i did. necrophilia, multiple murders, bizarre story, disturbing piece of work. if your gonna make a film like this you don't need a budget-its art for christs sake. worth owning"
1,"lndnurse I saw this movie on a flight to Hong Kong, and enjoyed it so much, I bought it upon my return home. Anyone who enjoys a ""chick-flick"" will love this one! The DVD has so many great extras, and the music is terrific. Everyone...go out and buy this movie! You won't regret it!"
1,Love this kind of movies! I have just seen this movie and I think it's wonderful. From beginning to end it's sweet and touching. It's the perfect movie for everyone who likes intelligent comedy with a lot of heart. All three main Actors are great. EDWARD NORTON forever!
1,"Sweet! This is a beautiful, sensitive film that addresses issues both spritual and secular, and it manages to do it all with amazing humor! It's a movie you'll want to watch again and again and share with friends and family."
1,"not a collection of dated priest and rabbi jokes one of the best ""date"" movies in recent years. elfman is good in her role as corporate superstar. stiller is very credible as the rabbi juggling religion and issues of dating and marriage within the faith.edward norton really hits it out of the park portraying the priest who loses his heart but not his vocation to elfman. the characters have believable personalities that mesh well, and the fine touch of norton's directorial debut is obvious.this is one movie you will enjoy seeing several times, we certainly did."
1,"Great Coverage I love this foundation. It covers & evens out my complexion SO well. Naturally, the price on Amazon is a HUGE bargain!!!"
1,"Where are the goods? Best line in the movie, if you have seen it, you should know what im talking about. Best dubbed voice evar."
1,"A MUST HAVE This was a really good old movie!! I have never seen this before and I have hundreds and hundreds of mivies, so this one caught my eye and I'm very happy with it! get this movie!"
1,"Excellent CD!!! Excellent CD!!!, The disc quality is excellent and the cover of the album is good. Excellent product I was looking"
1,"Really good Wow...I have to tell you that as much as this was compared to other recent cocaine movies, like Traffic, this movie reminds me of nothing less than Goodfellas. The characters are very much brothers from different mothers. Very good comparison. And to anyone who has entertained notions about Penelope Cruz' sexiness, you may be in for a rude surprise.Having said that, since Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz are dating, well, doesn't it take a special kind of ego for someone to date someone else because their last names are pronounced the same?"
1,"Lesson learned ""Blow"" desplicts the reality of the consequences suffered from selling drugs. Its unique theme was brilliantly written. The years passing by was perfected by the costume designers and hair stylists. Johnny Depp was the perfect actor to play the lead character in his Oscar worthy role. All other actors perfectly portray their characters wonderfully: a loving father, a hateful mother, a betraying friend, a cancer patient, and many druggies.Those who want to know the consequences desplicted must watch ""Blow"". Giving away all of them would ruin the movie effect for first time viewers. In the end, one will not be disappointed."
1,"Love this movie Who doesn't like a ""based on a true story"" movie? George Jung played by Johnny Depp is a fascinating person and lead an interesting life! And he'll be released in 2014/2015.... go George!"
1,"Love this movie I love this movie. It's always a good one. Every time I watch it I'm like, I need to watch this more often."
1,Blow is Great This movie will keep you entertained from start to finish. Johnny Depp is mezmerizing and the rest of the cast is awesome
1,"Superb filmmaking! Very real in its portrayal. This film had a very realistic feel to it, in terms of feeling as if you are actually witnessing the fall of George Jung. The very human side of Jung was portrayed as well, enabling the viewer to decide whether they wanted to really hate him as much as they think they would loathe a typical dope pusher, or to feel some empathy for how far he sunk into his world of coke and pot dealing, at the cost of his relationship with family and his freedom. All in all, an excellent, realistic portrayal of the risky, dark, and depressing world of drug dealing."
1,"Great movie I've watched this film a dozen times before. Great acting, great writing, great imagery. I can never watch the ending though, because it's just too sad for me."
1,no scratches Sent as an Christmas gift for my son. He said it came packaged great --just like new-- no scratches. Is very happy with the DVD. Will purchase from this site again. Gift card was a plus.
1,"Everyone forgot Pablo! Yes, this movie is about the rise and fall of George Jung, however the most important person in the movie... Pablo Escobar is a bit left out by the other reviewers. The movie does a great job with an excellent cast depicting George Jung's marijuana and cocaine empire's rise and fall... it even does a good job talking about Pablo Escobar and the Medellin Cartel's role in helping George Jung. It even brings in Carlos Diego. The movie isn't as good as the book by Bruce Porter but David McKenna did a good job writing a screenplay. Great movie, deffinately worth owning!"
1,"hey!!! this play was excellently written by one of the most famouse playwrights of our time. the story itself is fictional but the events serrounding the story are true, the witch trials of 1692 in salem. Just a warning, to have a better undertanding and appreciation of this play, get a general information about the history of the witch trial of 1692 before reading or before viewing the play/movie."
1,"a classic documentary This is the film that ""Munich"" should have been.It's the story Steven Spielberg should have told.It is a brutal,moving,and brilliant look at one of the most shocking events in history.The most remarkable thing about the movie is how unbiased and even-handed it is.The filmmakers make every effort to present both sides of the story evenly and fairly.They are remarkably nonjudgemental,even showing great sensitivity to the Palestinians as well as the Israelis.""One Day In September"" is amagificent documentary that should be seen."
1,"A Brilliant and Stunning Tour de Force What you must first understand is that this album really isn't a ""Miles Davis"" recording. The musician that is truly the dominant creative force here is John McLaughlin; Miles' role is much like the other musicians on this recording - to my mind, very much secondary to the driving, primal and brilliant work of McLaughlin. McLaughlin creates the context, the foundation, on which this recording is constructed. This is a stunning work in every way, and it's value is due largely to the almost otherworldly brilliance of John McLaughlin."
1,"A Fitting Tribute To A True Heavyweight I have always found this album as my favorite of the ""electric phase"" of Miles Davis. His solos are fabulous and the pieces - though lengthy - do not drift off into a free jazz mode.....they are tight and rock hard.John McLaughlin proves without a shadow of a doubt that he was the baddest guitar player at this time. The five-disk sessions set - a must companion piece - aptly shows McLaughlin on top of his game in jazz, rock and R&B; riffs. And head for the hills when Billy Cobham and Herbie Hancock start grooving.For those looking to start a collection in electric jazz and/or Miles, this is a perfect place to start."
1,"A Tribute to Jack Johnson brings you there. Miles has always been an artistic master of sound and space. A Tribute to Jack Johnson sums up new directions Miles had been migrating towards. These 2 tracks are emotional, creative and powerful. The Album/CD is forever fresh in sound."
1,"Great way to get rock listeners to jazz If you are a rock fan and thinking about jazz, this is a great album for you! This album showcases Miles, he keeps it funky and rocking at hte same time."
1,"Man, it's funky! I was totally blown away when I first heard this. This is Miles at his funkiest, loudest and bluesiest. It sounds like so much fun!Every musician on this album is in top form and the aggressive, raucous soloing is indescribable. It's a great privilege to hear these guys settle into a groove.The cutting and pasting technique involved in making the original long jams more palatable can be a bit annoying at times but I wasn't going to buy the 'Complete Jack Johnson Sessions' when I hadn't heard one note of this album before. That's the only complaint I have with this great piece of work.Overall, it was incredibly enjoyable!"
1,"MILES DAVIS AT HIS ROCKING HOUR I have to say that this CD is a masterpiece. The first song ""Right Off"" is really great, Miles does rock n' roll and jazz (like Miles jazz trumpet and Joe Satriani hard rock) and that is really one of Miles' best recordings ever, and one of my favorite Miles nearing 27 minutes of driving rock and jazz. Yesternow is more like other Miles a lot slower and calmer, but in the middle has a background of the first song of ""In a Silent Way"", in the end there is a voice for Jack Johnson. This is great Miles from the seventies and it is one of his greatest recordings. Every Miles Davis CD or Record collection should have this."
1,"A depressing but shockingly accurate glimpse of society The Stranger was an extremely thought provoking book, and it applies to every society at any time, thus is as powerful today in America as it was in France 50 years ago. Basically the book is about a man in Algiers who is killed by his society for his social abnormalities. He commited murder, but was executed for not crying at his mother's funeral. To me this book was a painful reflection of the mold that societies try to force people into, and the way the society views people who don't fit the mold. I felt this book was extremely powerful because of how it shows the cruelty that society can inflict to people who don't fit in."
1,"I know nothing of existentialism I have never studied (or even once read about) existentialism and I read this book purely for pleasure. Without being in search of existentialist thought, like many frustrated students who gave this book a bad review may have been, I found it to be immensely well-written and simply a perfect little novel. Camus used fantastic sentence composition disguised by Meursault's (or perhaps translator Matthew Ward's) drollery while the simplicity of the events hid the absurdity of the story. I now consider the book a necessity of my own literary knowledge, especially being such a pleasantly quick read."
1,"An Undesputed Classic I read the Stranger (actually i read the translation entitled The Outsider, but it's the same thing) in my grade 11 world literature class. The book revolves around the main character named Meursault. The novel, deep rooted in its existentialist theme, is one of the most mentally stimulating books you will ever read. Albert Camus suggests that the pinnacle of hypocrisy in society is its quickness to judge people upon appearances or behavior, versus its apparent incapacity to judge people upon fact. I will refrain from making any conjectures about the novel, its theme and message, because that is something you must do for yourself. After reading the novel, dont rush to the internet to read essays and reviews about the novel. Instead spend some time contemplating the book yourself. Then open yourself to the opinions of others. It is one of those books that you will never forget, and will change the way you see things, at least temporarly."
1,"Subtle and engaging This book certainly rings as true today as it did when it first came out, as our society produces more and more non-heroes like this, dulled to most everything. An important work of modern literature."
1,Excellent Story Line!! This Book was very interesting and kept my apt attention. At points I could not put this book down. I would recommend this book to many people.
1,Excellent book. I had somehow gotten the idea that Camus' writing would be beyond me. I can happily say that I found this book to be an excellent read. I prefer to get hardcover books over paperbacks. This Everyman Library edition has become A welcome addition to my library.
1,"political slant Camus' character, Meursault, commits a senseless murder and is executed for it. A Camus fantasy? Or would a white man really have been executed for killing an Arab (Moor)in N. Africa during what I presume was the late 1930s? The book first appeared in 1942. Had the setting been the USA during the same period, Meursault would've probably never even gone to trial. Maybe this says something about the difference between the colonialists and the racist slave holders in the USA."
1,"An amazing and powerful piece of literature. The magic Camus works with this novel is not entirely within the plot nor the ending, but rather in the cumulative emotional effect. Its funny to read some of the other reviews, calling it ""too depressing"" or ""odd."" This isn't a trashy dime novel to be taken on the same intellectual plain as Danielle Steele or Olive Ann Burns, but rather a serious philosophical work in the style of Derrida or Sartre. If you liked this, try Derrida's The Postcards."
1,"A Horrid Book Everyone Should Read! Albert Camus superbly takes us through the thoughts of a Godless heathen; A Nihilist. The author shows us the husk of a man. A hollow being who cares for nothing except his selfish desires. Our protagonist (and I use that label lightly) does not love his mother, whom he just days ago buried. Does not care, and looks on as his acquaintance beats his ex-girlfriend. He also does not care of the consequences or immorality of roaming the beach in search of someone to kill. He is mildly interested in sex. However, the woman whom he shares a bed with is viewed only as a means to the eventual end of satisfy his base needs. The main character is naive, loathsome individual whom everyone who reads this book should take great strength and pains never to be."
1,"Appeals to some and not to others My dad likes Albert Camus and my mom doesn't. I'm going to side with my dad on this one.One can debate the merits and demerits of the philosophy of the ""absurd"", and how well this books expostulates it. I think this book is great way to look at life because it creates the idea of an unexplainable phenomenon/na and illustrates it at a level that is easy to understand.Humans being rational often, if not always, look for explanations within dimensions and perspectives they can understand. In the course of living this is often possible, and sometimes not. I think this books takes this idea and illustrates eloquently and pithily, which is why I like it."
1,"An amazing piece of literature Camus is brilliant. I've read this book 4 times, and only after taking a course in existentialism have I realized it's full importance."
1,"One of the best books ever written. I was told by a really good friend of mine to read this book. Looking in a bookstore on vacation, I came across it. It was cheap so I bought it, not really knowing anything about the story or what I was getting into. But I trust my friend's judgment, so I went ahead and read all of 'The Stranger' this afternoon. WOW is all I can say. The language and storytelling is so simple, so effective, that I got wrapped up in the world that Camus was engaging me in.It reads like Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye', at least in my opinion. He tells the story so clearly. It's one of the most concise books I've ever read. It is quite depressing, but you oddly feel sorry for, and relate to the main character. I feel an odd sense of hope after reading it, and for people that hated it, I can't see what they're talking about. The story will engulf you and not let go until the end. Highly recommended!"
1,"AMAZING This is an amazing book and I would highly recommend to anyone who loves a great fantasy! I just picked this book up at the library and before I knew it, I couldn't put it down. I got very attached to the characters and could literally feel what they were going through. I just have to say again what a wonderful book this was!"
1,"Wonderful read, neat characters, made me want to visit. I read this book when I was 9 years old, I recommend this book for my nieces and nephew. Henry Reed is an interesting and enterprising character with many adventures to share."
1,"In response to Scott Eliason Hi, Scott! Listen, the latest edition always has an earlier date but in this case, as in previous printings, at the beginning there is an addenda including 18,000 new words or new meanings to words already included. This may seem unsuitable, but just think that by leafing through the addenda you get to learn about the new language of the last 10 years!"
1,Great Documentary! I love a mystery. The Lizzie Borden case has always been very intriguing to me. The documentary was very informative and the reenactments were very good and enjoyable to watch. Probably the best documentary on The Bordens that I've seen.
1,It's a wonderful story and I enjoyed this production of it. The story of Lorna Doone has always fascinated me and I always look for new version of it. This one was excellent and I have enjoyed it. I'm sure I will watch is many more times.
1,Looks and feels great! I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them! Won't take them off. They look even better on your feet and are very comfortable. The sizing is right on too. Excellent choice!
1,Tuan Jim (...)Conrad knows how to tell a story and few have ever been told as well as this one. Lord Jim the character is very appealing but also appealing are the sea and island settings that Conrad describes so well. Those hard to resist settings as well as the tale itself populated by a host of memorable minor characters all conspire to make this an irresistable yarn. It appeals as an adventure but there is plenty to capture the discerning substantive mind as well. Conrad offers a tale about a young man who wishes to be a hero.(...)
1,"Lord Jim Great Story. Also, additional material included is very helpful to help set the time and culture that the book was written. Conrad is considered a master writer for a good reason. Wayne Goodin"
1,"A Fantastic Novel and Regenerative Work of Art Reading 'Lord Jim' I was struck by how similar it was in many ways to Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishment. Conrad published 'Lord Jim' as a serial that straddled the beginning of the 20th century, and seemed to be hellbent on experimenting with form and style. The fractured narrative is buried in letters, conversations, remembered stories, etc. Conrad's style made me think of modernism swallowing a romantic tale. It was likeTreasure Islandbeing eaten by a novel by 'Dostoevesky.' I loved it.It also reminded me of Pynchon's classic problem. Most people are familiar withThe Crying of Lot 49andHeart of Darknessthanks to both being popular books to include when introducing high school students and college freshmen to classic works of modern and contemporary literature. Both Conrad and Pynchon's bigger AND better stuff requires more time and work.This is a fantastic novel, and a regenerative work of art."
1,"Book of many delights (&#65533; la belle &#65533;toile) Like many reviewers here, I have also seen the National Geographic Top 100 Adventure list (ranked #3), and the Outdoor Magazine Top 25 Outdoor Literature list (ranked #1), or even the picture of Exupery on French Franc notes (pre-Euro). But it would be narrow to read it for its rank alone. ""Earth of Men"" (the French title) is poetic verse, metaphorical contrasts and profound insight on what it means to be alive. Exupery captures it through flight, but planes are ""only a tool"" he says, a means to an end, in stars of infinite possibilities."
1,"Simply Marvelous!!!!! When this movie was released in theaters, it received bad reviews and I wondered out loud: ""What movie was the critics watching????"" This movie is awesome! I was completely drawn into the story because I could relate on a very personal level to all the things that happened in the movie, from beginning to end. The music was wonderful, too. I couldn't find anything to dislike about ""Kingdom Come."" It was the southern version of ""Soul Food"" only better. If you buy this DVD, you won't go wrong!"
1,"Like Everyman, Every Southern Family Almost didn't watch this movie....wasn't in the mood for musicians trying to be actors....but decided what the hey, might be lighthearted and worth the video rental price...ended up really enjoying it, even coming to amazon.com to buy it. This film has many southernisms and dysfunctional-but-you-gotta-love-them familyisms. We adopted several lines in our own family ""You know yo Daddy love us!"" ....a certain sign that we enjoyed it! It had excellent situational comedy and Whoopi plays the most understated part of her career, and it really works!"
1,"Very funny and endearing Wow what a great cast. Movie had some very funny moments and some parts that were very touching and endearing. Great performance from Anthony Anderson, he is on his way to superstardom. Anthony and Jada have real chemistry and I hope they do another film together. Another standout performance from Vivica Fox. Clyde was my favorite character, he had me on the floor with laughter. The only negative thing is sometimes the script kinda made some of the characters look like caricatures instead of real people. Very funny performance from Jada."
1,"To submit your body and life to another - no, this isn't a religious thing To submit your body and life to another - no, this isn't a religious thing. This is a few people's ideas of romance. Now in a new and updated edition for the new millennium, ""The Loving Dominant"" is a guide to the BDSM (a short hand way of abbreviating the life style meaning Bondage, Discipline, Submission, and Masochism) for any reader too timid to vocally ask the questions about the lifestyle which is more kind and loving than it seems to the people involved. Covering advice to make the best of the lifestyle to all, and with advice on toy-construction and photography, ""The Loving Dominant"" is an ideal addition to any human sexuality shelf and for any alternative lifestyle collection."
1,"Whip me, Beat, me, Love me An AMAZING BOOK! For both subs and doms, this book is PERFECT for anyone in the scene. It offers phycological info, stero-types, hoe to make scenes, and more! This is the FIRST book you must read when getting into ""bondage"" & ""power exchange"". If you don't, you have missed out!Also works great for giving to your loved one, as a suggestion for getting kinky...though it might scare them."
1,"High quality product! Received my order very quickly. Good quality chips and cards, plus they come packaged in a sturdy case. No complaints whatsoever!"
1,"pocket protector for my lab jecket I use this item to hold multiple scissors, needle drivers and reflex hammer in the pocket of my white clinical lab jacket--works great! No more holes torn out in the pocket and all items transfer out of my coat into book bag or locker quickly and easily. Highly recommend, very sturdy build quality!"
1,"prattgirl I normally don't go for mushy romance type books...I am more of a fan of Patterson's other material, but this book was great. It was a quick read, which once I started, I couldn't put it down. Everytime I got my eyes dried and cheered up, bam- he hit me with something new and I was crying again. Patterson has outdone himself yet again."
1,"Couldn't put it down.... Yes, I'm a very big James Patterson fan, and he didn't let me down. Sam's Letters to Jennifer was great! I couldn't put it down. I love all of Patterson's books but the romantic ones are right up there with my other favorite author, Nicholas Sparks. A must read for any true romantic. Okay, maybe it wasn't as good as Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, but it will go on my shelf as one of my very favorites!"
1,"Five star!!!!! Sam's Letters to Jennifer I had been meaning to read this book, Sam's Letters to Jennifer, for some time now. I stayed up most of the night because I just couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what came next, again and again. The story held my attention right to the very last page. Wonderful, endearing, and classis James Patterson!"
1,Magnificent Read!!! Such a sweet story! I loved this book and totally recommend it!Everyone should read this. Young or old! =)
1,"AMAZING love story!! I had picked up this book at Border's not knowing what to expect. I had never read any of James Paterson's books before, but the summary inside the cover caught my eye. Needless to say, this book was incredible!! The love story it possess is truly one of a kind. It will definitely inspire you and make you think about love in a whole new way. I advise you to have a box of tissues nearby though... it really is a tearjerker!!"
1,"Why is it out of print? I am appalled that such a wonderful,helpful and amusing book isn't available.I'm going to have to give MY well preserved copy to a family friend who's graduating from college.Except for a few sections,the advice is timeless."
1,lala I love doo wop music. This was a very good compilation of hits. I've bought several CD's of 50's and 60's music and this one is every bit as good. If you like doo wop music check this out. There are some songs that I had never heard but they were still very good.
1,"This cured my Doo-Wop jones... I doubt if this is the definitive Doo-Wop collection as implied by the title, but it is excellent. For a long time I have had a craving to buy a boxed set of Doo-Wop, but the $70+ was just too rich for my blood. This is great feel-good music at a feel-good price."
1,"I Wonder Why This could be the best CD although it's missing ""Book Of Love"" by The Monotones but on top of that, it's a really good multi-disc album a few remakes and original recordings."
1,"great remake. excellent remake better than the original in my opinion. All the same characters, Tony Todd was a perfect choice for Ben and the Cooper character is a bigger prick on this one than the original. Good story, very well done. I recommend this to zombie movie fans."
1,"Just as good as the original I like both versions equally. The original had atmosphere, the remake had better looking zombies. All in all, I highly recommend this movie. Check it out!"
1,"Excellent Remake! Thanks Tom!! Tom Savini pulled it off...to make a spooky, creepy, dead film!!I especially like the sound track during the film...that soft, twingy, sound during the moon rise at the beginning and other times in the film.For me, that spells SPOOKY man!! Where is Tom now and when is his next collaboration with George?RM Leal"
1,Tom savini did a great gob I love it George a Romero my favorite director of all time made the og version and he trusted savini to direct the remake it and it was awesome.savini did a great job with this film he put his own twist on it I loved it if you have not seen it see it buy it now you will not be disappointed if you liked the og you will want to watch this one great zombie movie savini is awesome
1,GREAT IDEA! This a better film than 68 version in every way! Best of all color! I was starting to think it might never hit DVD. Thank god
1,"Move over, Ms. Weaver Although this movie is based on George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, it felt very different. Perhaps it is my failure to appreciate 1960s era characterization and pacing. Here, you have two strong characters, male and female. The transformation of the female character is a bit surprising (how does she turn into a crack shot?). I do feel that her emotional transformation is congruent. She's finally externalized her personal demons, and realized they can be overcome by shooting them in the head. What was she before the movie started? A nurse? Social worker? Secretary? Regardless, she overcomes a lifetime of waiting and enduring to come out with guns blazing against obstacles. ""What I was is dead now"". Go girl. If only she was in the sequel, much like the Aliens saga followed Ripley."
1,"A wonderful, funny children's book for all ages A book bought by my grandmother on a trip to Australia when I was 6 years old (30 years ago). I enjoyed it thoroughly as a child and have just finished reading it to my seven year old daughter who couldn't wait to get through it. I highly recommend for anyone who loves well written fair."
1,Love it When I was younger and single I would watch Someone Like You a lot to understand why my relationships ended. Sometimes I would learn what I did or did not do right. Sometimes I just wouldn't understand what went wrong. Either way this is a good movie.
1,great movie Love this movie! recived it fast and in perfect shape and for a great price. If u like ashly judd this is one of her best shes very cute in this movie
1,"Great Movie, Sweet Price This is a great romantic comedy to watch with your special someone. The cast is wonderful and keeps you engaged throughout the film."
1,"It's the Alarm, need I say any more........ With out a dought, one of the BEST groups of my youth. I'm now thirty years old and I cherish the memories of their music, their concerts in San Francisco. I'm shocked to have read some of the comments made by ""fans"". One of my best memories was getting the chance to meet them one night in SF. LOVE The Alarm!! Signed, Staci Dube' of Silicon Valley, Calif."
1,"The Ultimate Foreigner Collection This CD is a great compilation. It's got a lot of familiar Foreigner hits, but what really sets it apart are the tracks from Lou Gramm and some lesser known Foreigner material. The sound is exceptional as well. I don't know if there was any remastering done or not, but it sure sounds like it. A lot of these songs have never sounded better. It is pricey though."
1,"A Spiritual Workbook Even more than its two excellent predecessors (""The Invitation"" and ""The Dance"") the third book of Oriah's trilogy is a handbook on how to live. While influences of both the Sufis and Lao-Tze (Taoist) are present, the voice is clearly unique and powerfully original. Grounding her teachings in stories from her life, Oriah marshalls a persuasive argument that the core issue in our lives and our relation to Spirit is not that we need to do more, but that we need to accept who we are. The meditations offer clear and practical steps towards accomplishing that.This is a practical book, that can be enjoyed whatever the reader's religious views are. Highly recommended!"
1,"Doc Hollywood This is a fun, feel good movie about small town living and the people who live in them. Loved this movie and have watched it 3 times. It's a movie that has some really funny lines that you will miss unless you watch it serval times. I'm a big Michael J. Fox fan."
1,"A real Gem ...must own movie ! This is one of my all time favorite movies & should be in everyone's collection. The main reason for my review though is I found an older brief mention of this info on another website ...but, a PAL format ""Amorphoric Widescreen"" Doc Hollywood was released in March 2006. I ordered it from Amazon.com.uk for the total price of $10.00 (3.99 + shipping) & received my order here in the U.S. approx. 9 days later.Here is a direct link:[...]It's kinda strange [...] doesn't list the aspect ratio (it's 1:85:1) or that's it's widescreen ...however, even though it's in PAL format ...this is your only choice for now if you that want to own this awsome movie in Amorphoric Widescreen !"
1,"The best hand-drawn Disney movie What a nice DVD set! In my view this is Disney's best animated movie, at least until WALL-E. It's scary, and has some adult themes, but those elements give it great replay value. The extra features are good, especially the commentary."
1,"A masterpiece...now and always Pinocchio is just one of those stories that appeals to everyone, young or old. And Disney told a wonderful version of it with this animated feature. It looks incredible on Blu-ray, and there are many great special features included. Highly recommended."
1,Classic Love Disney movies and love this story. Have added this to my growing collection of Disney movies.
1,"The Greatest Film To Be Made By Walt Disney (To Me At Least) If I had to choose a favorite Disney movie to be made by Walt Disney himself, then that would definetly be ""Pinocchio."" The main reason is because of Pinocchio, himself. is cute, innocent, and much more delightful than the jerk in the book. Jiminy Cricket is also a fun sidekick character. He's charming, he sings softly, he definetly knows between right and wrong, and he is only crabby when something goes wrong. Figaro the cat is cute and bratty, such a delightful comic relief. The song ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" is soft and delightful. Also, the music video on this edition is one of the few Disney music videos I personally approve of. The only thing I pan about this movie is Stromboli and the Coachman. They both make the movie dark, and neither get punished. Luckily though, that's not the focus of the film. This is definetly one of Walt Disney's greatest films for a reason!"
1,A VERY SPECIAL RELEASE OF PINOCCHIO IF YOU ARE A DISNEY FAN THIS EDITION IS A MUST OWN AND NOT VERY LIKELY TO BE REISSUED IN THIS SPECIAL STEELBOOK EDITION.THIS MOVIE WAS NOT SOLD IN STORES AND IS A VERY COLLECTABLE ADDITION FOR YOUR COLLECTION AND ALSO CONTAINS BOTH THE BLUE RAY RELEASE AS WELL AS THE DVD RELEASE.

1,Pinocchio Review Just as wonderful to watch now as it was when I was a little girl. Now my little girl gets to enjoy it! She loves it and has watched it many times. Beautifully done.
1,Pinocchio Item being reviewedPinocchio (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition + Standard DVD+ BD Live) [Blu-ray]Great product and beautiful enhanced version of a Disney classic. DH
1,"An actor's life for me ""Pinocchio"" may be the best film that Disney gave us and this DVD version is as good as it can be. The drawings are magnificently detailed and the memorable music is excellent. No film collection should be without it."
1,"A Classic! Beauty in the Beast is my favorite animated movie, but I think Pinocchio might be the best animated movie of all time. It's just perfect. Walt Disney's second animated feature lenth film after Snow White combines superb animation with a real soul of life. In a timeless story of a puppet coming of age, Pinocchio learns harsh lessons of temptation in a world of cruel characters, and eventually finds what's really most important. The richness of characters like Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio's creator Gappetto, and a host of charismatic bad guys, just makes this film a special one.The DVD is a terrific restoration of picture and sound quality. It has a nice second disk of extra features, but the movie is what this is all about. A classic in every sense of the word."
1,Adorable Wooden Boy Walt Disney masterpiece at its best!!! This keeps you young at heart!!! Everyone should get a Walt Disney moivie collection from Amazon.
1,"Pinocchio DVD Review I love this movie I think its great in fact I don't own the BD live I own the two disc DVD I love it and its got some great special features and the Picture and the Sound on the movie are superb! I highly Reccomend this movie, its a great story too, full of action and emotion!"
1,Pinocchio Received the product quickly and it arrived in the condition as described. I have purchased from this seller one other time and will purchase from this seller again if the opportunity arises.
1,Pinocchio DVD This new DVD set is wonderful. The second disc contains all kinds of additional fun things. I'm especially grateful for Amazon's low price guarantee which saved me an additional $1.00.
1,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS MOVIE I first saw this movie when I was a child many, many moons ago and fell in love with it. A true classic that has held up over time. You and your kids will love it, too. If you are a Disney fan (or even if you're not) you HAVE to get this movie."
1,"Best bonus material ! Although this film is a classic and one of my favorites, I particularly loved the bonus material included in this package. The ""deleted scenes"" the ""alternate ending"" and other material make this a well-worth purchase for any film buff or persons interested in Disney and animation. It's one of the best from that golden age of classics and still holds up against the newer computer generated disappointments out there these days."
1,"love it Bought this for my mother. Fast shipping, the DVD was not in the original shrink wrap but the DVD was sealed. No problems with the DVD itself it played well."
1,"Disney Classic I'm SO glad Disney is going through their classics and making the transfer to bluray. I love the story, characters, music, among many other things. Everyone should have this classic as part of their collection."
1,The best Disney film of all-time!!!!!! Pinocchio is my favorite Disney movie of all time!!!!!!! I'm glad they decided to come out with a 60th anniversary release. It is up there with such movies as Lady and the Tramp and Bambi. It is a classic a must have!!!!!!!!
1,deserves more than just 5 Pinocchio is a movie with good morals and great animation. The songs are delightful and it's a must for any Disney fan!
1,Great Woman's Wool Ski Hat Great hat that fits even larger size heads. I purchased this for my 16 year old and she loves it! Great colors that really bring out the detail of the knitting. She also likes that it is lined so it stays in place and is less itchy than most out door hats! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new ski/winter hat!
1,"awesome hat!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely love my 'wool chullo fleece lined ski hat with ear flaps'........I live in Oregon and its pretty cold in the winter. This is the first cap that has kept my head and ears warm, and its pretty too. I've got lots of compliments on it. I'm going to buy another one, only without the fleece for when its not quite that cold. I love it!!"
1,womens accessories I love this hat for skiing. The lining kept me nice and warm in blizzard conditions. I wore it every day of my week long ski trip.
1,One of my favorite This is not your typical Stephen King nightmare flicks. It is more thought provoking and Christopher Walken does an outstanding job of a man revived from a prolonged coma with a special ability. Even if you don't like Stephen King movies you will like this one.
1,The Wolf is loose! A truely scary film. Christopher Walkin plays the main character 'Johny' with panache. This film was a good adaption of The Stephen King book and manages to keep the audience spell bound through out. Martin Sheen plays the potential future president chillingly and overall worthy of a 5 star rating.
1,Goodie I love this movie I remember seeing this years ago and it took me some time to find a copy I like Christopher Walken & love Stephen King movies
1,"Raising Cain I am so thankful I found this book.Emotional literacy!!!How logical!!!How horrific that we still don't know this is the most important literacy we have to master first and for most and than we can go about other achievements.I recommend this book to everyone!Not just parents,not just fathers...Thank you Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson.I am learning to understand myself and my boys!"
1,"Great book for parents required book for teachers This is a great book. Kindlon and Thompson have provided an eloquent and readable discussion of the challenges facing boys in our society and our schools. I am a father of two boys and received my doctorate in Education a few years ago. As both a parent and educator for more than twenty years, I enjoyed reading each chapter of this book. I have also read Pollack and Gurian's books. I find Pollack pompous and arrogant in his opinions and advice. Frankly, I have not seen the separation anxieties that he describes in the boys that I have taught and counseled. Gurian draws extensive, simplistic conclusions from a select set of research findings - he seems to have predated the recent research regarding testosterone. Thompson and Kindlon, on the other hand, provide a balanced, quiet voice that relies on their years of experience with boys. Their descriptions matched my experiences and understanding of child psychology perfectly. Their advice is invaluable."
1,"excellent & complete - this book deserves wider attention! Anyone interested in or involved in teaching, coaching or raising boys must read this. Michael Thompson and Daniel Kindlon have done their research and work with boys. This book is timely, informative, and vitally important. This book will challenge the old notion that ""boys will be boys!"" as a way of forgiving their behaviors. It reminds us that boys are as complex in their emotions as any other human being. A must read."
1,"Wonderful!!! This book has been a tremendous help, even when I had no idea I needed any help. I am so grateful I have this book in my home to refer to as I embrace the jouurney of raising my three sons!"
1,"Really, REALLY good book about boys. Not only did I learn about some of the things that my son will go through as he grows up, I learned a lot about his dad and other boys in my life. I think this had to be one of the most informative books about boys and young men I have ever read."
1,"Raising Cain a must read for all who are raising or educating boys. This book is fantastic and written by 2 men who really know what they are talking about. It is written with clarity and in depth knowledge about boys regarding every aspect of their life. This is something that we all need to be aware of when raising boys and dealing with boys. Emotional illiteracy is widespread in our culture because of the way we socialise boys, as we don't allow them to get in touch with their feelings. This disconnection from the inner world causes much pain to him, and people who are close to him, as they often are unable to connect deeply with others, or to be truly empathetic. I applaud the men who wrote this book and I am at present working with a male client who is getting a great deal from the concepts discussed therein. It is a must read."
1,"Best boy guide ever I don't know what I did without this book. It is the best insight into why boys do what they do and the real feelings and emotions we don't see. I have recommended it to all my friends with boys and would recommend that if you have a boy, this is a must read."
1,"Awesome An absolute must-read for ALL parents of both boys AND girls. Being a feminist, I had to keep reminding myself that when we take care of our boys we also take care of our girls. It has transformed the ways I look at my son and also my husband and other men in my life.Along with Reviving Ophelia it should be mandatory reading for all parents!(...)"
1,How to Play the Hawaiian Ukulele: 10 Easy Lessons Great Book! Really easy to follow with plenty of good pictures of finger positions.
1,"Classic! I ordered this as a Christmas gift that never was able to be given so I opened it up and had a movie night with friends.I am in no way saying this is an award winning movie with award winning performances, but it does include a star-studded cast and plenty of corny jokes that are so indicative of the time period. My friends and I had an amazing time re-watching this childhood staple and enjoyed the humorous nostalgia that came along with it!"
1,"Tremors-Probably the BEST film I have ever have ever viewed! If you want to see a movie that is so creepy and fun then you must see this movie! If you actually put yourself in the characters shoes then you would see how scary it would be. I mean worms coming out of the ground without warning and eating you alive! That's scary. Then factor in the humor of Kevin Bacon and you have a formula that could make Sisckle & Ebert give it two thumbs up! Lets just say YOU must buy this movie, if you don't you'll want to see again and again anyway."
1,"A fun movie with a great cast and tight screenplay. Tremors tells the classic story of a small community fighting for survival against underground monsters. It's classic horror-movie stuff with a twist: unlike most Hollywood horror flicks, the characters look and talk like real people, and as the story progresses, you actually root for them to win. The last horror flick I saw where I didn't cheer for the monsters was the original 'Night of the Living Dead' (1969). The cast makes the people of Perfection real to us, and the dialogue is as sharp and funny as the best Mel Brooks movie. The action is fast-paced, but the tone is always positive. This film is great fun; I never get tired of watching it. Be sure to check out the ""Making of..."" feature and the original ending; excellent documentaries from the film-makers. You'll enjoy this disk for years to come."
1,"Laugh out loud funny I thought this movie was hilarious. The two main characters Val and Earl were the best part. Everytime they tried to leave Perfection, something would stop them. ""We just waited one day too long to leave""The 'Graboids' are voracious eaters who travel through dirt like fish through water. They sense vibrations caused by those walking on top, reminiscent of the giant worms from Dune. They then come to the surface and have a snack.Great movie. Not really scary, no sex or profanity. Good for the whole family."
1,Great Movie! Tremors is such a good movie because it is not a horror movie but and adventure movie. It has a good touch of comedy in it too and that makes is it great. Definitely a must see.
1,"Great Movie Ahoy! Better than Disney! Has nevadie rednecks, men fight the best, got a lotta guns, and I like it and the great Mummy movie. I hate Disney's poltical correctness, and choose this over it!"
1,"I absolutely love the movie! Love the special effects, the characters and the plot. Val & Earl may be country handymen, but they are heroic - very responsible. Rhonda the seismologist student is smart and a survival. Burt & wife are a matching pair. Great potrayal of Val & Rhonda subtle attractions. And the creatures, they learn fast. Each can only be destroyed in a different way, first by accident upon hitting RC drain head on, second by elephant gun, third by ""bomb fishing technique"" and last by tricking it into jumping off the cliff. Absolutely great movie!"
1,"But under the ground... In homage to 1950's giant bug movies Tremors is about giant mutant worms that suck up people under the ground. The greatest thing about this film is the outlandish characters and the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously. The movie is definately more of horror movie than the sequels, but there are some very good comedy bits instead of just having a straight up comic relief character. The special effects are genuin, no CG crap, or mat paintings. The acting is funny, Michael Gross is more of an (...) in this movie than a hero like he is in the others, but I still like him better than the two leads. Worth every penny, one of my favorite movies."
1,Excellent!!!! I've seen parts of this movie many times when it's shown on TV and I decided to get my own DVD 2 months ago. Since then I've probably seen it 30 times. This movie is really a classic. All the main characters are lovable and they have great chemistry together. A must have in any DVD collection.
1,"Learning from revelation, God is good--not terrifying. Systematic theology or memoir? Yes. The organization and intent is theological leading us from our existence in God, our humanity, our desire for the good, crucifixion, resurrection, and beyond. The method is to use her own life to lead us through the topics. Bondi suffered from traumatic childhood experiences including bad revival preaching. She was maimed by an image of a wrathful God that demands our sacrifice. Through study, prayer, and revelation, she learns that God, as God and as a human being, came among us to bring us healing....Read Chapter 4 before going to hear any Good Friday or Easter sermons."
1,"Very enjoyable, very effective I have used this CD now for about three months. It is not only very pleasant to listen to, it is also very intelligent. Mary suggests that you not 'try' to sleep, but just relax and pay attention to your body and thoughts. As you do this, you slowly relax more and more until you effortlessly slip into sleep.Now, when I lay down to sleep, I automatically start to scan my body, readjust my position until I feel comfortable, and observe my thoughts. As I do this, I often fall asleep without the CD.Highly recommended."
1,"Great Lesson Plans And Workshop I purchased this book in order to attend a workshop given by Mary Ann Johnson and was very pleased with both the workshop and the book. Tutankhamun: Time Capsule contains about twenty lesson plans, which could be used with a variety of ages and skill levels. They are fast paced, hands-on, and fun. I wish I had attended this workshop before viewing the King Tut exhibit, which is currently appearing in Seattle. Mary Ann Johnson has a wealth of knowledge and experience in this subject area."

1,"Miniature Mushroom Cloud After I bought this little can of Uranium, I bought myself a miniature centrifuge off eBay. Before long I had enough critical mass to make a mini nuclear bomb.So then I detonated my little nuke with a Black Cat firecracker in my garage.All of a sudden there was a miniature mushroom cloud spreading radioactive materials all over my garage. So now, every time, I go into my garage, I first have to put on one of those plastic yellow suits and the alien-looking face mask.It was a fun experiment, but one my neighbors complained to the H.O. saying I wasn't zoned for the production and detonation of nuclear materials."
1,"Fun for the whole family + excellent upgrade for your spudgun Not only do all 4 of us college students living here love this stuff (it goes great on pizza, and keeps it piping hot for hours!), our cats have taken a liking to using it as a face-scratcher, and it's done wonders for their coats. Far less dander now, and their glow-in-the-dark tags are even visible during the day!As an added bonus, once you've depleted the entire jar, you can upgrade your spudgun to use depleted uranium rounds! Using high-pressure steel parts instead of PVC is highly recommended if you do this, but the increased range and damage is worth it."

1,"Great For Tomatoes!!! In preperation for the upcoming zombie apocalypse I bought this Uranium to give a little extra ""umph"" to the Miracle Grow that I usually spray on my garden. Being able to garden in the middle of the night was an unexpected benefit of this miracle product. The vegetables started to glow beautifully which made them easier to pick, however some of the little buggers do try to bite me while I'm working. I told my neighbor that he was welcome to anything in my garden not realizing how territorial the tomatoes had become. They didn't recognize him and he lost an arm. Fortunately he gained a tentacle in its place so it's all good."
1,"Great stuff! This saved me a TON of money! My grandma had this huge tumor on the right side of her head. The doctors wanted an insane amount of money to treat it. I bought some of this stuff, made it into a paste with a little water, and rubbed it into the tumor area for a few months. The thing withered and fell off! Fantastic. I only used about half of the tin, too, goes a long way. I gave the rest to neighborhood kids that came by for trick-or-treat. Forget your oncologist...pick up some of this and you should be good to go."

1,"T'ai Chi Forms Grand Champion & Team USA Martial Arts Coach The T'ai Chi Forms Grand Champion (Sifu Hong Yijiao) & Team USA Martial Arts Coach (Michael Steward, Sr.) captured the essence of this book. In their excellant ratings below.It paints a vision and explains T'ai Chi & Qigong using Western science and cultural concepts. As a San Francisco teacher wrote, ""it brings Qigong to the people, as Apple did with the computer.""The medical research and modern terminology are effective reference tools for T'ai Chi & Qigong teachers as well as their students."
1,"Looking to get into Tai Chi? This is THE BOOK for you! Stress at work. Find yourself sitting in front of the television all weekend. Turning into a zombie? Been there, done that.Let me clarify this: I've never been 'up' on the Eastern arts, and until I picked up this book, I had no clue about Eastern Medicine. As a 'good Christian boy', that sounded a bit outside my realm.But, after reading Mr. Douglas' book and watching hte included DVD, I must say that I have fallen for Tai Chi and Qi-Gong 100% !!!The breathing techniques you learn early on help tremendously, especially when done daily.Now that I've read the book, I have been actively seeking a Tai Chi class here in my hometown.Easy to read and simple to follow, Mr. Douglas presents Tai Chi in a way that anyone could understand.Oh, and if you have physical limitations, DO NOT WORRY! Mr. Douglas includes information that demonstrates how you can participate in Tai Chi, too!"
1,Helpful for grasshopper I wanted a book to tell me more about Tai Chi. This book does that in easy to understand terms.
1,"makes the learning process entertaining This book is one of the most entertaining that I have (of all my books, not just tai chi.) It also speeds up the learning process as well because you are enjoying and remembering what you are reading. The Kuang Ping Yang style that is presented is not the style that I practice but the book is absolutely loaded with both essential and interesting information. If you want a fun book that has everything a beginner needs to know but does not act as a sleeping pill, this is the book for you."
1,A good introduction to Tai Chi & Qigong Length:: 0:55 MinsThis is a brief video note receiving and recommending the Complete Idiot's Guide to Tai Chi & Qigong.
1,"FANTASTIC Reference Book for student & teacher! This book is OUTSTANDING. It's a great reference tool for both the beginning student and the Instructor of T'ai Chi. I personally recommend this book to ALL of my T'ai Chi students. I have been teaching Yang Style T'ai Chi (48 step and 108 step) for the past 13 years, and am proud to be listed in the directory of this very fine book. This book promotes ALL styles of T'ai Chi. It encourages students to find a suitable class, and helps them to do so. Keep up the good work, Bill! We Love ya!"
1,"Learning about Tai Chi and QiGong As a new student of Tai Chi and QiGong, I have enjoyed reading this book. Since I only take class once a week, there were a lot of questions and gaps in my basis knowledge of Tai Chi and QiGong. This book is a wonderful supplement to my class and has exposed me to QiGong which is now a necessary part of my week. QiGong is a series of exercises which combine breathing and relaxation. I enjoy sitting on my outside porch and doing my QiGong exercises as the stresses of the week flow away. This was a bonus as I bought the book to learn about Tai Chi. If you want to learn about Tai Chi and QiGong, I would recommend this book because it is easy to understate and is fun to read. After reading this book I have recommended it to the other students in my Tai Chi class."
1,"Nice review of cursive handwriting We used this book in a fourth grade class. It is not meant to be the first introduction to cursive (that should happen in grade 3) - this 96 page color workbook reviews manuscript letters (10 pages), reviews the capital cursive letters, and then covers some of the tricky letter combinations that occur in cursive writing. It provides practice in different writing forms, and has improved my daugthers handwriting. It filled in the gaps that we seem to have from the introduction to cursive in Grade 3."
1,"Wait and Hope This book is about patience - not just in the sense of waiting but in the sense of tolerating the most awful life circumstances one could imagine upon oneself, until they ultimately make way for better times that are made sweeter by perspective. Although the book itself may be an exercise in patience (it is very long!) it is very much worth reading, entertaining throughout, and divided into ""digestibly"" sized chapters. Indeed, a two-hundred-year-old novel that has stood the test of time must be pretty good, right? It is."
1,"Excellent edition of the book This is an excellent edition of the book, it even includes a small timeline biography of Alexandre Dumas which was very insightful. Overall no complaints with this product at all."
1,"This was a Great Book!!! I was required to read this book for my English class and was not exactly thrilled. I finished reading it and was completly stunned at Dumas's intelligance & brilliance. The book was wonderful & kept me reading to find out what would happen next. I felt as if I knew each & everyone of the character's keenness, evilness, kindness, & image. Although, it did have a few slow parts, the ending was wonderful. I would definatly read it again."
1,"Great book! I read this book when I was 14 and I loved it, I still do! this is well worth reading. It is an exciting tale of adventure and revenge and one man's story! I loved it! read it!"
1,Great book My husband has been wanting this book for a long time and when I gave to him he was so excited! The book came in perfect condition and fast shipping!
1,"The greatest piece of fiction in the world! This is, without a doubt, the most masterful piece of storytelling to ever have been written. Alexandre Dumas paints a canvas of characters that are larger-than-life, with motives such as revenge, deceit, greed, lust, vindictiveness, and a sense of justice propelling them. This book has everything!If you are looking for an epic adventure, then this is the ultimate book for you.This book has been my favorite novel since I was required to read it in 9th grade English class. Over the years I have visited and revisited it, and have yet to grow tired of it."
1,"A truly remarkable work! This is one of the best books ever written. The characterizations are remarkable. Certainly a ""must-have"" for anyone who likes to read. It is a long book, but the richness of the text will more than compensate you for the time spent reading.The characters all comport themselves with a dignity and nobility that cannot be seen or portrayed by people of our time period. It is as though all of the characters have the distinction of Anthony Hopkins(and this still does not do it justice!). This work is a feast for the mind!"
1,"Alexandre Dumas - Creative Writer or Tedious Instinct? My AP English teacher recommended this book for me to read over the monthly required reading list, and I thought, ""Oh great, what a great idea....<yawn>"". But it was for two months because of its length, so I took it.Each chapter includes a specific idea to the plot that keeps you wanting to read more. I would bring this book to work and read a chapter a day during my 15 minute break and would go overboard reading two chapters because it just keeps getting better and better! Each new idea came as a surprise for me, and so much is in it that I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good book.Alexandre Dumas sure knew what he was doing when he read this, so I definitely recommend this."
1,"ADVENTURE Dumas... Master of adventure. His books take you away, but you have to keep up with the pace. Fantasy is in a mix with reality. What is true and what is Dumas?"
1,"A way to live Out of all the many books that I have read, I would have to say that ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is one of the most personally influential books that I have ever read. I had used to have a terrible temper, but here I saw the value of controling ones rage. Edmond endured a trial by fire and with inventiveness and unwavering steadfastness was able to achieve his goals. His revenge in each was a fitting exactment of justice. I personally love the revenge on Danglers. While the ending was predictable, I think that was the whole point. Revenge certainly is a dish better served cold. Anyone looking for an original story, and one that has obviously insipired many writers of our day. Read ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", and feel that certain power that only a classic novel can create."
1,"The County of Monte Cristo Love this book, can read over and over again. Compelling, cannot put the book down. Highly recommendThe Count of Monte Cristo-a must read for everyone. Classic!!"
1,Great version This is the full version. Great read! If you are going to buy one this is the true book no short cuts.
1,"This version is ABRIDGED, Amazon info has been updated, thanks! Updated to 5-star: Originally I gave this a low rating because it was incorrectly marked as the Unabridged version. Amazon has corrected this, so I'm editing my review. Great book at a great price. Thanks, Amazon!Old Review: Note: 1-star rating is only to bring attention to the edition of the book! I'm sure this is a great book, I'm really looking forward to reading it, but after much debate I decided to get the Unabridged version, and ordered this item - I got the book in the picture, but it's Abridged. Not worth returning (Great deal, $5 book!), but just a heads up for others in the same boat."
1,"Incredible I have read this book 3 times and it is still my absolute favorite. The language, detail, and life of Edmond Dantes as depicted by Dumas is unlike any other book I have read. There is no filler or boring moments. Every line gives great insight into the characters. The idea Dumas presents is novel and paints revenge different than any way I thought about in the past. The movie is a disaster and distortion of the main points the book presents by the way. A must read."
1,"Easy to digest and fun Just finished this marvelous classic. Don't delay - start reading today, this new translation is fabulous. Now it's on to Madame Bovary!"
1,"Whoa, what a book!!! A brilliant piece of literature, a real tribute to French literature, Alexandre Dumas is a genius with all the subplots and major plots that he intertwines which makes this a superb novel. I found myself guessing about what was going to happen next but each time I tried to guess, I was wrong. I loved the character development. There were so many characters in this novel and each character brought new attributes to ""the table"" which made the book even more interesting. Also I loved the plot development. There were so many subplots that all ended up tying into the main plot which made the book that much more interesting. Starting out as an honest sailor in Marseilles, he is framed for being a Bonapartist, and is sentenced to life in jail... With little hope for escape he is left to die in his cell, but when he meets Abbe Faria his luck just starts to turn around... With this in mind I would definitely encourage others to read this book!"
1,an exciting tale of revenge this book is awesome. Its a little complicated because of all of the characters and the past crimes they have commited but in the end the characters all tie together in weird twists of fate. You'll enjoy every one. The book is so different from the movie. Way better!! It goes into more detail and depth.
1,"There was nothing wrong :) I ordered the used version of the Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas and the book had said it was in ""good"" condition, but I felt like it was in very good conition. The cover had no knicks or bent edges to it and the inside was just fine. There were no markings or folds in it at all, and I'm pretty sure there weren't ripped pages."
1,One of my two favorite books I absolutely love The Count of Monte Cristo and look forward to reading it again (and again). Revenge is sweet!
1,"Another Classic Was forced to read as a teenager and just read again in my 40's. Wonderfully written (maybe a little wordy), awesome characters, love story, adventure, intrigue, etc. What more could you ask of a book?"
1,"Excellent Classic! The book is a little hard to follow, but the storylines come together perfectly! I was amazed at the level of detail and planning foresight of the author. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to expand their knowledge of famous classics.Dumas is a literary genius!"
1,Christmas gift My son is an avid reader and is interested in reading the classics. The look of the cover is very nice according to my son. He said he is looking forward to reading The Count of Monte Cristo! It's is the second classic I have purchased for him and will continue purchasing more of the classics to help him build up his library of classic books.
1,"Great Story This is an excellent book. I love the classics and had somehow managed to have never read this one until last year. Amazingly, it feels like a story upon a story upon a story. It has the beautiful quality of building anticipation from beginning to end and continuing the story when you are afraid it is about to end! More recent books always leave you with the feeling that you want to know what will happen next when the book has ended, this story gives you everything you could ever want and more beyond your imagination. I highly recommend it!"
1,"Fantastic Classic, Best Version The greatest story of revenge ever told! The un-abridged version is the only way to go with this book. The everyman's library hardcover is a beautiful book with very nice pages. It is a very sleek stylish looking book too when you remove the cover slip."
1,"The Count of Monte Cristo is a gorgeous novel of suspense. The Count of Monte Cristo has to have been one of the memorable books I have ever encountered. It is one of those great stories capable of pulling the reader in, overcoming the barriers of time, lanuage and culture. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to spend a lot of time with a truly enjoyable novel."
1,"Excelent Book Shows the nature of vengence on a person Dauntes a sailor on the verge of of marrying the woman he truley loves. Is betrayed by the people he trusts. And hate and vengance keeps him going throught his time in prison. Dumas describs in detail how he plots and scemes to get his revenge on those who wronged him. How it consumes him every waking hour of his life. He beleves he is doing gods vengence on those who wronged him. But starts doughting it all when little Edword dies unsuspectingly. and how he realizes vengence is for god to do not him, and that this vengence has cost him his happiness all those years. And he realizes that the Young woman he saved from slavery really loves him (she realizes vengence has caused her unhappiness), and that he can really be happy again with her. The unabridged version is the best one."
1,excellent service I received a beautiful book to give my daughter for her birthday. The condition was just as it was described and the service was excellent.
1,Awesome! Very entertaining adventure-fiction classic. Once you begin you can't put it down. Highly recommended.Now I have to read Aledandre Duma'sThe Three Musketeersas well.
1,Awesome Book Excellent version of this book. The Count of Monte Cristo has never had a better translation.
1,"The BEST book I've ever read. I'll miss it. Monsieur Le Comte is incredible!!!! The best book I've ever read; I'll miss it... I could not tear myself away from this book... My two year-old recognizes it as ""papi's book"" because I could not put it down.... I kept my wife up with the story and got a chance to relive it that way. She loved it too.Dumas makes you fall in love with his characters, with Mercedes, Edmond Dantes, Abbe Faria, Valentine, Haydee, M.Morrel.... and he makes you hate the bad guys, Danglars, Villefort, Morcef... But in the end you end up doubting just like M. Le Comte.... Every character has an incredible story and every story will take you deap into the time and place and the feeling of it all....This book cannot be described. It must be read. If you will only read one good book in your life; make sure it's this one."
1,"Buy the Buss... Lots of people try the Count of Monte Cristo and give up... it is very long, very complicated and in the original English translation, very hard to read and enjoy. Robin Buss's (1996) translation for Penguin Classics is fantastic - delivering the complete and unabridged (1316 page) original story translated into smoothly flowing idiomatically correct English. Sure, you can pick up the 1850s version for free on Project Gutenburg, but if you're going to commit to a novel of this quality and length, why not spend the $5 and experience the best it has to offer?"
1,"BRILLANT!!! I loved this book and it has easily became my favorite!! When I first started this book I didn't make it past the first page because I just couldn't get into it. However, a few weeks later I opened the book again and couldn't stop reading. Don't let the page count deter you. This book is genius. The count of monte cristo has it all and just when you think you've seen the last of a character, he/she pops right back up. I love how everything comes together. Make sure to read the unabridged version because other wise you would just miss out on all the stuff that makes this book great. And you can't go wrong with the Robin Buss translation. Enjoy!!"
1,"A great book. The Count of Monte Cristo is an amazing story filled with action, betrayal, romance, and vengeance. Edmond Dantes is a young sailor who has everything he needs in life. He has a wife and a large amount of money to start a family. He is betrayed by his friends and sent to the dreaded Chateau d'If, and is imprisoned for life. Edmond thinks his life is over, so he swears vengeance to all who betrayed him. Edmond makes a miraculous escape and puts his plans into motion. He is determined to gain vengeance and nothing thrown in his way will stop him. He adopts the name Count of Monte Cristo and becomes friends with the ones who betrayed him. He gains his vengeance slowly by revealing little secrets about each of them, while revealing nothing at all about him. This is a story of a man who was wrongfully accused, and was able to escape and return the favor to his friends. The Count of Monte Cristo is an amazing book by Alexandre Dumas, and it is also one of his best."
1,"The best book in the world I have just finished reading this, which in my opinion is the best book in the world. Everything about it is amazing. The plot is captivating and fulfilling. Dantes's intricately planned vengeance on the men who ruined his life is so detailed and amazing it leaves me speachless. I love how the book leaves hints of future events and things which at one point may not make sense. Later, however, their purpose is revealed and they help the reader to understand the current events as well as show the how the past, present, and future of Edmond Dantes's life is connected. All those who have given this book 1 star are simpletons who were forced into reading it and never even tried to appreciate it."
1,"Not just a great adventure novel... Alexandre Dumas was considered in his time to be the foremost adventure novelist. What he created in The Count of Monte Cristo is so much more. The story chronicles the journey of Edmund Dantes, a young and hopelessly naive sailor as he matures into the worldy and cynical Count bent on revenge. Had Dumas ended there, he would have written a stupendous and sweeping saga of adventure and drama. The greater relevence of the story is in its moral telling: Edmund Dantes regains his humanity and learns to live again. Here is a story of spiritual redemption, told against the backdrop of post-Napoleanistic France. It is a tale of love, of loss, of revenge, and of the rekindling of the heart. While the unabridged story is long, it is best enjoyed while seated in front of a fire, with a warm beverage in hand. Few narratives are as satisfying to the soul as this one is."
1,"This is the Complete and Unabridged and IT IS BETTER! Little known fact :Dumas was paid by his Royal benefactor ""By the Line"":Hence his novels tended to be Very Long. But in the Count of Monte Cristo this is just More of a Good Thing. This novel of over 1000 pages is to be savored for its many attributes. The characters seem to come to life as The Count goes thru his trials and tribulations. This has it all: Adventure,suspense,joy, tragedy ,Love , hate and Let's not forget Revenge. This book is a great read and if you take the easy way and read another abridged version then you are not savoring a mouth watering chocolate moose but settling for a cardboard tasting diet cookie."
1,"The ultimate REVENGE book. A fantastic read I've read this book twice and I'll read it again. This is one of the best novels ever. The ultimate story of revenge, it is truly realistic. I recommend this book highly."
1,"Positively Stunning I just finished reading this book for school, and I absolutely loved it!! Dumas' captivating writing style combined with the intriguing tale of Edmond Dantes make this novel a must read for all lovers of classics and quality literature."
1,"The Adventures of The Count of Monte Cristo The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is an excellent book for people who like classics with an actual meaning to it. This book desribes a man's life and the friends who betrayed him because of their jealousy. As he makes a ""comeback"" as a completely different and sophisticated man, the Count of Monte Cristo gives no mercy to those who betrayed him. With all this merciless revenge, Dumas shows the real meaning of love and how forgiving may be the solution to your problems. The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite number one book and I recommend this book to people of all ages!"
1,"Astounding book! When I first started this book, I thought, ""Oh, I'm never going to finish!"" That was very wrong. This masterpiece of a novel is next-to-impossible to put down. I became so involved in the book that, when I finished, I felt sort of deprived. I wished the book would continue for another 1,000 pages. By the way, if you're going to read this book, don't read the abridged version. It is NOTHING like the unabridged, original copy."
1,"Best book EVER This is my all-time favorite book. I've read it at least 15 times. This book has something to offer to absolutely anyone that can read -- revenge, romance, betrayal, loyalty, friendship, political intrigue, history, etc. The cast of characters is unforgettable and well developed. The depth and breadth of the revenge plot in this book is unprecedented and unmatched. I wrote a paper on this book for my Revenge Literature class in college. Whenever I have been dissatisfied with recent books and need something really great to fall back on, I pick this book up again and love it just as much."
1,"READ THIS BOOK....NOW!!!!! I have spent hundreds of dollars on this site and have never been provoked to write a review...until now. The Count of Monte Cristo has got to be one of the greatest books ever written. I'm telling you now, read this unabridged version, and it will change the way you look at fiction for the rest of your life. I promise. I'm an avid reader (I teach high school literature) and made it to my late 20's without ever reading this unabridged version. Man am I glad I decided to pick it up and read it. Don't be scared by the number of pages (1245). I absolutely promise you will finish it in no time. I mentioned to the person who suggested I read this version this comment, ""there is no soul on this earth who would not like this book"". Pretty intense I know, but do yourself a favor...buy the book, read it, get lost in it, tell other people about it, and love literature. You will not be disappointed. Have fun...I DID!!!!"
1,"Finally - modern and unabridged on Kindle This review is for the Kindle edition ASIN: B002RI9KL8. Don't get any other Kindle edition, even though they might be cheaper. This is complete and unabridged and with a superb modern translation by Robyn Buss."
1,"The Count of Monte Cristo; Sould You Read It? The Count of Monte Cristo, some people did not know it was a book until the movie came out, some people still don't even know it is a book. I thought it was an exciting, keep you on the edge of your chair, hafta turn the page, cliff hanger. That is, until you get past the first five pages of boring mush (literally only 5 pages). It is a classic story about a man who has everything going for him; until, on his wedding day his supposed friends frame him and send him to the legendary Chateau d'If for the rest of his life. But when he escapes from prison and finds a gigantic treasure, he sets out to reclaim his lost love and exact a slow, fitting punishment on his betrayers. Will he find his beloved Mercedes and get his revenge against his enemies, or will his whole plot go ka-put?"
1,"The Best Book Ever This is the best book I have ever read. I am not usually the type that likes to read books as long as this but The Count of Monte Cristo was worth all the pages. I have never been more excited to read a book before. Each time I picked it up I would tell myself I only had time to read one chapter but I always read about ten chapters before finally and reluctantly putting the book down. If I was to recommend any book to anyone, this would be the book. No matter what you are looking for in a book you can find it in this book."
1,"The Counte Of Monte Cristo Assigned the book as a termpaper project, I dreaded the thought of having to read this 1400 page monster. But as soon as I began read this book I was quite pleased with the plot. I admired Dumas' ability to patiently draw out the story as to build mounds and mounds of suspense. How he played out the revenge of the Count is the most interesting and compelling part of the story. What an amazing book!"
1,Favorite Book A book that you don't want to put down. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys reading.
1,"Best Written Book It is rare to find in modern writing the wonderful complexity that exists in this book. It is a classic for a reason, and i consider it one of the best written stories i have ever read."
1,"Great story of redemption Sweet revenge at it's finest.Love, romance, long friendship gone wrong.It's all in here. Not like the movie, so don't beterribly disappointed."
1,"The Best book of all! The Count of Monte Cristo is truly the best book I have ever read. The book is about a young salior named Edmond Dantes who is framed for a terrible crime by ones whom he named friends. In prison he plans revenge. Once free he seeks his revenge.If you don't mind a challenge then the Count Of Monte Cristo is for you. This tale of adventure, vengence, and romance is one all should read."
1,"What a great single! While I rarely find remixes not annoying, much less good, both remixes here are fabulous. I particularly like the Baxendale mix, which makes the title track sound very much like, well, Baxendale, who are another great band. Anyway, the real key to why you should buy this is the awesome b-side ""Buying Records Won't Make Me Feel Better"". Its a slow song with lyrics which I've found to be all too true. But, I must confess that buying this CD did make me feel a bit happier."
1,"our favorite doll I purchased this doll for my 18 month old daughter 2 years ago after looking around for a while. This doll is just the perfect size to tote around and has a really sweet face and nice vanilla smell. ""Nilla baby"" was recently lost on a trip and, despite having about 15 other dolls, we had to buy a replacement to put under the Christmas tree (she actually sat on Santa's lap and told him she wanted Nilla baby home for Christmas because she was ""really worried about her""). So now we own #2."
1,"It does not get much better or more concise than this! Nothing I write will come close to the appropriate praise that this little book deserves. Michael Himes, a professor of theology at Boston College, known for his excellent video series from which this book was derived, does an amazing job at summarizing the essential elements of what it means to be part of the Catholic Christian community.This is as fun a book to read as it is informative. Having looked at many ""Introductions to Catholicism"" in order to better recommend particular books to inquirers, I would not hesitate to endorse this book."
1,"An eye-opening, powerful work So often we stereotype autistics as being very limited in their ability to do basic functions of daily life. While this is true of some autistics, this book reveals that autism is not a single,universal condition, but a spectrum with a wide range of abilities as well as disabilities (the book's editor, who is autistic, is a college instructor). This book opens both the mind and the heart, enlightening readers about the variety of people who fall under the umbrella ""autistic""."
1,"Best SAT prep EVER If you don't believe me, then listen to this true story:I got this book in the mail 2 days before my SAT exam. The day before the exam, I decided to read the verbal section, and then when I did a practice SAT, my verbal score jumped 100 points from 630 to 730. Amazing, non?"
1,"I WIN! I finally did it. I got him to watch a chick flick. Despite Mr. Bronson's constants groans of pain and disgust, he watched the whole thing (and survived!). This is one of my favorite movies of all time so it really meant a lot that I was able to share it with him. After 7 months of horror flicks, a little change was nice (i love you honey).There's not much I can say about this movie that someone else hasn't already written. I love the music, the dancing is awesome, and the story is well written. For the longest time, I'd always cry at the end of the movie because, gosh darn it, I wanted my happy ending! Finding it (my happy ending) with Mr. Bronson made me look at it in a completely different way.I'm done be mushy, I promise! I'm making myself sick with the immense sappiness of it all."
1,"INCREDIBLE NEVER HAVE I SEEN A MOVIE THAT IS FILLED WITH AS MUCH ""STUFF"" AS THIS ONE. i WILL NEVER FORGET THIS MOVIE, IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST i HAVE SEEN"
1,"Review for Dirty Dancing This movie is a classic, and it was great to see it in the blu-ray format. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is a fan of this movie. It would also make a great gift idea."
1,60's or 80's This has got to be one of the most 50ish value movies with the most 80's soundtrak which makes it double great. I love and you will too. What girl wouldn't love to be swept off her feet by Patrick Swayze and in thos pants at that!! WOW!!
1,"From the 80's Dirty Dancing is one of my favorite movies. Its a lot like Grease. I don't know which one I like better. It has great songs, great acting, and great dancing. Thats probably why they named it Dirty DANCING. It is very fun to watch and you could never get sick of it. This is one movie that will live on."
1,Loved it I hadn't seen this movie until now and loved it. Now I know what everyone is talking about when they reference it.
1,"This movie changed my life when I was a kid. One reviewer put down this movie because of its ""relative morality"". The thing is, Baby wasn't underage (I think the reviewer said she was 16). Her dad says that she is going off to college in the fall, so you should assume that she is 18. Anyway, while the music and dancing are fun, that is not what this movie is about to me. Its about Baby's coming of age. There are a lot of deep interactions between people here."
1,"Brillient!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dirty Dancing is my all time favourate movie, I first saw it when I was about 5 years old(even though i shouldn't have done!), and later on I decided to buy it, It has a great story line which deals with very serious situations. Patrick Swayze is a brillient dancer and absalutely gorgeous!!!!!!! Jennifer Grey is also very good as Baby. I recomend this film to anyone who loves a good old fashioned love story or even if you don't your'll still love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Kitten's Thought's on the Dirty Dancing I first saw bits and pieces of the movie but i fell in love with the movie. Then i could not figure out what the movie was called. So i spent about 6 months trying to figure out what it was called. So i finally figured it out and i went out and bought it. When i got home i put it in and watched the whole thing for the first time. It made me feel kind of mushy inside. Then i watched it over and over again. I must have watched it about 40 times that night. I think that it is the best movie i have ever watched in my life i havent yet found a better movie. I think that is the best movie in my whole house.
1,"Still a Favorite, After All These Years! The energy, music, dancing and scenery--not to mention the chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey--have made this movie one that still makes me laugh and makes me cry. It's a ""feel good"" movie to watch again and again."
1,"Worth waiting for The entire family Stewart loved "" Dirty Dancing"" when it hit the UK cinemas. Since those days, we've played the CDs incessantly and watched and watched the video, in widescreen. We couldn't wait to see the DVD version ( We pre-ordered for safety) and now we have it we can savour it all over again and again with a myriad of extras due to the capability of the new format, in perfect audio and video. My suggestion ? - BUY!!!"
1,"A great glimpse of the now played-out ""Titanic"" Syndrome I loved this movie. I saw this not too long ago. I had seen the movoie Titanic and thought ""poor boy meets rich girl, how cozy."" But now I see where the inspiration was! The movies music makes you want to dance, and the coreograpy makes you could dance like that with Patrick Swayze. I loved it and I give it 5 stars."
1,"Love my Dirty Dancing DVD This limited edition Dirty Dancing Keepsake DVD collection is a must for all fans of this movie. It has not only the movie but lots of additional footage, interviews, and even screen tests of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey."
1,"Who doesn't love this film? Great blooper in the movie. The scene where Cynthia Rhodes, is training Baby with Patrick Swayze in his room. Cynthia picks up the tone arm, and places it on the record, immediately puts the tone arm back onto its holder, and the song Hungry Eyes starts. The needle never touched the record!"
1,Great CD! The CD was in great shape and played well. I was very happy with it as well as the service I received. It arrived exactly when expected.
1,"Unbelivable! I have always loved this movie and when I decided to buy this DVD I didn't expect to get the movie, music videos, concert, how the movie was made and lots of other things! It is truly collector's edition.The movie itself is a beautiful love story with a girl and a boy which we can all be. I think it wakes the best in us.And one more important thing: after this movie you'll go to dancing lessons, definetly!"
1,Best DVD I have ever seen I have been a fan of Dirty dancing for a long time . I have it on VHS but I bought it on DVD because I wanted to feel the music. What I saw on the DVD is beyond my expectations. I don't mind borowing movies to my friends but this one is staying home. It is too good!!!The movie seemd like a totaly new movie. I love it!!!
1,Wow! What's not to love? I'm so glad to have one of my favorite movies in DVD. The anniversry edition is just a bonus.
1,Where is Patrick? I certainly enjoyed watching Dirty Dancing over. The special features are nice. Lots of memory. The only thing is there are no interview with Patrick Swayze...really strange...
1,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I always thought this was a lame movie, but I really love it now that I've seen it. Yes, it IS a chick-flick, so if you don't like those types of movies, don't buy it."
1,"Hopelessly Romantic Feel Good Movie A romantic novel with pictures. Its not a 'deep' movie, nor do I believe it was supposed to be. Its just a feel good movie for us hopeless romantics...much like 'Pretty Woman' was. I would love to see a director 'pair' Gray & Swayze together again...maybe a return visit to 'Kellermans' with the rest of the cast."
1,"Wonderful This is a movie that I have always wanted to see. Not only is the movie entertaining to watch, but it also has an excellent story line. I would highly recommend it."
1,movie I love watching Dirty Dancing. I loved Patrick Swayze in this movie and will miss him. My daughter and I love this movie.
1,"I have an OCD with this movie! Yes I am a psycho, and yes I love this movie! It is THE BEST thing since sliced bread...and pizza. It reminds me of the good ol' days when I looked Jennifer Grey. I miss those days. And for awhile I even looked Patrick Swayze. But now, I just look like Neil. Watch this movie because it's really good and you'll just want get up and D-A-N-C-E...dance!"
1,Excellent Children's Book This is a fun and educational book with great illustrations. A must-have for your child's library.
1,Sexy! I first heard of Jovan through a friend of mine who told me I had to get his album. I just purchased it a few days ago and it is already on the top of my list of favorites. It is a MASTERPIECE! The music is very classy and the words take you to a whole new level. His music is sexy and his writing is mature and thoughful. For Brian McKnight and Eric Benet fans: Watch out. There is a new treasure in Soul/R&B: JOVAN!

1,"You will like this CD too This CD was given to me as a present. I wasnt a fan before, but now I truly love his music. It is smooth, has a beat, expresses emotions once in awhile but is never depressing. In fact, it is such a feel good CD, I recommended it to friends. Dont think twice. Buy it."
1,"Buy THIS version (import) The difference is that there are 3 different songs: Track 6. pop ya collar; 16.TTP and 17. SeparatedThe US version has U R the one for track 15.The most important reason to buy this one is for the song ""separated"". One of Usher's best songs ever. You can't find this song on iTunes."
1,"Crystal Jordans Review My name is Crystal Jordan and I attend Albemarle Middle School(Home of the BULLDOGS).Well Usher I think that your albulm 8701 is off the chins.Eva since the song U Remind Me came out, I have really been felling that.If this is not to much to ask you,Would you come to my school in Albemarle to talk to the students about how drugs are very bad for your body.Well my words are getting shorso GOTS TO BOUNCE. HALLA.Love your #1 fan Crystal Jordan."
1,NICEEEEEEEEEEEE. I LOVE THIS CD AND ITS GREAT ITS OFF THE CHAIN. I LIKE THE WAY ALL HIS SONGS ARE DIFFERRNT AND HOW NONE OF THEM ARE THE SAME. I LIKE THAT. IF U LIKE USHER U'LL LIKE THIS CD. GREAT JOB.
1,"We LUV USHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! right now me and my friend r listening 2 the cd and it is the very best!!!!!!!All 15 songs r awesome!!!!!!! especially can u help me, my friend luvs twork it out and u-turn and u got it bad and. . .ALL OF THEM!!!!!!!Usher swears a little but dont most people?His songs r really great, they all hav great lyrics and r fun 2 dance 2!!! Especially the slow songs!!!!"
1,"This is the best cd I have ever bought! This is such a good cd, i couldn't stop listening to songs on it like: ""U Got It Bad"" and ""I Don't Know"". I like how Usher mixed in a lot of slow songs with fast ones. He did an OK job on ""My Way"", but there is no way he can top this cd.This is a definite buy for anyone who likes the songs ""U Remind Me"" and ""U Got It Bad"". Even if you don't, then you should still listen to this cd ALL THE WAY THROUGH a couple of times.If anybody, and i mean anybody, says that 8701 is not the best cd they have ever heard, than they can go to hell.BUY IT NOW!"
1,itz a very good album!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ushers best album ITS MUCH BETTER THEN CONFESSIONS!!!!!!!!!!!CUZ U HAVE 2 SKIP SO MANY TRACKS ON CONFESSIONZ.....GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!
1,"GREAT MEMORIES bEAUTIFUL FILM QUALITY FROM THE ""GOLDEN AGE OF HOLLYWOOD"" WELL WORTH THE TIME AND MONEY TO ENJOY."
1,"Amazing Collection! This is an amazing collection! I bought this set for the movies, and I am thrilled.The extra nice surprise- I was completely blown away by the huge amount of extras. Each dvd comes with loads of special features- commentaries, interviews, lots more (two pages of extras per film), and even old newsreel footage. I haven't even looked at the ""extra"" special features dvd that came with the set yet. It also came with a hardcover book with info about the films and the actors, and great images of behind the scenes and all of the movie posters. Additionally- there was a folder with many photographs (like large, high-quality postcards), which are a treasure in themselves.I am so glad I bought this set- what a bargain! My whole family loves it."
1,"Great read! I recently read this again. It's just as good a second time. Kaylin Neya is a complicated, interesting character in a well developed plot. The City is believable with its different races working together, most of the time. There is magic, but Kaylin doesn't really understand hers, nor anyone else's. Michelle West doesn't try to explain it all at once, which would bog the story down to a crawl. (Hear that, Stephen Lawhead?) the story draws you into her world and drives along at a fast clip. I love the book and am reading the second one in the series already!"
1,"A Very Fun Start to A New Series! I really enjoyed this book! At first, the dry narration - dry in humour, not in interest - was a bit off-putting. I think that this would not have been in the case if the book was written in first-person, rather than third, but as I became more accustomed to her style, I really loved it! And it's always so exciting to start a new series! In some ways, this book reminded me of what I remember from reading Maggie Furey's _Aurian_ a long time ago, and more recently, Maria V. Snyder's books. Either way, I am really enjoying this series and am quite excited to continue reading them!"
1,"Unbelievable Story I thought this was a wonderful book.The story was a great love story.The main character,Kyla,loved her late husband so deeply that she is not able to turn loose of him after he dies to make room for another love.It causes her more pain in the long run.Kyla is a young mother whoes Marine husband is killed the day after the couple's first child is born. She picks up the pieces of her life and trys to continue caring for herself and her son.Through a chain of events,Kyla meets the best friend of her deceased husband,Trevor. Trevor falls in love with Kyla the first time he sees her and pursues her effections. Trevor does not tell Kyla who he is for fear that she will reject him do to his connection to her late husband. When the truth comes out, it causes a big blowup between Kyla and Trevor. The end of the book is dynamic."
1,Another excellent novel What can I say more. I'm a dedicated SB reader. I love her novels. This is one of the best. Just great. Burcu Ergen
1,Osmonds Bio Bought for my mother. She has enjoyed it as well as the other gifts she received involving the Osmond family.
1,"Absolutely the best! Why do you think it won 5 Oscars, huh? Because, you had an excellent cast of two Americans and a couple of European imports, an intense director, incredible material to adapt, and a very good screenwriter known for hard-hitting cop movies. In the end, it walks for with Best Picture, Director (Friedkin), Actor (Hackman), Screenplay (Ernest Tidyman), and Film Editing. That is impressive, especially with such compition as ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and ""Nicholas and Alexandra."" This film is an absolute treasure -- one for your library collecton of Best Picture films (like I do at home)!"
1,"You can almost smell NYC! ""Hey, ya ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?"" Gotta love this film. Great acting, great NYC feel, great realism and fantastic villains. The hoodlums ain't bad either. Hackman is a revelation. You can see why he's still in such demand as an actor. Don't miss this one."
1,"THE BEST CRIME MOVIE EVER MADE! French Connection is a exciting action/crime film starring Gene Hackman as Popeye Dole, a N.Y. Narcotics Cop who is investigating the recent flow of herion coming into N.Y. He and his partner (Roy Shrieder) get into the absorbing process of phone tapping, following suspects, and stakeouts. A real good crime movie from director William Friedkin. One of the best films ever made, also has the most exciting chase scene in history. A winner!!"
1,"Covers Everything This book is excellent for the beginner, intermediate and advanced art enthusiast. It crosses over all cultures and eras and connects them all using unique and interesting themes. It also covers the basic design elements and visual fundamentals and can be used again and again for any art class: drawing, painting, sculpture, art appreciation."
1,"Thorough and enjoyable One of the best art history guides I've read. Well illustrated, organized and extremely diverse as far as media, styles, and cultures. Fine for beginners, or for people who already know a fair amount about art and artists."
1,"I've always loved this movie! I've loved this movie since the first time I seen it, the quality and sound is just like being back in the theater."
1,"Two Can Play That Game I liked this Film~ I thought it was full of fun and I found myself very amused with this Woman vs.Man thinking! I had to laugh during some of the 10 step's in this film~ Why? Because some of it I've played the Game that way myself~ and it worked, well to a degree~If you are looking for a ""Fun Film""~ buy this one ~ The whole Cast was nothing but perfection~ It was IMO a good Film~Buy it yourself and ""Enjoy""~"
1,Always Have Popsicles This is a great gift for new grandparents. I give friends that are having their first grandchild one. They seem to enjoy it. It has cute things to do with kids.
1,"Great kit for the inquisitive kid!! The Scientific Explorer's Ultimate Crystal Growining Science KitScientific Explorer's Ultimate Crystal Growing Science Kitis a great kit for variety and interaction. I got this for my 8 year old grandson who is a real science 'explorer' and he just loved it. He was into the kit and growing crystals before you could say Jack Robinson. (Okay, that's an old saying!) He loved that there were so many to grow and all the varieties kept him interested. He is a real fan of science experiments and this kit just kept him involved and enthused through all of the kinds of crystals he was growing. It is a real value for the price and I know that any child interested in science will like it."
1,Growing crystals Enjoyed seeing actual crystals grow and the experiments were detailed correctly and tried Parental guidance is necessary for through out these experiments you will need to boil water My daughter used project of blue sapphire sparkled crystals and was able to use scientific method to presentation

1,"How did I miss this? I love this cookbook. Miyoko has so many interesting and innovative ideas on how to prepare meals. I live in the UK and all the ingredients she lists are readily available to me. I bought the her Artisian Cheese cookbook, then watched some online videos of her and after that I was hooked and got this book. I can't wait to make some of these recipes."
1,"Sebastian Knight was pretty bright A book like this is so full of gems that for all intents and purposes it is without flaw. Understanding Sebastian Knight pretty much means understanding how literary genius works. The book is loaded with humour that will be above the head of most err stupid people. I saw Nabokov sitting and smiling at me at times as I read. The world is full of Dr. Goodmann's - that is for sure. Best to take a long time and read this book slowly, out loud of course, doesn't that go without saying?"
1,"Dragonheart What's not to like about these movies. My kids still love them, even as teenagers. They like to watch them over and over."
1,Aweee! Drake is so cute! ^_^ I loved this movie! If you liked the first one you definately have to see this one. Its totally different but practically as good as the first ^_^ Dragonheart and Dragonheart: a New Begining are my two fave movies! As you can see I am a dragonluver ^_~ Hey I hope this movie is open for sequels :P
1,:) It works very good with other products I am unsure how well it works by itself but for curly hair it seems to help along with other hair products. It will have your curls under control! :D I used it today and plopped my hair and my curls were shiny and soft and tight. I used with it Dr. Bronner's hair rinse and hair creme. :)
1,Its reputation as one of the best scifi stories is not overrated Herbert's Dune series is a life's work that made the world of literature better. It introduced characters and circumstances that carved out a place for world building and space travel in literature that few other stories ever accomplished.
1,"If you want to read only one SF-Fantasy book in your life... I have read this book 20-25 times, and every time I read it I get something new from it. It's complex themes blend togather perfectly with the books main plot. I particularly loved the philosophy and the treatment of characters and delicate social issues like religon, sexuality and politics. This is a must read for any one, if u read only one SF in your lfie, make sure it is Dune. The only regret that you will have is that the book is only 400 pages."
1,"The best book ever written I only read Dune this year, but I ended up reading it two timesin a row. This is, by far, the best book ever written in humanhistory. I've made Dune my Holy Book. I've never seen /anything/ as richly detailed in politics, religion, and description as Dune."
1,"This book was great!! I read Dune when I was in middle school. My dad suggested it. I loved it!! In some points, it was hard to understand, and in others, it almost scaired me, because of the amount of suspence. Frank Herbert had a very complex imagination while writing Dune. There are only two kinds of people, I believe, that could write a book as interesting as Dune. Either a genious or a lunitic. and I don't believe Frank Herbert to be a lunatic!"
1,The all time classic Sci-Fi Novel This is a must have. I'd even say one of the best novels ever written. The idea behind the entire Dune Universe is tremendously well worked out. Frank Herbert's craftmanship is to be studied for ages if you ask me. Many popular sci-fi and fantasy novels haven't got more to tell than the neverending fight between good and evil. The good is white and the bad is black - how very boring. Frank Herbert paints us a universe that is so detailed in both characterization and storyline that it truely becomes real. Marvellous!!!
1,"Price? Why is this e-book $16 and the actual book can be picked up for $3 at betterworldbooks.com? This is nothing short of ridiculous price gouging. Shame, this is the reason why most people haven't made the switch from paper and ink to kindle.."
1,"Nicely Done I enjoyed this book to be sure, and although it was quite lengthy, I found myself unable to part with it easily. I finished it within a week simply because the story was so gripping. I'm not sure how Herbert manages it, but it seems that he can endlessly descibe something yet never bore someone. Highly Recommended."
1,"this is the book I'll take to the desert island!!! Well, this is simply the best book I've read EVER, starting the best SF series ever written by the human being. The plot is awesome, the scenery is witty, the writing is simply splendid... If you'll ever plan to go to the desert island, this is the definite no. 1 choice."
1,"More then FINE It is SHEDERVAU I am Russian man And Live in Kazachstan. I ret DUne approx 4 yeras ago And I fallen love in this book I not ret only last book about DUNE By Russian it called Brotherhood of Dune When I ret Children of Dune I begin to search film by D. Lynch ""Dune"" When i did it I saw this one 20 times in same day!!!!"
1,"!!!The God of good books!!! GREAT BOOK. Love the way Herbert has made up a ""new"" religion, based on Islam and Christianety...It gives the reader a perfect picture into a futur, where humans relly more on other people, then robots. Also the part about ""making a perfect humaniod"" is great."
1,"Dune - Spice of the Day Probably the best of his works, Frank Herbert's DUNE is a masterpiece by a master of authors. The story line is rich, with realistic characters portraying people as they really are and not loaded with sugarcoated individuals that survive the entire book and the next four in the series. It begins with Paul Atreides being brought to the desert planet Arrakis, the sole producer of spice, by his father the Duke Leto Atreides. Ambushed in a strange world with his father killed, Paul is taken in by the desert Fremen to become the Kwizatz Haderach... This book can only be compared to Herbert's The Godmakers, another one of Herbert's greatest works. I am also a fan of John Robert Reule (J.R.R.) Tolkien, Tom Clancy, and Clive Cussler; Herbert is one of my favorite authors among the few whose books I look for."
1,"Awesome Is this book great, or what? But seriously, it is a rare insight into the bitter rewards of power, along with all the other levels this book has to offer. Religeon; how much of this is created, & how much is self-creating. Economics; Muad'Dib - the supreme energy eater. Politics: Bene Tlalaxu, Bene Gesserit, House Atredies, The House of Ix, The Fremen, The Guild, oh yeah. Finally, this concludes the story of Paul Atredies (The Preacher is another story...) who sought to make his future, only to find his future made him."
1,"it's a godly work! i've read the negative reviews and could not believe my eyes! some people compared this series to the LOTR! first LOTR is not SCIENCE FICTION you idiots! it's FANTASY at it's best!!second i hate people who write a review without even reading the whole book! i've read all six of the original dune novels and the ones frank herbert's son wrote and i think all 11 books are great, especially the original novels..this series is not for novice sci-fi readers! so if you are new to this genre stay away from these books or if you don't like them keep your thoughts for yourself!"
1,"It's Dune...Top Notch I bought this for Kindle, so I have yet been able to recognize the benefit or difference of this version (40th Anniversary) vs. previous versions. As for the book itself, it had been a while since I had read it. Again, Frank Herbert is absolutely amazing in creating the Dune universe...many levels superior to the ""clever"" sci-fi"" prevalent today. My favorite aspect of the Dune series is the contemplation of humans moving toward the Omega Moment, or in other words the process by which humans could evolve in virtual gods. This is a topic that Herbert covered in other non-Dune books that he wrote as well. It is a topic that is more and more discussed even by serious scientists and philosophers in light of discoveries of the epigenome among the fundamental nature of the universe. Herbert was way ahead of his time."
1,"THIS is the masterpiece of Science-Fiction I'am a science-fiction fan and I have read lots of very good books, but Dune is by far the best. I have never read such a good book. It has everything : Action, philosophy, psychology, everything is perfect. If I had to choose through my (big) collection of SF books, I would take this one without any hesitation. Really, there is no word to describe how fantastic it is."
1,"""Dune""amic! Thanks to this book, I have a hard time picking a favorite story. I no longer want to be a jedi, but a Fremen leader! Such a great story, that you will keep it in the front of your library so you can read it again, and again"
1,"The Supreme Science Fiction Story Dune is the best hard science fiction novel that I ever read. Frank Herbert's deep understanding of issues range from economics all the way to desert tundra. The center plot of Paul of Atrides measures easily with the epic sagas of antiquity. Majestic heroes, horrendous villains, an exotic environment, terrible wars, court backstabbing, messianic thrills, WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK?I read it back in College, and after countless SCFI stories this is easily the best one."
1,"Bought it! Okay now I have all of the Dune series from way back-but, I did go an purchase the new hardcovers with Brian Herbert's Introductions-They are so wonderful to read! The book is exquisite."
1,"a staggering creation of an entire cosmic culture This is the original, astonishingly intricate construction of a complete universe, painting a bright allegory of good and evil;giving breath to a wealth of characters that incorporate all the qualities of epic figures ranging from Moses on the mountain to Lucifer after his plunge."
1,Dune The best SF book ever written and thats saying something as I have been reading and collecting SF books for over 50 years... I just wish that his son Biran was half the writter that Frank was... Anyway I love the entire series.
1,"Timeless masterpiece Dune is without a doubt one of the best novels ever to be written. It takes the reader far off into the future where space travel is made possible by a substance called the spice melange, only available from a single planet in the known universe, planet Arrakis, also known as Dune.Long before Dune there was a Butlerian Jihad when artifficial intelligence threatened to end human life. Ever since, computers have been banned, high technology being replaced by other means, specially trained humans acting as computational minds.Intriguing and original concepts. Frank Herbert writes about many different aspects thus painting a comprehensive and complete picture of his vision.A must read not only for the sci-fi fan."
1,"BEST SCI-FI BOOK EVER! Well if not book definately series. This is an addictive series. a must for anyone who calls themselves a sci fi fan, and anyone who doesn't! This was very real and detailed. Frank Herbert really understands human nature. The only problem is that there are no sentient species. Odds are there would be at least one in the universe. Otherwise great book."
1,Perfect! Exellent product! It's perfect conditions and is that I've was searching for.. =) I'm really very happy whit this book! Here in my country I can't find it..Exellent product! It's perfect conditions and is that I've was searching for.. =) I'm really very happy whit this book! Here in my country I can't find it..
1,"A masterpiece This, the first installment of the best selling Dune series. Is, and will always be, a true masterpiece. The complex characters and locations make the reader captivated. This book is a must read."
1,"This masterpiece is one incredible spiritual trip Well,what can i say that hasn't been said already this is as i said is one incredible spiritual adveture for the your mind,one big spiritualistic trip on a foreign desert world. truly a classic masterpiece."
1,"Ain't Dune that good? I was introduced to ""The Book"" ( Frank Herbert's Dune)by a close friend. He told me that once you read Dune your life will never be the same. I thought ""Hell! never liked SF"". But in respect for his opinion, i decided to read it anyway. In my way back home one question was disturbing my brain. ""- Ain't Dune That good?"". Well I'll tell you all that i ""devoured"" Dune in about 48 hours. Once you start to read it you can't stop before you finish it. It is so amazing. What kind of mind could develop such a masterpice? Frank Herbert (God bless his soul!!) was a genious. He created the ""Bible of Science Fiction"". Listen to my words as i say ""- Buy it now. You won't be disapointed.""""Ain't Dune that good?"" ""F_ _ K. I'm preety sure of it."""
1,Best Sci-Fi Novel I've Ever Read I've been enchanted with this novel ever since I read it as a child. A must read.
1,"Dune-- The Greatest Sci-Fi Series ever written! I picked up Dune, not even being a fan of Sci-Fi literature; yet when I was finished, I rushed to the book store and bought all 5 of it's sequels!Frank Herbert is an equisitly talented writer, from whos style and extensive research came a novel that can only be described as magical.Dune, is the story of a young boy with extraordinary powers, who rises to power, on the desert planet known as Arrakis.Filled with every kind of challange and adventure, from gigantic sand worms, to gripping battles, and even sweet love ""affairs""; Dune is the most exciting series I've ever read.My only regret, is that I don't have a talent with words worthy of this book's greatness."
1,"Science Fiction masterpiece of the Millenium This is by far the most absorbing and entertaining science fiction book I have ever read. It must be read, again and again. If you've seen the film, read the book!!"
1,"A Childhood Treasure it is written in the apocryphal new testament, within the pages of the Apocalypse of Baruch...""around the sun flies a phoenix, the phoenix excretes a worm and the worm excretes cinamon. this is eaten by the kings and princes of the earth.""thats all ive got to say... this man (Frank Herbert) was certainly well read.love, Snow-Flake. xxx*******ps. since writing this article it has come to my attention that the 'apocalypse' of Baruch has been removed from professor eliotts current edition of the new testament aprocrypha... so if you want to read the words i quote above for yourself you will need to aquire a first edition hard back. very expensive im afraid. tc.*******"
1,"addictive my favorite story besides to ""kill a mockingbird"". two and three are excellent as well, didnt like fourth book and stoped there"
1,"Paul Deconstructed I'm not sure why Dune Messiah gets the bad rap apart from Herbert's books... I can only think that the fall of the ""Great Hero"" is a disappointment to some? But then, this is Paul Deconstructed. And if you are a bit annoyed with Paul Atriedes that he became bitter and turned his back on his empire, his people and his children then I'm afraid you've fallen into Frank Herbert's trap... He warned you; Don't worship this guy. Addendum: One of my favorite scenes out of this book is when one of Paul's former Fedykin encounters a true sea (while on Jihad) for the first time. It illustrates the true impact the Fremen deification of Paul has really had on the culture. Heart wrenching."
1,"My favorite book ever I was never a big sci-fi guy, but Dune blew me away. The story is great-- if you're not into sci-fi don't worry-- this book is a classic revenge story that happens to be set in the future. There are no robots or cliche star trek moments here. Super original, super great, a super book,My favorite ever.If you die without reading this book you are making a colossal mistake."
1,"A Masterpiece The best way I can describe Dune is that it takes the political and strategical elements of the latest books in the Ender series (Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets) and takes them even further in depth, all the while being supported by an incredible plot. The emphasis put on the importance of every little action affecting the overall outcome helps to paint a beautiful and intricate picture for the reader. The depth of this world is amazing, Herbert creates an entire alien culture better than any I have ever found. He has even made an entire ecosystem with everything having a purpose and explanation. This novel does not disappoint in the least and I recommend it to any sci-fi book reader."
1,"great read, geniously written. the book may have a high reading level and fairly difficult to understand at times, but if you stick with it I garuntee you will like this book."
1,"Frightening and Powerful. Frank Herbert's masterpiece Dune, is definitely one of The Greats in science fiction. The power and the horror of religious fervor on a dead planet where the minds of the people are terrifyingly fatalistic is captured in surreal and mesmerizing clarity. Where water is so scarce, the people dehydrate their dead for their water, and death is an oh so real component of everyday life, you can feel how the barren landscape imprints itself in the minds of the characters, as messiahnic insanity devours an entire world in its jaws."
1,"one of the best books-period! If you are a fan of sci-fi, or even if you're not, this is truly one of the greatest books ever. Frank Herbert creates a fantastic world filled with amazing creatures like the sand worms, and unforgetable characters, such as Lady Jessica and Pual Maud'dib Atriedes.In the story there is one main plot, yet there are also sub plots, like Paul becoming the kwisatz haderach--the male Bene Geserit. I can't really put this book into words--you just have to read it for yourself. And if you have trouble understanding this beautiful and complex Dune universe, there is also the handy glossary in the back to help you understand the words. But don't just sit there reading this review--read Dune!"
1,"Landmark Dune is a timeless book. The writing style is superior to many novels, even after 35 years. I admit that I tried reading Dune and then quit(I was in the 7th grade). But after I saw the movie I wanted to read the book. Was I ever glad that I did! Buy this book. Oh, the sequels. People have mixed feelings about the sequels, so I recommend that you read them at your local library before deciding to buy them. P.S. This book is far better than anything Heinlein ever wrote."
1,"I really adore this book I'm absolutely satisfied of this book. It contains not only scince-fiction themesbut also problems of all world like the resonibility of leaders, the fanatism, political methods. It also represents what will happen if there's such melange addiction in the world. Ecologycal problems of Dune shows exactly how we can exhaust the resources of our planet. At last the stoy of persons as Lito, Paul, Jesika are told with great tallent."
1,"And it'll keep getting better... Dune Messiah was a fantastic read. Chronicling Paul's life as messiah on Arrakis, and Paul's inability (read as unwillingness) to accept his own Golden Path. Paul rules Dune and Spice production as only an Atreides could do...This book foreshadows so many of the wonderful happenings in future books, albeit it stands as a novel of it's own merit and splendor.If you liked the first novel, you'll love this short gem in Herbert's universe."
1,"A Sci-fi Masterpiece I found this book to be extremely intriguing. I had never bought science fiction and had never really cared for it. Frank Herbert did an excellent job of entrancing me into his work. This book is fast paced and keeps the readers attention well. Once started on this awesome adventure, Herbert takes the reader through politics, scandal, betrayal, religion, addiction, love, revenge, and of course the desert. The ending leaves you hanging and forces you to read the next one. This book is well worth the read a couple of times."
1,"Dune: A Classic that Stands the Test of Time. The making of a man and the future of a planet are intertwined in this Science Fiction classic. Paul Atreides is the heir to his Father's Dukedom on th Planet Arrakis. The planet is the key to intergalatic commerece because of its large supply of spice. As Paul completes the rite of passage from child to man a new generation make their mark and it all begins in Dune.Rarely, does a story capture me from the beginning like Herbert does here. The characters leave an indelible mark on the reader and move the story at a brisk pace. This is not an average sci-fi story. It has many levels of religious, political and ecological overtones that still hold significant meaning in today' world. I highly reccomend this brilliant Hugo and Nebula Award winning novel."
1,Nothing compares to it... Dune is by far the best book I have ever read. I can't recommend it highly enough. I have never found myself so immersed in a fictional world. Words can't describe the beauty of it. Reading Dune is one of the few things I still vividly remember from my childhood...the experience was that intense.
1,"A Sci-fi Bible I first read Dune when I was 12 and I make sure to re-read it at least once a year. This book, and the five that follow it, will blow you away. Following a very medieval/feudal system of politics, set over 8,000 years in the future, this is a book of intrigue, war, and a messiah, all rolled into one. The two main houses, the Harkonnens and the Atreides, are enemies and when House Atreides is given control of the planet Dune, where the mind-expanding spice is mined, all hell breaks loose. The Harkonnens, backed by the Emperor, seek to destroy House Atreides, little knowing that the Atreides heir is the new Messiah.This book will change your way of thinking in regards to science fiction and once you read Dune, you will want more."
1,"A remarkable and intriguing work Herbert, in a way that so few else have, has crafted a new world full of life and detail. mMore than just a work of science fistion, Dune articulates several resonating stories of humanity intertwined in a single (though complex) plot. The writting is superb and provides a beautiful portrait of Dune and it's characters. Everyone should at least try to read this book, though I understand it may not be for everyone given it's themes and subject matter."
1,"Well worth the time For one reason or another, I put off reading this ""classic"" for years. What can I say? If you haven't read it... read it. It's wonderful storytelling. The tale incorporates recognizable political and religious references without being trapped in specifics of previous or current historical events. A grand tour indeed."
1,"Best sci-fi novel ever written. Demands multiple readings. This is one of perhaps 8 books that I would give a 10 toand would be my unhesitating answer to the question, ""Whatis the best sci-fi novel of all time?""Herbert has achieved what very very few sci-fi writers do:he has created a complex and utterly believable ""universe""that is almost wholly alien to our own. Yet despite thisyawning gulf, Herbert spells nothing out; we learn about theuniverse by seeing it through the eyes of theextraordinarily compelling characters who inhabit it.This is not an easy read, and it takes more than a singlereading to really appreciate it. NB: do NOT make any assumptions based on the movie. It simplydoesn't compare."
1,test of time consider how long ago this book was written...and yet it still stands as a sci-fi classic. The movie was a poor attempt to capture the developed characters...Paul...follow his evolving life in the follow-on books..an innocent evolved into a god...just good old fashion reading!!!
1,Alternative Reality This is The MASTERPIECE of Sci-fi.Its greatness is the ability of F.Herbert to create a real world with a realistic culture in such a way that the reader enters so deeply in this alternative reality that begins to think like a fremen would do and he can't look at the sand on the beach without thinking that it would be better to walk in a non-ritmic way because the worm can hear you.So you enter into a world you'll never forget and the words that the Bene-Gesserit say to fight the fear will never let you alone
1,"Excellent cell phone This cell phone is for people who want an updated phone in mobile technology, and of course to talk and call people. The features are great, and this sleek cell phone will fit almost everywhere. Color screen and a voice recorder, you'll find something that you'll like!"
1,Warm and self sacrificing Jane and Tom meet fall in love and there are many obstacles to overcome. Different ending bittersweet. Loved it. Will not tell all as it will ruin the movie.
1,"Jane at her finest This movie has blown both my wife and I away. It is every bit as good as Keira Knightley's Pride and Prejudice, Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility and the list could go on. This totally fictional tale of Jane Austen's life is a pure work of art. The language is spot on, the accents are spot on and above all they couldn't have found a better Jane Austen than the performance of Anne Hathaway. You see parts of all of her books incorporated into this story of a brief and emotionally moving part of her life. Bravo!If you like Jane Austen, this is a must see!"
1,"A well done Classic An interesting take on Jane Austen's life which sheds light on some of the circumstances and characters that served as an inspiration for the creation of her own literary universe.On the technical side, good image quality with a nice film-looking video, great contrast and color balance.Superb audio: -English uncompressed 5.1 @24 bits-English and Latin American Spanish 5.1 Dolby DigitalSeveral subtitle tracks:-English SDH, French, and Latin American SpanishIf you like period Drama this is a flick not to miss."
1,Becoming Jane This was a delightful movie. It showed the ups and downs of young love and ultimately making tough decisions regarding one's future.
1,Great movie for my daughter Bought this for my daughter. This is a good movie if you like classic books made into movies or movies made about those authors.Also good if you're a girl.
1,"Wonderful Being a Jane Austen fan, I knew right away that I would love this movie! Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy are two of my favorite actors and they did a great job."
1,GREAT MOVIE WHAT A DELIGHT TO WATCH!AND THE PERIOD SETTING AND COLOR AND PRODUCTION WERE WONDERFUL! LOVED IT!
1,Beautifully done This is such a good movie and to actually get it on blu ray is even better. Blu ray quality makes even romantic movies look crisp and beautiful.
1,Jumanji This has always been a family favorite! I purchased this movie for my son as a birthday gift and he was thrilled. AWESOME!
1,"A Wild Ride! Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, and Kirsten Dunst star in this phenomenal adaptation of the award-winning childrens book."
1,"love it love the movie and had to own it, delivered quickly, reasonable price, enjoyed ever second watching at my leasure, you will enjoy it too."
1,Jumanji DVD Combo Jumanji is a great movie for all ages. The DVD Combo pack is an exceptional value. Especially for those of us who do not have a Blue Ray player yet. Keep up the good work Amazon.
1,Great movie I enjoyed this movie when it came out years ago and I love it in Blu-ray! The picture is crisp and the sound is perfect! The color is great and the special effects make me laugh. A wonderful experience.
1,fun movie We have had the dvd of this movie since it first came out. It's amazing the improvement in the clarity. The movie holds up over time. It's just a good movie.
1,"A suspenseful look at tragedy Narrated by the author, The Journals Of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation Of The Kingdom Hospital Incident is the true story of a female spiritualist. Drawn to a Maine hospital built upon a site where, in 1869, a textile mill burned down killing dozens of workers including child laborers, Eleanor Druse pretended to be ill in order to search for the ghost of a young girl and root out the presence of an ancient evil. A suspenseful look at tragedy and how its negative ripples can carry over space and time, The Journals Of Eleanor Druse is literally haunting to listen to and highly recommended. Four 1 1/2 hour audio cassettes."
1,"GENIUS BRILLIANCE! This is a very soft, beautiful album. I put it in my computer and fall asleep nearby... it's undescribeable. Not much like their past cds, this is late-night perfection, inbetween talkshows and driving through dark cities."
1,"Nice Valentine gift! Bought this as a Valentine gift for my Secret Sister in church. She will love it! The price was great, brand new item, fast shipping."
1,"Humanism for the Faithful This sympathetic portrayal of aristocrats, peasants, conservatives, progressives, radicals, nationalists, internationalists, romantics, and even nihilists is ultimately a work of great humanism in its best (and really its only) sense of men made in the image of God. Turgenev captures the vanity of youth, but considerately and without spite. It's an excellent book heartily recommended, even though he goes a little too easy on the progressives, radicals, internationalists and nihilists."
1,"ALL the House Beautiful books are a great resource!! I own most of the House Beautiful books and I just love them!! This one has so many great ideas for people just moving into a new home and ready to design their own space, or for those just wanting to add to their already stylish surroundings. I have clips marking pages throughout all my books and the clips come off and change pages as time passes. It's amazing that I keep finding new ideas, every time I look at this book! I highly recommend these books to a novice, an expert, or anyone in between for decorating inspiration. Have fun!!"
1,"Great CD! This is a great CD! I love Matthew West's music! If you enjoy any of his other cd's, than you'll love this one! The price is also great! Overall I thnk that this is one of his best cd's."
1,"practical qnd classroom friendly This book is a wonderful resource book for any Language Arts teacher. The key to successfully using it is to find out what the child needs to learn to do to become a better reader. Then Mrs. Beers has listed what to do, and even shows how it has worked with real students. I know the activities could be used with first graders and on up. I taught Reading Recovery for ten years and have studied struggling readers for forty years, and I know these resources will work. I also like the authors she used to gather her research. She didn't just research through books, but also practiced these herself. Mrs. Beers has included places for busy teachers to go easily to find the materials to use. All Language Arts teachers shoud use this book."
1,Great Fit...Great Value...Great Shirt Bought 3 for myself they were wonderful. Came back for 4 more for gifts. Spent 9.99......people think I spent 30.00-40.00.
1,"An excelent book on physics An excellent book about physics, its history and its philosophy. The concepts are well explained, discussed, compared in a conversational and rigorous style. And done with the contribution of Einstein.With this book you will understand what physics really is; what is behind the science undertaking; what is science after all. A must book to serious interested readers"
1,A very good book. This is a really good book which clearly explains the evolution of physics from Newtons laws to Quantum mechanics in a simple and lucid language.Einstein was not only a genuis mathematician and physicist but also a great author and story-teller and no one else could have told the story of evoultion of physics better than EinsteinA book that should be in every phisicists library
1,"FAST shipping! Good price - got here in GREAT time, even with super saver shipping... The movie is hysterical and timeless."
1,"great i used to watch this movie all the time when i was growing up. since i grew up in germany, it took me a bit to find out the original title of it. my husband finally bought it for me for christmas. i already watched it twice. i love it, it is so funny. the quality of the dvd is great. highly recommend this"
1,A Must Have Movie! I was very pleased with this DVD. It's an excellent addition to any satire/mystery lover's collection. Hilarious dialogue and outstanding actors throughout the film.
1,personal top #10 If you haven't had the chance to see it then trust me and please buy it! Laughs are assured!!
1,"Murder by Death - DVD Wow, love this movie! What a great spoof on all the different 'who done it' movies and characters!"
1,"Still a great film Murder by Death has been seen by millions of renters since Blockbuster has been around, and just recently (the past couple of years) they have sold their stock off. Fortunately though the DVD transfer of the original is great, and the movie holds up quite well. If you have found memories of the movie, or simply enjoy whodunits of the past century, buy this film."
1,"Happy with what I got! I'd just like to say that I was very pleased with my order, it was in good condition (new as stated) and was glad that it came quicker than the estimated time arrival. Thank you! I used to see this movie with my little brother when we were younger and was surpised it was on DVD, it took me back in time.-Maria-"
1,4 great moves...ONE GREAT PRICE! I originally was looking for just beerfest (because it is the best of the 4) but when I happend upon this I knew it was a far better option than beerfest alone! These are all great comedies!
1,excellent I just watched this for the first time last night and I am glad I bought it. I will watch it again and again. Excellent movie.Can't wait for the second one
1,"Great movie This movie has everything..great star, great villain, great story and wonderful special effects. I loved it!!! Saw it twice."
1,"Easily The Best FIlm of The Last 50 years Coppola. Scorcese. Spielberg. Kubric.Decades upon decades of cinematic evolution have left the movie going public with...Vin Diesal!xXx not only lived up to my expectation, but surpassed them tenfold. I saw the movie because i had this feeling it was going to be terrible. Not only was it terrible, but far worse than I ever expected.So why five stars? Well it was entertaining to see the current state of what people like me call ""mainstream garbage"". I laughed pretty hard on more than one occassion. Also, to people that don't know any better, this really is a five star film. But who am I to disagree? Vin is clearly the best thing that has happened to the matinee since Marlon Brando."
1,AWESOME! Wow! This movie is a must see for every action fan. the acting is really good and there is non-stop action. If you are a Vin Diesil fan watch this!! It is one of his best movies yet. If you liked this you would also like one of vin diesil's other movies called Pitch Black. This is a must see for everyone. Don't miss out on it!
1,"Vin Diesel & Asia Argento (beautiful woman), X is hit! i have to say that the motion picture has an interesting plot. Xander Cage (Diesel) goes up against a russian mob that goes by the name of ""anarchy 99"" and Xander along with Russian CIA Agent Yelena (Asia Argento)have to stop this evil gang of men who want tyranny and chaos in all the world, and who want to destroy Prague Czechoslovakia.the movie has action, great acting by Vin Diesel Asia Argento Samuel Jackson and other actors. the scenes are very realistic, and one who sees this movie will see the nice city of Prague.there is nothing cheezy about this film, one has to...see it to enjoy the film and ignore the critics."
1,XXX I'm a huge Vin Diesel fan. So i think it's amazing that he is in another film and i can't wait to see it!!!
1,"Talented.....Athletic......and hot! These are just a few of the words that describe Xander ""XxX"" Cage (aka Vin Diesel). The movie was great, the graphics were off the hook....The sound track was bangin' and the sequal, I hope, will include him and the rest of the cast members."
1,"NEW DEFINITION OF MAN-POWER!!! ...rob cohen profed already,to make FAST movies.vin diesel pitched us to black and this right fast&furiously;!!now what do you expect XXX will do???yes-it will blast us away.no more questions about vin diesel,he`s not just acting,he display emotions for everyone!join XXX - so i will do... thx ;-)"
1,"You want action? Get it here! What more is there to say about this fantastic Van Diesel flick? I actually bought it for my son a few weeks ago, he saw it first on Netflix and as he likes to collect the DVDs of his favorite shows, I figured I'd give him one more to add to it. He watched it at least 4 times since and just can't seem to get enough of it. The price on Amazon was excellent and certainly worth buying. No waiting around for Netflix to come in and, as it sometimes happens, not come in at all when you're in the mood for watching as certain show. BTW - I also love the movie and am glad I bought it!"
1,"ECommerce needs a Real Options investment approach! Many investments in ECommerce have been postponed because management required facts about the future - which do not exist - to fit into their ROI models and mindsets. Well the Real-Options approach helps managers create business cases using the market which will validate action. We have been postponing the future, particularly in ECommerce investments for too long and this is a very important new tool in the arsenal for action! So now there will be few excuses to postpone investments today which create options for tomorrow. If you don't sow you can't expect to reap the harvest."

1,"wonderful! My 2 year old son is so in love with his ""puppy"" he misses it when it gets washed so I had to order replacements in case he gets lost!"
1,"A life changing read This novel works on layers that other novels don't even know exist. Faulkner blew it off, but I suspect few outside the university read Faulkner whereas this book, rich, powerful evocative and beautiful, is what reading is for. It changed my life; it made me realize that self is not ""found"" but created. No higher praise can I offer."
1,"Classic of Southern Genre Will long stand as a classic of the ""good ole' boy"" south. From asphalt politics to segregation, a rich, deep view of the hey-days of the old south"
1,"Above mere books as olympians are above mere athletes One feels after reading this book like one has lived an entire extra lifetime and now must get back to one's own life, though wiser and a little more world weary. Somehow it feels out of place to list this among other ""books"", like it's been misclassified or misslabled. This isn't a book, it's rare genius hitting on all cylinders -- a spark from the shattered vessel of the deeper truths of life."
1,"Remarkable and breathtaking Warren's novel -- one of the best American novels ever written, I believe -- is beautiful and evocative, but it is only tangentially about politics and Willie Stark. It is instead primarily concerned with history; specifically, the New South and the Old South, one generation versus another, backwoods Jeffersonian agrarianism versus modern political ambition. Willie Stark is certainly an important character; it is with him, after all, that the novel reaches its violent climax. But Jack Burden, tortured former graduate student, keen observer of everyday life, is the true focus of the novel; through the course of the book, we see the world through him, and come away shaking with revelation and uncertainty."
1,"Song of South I've read this book many times. It is bittersweet meditation on human weakness, loss, and learning the way of the world. The depth of this book is such that different themes resonate at different points of your life, like a dark gem. Penn Warren's evocation of the changeful, aching, moments of life is nothing short of masterful."
1,"stick with it; it's worth it I definitely had my doubts while I was reading it, but now in reflection this is probably one of my three favorite novels. If you can withstand the slow first chapter, keep reading - the final chapter is nearly impossible to put down and is undoubtedly one of the most captivating and best-written chapters in American literature. DON'T read this book to learn about the political rise and fall of Willie Stark. Most reviews say that the book is about him, when the book is really about Jack Burden, the narrator. Warren at times is really amazing; his prose in countless paragraphs is as good as or better than any 20th century American novelist. The book is long, and often times slow, but it is a priceless piece of fiction, and I think it would be difficult to find an educated reader who would be disappointed in the end."
1,"The best ""serious"" novel I have read. The descriptive passages in this text are able to take me, an Australian of this era, into the lives homes and meeting places of people of a different era and nationality.The characterisation weaves through the narrative to provide a consistency unparalled in other writings.The writer cleverly builds to the climatic and devastating discovery by the anti hero (Jack Burden) that nothing is safe (or sacred) from corruption - even his boyhead love."
1,"Arguably the great American novel There never has been and never again will be a book like ATKM. It is, arguably, THE great American novel. Unfortunately, some view this work as a retelling of the Huey Long story but, of course, it is far more than that, for in Willie Stark, Warren has created a character both more complex and more sympathetic than Long. How greatful we all should be that Warren abandoned his play, Proud Flesh, and chose the novel format instead. I doubt the play, if produced, would ever have been successfully transformed into a novel, while the novel has generated numerous plays and a successful screenplay. With the exception of the Cass Mastern episode, which tends to drag, this work is up there with the very greatest fiction in the English language."
1,"A must read As a visitor living here for a few years I have decided to read the cream of American Fiction.I must say in this book I struck gold.The writer seemed to have the skill to combine a hugely compelling plot,elaborate character development and prose which at times was poetic.The novel is full of timeles themes such as the greed and corruption of the body politic,sowing what one will reap and the importance of friends and roots,it is all there.This novel for me was a great discovery and I was in awe from start to finish.This is compelling reading and stands head and shoulders above some of the modern writing we are getting today.I would recommend this book to anyone.......it is a must read."
1,No exercise during this reading time. Outstanding writing..........unbelievable. Could not quit reading it. Best book I have ever read.......and I have read thousands of books.
1,"The title is right. So is the premise. Plain old excellent. The authors opening sentence to the introduction: ""Those who seek miracles or panaceas to replace work should stop here.""; states the premise of this book clearly and without embellishment. Study is work, and, like work, it has skills that can be learned and sharpened.This small book should be purchased, read, reread, freely annnotated, and kept within reach on every reference shelf. I wish it had been available when I bought my Strunk and Whites'. I also hope someone makes this into a series of study couses for seveeral levels in our educational system."
1,"The not so simple Organization Morgan decribes common assumptions about organizations - he helps to reveal the hidden assumptions behind the managers perceptions. What do we mean when we say that 'organizations are like animals'? It is pretty easy to start to think from a metaphor, and end up in literal believing in it (e.g. that 'organizations live and die', 'organizations have evolutions'). Such reifications are carefully described by Morgan - several most recurrent metaphors of organizations and popular organization theories basing on them are clearly described, and their pros and cons are pointed out. Having read 'Images of Organizations', it is much more difficult to adopt illusionate metaphors, and to get persuaded by a biased visioner."
1,"What's up with Mother Teresa? Actually it is a very funny movie, despite the social content it is bounded, the movie should be also apreciated by the comedy itself, specially the cameo apearences."
1,"A Rare Treat Only two movies that I have watched on the subject of homosexuality have stirred my heartstrings. The first was ""The Boys in the Band"" (if you haven't seen it I would recommend that you do) and the second is ""Jeffrey"". There is the usual camp and one-liners but what brings the movie its class is the chemistry between the two male leads. Both Mr. Weber and Mr. Weiss make their characters believable showing that in all life styles we all want the same thing. We are all scared, searching and hoping we meet that soul mate that will bring life and laughter to our lives. Kudos to these two fine actors whose talents are definitely not utilized enough."
1,"The Stones Keep Rolling Great new tunes for anytime! If you are under the age of 80 youwill love the same spirited classic style of the Stones, with newrhythms and lyrics."
1,"A big bang, indeed! I took the wait and listen stance, and now I can't stop listening! Another great release from the Stones, that does pack a Bigger Bang!"

1,"A Good Stones Album For ANY Decade A lot of people have remarked that this album is their best album in 10, 20 or 25 years. I'm going to go one step further and say that this album stands along side their work from any era. I'm not saying that it is their absolute best album of all time but it is in the same league as the great albums from the Mick Taylor era.I have seen them live on this tour twice and I frequently check their set lists on the tour web site. I can't for the life of me undersand why they haven't played ""It Won't Take Long"" yet. To me it is the best song of the Ron Wood era and I think it would work very well live.The other highlights of this album are Sweet Neo-Con and Keith's great take on ""Infamy'. The last 4 or 5 albums have been highlighted by a song with Keith on lead vocals and this one is no exception."
1,"This is a great album, a thrilling display of funky brilliance and virtuosity. You should listen to this album many many times, like for a whole evening, sipping Martinis or Margaritas or whatever you like to drink. It's one of their greats, along with ""Some Girls"", ""Exile on Main Street"" and the others. This one is notable for the funky guitars, the jazz influence, and Keith Richards sounding like he's singing in Humphrey Bogart's bar in ""Casablanca"". Most importantly, this album appears to have been very carefully made, with a tremendous shot of inspiration, and it gets better every time you hear it."
1,"No more dandruff ...because I always scratched my head wondering why artists when they are young write such great songs, but when they get older, they suck. For example, see U2. And what's up with Dep Leppard morphing into the Backstreet Boys? But not the Stones. It's like we're in a time warp, and it's still 1980! And if you disagree with my opinion, you can suck on big moosey juicy one. Word. Sentence. Paragraph."
1,"DEFINITELY worth the wait Who knew they still had it in them? Mick and Keith can still crank out a fine set of tunes, and there's a great set of them here. To be honest, I can't think of one song that I would skip on this disc. Even the ""Angie""sequel ""Streets Of Love"" has grown on me, and is actually pretty good. Of course, ""Rough Justice"" ""Back of My Hand"" ""Look What the Cat Dragged In"" ""Dangerous Beauty"" and all vintage Stones tunes, and stand out to me more than anything of Bridges to Babylon. The real stunners for me are actually ""She Saw Me Coming"", which some knock as repetitive but I was bowled over by it upon first listening, and Keith's closer ""Infamy"", which has yet to stop playing through my head. All Stones fans should own this, no doubt. Its just a matter of time until this one gets thrown in there next to ""Some Girls"" ""Tattoo You"" and ""Aftermath"". Probably not the big four though, as no one will ever top that batch."
1,"It makes me cry because is too good to be truth This album is amazing, it could be better but even the Universe has it's flaws...even the Bigger Bang.The fact is that this is a bunch of 60 years olders and THEY CAN ROCK!! better than all the overly-image-created teens that rule the charts this days.This is how music is done kids...and by the way I'm only 28 years old so don't think is your grandpa talking. So make yourself a favor and buy this pice of history...it is really good, very, very good and will bring happy tears in the eyes of those who still have ears."
1,"A bigger surprise I'll be 46 in January 2006, and have been a Stones fan since I first heard Get Yer Ya Ya's Out when I was about 10 in 1970. I remember eagerly awaiting the release of albums such as Sticky Fingers, Exiles, IORR and so on. I lost interest after Tattoo You, but still kept in touch with what the Stones were up to, whilst my musical tastes broadened.To cut a long srory short, I sit here typing this review listening to A Bigger Bang for the 10th time through a pair of Ultimate Ears UE10 Pro Earphones (the very ones Mick uses on stage). Suddenly I get it, this album absolutely rocks with power and emotion. If I could create music of this energy and turn on huge crowds like these old boys can still do, I'd never give it up.Onya boys, keep going......lets see how far this thing can go."
1,"Powerful, imaginative treatment of a controversial life Bill Condon provides us with a real gift -- an unflinching look at the life and work of Alfred ""PROK"" Kinsey. The sex is as pervasive as the humor in this brilliant biopic.The strength of the performances moves this film along despite the uneasiness engendered by a look at this very repressed era. Neeson, Linney and Saarsgard are especially memorable, but the other supporting cast, full of notables, is quite good.There are a few missteps, with a few uneven performances and occasional shallow spots. I wish Condon and the writers would have gone deeper in spots (NPI) and lingered a bit during certain scenes, but overall this is a remarkable piece.****1/2"
1,kinsey came on time and in excellent condition. great story about a great man who changed the way we view sex in the world
1,The best book on drafting for weaving that I've seen! Even experienced weavers can use a refresher and this book is it! It covers all aspects of weaving drafts. It is fine for a beginner and everyone else.
1,Another winner I highly recommend this book as well as others written by Jance. I've read several now and have enjoyed every one!
1,"The Best I first heard of Craig Hayes at a Sunday evening service in the Bronx. They were on program with Jae Nixon and a few other locals. I mean when Craig and the choir sung they did it with conviction. It was worth staying past 11 pm to hear them. I have every release most on cassette, but I got my money's worth and then some.Craig and the rest of the choir you are still high on my list of gospel artist. I'm currently in Nashville and no one here has never heard of you all. Get here in a hurry!!!!!!!!!!!Be blessed."
1,"One of the Best Clay Davidson definately has another hit with ""Sometimes"" to follow ""Unconditional"". He is one of the few new truly country artists left with the onslought of people using country to break into the pop charts. This CD is definately worth the money. He has a great voice, and some great songs on this CD. If you only have enough money for one CD, this one is the one you buy."
1,"Pity I Didn't Buy it Here! ""Joseph"" has got to be one of the most refreshing musicals I have watched in recent memory. I found myself knowing the words to each of the songs by heart by the end of the tape. A part of the storywriting I enjoyed was the fact that the teachers of the school where this play is being performed turn up playing some of the characters. That kind of tricky casting work makes a musical even more enjoyable to watch. And, the clincher to my purchase of this tape was, it was by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Unfortunately, I didn't buy it here, and consequently spent more and waiting longer for it. Oh well..."
1,"Hard To Find Items I had seen this movie on PBS years ago, and wanted a ""good"" movie to show my grandchildren. It's a really good one. I had to go out and by the CD to play in the car while going back and forth to school."
1,"about Joseph Movie was great-saw live performance in Dallas with Jon Secada playing lead. I think his voice is better than Donny's but Donny sounded good, too.A great family movie, especially if there are any music lovers or budding singers watching"
1,Amazing Dreamcoat! I bought this DVD for my 2 daughters for Christmas and they love it! Every time they watch it now they sing along with every song. This is a must for any family who loves to get together to watch a great Musical!
