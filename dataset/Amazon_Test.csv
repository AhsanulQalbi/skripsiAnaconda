0,"Overly complicated Being both a U.S. history buff and a mystery fan, I expected to love this book. I gave up after slogging through 150 pages. New characters (many with similar names) are introduced about every other page, making the story very difficult to keep straight. Benjamin January also brings a multi-layered backstory to the proceedings, adding additional layers of complexity (and does anybody else think a musician-surgeon-classically educated sensitive widower is a bit too good to be true?).Add a setting unfamiliar to most readers (an 1830s Creole sugar cane plantation), and the density of details overwhelms both plot and characterization. Casual readers will find this book tough sledding."
0,"Terrible Disappointment -- parts don't fit My son (almost 8) and my husband (an engineer) sat down to put this together. Many of the holes were either drilled too small or, even worse, drilled in the WRONG PLACE. Some pieces are cut the wrong size and just don't fit!! What a terrible WASTE OF MONEY. There is no way to make it work without major drilling and sanding and then re-painting.My son is so disappointed -- he was really looking forward to putting this together."
0,"Didn't hold up.....very disappointed I bought this OXO Insight Tea Kettle tea after I'd let my former whistler boil dry. The whistling cover on the spout had been left in the ""UP"" position after filling and I totally forgot about it. Well, I thought, THIS teakettle had solved that problem for me. Just a squeeze of the handle causes the spout top to flip down into the spout. When the the kettle is set down and the handle released, the spout top closes. What a great idea!After just 6 months of light use, the spout top will no longer close. I am so disappointed. FYI, the whistle on it was great, not too irritating, but loud enough to get one's attention.I am on the hunt for a new teakettle. A stainless one with a non-irritating whistle --- some of these teakettles sound like a tornado siren."

0,"Nice toy but ... My six-year-old loves space and to get this he was so exciteded! However, as we assembled some of the shuttle and other things the taps and pins would break-off. Needless to say, now he can't put everything together to simulate launch from Kenedy Space Center because all the parts won't stay together."
0,"Very low quality It's sad to see that the space toys based on the actual space program are not good ones. My son loves space and space exploration, but he hardly plays with this set. The shuttle does not stay on the tanks, even when sitting still.I like the fact that everything fits into a box. If only the toy were higher quality!I'd buy it again, but just for the fact that my son loves space and the space program so much."

0,"To Paraphrase Cordell Hull. . . In all my years of viewing movies, never have I encountered a film laced with such infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge, that until today I never believed a studio was capable."

0,"Misleading Title. This book's title and its thesis ""seem"" to suggest that it is all about the impact of people on politics, but in fact it is about feminism. The topic, feminism, is fine; anything under disguise is not.It is not quite an academic book with logical arguments but rather a propaganda with a few claims that are appealing accompanied by loads of emotional examples exposing the unfairness of this world which do nothing to strengthen the previous claims."

0,"Good Story, Bad Writing, Bad Acting, Bad Directing And worst of all was the techno music, which in no way fit the setting of the film."
0,"I want my [money] back! I was the only one in my senior English class who loved the epic poem. Several years later I bought a copy of it at a comic book shop.For some reason, I liked Christopher Lambert, and I thought he would be a good actor for a movie based on this classic tale.Man, was I wrong!Aside from the names of the hero and one of the villians, this movie has almost nothing in common with the poem. It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!The acting, even with a so-called ""top talent"" like Christopher Lambert, is awful. The setting is almost non-existant, and the plot, ah yes, the plot ....I knew this movie would reek within the first 10 minutes. I mean, I tried really hard to be open-minded, but it was to no avail.Spare yourself the pain and skip the movie. Settle in on a dark winter's night by a fire, put on some quiet music, and read the epic poem. You'll be glad you did."
0,"This Film Was a Waste of Time I agree with the reviewer who said, ""Read the book."" Or better yet, see Thirteenth Warrior, which is another fanciful rendition of this myth.Yeah, it's a B movie. It even has glimmers of interesting character development and plot line in it. But it's also-as one reviewer recognized--a pseudo video game, an imitation of an imitation of a life. It's a hostile, cretin, pubescent violence fantasy, festering in a cracked mirror. Beowulf, in the original tale, saved people from the monsters and nobly sacrificed himself. In this moronic film, he is a sociopathic ""swiss-army-knife"" who wants us to feel sorry for him. BEOWULF, the film, is gratuitous violence run amok. Who is the real monster in this film? Who really cares if the main character gets et? Everybody, not just mostly everybody, should have died in this film. They were all despicable."
0,"bad This is a pretty bad movie. It was only 90+ minutes and it seemed like forever. The sets are pretty good and some of the action scenes are as well. That is about all that is good. The special effects are bad...laughingly so at the end. There is no character development and most of the actors don't even bother to act (such as the king). There isn't much plot, except near the end. You spend the whole movie wondering when the actual story will begin. It canabalizes the Beowulf legend to the point where the only thing in common is some monster killing everyone. And while they claim it is a ""technofuture"" its really just a medieval setting with some props forced in (like a loudspeaker in a stone castle). You'd be much better off watching The 13th Warrior."
0,"Bad movie, bad writing, bad everything Ok, where to start with this piece of junk. Christopher Lambert sleep-walks through his scenes and the other actors take their queue from him. The soundtrack his pure heavy metal with no real link to the scenes. The set is minimalist to say the least - pipes and natural gas flames do not make a set. Writing was atrocious, directing was even worse if that is possible.This movie is just one more reason that Hollywood should not be allowed to touch a classic written story. Read the classic Anglo-Saxon story, but don't get this movie. Avoid at all cost."
0,"Yeesch I'm convinced that this is the worst movie ever made. I rented it because it sounded like it might have been remotely interesting but it wasn't even that. The story was godawful, the acting was worse and the effects were comical. So instead of purchasing this film, do yourself a favor. Take the money you were going to spend on the tape, buy a torch and a metal hanger, heat the hanger with the torch and beat yourself senseless. It would be infinately more enjoyable than watching this movie."
0,"Stink! Stank! Stunk! Unbelievably stupid and inane. Chris Lambert has the acting ability of a limp dish rag. If you haven't seen a pseudo-martial arts film that spends most of its time having the actors sommersault backwards again and again and again and again to a soundtrack filled with WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!, then this film is for you. And the fact that this film is based on what is considered the first English language literary classic is sacrilegious. Everyone associated with this film should be subjected to that huge single-edged razor blade used to separate people shown in the beginning of the film. This goes down in my books as one of the biggest bombs of all time. And Chris Lambert is positively laughable as an actor. Bar this man from acting!! Trash this film or--better--use it to prep people in how NOT to make a film."
0,"OK, really now... How can anyone like this garbage? I just listened to the song Money Talks with a few friends and we agreed that it was one of the poorest written songs we've ever heard. The overuse of keyboards sounds like something out of a bad video game, only with lots of rainbows and flowers and stuff. But the vocals, man, the VOCALS! The guy sounded like he was getting pleasure from discussing the way that money talks to him and he does what it wants! Sounds like he's looking for a profession in the red light district if you ask me. Howabout they take time off and never get caught... it's all part of the game! In fact, take a lot of time off. In fact, stop ripping off Marillion with a touch of RuPaul and Prince and never write another album again!"
0,"Package fine; pan bent or warped and they shipped it anyway! I would assume whoever packages these items, looks at them -- this should be a round pan -- not a dented pan. The box was not damaged, airpacks around the pan. Pan has a serious dent -- not a minor dent. Watch what you buy"
0,Amanda A daughter of the Mennonites This book felt like I was reading a book written by a sixth grader. The portrayal of the characters seamed unrealistic and staged. It felt like the writer hadn't done any or very little interaction with the Mennonite community.
0,"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? After 20+ years you would've thought Temple could have made a film without rehashing swindle. 99% of the footage has been seen before, the only new stuff is the interviews carried out in pitch darkness - probably sounded good in theory, in reality it is profoundly dull.No complete performances, overdubbed music, endless footage of council flats, endless rehashed footage from Swindle. A complete and utter wasted opportunity.Ever get the feelin you've been cheated?"
0,"BOLLOCKS!!!!!! The Pistols made Punk into the biggest media bonanza since hippie.When Punk came out, to spread out its dirty little wings, the generation caught by the narcotic f**k up of the sixties had a new hope something to fight for, to live, but within months the dream was sold, baught out it was turned into another commodity beacause of bands like The Pistols,The Damned, and the Clash. They can stuff their punk credentials, with all their money up their a**. ANARCHY IN THE UK WHAT A BUNCH OF BOLLOCKS, what did they ever do to live out that dream.They didnt care about punk, they dont wanna worry about anything. They numb their minds on T.V., space out on coke and dope they dont want their sh*tty lives to surface. I know its sh*t and u know its sh*t but they wont admit to the themselves that the fun they have all that style they got is the same old sh*t. Their music is a joke. Find some other ""Punk"" bands theirs many and a lot better too. THE PISTOLS, BOLLOCKS!!!"
0,"Time to Revitalize I think I have read everything Hillerman has written. Hunting Badger, is, at least in my opinion, his worst work. We already know Chee, Leaphorn and the other staple characters. Very disappointingly, Hunting Badger has no character development of the antagonists, no suspenseful plot and no real conclusion. This book seems to me to be a ""My editors want another book."" piece. I look forward to additional Hillerman books with hope that he will again do his usual interesting charatcer development as well as geographically detailed work. But, as far as Hunting Badger goes, miss it. It isn't very good. jbd"
0,"Hunting for a reason to like this book. Tony Hillerman is a great American author. His Jim Chee / Joe Leaphorn mysteries have introduced me to the Navajo culture and the American southwest, about which I knew little before I began to read his books. Therefore, I was very disappointed to discover that Hillerman's most recent book, ""Hunting Badger"", is far below his usual standards. I read the book before coming to this site, and I agree with the many criticisms posted by other reviewers. What I would like to add is my concern that two or more reviewers stated that ""Hunting Badger"" is the first Hillerman book they have read and it will be the last. They don't know what they're missing! ""Hunting Badger"" is in need of better editing, plot strengthening, more character development... and an ending!"
0,"A misstep in the series I've been a fan of the Hillerman series for many years, but Hunting Badger represents a great disappointment. I only hope that most new readers begin with another book in the series--any other would do. Also, why name a book after the villain if you're not going to confront or even glimpse him in the book? I felt as though Hillerman simply got tired and quit before he wrote the final chapters. Lots of typos and poor editing throughout. Maybe he had a falling-out with the publisher."
0,"Hunting Badger This is my first Hillerman book, and it will also be my last. I put it down after enduring 125 pages. I am not sure what the problem was, but it never really grabbed hold of me. The book seemed to just meander along without any real bite."

0,"Beware if you're sensitive to MSG I bought this at the health food store, and I guess I could get used to the bitter aftertaste that, as one other reviewer says, ends up in your throat, but I should have read the ingredients more closely. Even if I liked the taste, I couldn't use it because of that last ingredient ""natural flavor"". Not sure if you're aware, but that's one of the many aliases of Mono-sodium Glutamate, as in ""Accent"", and is a flavor enhancer. Many people have no known sensitivities to MSG, but I'm a lifelong migraine sufferer and have to keep an eye out for it because it's poison to my system."
0,"This stuff is absolutely NASTY!! I have no idea who is submitting the 5* reviews here, but they lost their taste buds years ago.This stuff tastes nothing like salt. It has a horrible bitter after-taste that lingers in your mouth ruining anything it touches.Try it at a restaurant or something before buying it. It even nauseates in cooking or in recipes requiring any significant amount of salt.If you are on a salt free diet, find something else. Yuk! With a capital Yuk!!=============UPDATE=====================I have found one use for this. In cooking, with tomato sauce, if you mix it with real salt, you need much less salt. The tomato sauce appears to nullify the bitterness somehow. So, if you like pasta with sauce but have to cut down on salt intake, perhaps this is the answer for that.But it is NO salt shaker for the table."
0,"WARNING!! You should not use potassium chloride if you have kidney failure, Addison's disease, severe burns or other tissue injury, if you are dehydrated, if you take certain diuretics (water pills), or if you have high levels of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia).

Serious side effects of potassium include uneven heartbeat, muscle weakness or limp feeling, severe stomach pain, and numbness or tingling in your hands, feet, or mouth.In addition to all this scary information...product tastes horrible. Like something that is not intended for human consumption. Its bitter with a definate 'bite' and aftertaste. I would not expect anyone to use this product regardless of their health...it's that bad!"
0,"no Rod Stewarts here Cibo Matto are one of the many bands trying to be too many things at once while winking to their friends in the audience. Stereotype A is an appropriation of many disparate styles, and it never comes together. The one lead singer in the band is very attractive, which makes their shows a must. Nothing on Stereotype A suggests that Cibo Matto will ever be able to incorporate many styles into one seamless blend like a music maestro such as Rod Stewart, whose many great albums are on sale right here at amazon, the country's most reliable source for music and book purchases. I think Yuko is the name of the very attractive member of Cibo Matto."
0,"Cibo Matto Goes Mainstream R&B What a disappointing, overproduced, overhyped mess. Yes, the ladies have abandoned their former trip-pop, sampled, quirky kookiness for radio friendly, very mainstream r&b blandness, replete with empty romanticized lyrics (I really miss the food references) and annoying (Shades of a Carpenters revival) backing vocals. There are only two vaguely salvagable tracks here ""Sci-Fi Wasabi"" (Derailed for me by an uncool Star Wars reference) and ""Blue Train"" (Sounds like a bad Buffalo Daughter outtake). The rest is an indistinguishable blip on the Top 50 charts. And why did they tamper with ""Spoon"", which was perfectly fine in its former incarnation (Perhaps to show off their improved diction)???? They're sure to make lots of money (Probably the idea)with this as the new Japanese TLC."
0,"Cibo Matto has made an incredibly boring album Having heard the decent track by Cibo Matto ""Sci-fi Wasabi"" on a CMJ sampler, I bought STEREOTYPE A thinking it might have other songs in the same vein. Much to my dismay, it honestly is a boring album. Nearly the songs sound the same, and the singing of Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda is inept and lazy.Cibo Matto, like several other Japanese artists (most notably Towa Tei), tried to use the American fascination with seemingly alien culture to sell this album. In the end, all one gets is a collection of 14 yawn-inducing filler-pop tracks. It has no redeeming qualities, and I would recommend that people would find much more worthy music to spend their money on."

0,"I love the Bodeans but not Sammy's solo effort I have every Bodeans album ever made (my favorite is the live ""Joe Dirt Car""), I have seen them in front of 200 people as well as 15,000 people (at Milwaukee's Summerfest) and absolutely love them. I was anxious to listen to Sammy's solo effort but have to admit it is not a CD I listen to often. The theme of the album is extremely dark and the CD simply depresses me.I am eagerly awaiting Kurt Neuwmann's solo effort (coming July 25, 2000). As the other half of the Bodeans songwriting duo, his album will likely be much more upbeat musically but still have great words...we'll find out in a few weeks."
0,"very disappointing first of all, this cd has too much swearing. second, it's just boring to listen to...there arent any decent rythms. What was fiend thinking when he wrote this horrible cd??? go buy 2pac or jay-z if you want to listen to decent rap!"
0,"GREAT movie - TERRIBLE DVD This is by far one of my all time favorite movies. My wife always loved it, so has my 3-year old boy. So we went ahead and purchased this movie on DVD. However, how annoying is it when the DVD doesn't allow you to skip the previews of other insignificant movies before you actually get to see the feature film. This thing locks up your DVD player control completely (disables functions of menu / stop / fast forward) and forces you to sit through previews of five movies before ever getting to the Babe feature. It is simply the most offensive and intruding thing my family has ever experienced in DVD's and VHS.I have a lot of words to describe those folks at Universal Studio, I will try to be gentle. Let's just put it this way - your limited creativity in marketing really must be the ultimate lowest of all."
0,"Love the movie, not the previews... First and foremost: Babe is one of my favorite movies.If you haven't seen it, you're missing out.But this movie has ""coming attractions"", previews that cannot be skipped. Granted, they're only a few minutes long. But you have to watch them each and every time you play the disk. No skipping to the title menu.If there were other versions available, I'd buy them.Hey studios: Ineffective marketing tool. Next time I'll research before I buy, and won't buy a movie with forced previews."
0,"Buy the VHS Tape One of the benefits of DVDs is the ability to skip to any part of the movie easily. This benefit is exceptionally true when you have kids and they want to watch a movie. Normally, you can skip the trailers and head right to the movie or at least the main menu. This DVD makes you go through each of the many trailers before you can get to the main menu. You can't fast forward through them or skip them. You must wait until the trailers have completed then select ""Play"" from the main menu. Because of this, we would have rather bought the VHS version of the movie. With a tape, you can at least fast forward through the trailers!"
0,"Do not buy this disc; you will be forced to watch 10 minutes of advertisements The movie is great. This disc will end up in your trashcan in pieces unless you have the patience of a saint. Universal pictures has decided that you are paying them for the imperative privilege of watching ten minutes of previews. /Dumb/ previews, through which you cannot fast forward and from which you cannot access the main menu. Buy the movie elsewhere or pirate it."
0,"Too sad!!! I'm sorry, but my eyes were filled with tears through the entire movie!!! Sure, it's nice seeing the animals talk, but it's SOO 'darn' sad! It's just another depressing animal movie.If you love animals and want a good bawl, this movie's for you."
0,"Not Good At All This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen. We had to see it in our class one day. The teacher said that I HAD to watch. Reluctantly, I sat down. I hated it. She fast forwarded it to the middle so we could see the end. Even that part was bad, and I didn't see all of it! I'd give it -10 stars for horrible scenes, cruelty to animals, and lack of trying. DON'T SEE IT EVER!!!"
0,"Weak, very weak! My ex-boyfriend Jeff and I rented this movie a while back and we had very different opinions. I thought the movie was childish, stupid and just simply not dope. Jeff on the other hand thought it was a great movie. I feel it takes a very warped individual to like this movie. This may be why I have since dumped Jeff and moved in with my new boyfriend Jermaine."
0,"skimmed to the end This reminded me of a Nancy Drew story in which Nancy gets laid, more than once. If this seems vulgar, then prepare yourself for a big surprise if you read this book. Contrived ""in the nick of time"" encounters hobble the already weak suspense, and stereotypes abound. You'll be happier with some James Lee Burke."

0,"Incomplete, missing musicians This release is missing two of the songs from the original performance at Woodstock, ""Gypsy Woman"" and ""Mastermind."" Hendrix only performed these songs at the Woodstock show; therefore, their historic value is impossible to deny. Yet these songs are not on this release!Additionally, this album does not include some of the other musicians' performances. The guitar of Larry Lee, for example, has been mixed out, along with other percussion and singing.This release could have been the definitive edition of Jimi Hendrix's legendary performance at Woodstock. Instead, it represents almost nothing beyond the 1994 Alan Douglas :Woodstock release."
0,Trash I have a good collection of hendrix and heard much more; this is trash cashing in on the extremely overrated concert of its name. The band is very spotty and really juiced making them all completely unable to follow Jimi's talent (which shines through in SSB and the long solo afterwards - pretty much the only highlights of this disc) You would be much better off with Band of Gypsies or Live at the Fillmore. In this vein Isle of Wight works from a more solid foundation. Do note that Jimi never played with this band again.
0,Don't Bother I bought this program to load onto my laptap for school and work. You can only download the installation cd. You cannot load the other 7 cd's onto your hard drive.

I have emailed the company to see if an upgrade will be released but I have not received a reply yet. I am now looking for a program that can be completely loaded onto my hard drive.

I found it as alot of jibberish, granted there was some decent parts, most of it seemed like it was written for her and only her and those she teaches. I found most of it difficult to understand, and her version of the Craft seemed so organized; for instance, your altar MUST look like this. Needless to say, Cunninghams book I finished, Ms Cabot's, I did not."
0,"Please don't go here! This book is just awful. Written at a fourth grade reading level but I would not recommend it for children. It is just disappointing.

0,"Sequels are almost always disappointing Having been so impressed with the original ""Megatrends,"" I was very much looking forward to this edition. Unfortunately,the authors' crystal ball failed too often this time around to inspire much confidence. One major flaw, I think, is that there is much less content analysis used in tracking these trends and far too much fluff in the way of interviews and anecdotes. Too, in ""Megatrends,"" statistics were used to back up forecasts derived from content analysis. Here statistics and surveys seem to be the sole basis for the forecasts. Perhaps the authors' thought the original work was too dry, or perhaps they were just trying to capitalize on a winner with a quick and dirty follow-up. In any case, this book was not nearly as insightful, or useful"

My friend from out of town (who I was carting around the city doing touristy stuff) picks it up and starts reading it out loud to all of us. It says such horrible bad bad BAD advise. If you follow this guide you will be slapped. NO DOUBT. And possibly knocked out, depending on who you approach. This is from 2 chicks and one dude who are very open minded. You will NOT get anything other than a fat lip if you do even ONE of the things it tells you to do. So actually i think this should be in the comedy section.

The two are college level texts and probably quite good for those engaged in intellectual pursuits. I, on the other hand, teach ESL as a volunteer and was simply looking to shore up my practical knowledge of the subjects. Both texts contain virtually no such information. In fact, they assume a significant knowledge of linguistics and linguistic theory; they are literally packed with obscure jargon that I presume familiar to some set of initiates but certainly far beyond my ken. If your situation is analogous to mine, I suggest Side by Side Spanish & English Grammar and Practice Makes Perfect English Pronouns and Prepositions--much less expensive ($30 the pair I think) and much more practical."

This is almost bootleg level in terms of editing quality and intention as a piece of art but that besmirches the good name of the better quality bootlegs I've enjoyed in my life.

0,does not fit Garmin 276c I purchased this power cord for a Garmin 276 gps. I specifically wanted the one clearly pictured on the website that has the 90 deg bend at the end. I bought 2. I received the item and it does not fit the 276. The contacts are correctly placed but the rubber type product that is meant for a press fit into the gps is too small in diameter and the cord immediately falls out. The end of this cord is straight and not the 90 deg. It is packaged as a Garmin product with the 276c clearly on the package so I do not know where the problem lies. I tried to contact Antonline but they do not provide for any human to contact to explain/rectify the problem so I ended up sending the cords back and eating the shipping each way. Will never buy from Antonline again.Garmin 12-Volt Adapter Cable for GPSMap 276C (010-10516-00) I would personally verify with any vendor offering this product.

0,"Where's Coral Sea? What a crock!I bought this DVD in the (vain) hope it contained the entire 2:45 minute movie not just the stupid love scenes (which I really don't care for.) The long version (rarely seen on TV) of Midway with more detail (among the missing scenes: the death of VT-3, the massacre of VMF-221 and the battle of Coral Sea) is (I think anyway) actually a better movie than the theatre original which is on this DVD.Upon further reflection I should add the following. As it was pointed out, many of the additional scenes were shot for TV and not part of the original movie. However, if they could jam in those love (useless) scenes, why couldn't they stick in the combat (good) scenes that everyone else (myself included) wanted?"

0,"Midway between ""bad"" & ""sucks"" This is not a movie for anybody who is interested in Naval history or has any knowledge of the ships and aircraft types that were actually in the battle. Besides Hestons' usual overblown acting, the movie is spoiled by outakes from actual combat footage shot long after Midway was a memory, involving aircraft types that were not in service at the time. Overhead views of modern(1950's & 60's) U.S. carriers only needed an Apollo or Gemini spacecraft bobbing in the water to complete the fiasco. This movie is one anachronism after another. For a far better portrayal of the events at Midway, I would recommend the television mini-series of Herman Wouks' ""War and Remembrance"", starring Robert Mitchum et. al. Although built around fictional characters, the historical research was better and skilled use of good models was better than bad use of inaccurate video. Skip this movie."
0,"Poorest war movie ever made 'Midway' on DVD while we're still waiting for 'The Longest Day'- somebody's got to be kidding. This one really sucks. Here we go: stock-shots ripped off from 'Thirty seconds over Tokyo', 'Tora Tora Tora' and probably other movies, WWII newsreels footage extensively cropped to fit into the Panavision frame, meaningless cameos by various aging stars -probably to make the flick look like a blockbuster- , historical mistakes and countless errors about planes and aircraft carriers, inept dramatization -the predictable romance between Heston's son and a Japanese girl-, you name it. The only reason I give this awful turkey one star is because the software doesn't allow me to give it none."
0,"Can't give a minus star review! It's pathetic that perhaps the greatest sea battle in U.S. history generated such a lousy movie.This movie stinks on many levels. It uses outtakes from Tora Tora Tora, so the viewer sees interesting things like battleship masts at Midway. The actors, except maybe Henry Fonda and Hal Holbrook, do lousy jobs. Charlton Heston is particularly irritating- you get the impression that he was running the Pacific fleet and Admiral Nimitz just came in on the weekends to read his mail.The ""romance"" angle in the movie just slows it down and somehow makes you wonder if these people's personal problems were bigger than World War II!"
0,"YAWN I fell asleep during this one, watched again, drank much coffee, then wished I had fallen asleep instead of watching it. Young men fought and died at Midway, not tired old actors. I wonder what they could do with it today, with better acting and realistic younger actors in the parts?"
0,"I had a great expectation for this... What would you get if you took a bad script, uninspired acting, WW2 stock footage, scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora!, and put it in a blender and mixed it around? The answer: Midway! This reeaallly bad movie suffers from everything. WW2 stock footage is over-used (most of it didn't even take place during the battle of Midway) and the scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora! are out of place. A corny love interest gets in the way of the action too much. Lot's of familiar faces in this, but their acting is uninspired, and the script is dreadful. About 30 minutes of important footage was cut out of the original release (including the battle of the Coral Sea). Please, avoid this film!"
0,APC MAKES JUNK BX900R I spent a lot of money for this unit and got about one year of use out of it before it started constantly beeping and overloading. I replaced the batteries with new ones plugged it in and it still overloads with nothing attached to it. I deduced from reading all the other reviews that this is a poor design on cooling the circuit board. The unit runs hot with nothing attached. I guess the cheap fan doesn't last too long and you ruin the warranty by replacing it. If you go to the APC site the unit is discontinued thank goodness they retired it. This will be the last APC product I buy.
0,"used to be a fan of apc This product is an unfortunate one. From the very beginning since owning it, it must be plugged in all the time to maintain the battery and take a great deal of power to do so. After owning it for less than two years, beeping has started anytime you turn it on (annoying that you can't turn it off), which suggests that its battery is about to do. For being such an expensive unit and not even being able to find a battery to replace it easily, I am thinking this may be my last apc. If you search apc's website, there isn't even product info or manuals for this manual, so support is lacking."

Further good news is that the shipping met my expectations (5 stars). What I did not expect is for it to be delivered with mold or algae (it's green when I wipe it off) particularly on the parts of the mat that were not enclosed by the cardboard package. This made the experience a 1 star experience because I have had to spend a good deal of time cleaning it. I am a little uncertain about the safety of mat, even if it appears that I have cleaned the mold off. The idea of having to return this gift is appalling."

Don't get me wrong - I hate violence in all its manifestations in life although I like it on screen, but here we can't even empathize this woman 'cos the movie is just sooo bad. The acting is terrible, characters do very strange and unexplainable things. You can't feel with a character when you see everything in the film is false and naive. Don't believe the taglines - there's nothing shocking in there. It's just one big waste of time. You'll feel cheated and robbed. If you hate violence in cinema, I guess you are not reading this right now and if you like shocking movies, don't bother with this one, there are plenty of others that are much more shocking and I assume you already know them all by names. Go and watch ""Irreversible"" for god's sake."
0,"What a sick disappointment I watched this film hoping for a great revenge flick, in which the victim of a brutal rape enacts the revenge on her assailents like they deserve. Unfortunately what I saw was a film about a woman who gets raped, the details being the main focus of the movie, and a bit thrown in at the end about her getting revenge by killing the guys. Only the bath tub guy gets what he deserves. The other guys all get relatively quick and painless deaths. They should be killed like the victims in ""Saw"", but they actually seem to get off pretty easily.The fact that the rape scene is around forty minutes long proves the misguidedness of the film makers. It's like using the movie ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to say that murder is wrong. It just doesn't work to throw the subject in our face and force us to stare at it.I just feel like this movie screams to be remade, with the rape being downplayed, and the revenge being emphasized. It could have been done far better."
0,"A very dull, unbelievable movie, with horrible audio I had been wanting to see this ""notorious"" movie for a long time. Now that I have seen it, I can honestly say ""What's The Big Deal?"". Other than the fact that the Camile Keaton gets attacked 3 times, and makes a lot of noise while doing so, I didn't see what's was so horrorible about this movie. The one thing that I found bothersome was the sound. Other than the commentary tracks, there is the original mono audio track, and the new dolby 5.1 surround track. I listened to the latter. It sounded like someone had put the microphone up against another tv to record the sound....This movie is unbelievable because Camille Keaton is raped & sodomized by several men on 3 different occasions, and within a day or so she able to walk around like nothing happened to her."

0,"DVD-R wont play on newer systems bought the ""DVD"" millennium edition and watched it on (a now old) DVD player a few years ago.This evening I tried to watch it again on my new-ish PS3 and it would not get past Dolby ad.Windows 7 laptop stalls one third the way through.. While this is not a film I love to see, I didwant to watch it once more as a re-make is out soon. Shame, my comparison is spoiled by what seemsto be a bootleg, bought on Amazon. Beware."
0,"just say no I watched this movie sometime in the late 80's. It disturbed meto the point that I've never forgotten it, and never will.Take my advise and don't fill your mind with this trash. It willstain your soul. If you like to see lots and lots of violent rapethen this movie is for you and you need help. I can't imaginewhy anyone would make this movie. There is enough of this typeof horrible stuff in the real world without adding a fantasyversion."
0,"graphic and terrible, but reality I put reality because this is a very strong depiction of what rape is and how men can be. It made me nauseous just watching it, and I read the other reviews on here about it and was very offended by the guy who wrote ""if your a man the bathroom scene will make you squirm"". Well, the man in the tub had brutaly raped this woman and deserved what he got, in my opinion if your a man watching this film what should make you squirm would be the scenes of the rape and just knowing that you are part of the male species that commit this horrific act. Dont watch this if you have ever been raped, it will bring flashbacks."
0,"biggest disappointment EVER If you are looking for something shocking, don't bother with this movie.rape scene: why doesn't she run???? why doesn't she fight??? how come there's all this blood on her all of a sudden??? where did that come from???? stupid. revenge scenes: first of all, i wasn't upset enough to thirst for revenge. second of all, the murder scenes were even weaker than the rape scene.what you've basically got here is a movie hollywood could remake, scene for scene, including every gratuitous moment. and it would get made. it would show in theaters. and lots of annoying people would think it was horrifying. go rent ""irreversible"" it's much better at this sort of thing."
0,I Spit On Your Grave After no word for three weeks I was sent a message that I had been sent notice that the product was unavailable. Not true. The message arrived the day after the last day that I was to expect it. I would have appreciated a timely message so I could look somewhere else. Instead the import CD wasted three weeks of my time.
0,Waste of money ! From the name of the movie you will think that you will see real good horror movie. In fact the story was so bad .....it is not worth it to waste your time and money .....!
0,"Waste of time, soft core trash! I Spit on Your Grave, more like I spit on this movie. How anyone can like this movie is beyond me. I personally like violent movies, but movies of class and style, such as (Goodfellas, Halloween, and The Exorcist), but I Spit on Your Grave has neither, just a woman getting raped in the first half, and her revenge in the second half. Mabey the reason critics hate this film(HA-HA) so much is because it really does suck. Their really is no bacic story, and acting that deserves turkey awards for the entire cast. Come on people quit wasting your time on a movie that no one can even say (this is a horror movie, a suspence movie, or a drama) because honestly I don't even know myself. But I do know that this garbage should be banned from the public peroid..."
0,A poor film with not much story that should not be seen. This is a very low budjet film and really is nothing special. After seeing the exorcist I thought to myself I should start to get into these Banned movies. When this came through my door all that was in it was rape and more rape that should not be allowed to be seen in any country. It is not a horror or thriller but just more like a old cult film gone wrong. If you are looking for a film with a story line that is banned buy A clockwork orange.
0,Violent and Exploitive. Extremely violent horror/thriller about pretty young woman travelling to an island only to be beaten and raped by a gang of young holigans. Terrible film is banned in most countries and is an absolute abomination. Don't waste your time or money.
0,"A Grave Mistake This is one bad film. It has all the style and charm of a 1970 porno flick but with none of the benefits. Okay there me sex and violence, but is that enough? As that isn't even done well I saw no. All in all this is one Nasty Video."
0,"Garbage The only people I can see really trying to get this flick are poor souls in the UK who are curious as to why it was banned. I'll tell you why it should have been banned. Unfortunately in Britain they still censor and ban films, which is a joke, and people become obsessed with these ""nasty"" flick, most of them being just plain bad. Save your money, American or British, and pass over this poor excuse for a film."
0,"Sick and repulsive I gave this movie at least one star because the woman got revenge. I was so digusted and shamed by this movie[...]This is a sick, sick movie about a horrific experience that women face everyday. This movie is basically rape porn, so if you enjoy that then rent it, but if you are a normal human being and are sickened by the act (which is very graphic in this movie) then avoid this [...]."
0,"You have to be disturbed to enjoy this movie! Im not going to lie to you, but you do have to be slightly disturbed and/or sick to actually enjoy this movie. What can be enjoyable about watching a girl getting gang raped numerous times? And to say this is not worse than the likes of Deliverance is insane. Yes, there is a male rape scene in Deliverance, which again was not at all enjoyable to watch and i shall not be watching again, but the scene in that movie is far shorter and far less graphic than the rape scenes in I Spit On Your Grave. So basically, if you have any sanity and/or morals you will not enjoy this movie as there is absolutely nothing in the movie to enjoy."
0,"only pricks like this film This movie is just fake snuff. Thats it. Its boring, laughable, and not scary or disturbing in the least. Watch Last House on the Left, now thats scary!!"
0,mold issues like other had I ran a few batches with this and every time it got moldy. Then it attracted bugs in my kitchen(the seeds in the bag not the growing grass).
0,Has live grain bugs I received my order a couple of weeks ago. The shipment has live bugs -- Sawtooth Grain Beetles. I have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage. I have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds. Usually I place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out. This bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment. The seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star.
0,"Never could get the bells to work right I have some Woodstock bells for the patio, so I thought this would be great. It wasn't. No matter what I tried, I never could get the bells to go around and strike one another properly. I feel like this product was definitely not worth its price."
0,"i am still in a hole this game, sorry this item is not unfinished but it shouldn't even be in the market. Not only was it impossible to complete, it made me gag every time i hear the E.T. theme song. This game should be extreme punishment for kids to suffer if they misbehave or break something valuable.

It is a book that says what it is, but as a teacher, I could make all the signs that are in it and have access to most of the documents that could be legally binding. I was disappointed but should have known better...."

0,"Far from classic Two powerful interstellar magnates vie for control of human-controlled space in this early (1959) John Brunner novel. This is the only novel of Brunner's that I've read, but I have to assume that he improved considerably later since he produced two very highly regarded novels, ""The Sheep Look Up"" and ""Stand on Zanzibar."" This book is a bit of fluff that displays all of the worst traits of Golden Age science fiction--a nave faith in the ability of extraordinary individuals (invariably scientists) to engineer the optimum human destiny, and a maddening tendency toward endless exposition delivered through interminable conversations. The hero, Counce, subjects people to horrendous fates, including starvation and torture, all in the name of a greater good--and they love him for it later. I don't think this novel has ever been reprinted (I came across it in a used book store), and I can understand why."
0,"Pathetic excuse for a book Pathetic cut and paste typical of TFH. Oh, and the company also owns Nylabone, which they promote in every book. Make sure that you don't get one of their HOLLOW Nyalobones for your Neo. TFH has no scruples whatsoever."

0,"NOT WORTH THE 'JAILBAIT' I saw 'Jailbait' when it was first on MTV. I was looking foward to a stupid, funny entertaining teen sex comedy. What I got was a stupid, unfunny, offputting, offensive, teen pregnancy so-called 'comedy'. I happen to like MTV movies- I enjoyed '2gether', etc. but this was just plain bad. Do Yourself a favor and skip 'Jailbait' -ROBBIE SCHEER, 15 YEARS OLD"
0,"total waste I have used other hair styling tools so I am not totally inept with them, but this tool was a real failure on my hair. My hair is fine and straight and I wanted a little curve to it (achievable with other hot brushes). All it did was to frizz my (usually) non frizzy hair. The strands do not wrap tightly around the cylinder and this causes fly away hair. For anyone with my type of hair, I wd strongly advise against this tool."
0,"Infiniti by Conair BC173 I have shoulder length curly, fine hair. I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair. The brush does more blowing than straightening in my opinion - it is fine for drying hair. But I did not get the sleek, smooth, shiny effect that was promised by the straightening tool. It was nothing like the salon straightening job I normally get. I will be returning this styler ASAP. Very unhappy."
0,Hate it! I feel like I waisted money on this product. The clamps dont hold onto my hair like they should to straighten/dry my hair. My hair was still left looking like it was frizzy. I did a better job at blow drying my hair with a dryer and then straightening my hair with my straightener than using this product. Don't buy it!
0,Do not buy!!! This product is money going to the trash. I used it once and it doesn't do ANYTHING. It can hardly grasp the hair and can't really streighten anything. Simply doesn't fit.
0,"Never buying from Conair again While the thing worked just as good as a flat iron in half the time I went through 4 of these, in a little over a year. They All died within 3-5 months of each other. I called the company and gotten replacement for my first one and and was given a 6-10 week wait, so I buckled and bought another one...which died before they even sent me my replacement which was taking way longer then 10 weeks, when i called again asking where my replacement was, the guy we talked to said there was no reason i should have even had that wait and that he'd make sure he sent a replacement for both dryers, and that they'd arrive in a timely manner. Which they did. Both replacements are dead. I switched back to my flat iron, which cost the same as one of those stupid driers but has lasted at least 4 years and still works like day 1."
0,"Twice the effort for half the sleekness My hair is about 90% straight and 10% wavy, so you wouldn't think it takes much to make it sleek, straight and shiny; I even use an ant-firzz serum before I style. But using this Conair took twice as long as drying and straightening my hair in two steps, and gave me half as straight hair. I even used my regular blow dryer first to get most of the dampness out, thinking this would speed up the process...but no, it took ages. The Conair is basically a very small hairdryer with a few brush bristles. When I was finished, my hair definitely had frizz and fly aways, and I had to go back over it with my Chi flat iron. I really wanted to like this product and to save time, but I will be returning it."
0,"Singed my hair after one use I used it just like it said, I brushed as it dried never leaving it in one place and after one use I found a section of hair that was burned.This gets too hot and their is no way to protect the hair shaft.It is going back and I will have to trim my hair"
0,hirdryer this is not what i wanted.i tryed to get a hold of someone to tell me where to send this back and no one could help me.they just shifted me around to some one else.i wont order again
0,too little band and too much buck Really only works with tension which is not possible at the ends of your hair. I would return it if I could. Very expensive for what you get.
0,dissapointed it really hard to use this product unless you are an stailist. Also it take time to straighten the hair and at the end is frizzy. I'm very dissapointed and it was a waste of money.
0,Total junk I owned this for less than 2 weeks when it stopped working and began to smell like it was burning. I returned it for a refund.
0,"Terrible This product was so awful, I returned it - something I RARELY do. It didn't dry or straighten well. My dryer and round brush were far superior to using this. I don't recommend this product."
0,"EVEN MY HAIR STYLIST THOUGHT THIS WAS A LOSER I bought this product thinking it was the perfect answer for my shoulder length slightly wavy fine hair, to give me a sleek styled look. Wrong! I tried numerous times to use this ""styler"" and found it awkward and useless at best. At worst, I felt like I was damaging my hair! I even took it to my hair stylist to see if there was some technique I needed to use for better results. She was baffled by the poor design of this product as well. My advice? Don't waste your money."
0,not worth it... It doesnt do anything to my hair but take an hour to dry it and make it frizzy. Doesnt do what it says it does. it makes it very poofy & frizzy.
0,"Doesn't straighten my hair I have extra long wavy thick hair. I've always wanted to be able to straighten my hair on my own without having someone else's help or going to a salon. This does dry my hair, but it doesn't make it straight, it always makes my hair frizzier and more dull. I would not recommend this product."
0,Not Pleased This dryer is not meant for ethnic hair. My hair doesn't get any straighter than it did using a regular blow dryer and brush. I wouldn't recommend it for women of color.
0,"My hair looked horrible after using this. I have frizzy hair and use a straightener. When I read about this product, I thought it sounded like what I had waiting for all my life!It made my hair drab and flat. I will go back to my former styling method."
0,"Not what I expected at all!! I puchased this product and was not happy with it at all!It is very sturdy and all that but after awhile using it - the handle is too heavy - which tends to put a strain on your wrist - i have long hair, straight hair and feel it for those who have this product and have curly, long hair - take it from me - if you insist of purchasing this product - get a wrist guard - cause after awhile you will feel the 'burn'.Hope this helps... I can surely say - i wasted my $$$$P.S. i would like to add - it last only 1 yr - used only 7 times out of that one year.."
0,"Does not work, electrical problem Just received it, plugged it in after watching DVD and reading instructions but it would not go on; tried reset button etc. with no luck. Will have to send it back. I have purchased other Conair products over the years but this was a big disappointmnet because I didn't get a chance to use it."
0,"Too Many Omissions to Count... The name of the film is American Hardcore, but never once mentioned are seminal Hardcore legends Reagan Youth, Warzone and the Angry Samoans. The Dead Kennedys, Misfits, Husker Du, 7 Seconds and Suicidal Tendencies are briefly mentioned and in no way given their due. Much of the running time of the documentary focuses on the California, Boston and DC scenes. But how can you cover Cali in depth without delving deep into the Dead Kennedys? The film is completely disjointed and has no rhyme or reason as they move from California to Boston back to California to DC and then briefly to New York. I know the intention was good but the product is subpar and heinously omits bands that should have gotten their 15 minutes for their contributions to this important underground scene. Not recommended."
0,"This translation from the French is HORRIBLE! Although I have not yet read the original French publications of these essays, I must express my dissapointment with this translation.

0,"Immoral movie This movie could have been so good. The storyline was great and the relationship between Mr. Sorrell & his son is wonderful. However, there were lots of bedroom scenes. Leading character was very immoral and there was language. In the end, the son winds up euthanizing his father after the encouragement of his wife. Very dissapointed"
0,"Unfortunatley, There Are No Grades Less Than One. This is the last William W. Johnstone book I buy. It was a pathetically written story.

0,"The Worst SF Movie I ever saw. It was the first time I ever felt a need to fast forward through a video and even then I couldn't stand to watch it. Fast forwarding through all the action on earth I was dumbfounded by the impossible plot on the space ship. Special effects or not, this movie is not worth paying for, I didn't - (checked it out of the local library).Take a hint from the Director credit: Alan Smithee - the real director did not even want his name on it."
0,"A high budget Sci-Fi mess The first sign that this film is no good is it's directed by ""Alan Smithee"". ""Smithee"" is a psudonyum for directors who want to disassociate themselves from a finished picture. Too bad the stars didn't have the same luxery: Peter Boyle, Jack Palance, Charlton Heston, Tim Matherson. The hard-to-follow story deals with evacuation of Earth during a probable supernova of the Sun (I think) but what you really get is an unstable bastardization of ""2001"" and ""Road Warrior"". This film may have impressive special FX but the best visuals in the world don't mean a thing if you don't have a halfway decent story to go with it."
0,"Exploding bomb! I would actually give this ""film"" no stars. Quite possibly, next to a few others, this has to be one of the most convuluted, boring and sickening movies to watch. Want the storyline? Refer to the title, and thats about as exstensive as it gets. I own this on laser disc and have wanted to burn it for years. So many quality films being excluded from dvd and this pile of junk gets released. Too bad alot of good actors got caught up in this mess, but they are just as responsible. Man, this is bad, dont waste a dime on it."
0,"I did not even finish this book I was told that Amanda Cross was a good mystery writer and looked forward to reading some of her works. After reading 4 of these short stories, I put the book down and will not look for any more of her works.I tried to over look the excessive use of fractured compound sentences, but the bizarre resolution of the stories was more than I could bear."
0,"Warning do not buy highpoint product I was originally sold highpoint rocketraid cards from a company that I buy my hard drives from. Highpoint implements a technology where one must use a browser to log onto the hard-drives in order to mount them, format them or do anything else with them.The trick is that sometimes the password works, sometimes not. So I am locked out of my own hard drives. This has happened several times to me. So far today I have been sitting in front of a dead computer for 8 hours waiting for Highpoint to return my tech help call - I have left 5 messages.In order to switch cards I must wipe out all my data. Which I am going to do as the frustration level of not being able to access my own hard drives is horrific. This company is basically holding me hostage.

0,"BOOOO, two thunbs Down! it was an EXCELENT movie but distroyed by Rhino. they Cut sceans, they Changed the movie, there are barelly NO extra features, and it is a bad transfer. this is just very disapointing. sorry to break it to you all but this is not worth the time or Money."
0,ATTENTION! NOT WHAT YOU THINK! The movie itself is FANTASTIC BUT beware that this is NOT the original 1986 movie. It's the Special Collectors Edition that's been remastered and includes foul language. The only way you'd know that is if you happened to mouse over one of the extra thumbnail images (and who does that?!).
0,"Pure Boredom I tried to watch this movie a couple of months ago. I am sorry. I see no sorry. It's a series of unrelated events and unanswered questions. Ugh. I don't see why people love this movie. Even if you are a Transformers' fan, you have to realize that this movie is sooooooooooooooooo boring. I had a hard time trying to watch this movie a second time.If you want real stories, check out Beast Wars and Beast Machines. Now that is entertainment."
0,"Parents, keep your children away! My child attempted to transform into a semi truck like the much lauded ""Optimus Prime."" He has not been able to stand up straight since 1986. It was weeks before we were able to detach the trailer. The Transformers are more than meets the eye, they are a disaster in disguise."
0,"one of the worst movies I've ever seen Even considering the fact that this movie is 25 years old, it's still bad. There are plenty of other animated movies from that era that are ten times better than this. I stopped halfway through watching this with my kids because I just couldn't bear it any longer. The animation is poor, but I can write that off to its age. The story is horrendous, with plot holes too numerous to count. On top of that, right in the middle of this movie I thought was geared for kids one guys yells an expletive at the top of his lungs. I don't recommend this for anyone."
0,"Awful DVD A lifetime TF fan of the original series, the movie was a classic, when I first saw it August 9, 1986. I wish the new characters didn't have to be introduced by killing off the favorite characters. It was awful to see fire spewing out of Prowl's mouth, when he was killed. And Ironhide's head being blown off by Megatron. I just saw the Kid Rhino DVD, and it was the sorriest way to bring a classic movie to DVD. The colors were too bright, and the animation was choppy. Besides the interview with the composer of the music, this DVD didn't have any features. It was just sloppily thrown together, just to get a DVD of the movie out there. I hope in the future, Paramount (Who is filming the new Transformers movie) gets in touch with Marvel/Sunbow, and re-release the original film, complete with trailers from the original film, plus toy commercials, featuring the movie characters. This is one movie, Kid Rhino, should have never put their hands on. This DVD sucked!!!!"
0,"Memories Yes, this is one of those movies you can never forget about. Most of us that grew up in the 80's remember this movie. Truly, this is one that i don't regret buying. Now that it is a part of my dvd collection, i can enjoy it over and over again. It can now be enjoyed by the next generation of kids can enjoy it as much as we all did when it came out."
0,"... Well, I just bought myself Transformers on DVD. Giggling like an idiot and running to my DVD player I was absolutley shocked when I threw it in. No extras whatsoever. Not even a theatrical trailer. Pan and Scan only ?!?!! Augh! Could it get any worse? Yep. The sound is horrible. Hissy and muted. The Video isn't incredible, either. on Par with the VHS copy. Perhaps slightly crisper. I'm not sure if I got a different version. It has a different cover than what's shown here on Amazon (I bought mine at a local video store) This version is released by a company called Seville and Sports a cover like the VHS Release froma few years back with Optimus. Needless to say. I was incredibly dissapointed. Disgusted, even."

0,Statistics It would be an interesting and informative exercise for both sides of the creationist/evolutionist debate if someone could produce some statistics on the proportion of readers of this sort of publication were bought to the fold of the lamb by it and the proportion who on reading it realised that the writer and many of his adherents had very real problems and were led to the assumption that all Christians were that way inclined and decided that they wanted nothing to do with them or their beliefs.If only from a crass marketing point of view the churches should give this some consideration if they are tempted to go along with these people with the intent of making new converts.Brian Giles
0,"Evolution is true Science in no way refutes evolution, if used correctly. The authors of this book don't have an inkling of what 'science' is. If you're thinking about buying this book, do yourself a favor and go buy ""On the Origin of Species"" by Charles Darwin. That is, if you care about the truth. This book is full of lies. What it preaches is blatantly wrong and you would be a fool to believe a word of it."
0,"The inability to think equates to the inability to vote ! This (comic) book tells us much more about the mentality of it's authors and readers then it does about evolution. And more importantly it helps to explain how the Repiblicans could convince a majority of voters to vote for an intellectual midget like G.W. Bush.It is now clear that an American conservative is one who believes that there is proof that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, but that evolution is an unproven fallacy!God (or Darwin) help the United States of America!"
0,can't believe I can't believe that so many people gave this piece of garabge high marks. This book and any thing else ever written Ken Ham is an absolute waste of a tree.
0,"Refuting nothing Sarafati's book begins promisingly, but soon degenerates into blatant and unashamed creationist propoganda. He presents a few problems regarding evolution that are worth ruminating over, but for the most part he merely contradicts himself and asserts, without evidence, that his view of the creation of the world fits sceintific evidence better than evolution does. The reader does not have to read far until Sarafati sheds any illusion of scientific fairness or reason. Good for an ardent creationist who would like a source to quote in argument, bad for anyone looking for any real scientific insight."

0,"A Memory There isn't much to add to the other comments except this: I attended the premiere of this little opus in Southern California back in the late '70s. Many of the stars, including Mae West, were in attendance. Afterward, making my way through the stunned crowd, I came face to face with Dom DeLuise. I will never forget the look that passed between us."
0,"only to see and enjoy the great Mae West well, what can i say about this movie, i just acquire it to see the great West on her 80s fun as ever in her last movie work. the dvd transfer? well i cant see any diference between it and the vhs format they have the same bad and poor image, but who cares is Mae West on it thats worth this dvd. for the Mae West fans is a great acquisition. well, she can even move, her voice is litle,but hello she was 85, and stills.... mmmm well come up and see me sometime."
0,"Unsatisfactory I waited almost two months to rent this video. Unfortunately., I was disappointed. The movie while poignant, was spasmodic and disjointed. I had to try too hard to piece together the events while they were occurring. James Caviezel's performance was compelling. Dennis Quaid's acting was fair."
0,Couldn't read it Pics are nifty. Watch Coal Miner's Daughter. Don't try to read this book. I know she was raised in the woods but trying to read like you are illiterate is kinda challenging.
0,"please look for a better source than SRW Those of us in the pagan/wiccan community rarely take Silver RavenWolf's writings as serious in nature, as her writings are filled with condescending tone, advice to lie for teens, and an obvious gimmick to make money without any regard for gaining credibility for the pagan community. If you are looking for credible resources, look to Scott Cunningham, Raymond Buckland, Christopher Penczak, Ellen Dugan, but if you see Silver RavenWolf RUN the other way."
0,"Ultimate? . . . Fluff! I bought this because it seemed to cover a lot of territory. In the end, that's its biggest fault--kind of a lick and a promise approach. Even worse is that this author seems to devote much of her efforts to feeding the usual teenaged angst, and giving youngsters the idea SHE is the only one who understands them. . . very dangerous territory, IMO. One thing to offer generic advice, and another to try to generate a cult following. Some useful stuff within, but even more to have to sift through with a grain of salt.

Here, Silver has successfully minced up her old works, thrown in some bogus information to taste, and hit the puree button on the proverbial blender.Personally, I wouldn't bother with the investment. I borrowed the book from a friend, and returned it disgusted, not wanting to buy it for myself. In this book, there are places where Silver begins to Christanize some of the Pagan ideas... in my opinion, she's just selling out her craft.If you're looking to get started in the craft, I would absoluely recommend some of her earlier books, like ""To Ride a Silver Broomstick"" and ""To Stir a Magick Cauldron."" These books are excellent, and essential additions to the library of any serious Witch. This new book, however, is defiently one that my bookshelf will be happier without!"
0,"Not a Fan I have tried to read the ""whole"" of the book, but find that the book has too many ""holes"".For those who are interested in the Wiccan path, read Scott Cunningham as a start as he, and there are others, who explain and teach with great wisdom.I am sorry I am not s fan of hers, but I find her books more for teenagers and certainly they should not be reading Silverwolf without having read a proper authority on Wicca. Sadly, hers are the books that remind me too much of Halloween and all the kiddy behavior that sometimes follows.Please, save your money."
0,"Was She Guessing??? Has she stopped researching for these books? I have never returned a book in my life but this one went back to the store. Being Asatru I immediately opened up to the section on runes. That was a joke, they were completely messed up. She changed the names, swapped meanings for the runes, and even included the blank one. Runes are not something that one can debate on, they are what they are. The section of teenie bopper spells was memorable. Of course that kind of throws the three fold rule out the window. Or drives the witch performing them into a pickle, I would not want that backlash. This book was a waste of perfectly good paper."
0,"Filler material for Wicaa wannabes. If you have no plans on taking Wicca seriously, read it by all means, but if you're exploring this as a legitimate religious option, stay away from her at all costs."
0,"Confused I purchased this book with the idea that it could be a good reference guide for a student I have been working with. I would have returned the book if I could have. Although it is focused toward the wandering teen, it's ideas are too scarce. The ideas within are not necessarily focused to any one religion, but a mix of all the different aspects that the author has put together as wicca. This is a choice that is made by the practicioner, and nowhere in this book does it stress this opinion.For those who would like some fun reading about what fantasy religion could be, this would be the book for you. For those who really need some insight into pagan or wiccan religion/spirituality should look elsewhere."
0,"Poor quality product The idea around this board game is a good one--to make it cooperative. The picture on the board itself is a colorful and fun graphic. However, the quality of the product is very poor. The game pieces are on such thin paper and so tiny it is difficult to pick them up. It is VERY over priced for the quality of the product. Should be more like $5. Peaceable Kingdoms game, Stone Soup, is $10 instead of $15 and the quality is superb."
0,"Poor quality without supporting service I totally agree with the other reviewers: the quality is very poor. damage the card in the beginning. very easy to lose small cards. very cheap made. does not worth $12. The idea is fun. But there are other better games at this price(I mean quality). BTW, there is no way to contact the seller or manufacturer. No phone number, no response. Do not buy this. Buy something made in U.S. At least you can talk to someone when there is a problem."
0,"Evil, Self-Mutilation, Vomiting, Defecation, Oral Sex, Abuse Here's my review: In this video your children WILL SEE: Marilyn Manson rubbing a Bible on his naked crotch; Marilyn Manson mutilating himself by cutting his chest with broken beer bottles; A band member vomiting back stage; A band member forking a piece of excrement; Marilyn Manson performing oral sex on his (male) lead guitarist? They will hear a woman being abused. She was actually being abused or she was the best actress on the planet. They will see hate and agression, all in the creative guise of free speech - you couldn't call it entertainment. Oh yeah, there was some music in there too.It's America and he has the right to do so, to do so doesn't make it right."
0,"Don't buy! Don't waste your money! The original book was far better than this version. So was the 70s version, one of those ""Made for TV"" movies.Find the book wherever you can, and read it.

0,"Prince of Centeral Park Many years ago, I saw was fortunate to see off Broadway show ""Prince of Central Park"" Reason I say fortunate, is because UNFORTUNATELY this was in and out. Everyone I was every telling about this show has never heard of it. I have to say that that was THE most impressive shows I have ever seen. Many years later I came across this movie and was excited because I could finally share it with my husband who I was telling so much about the show. Unfortunately the movie was not done as powerfully as the show was. Even thought the subject is very moving. I wish this Broadway Show would be back."

0,"More Like ""Royal Rape"" The so-called ""hero"" of this book is nothing more than a rapist. For goodness sake, the first time they get together, he throws her down, holds her down and rapes her, and yet this is somehow supposed to be seen as romantic.This book is sickening. It does not deserve to be called a romance novel."
0,Not a great book! This is absurd. I don't know how the other reviewers judged this book. It is based on [assault] of an innocent girl and coersion. I'm forced to give a 1 star because no stars is not an option. The author is way off base in this one. I stopped reading the book when the prince mistook Angeline for Claire and proceeded to [assault] her.
0,"Shallow and Poorly Thought Out The best thing about Morey's book is the Recommended Reading list at the end. Too bad he didn't study some of the books he listed. John Howard Yoder could have helped him tremendously. For the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century. Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions. If you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war , this is not it. But if you want a shallow piece of work that may reinforce your prejudice, When Is It Right To Fight? may be exactly what you have in mind."

0,"Concept is interesting but, doesn't amount to much... It seems that Korine has just decided to make his script as controversial as possible so that it would at least allow him some publicity for a film that probably would have otherwise sunk without trace. Being a small independent movie, it suffers the effects of such a budget; bad sound, camerawork and even actors (apart from Sevigny). Unlike many other films that are similar in content and subject matter, Clark's direction doesn't raise it above standards. Boys Don't Cry is a classic example of an 'indie' film that has risen above prejudices concerning independent films due to Peirce's sharp direction and haunting photography."
0,"Horrible I am only 14 years old. I would think that a movie like this would have an impact on someone my age. It didnt. It nearly put me to sleep. It was the biggest waste of money in my life. I just bought it today and am throwing it away today also.All this movie offers is an inaccurate portrait or teens, and the story of a group of moron teenagers who thinks its cool to be going around drinking, smoking, engaging in brutal fights with people and other acts of vandalism, having sex with girls between the age of 12 and 15, and stealing from their parents.This was a huge waste of an hour and a half. I only gave this movie 1 star because amazon doesn't allow me to give it 0.If you are looking for a movie that offers the story of troubled teens, and is GOOD, Thirteen is the movie you wanna watch."
0,"I hate wiggers The sex, drugs, violence and constant marijuana usage didn't get to me. What got to me where the unbelievably annoying accents of white kids trying to be black.

0,"A modern-day ""Reefer Madness"" I watched this film with some at-risk teenagers and probably the funniest comment I heard was, ""They made this movie like a documentary because the rest of it is so fake."" When I first saw it, I was like other people who think that this is an artistic reflection of real life. I grew up with kids who used drugs and sex for recreation, and I imagined that things had gotten worse since I left my teens.Then I listened to the comments of teens who have lived in crackhouses, who have been shot at, who were raised by folks who traded their bodies for drugs or cash - and THEY'RE saying this movie is unrealistic.Telly, with his multitude of willing virgins, is more a dark fantasy of a teenage player than a real teen - rather like ""Reefer Madness,"" which had more to do with middle-class America's fear of marijuana than actual drug use. I wonder if this film will seem as dated in a few more decades as ""message"" films from the '60s and '70s."
0,"""kids"" will be kids People are forgetting how to make memorable films without having to shock people to get it noticed. There are a bunch of kids , wearing droopy jeans, with their undies hangin out, who do drugs and have sex. Full of annoying slang and even worse fashion. It was too ""directed"" and wooden. If I hear ""peace out"" one more time my head will explode...It was like watching one of those boot camp episodes on ""Sally"" Jesse Raphael.."
0,"If you want to send a message... I watched this movie when I was in high school. I hated every last minute of it, as did everyone I watched it with. The person who insisted we rent it apologized profusely. Spending two hours watching a movie about the type of person I was glad to see wind up in juvie was about as rewarding and worthwhile as shooting myself in the leg with a nail gun."
0,"Where was Robin Williams? The only thing that could have made this movie better is Robin Williams. I expected a ""wonderfully funny, bright and cheery"" (the New York Times) cameo performance by the Great Hairy Comedian, but instead I just got a bunch of kids talking about sex. Big deal, I can get that walking into Soho."
0,"Dreck for Dreck's Sake You have to have an affinity for what is most loathsome in human nature to appreciate the unrelenting vileness and a-morality celebrated in this movie. Okay, whether it is actually celebrated is, of course, arguable. However, this movie does nothing more than show us sordidness after sordidness: Teenage Telly practicing his favorite pasttime (next to getting high, perhaps)--painfully deflowering very young virgins; Telly kicking some poor slob nearly to death. Sex, drugs, sex, drugs, ad tedium.This movie might show us what *some* kids indulge in, but it really shows us nothing new, leads us to no new understanding of, well, anything under the sun except perhaps our own stoicism should we heroically make it through the entire movie.In a word: Blech!"
0,"It was stupid I can't imagine why anyone would praise this film. Okay maybe it is a reality check for our society, but so what?? It's a horribly acted, horribly scripted, uncreative, unoriginal and VERY exploitive film. The mere fact that it accurately depicts the lowest form of young degenerates in American society doesn't by itself make this a good film. Any idiot can film a bunch of teens having sex, getting intoxicated, beating up and raping people. But the film doesn't go beyond these depictions. it doesn't offer any solutions or explore the root causes of such behavior. And how many times do we need to be shown teens having sex or being raped to get the message? One time was shocking enough to be educational. Three or four times turns it into simple exploitation. This is little more than glorified child pornography."
0,"Boring This is low grade, boring, exploitative rubbish. Only shocking to the thoroughly naive. It's high rating is a testament to the gullibility of the general public."
0,"Absolutely horrible. This is by far the worst movie I have ever watched. Perhaps it is realistic if you live in inner city New York, or Chicago, but the majority of the world does not live like this. And there are very few teenagers that have the maturity to watch this and not think it's ""cool"" to do these things. This movie was all about shock value. And it looks like it served its purpose."

0,"Wow, this is BAD! I think this may have grazed my top ten list of bad horror movies (it is right up there with movies like ""half-caste""). This just redefined the word bad. It is defecation. The best way to describe this is to imagine an episode of the power rangers meeting an MTV boy band video: It has very bad acting, slow, generic killing scenes (each victim is surround by members of a boy band and smothered so you cannot see what they do to the victim) At least half of the movie is a generic music video (singing throughout the movie) You almost have to see it to believe it, and I definitely wouldn't recommend seeing it. This movie is the equivalent to getting kicked in the groin or going to the dentist. This movie will make you want to hurt someone, or vomit uncontrollably. It will make you want to peel your eyelids off with a fork. Oh and did I mention it was bad?"
0,Wow bad even by DeCoteau standards A real time waster. Not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that.
0,"Oh no... One star is being generous, this is probably the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen some pretty bad ones. I like B horror movies but this was WAY below that. It actually played out more like a gay porno movie than anything else with the blood ritual in black briefs? IF the movie were going for $4.99 I'd consider sending it to my cousin as a joke who loves zombie movies. But these weren't even zombies, they had grey makeup and looked kind of like the guys from V, the old movie/TV Show, but they didn't even have scales! It was just grey makeup! Do yourself a favor and run, don't walk, away from this film! Cooking with Porn stars was a better buy than this would be, and that movie was REALLY bad. I don't know who thought to sell it for $24, discounted to $22, but if they sell one at that price, it should just about cover the budget for the film with those ""special"" effects of the burnt zombies which were really piles of sand from down the beach on the same set."

0,"Quality is an illusion While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax."
0,"Emma - Noteable for dubious reasons There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered. It was written by a woman. If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit. The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's ""Frankenstein"", Kate Chopin's ""The Awakening"", Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple"", ""Nectar in a Seive"" by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" by Zora Neale Hurston. All of these works have better characteristics than ""Emma"", and prove to be superior to all of Austen's writings.Trust me, ""Emma"" is a waste."

The characterizations are awkward, the plot contrived, and the prose is so roughly handled it makes a reader queasy. Pride and Prejudice at least had a little humor in it, but ""Emma"" has no redeeming qualities. I don't recommend spending your time on this one."
0,"PRUNELLA SCALES NO HEIGHTS I've always been a fan of the British actress Prunella Scales and already own some of her readings of classic novels, including Cranford which she handles delightfully.So it was a big disappointment to find that she seems to have completely misjudged her narration of Emma. One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."
0,"Don't waste your time or money I bought this book because my book group had chosen it for a ""classic"" read. I can't imagine why anyone would waste their time and money on this book. I could barely get through the first 50 pages or so until I gave up on it. As far as I'm concerned, the characters were worthless and their activities were pointless. Why anyone still reads Jane Austen is beyond me. If this book is an example of her writing, it is terrible! People in my book group said her other works are better but I won't be reading them."
0,"Poor Condition This book is VERY poor condition. The pages are uneven and look like they were cut when the blade needed changing or sharpening or cut with too many at once.I am returning it to Amazon, the only good thing is that I bought it with Amazon, they are paying for return shipping. I have to say that I am very pleased with Amazon's CS. I am a frequent customer and will continue to be."
0,"Doesn't survive the test of time I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention."
0,"No classic in my mind After reading Emma by Jane Austin I am very much considering not reading another book by Jane Austen.I was very dissapoited with the book. I am new to readint ""the classics"" and after looking at several ""classic"" reading lists found this book to be on several. I decided to read the book and even completed it against my better judgement. I found the book extremely boring and would not recomend it to anyone outside of maybe teenage girls."
0,"Indypublish.com edition is a flimsy computer printout The name of the publisher should have clued me in to the fact that this edition is only an imitation of a real children's book. Perkins' original book was charmingly illustrated; this has no illustrations at all. This is disorienting as well as disappointing, since even the first line of the text refers to an illustration. The lack of illustrations greatly reduces its appeal to younger children. The edition is flimsily bound, and closely resembles a manual that might come with your new Kenmore washer."
0,"A disgrace to both original film and Margery Sharp! This Disney sequel, ""inspired by characters created by Margery Sharp"" totally rips the appeal of the original novels and the original Disney animated classic. This sequel hardly captures Sharp's world, it only offers the same title characters but those have become probably the most boring characters in the film. The whole thing has turned into a modern day ""adventure."" I really don't have much to say about the plot other than it seems to me as a remake of the first film.Even though the first film twisted Sharp's world a lot, it was still a fine piece of beautiful animation and smart storytelling. This sequel has nothing especial and has no heart. Skip it. There are better films out there. Too bad for Bernard and Bianca, though...

Nothing happens here that relates to the first movie, there was no need for it at all!But to have Miss Bianca and Bernard marry?! That's like shooting Margery Sharp!

My 8 year old daughter absolutely loves them, but what little I have read when reading with her is just gawd-awful. Thank goodness she can read these by herself. I find it hard to believe the spectacular ratings these books have received here. I found the writing to be almost unbearable. The author uses the same few adjectives, verbs and adverbs over and over again, and she seems incapable of writing a sentence that does not contain the repetitive names of two or more cats. Has she never heard of pronouns? Maybe the story is compelling, I wouldn't know, but no story could be compelling enough to make me wade through this horrible writing. True, the target audience of these books is very young, but writing for a third-grader does not mean one has to write LIKE a third-grader."

This book is NOT for young children. I don't want to have to explain to my son what at ""Cutter"" is and why cat's would be afraid of it. I don't think that young children should be hearing about the pleasure that cats (or any animals) get from a fresh kill. Those just aren't the types of things I want to introduce to him at his age. This book should really be targetted for older children (teenagers), not young readers. Besides the issue of the target audience, I do feel the writer does capture the feelings of cats as best as a human can capture an animals ""feelings"", but I also think that the writing is not particularly polished or engaging. I would not recommend this book."
0,"Frightfully BORing, ol' chap When I read that Hollinghurst had a new book out, and a prize-winner at that, I was really looking forward to reading it. I requested it from my public library and had to wait a couple of months for it to become available. After part 1, pg. 160 (Nick's first ""love"" affair), the book was due back, and I gladly returned it. Read the other 1-star reviews, and I TOTALLY agree with those in-depth reviews.I found it impossible to ""relate"" to and/or care about ANY of the characters in this book--two important criteria for a ""good"" book-- in my opinion."
0,Utter rubbish I agree with a previous critic that this is one of the worst books ever to win the Booker. I hated it so much - its obsession with people of no consequence and the belief that it was 'recording' something important. It is crass and banal. Awful. Don't get me started on its attempt to be shocking!
0,"Tremendous, unmitigated downer One of the worst books I have ever read. A perversion of an unquestionably great talent (and I don't mean the sex). The worst thing in art is using talent to send out a message that is without hope.There is a lot of very explicit sex in this book. No problem with that. The problem is that none of these mostly very unlikeable people learns anything, grows as a person, shows any degree of integrity or finer human qualities. They show the worst side of humanity, something worth looking at, but without a spark of hope for something better, it is just a collosal bummer.True art uplifts, inspires, enlightens. It makes us face up to the worst of ourselves and ultimately makes us glad to be human."
0,"Nig-Nog? One wishing to learn about racism in the gay community would do well by reading the collected novels of Mr. Hollinghurst. The graphically brutal rape of the white protagonist by the black cook near the end of The Swimming Pool Library is disturbing; but no less so than Hollinghurst's gratituous use of racial slurs and the stereotypical depiction of the ""black"" council clerk, Leo, in this contemporary ""masterpiece"".Not my cup of tea."
0,"nothing beautiful about it I had such high hopes for this book - nominated for all those prizes! If you're looking for gay fiction then this book is for you. It should be sold with the porn magazines - the first 100 pages ramble on and on about gay sex - but never get to a storyline. I tried to endure. I kept hoping there was a story! I grew up in Britain and thought this sounded like a great perspective on the Iron Lady (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher) and 80's Britain. But it's just about a guy trying to fit in with a bunch of snobbish upper class twits! Oh yes, and there's lots of gay sex."
0,"Boring, boring, boring I found reading the book very tedious. He takes chapters to say very little. I had to read the book for a book club, or I wouldn't have finished it."
0,"???????? i liken this book to fitzgerald's ""tender is the night."" and that is not a good thing. people of no substance plod through hundreds of dull dull pages. are people really this shallow? this empty? probably. but, my god, do i have to read about them? no. i do not. i simply could not finish this book (and that is rare). i wasted valuble reading time for about 300 pages, then had to admit it just wasn't working. because of all the critical acclaim this book recieved, i was very much looking forward to reading it. what a major disappointment! i am truly puzzled by the positive response this thing gets from so many people. great writing? really? i just did not see much of that here. shouldn't a book have at least one interesting character in it? it seems that dullness is making a comback in critical circles these days. too bad."
0,"the literary equivalent of watching grass grow This book wins my award for the most unreadable novel ever written: English twits talking endless twaddle. Thats all there is. No plot, no suspense, no conflict, no characterization, no development of anything--you could shuffle the chapters and it would make no difference in either the novel's outcome or rampant boredom. It is simply a litany of shallow upper class stereotypes making prissy comments about the insignificant concerns in their lives--i.e. a character's ""confusingly firm buttocks ... set off by his tight Fred Perry shorts."" That's about the depth of character insight one gets in this novel. Read it at your peril."
0,"Confusing even if you are not an idiot This book is poorly organized and confusing. The authors used way too many quotations from other sources, i.e. books, websites. In the end, I have to wonder what the authors' own take is on the subject. It doesn't have a backbone of its own, period."
0,"Do not buy REMANUFACTURED from this outlet! I received a broken waffle maker. Sent it back, received another broken waffle maker. Both were broken due to poor packing. They both were broke in a place that could not be fixed to be operational.Save the headache and buy the newer Waring Pro PROFESSIONAL waffle maker with the fold down handle. If you shop around you can find one for about ten buck more than the remanufactured cleaper line for a much better waffle maker, and brand new! Would NOT recommend rebuilt on this item. Would give ZERO stars not one! Also bad customer service."

0,"Don't waste your cash. Ok let me start by saying that this cd is really [bad]. The only thing that saves it is the song Cadillac. Other than that, this cd is about as good as shoving forks into your ears. It has some semi-decent music, but the lyrics are so [bad] it isn't natural. I think their are so many bands that are better than M.E.S.T. (like Good Charlotte, A Simple Plan, and my personal favorite The Sarting Line) that you shouldn't waste your money on this garbage, unless you want to hear the song Cadillac (which for some reason is really good), but i just suggest that you download it."
0,"posers they aren't real punk, they are just pop-punk. Good Charolatte (however you spell their name), A New Found Glory, Blink 182, and Sum 41 aren't punk either they are all posers like Mest.

0,"Junk -- will flood your kitchen Expensive and works for less than 3 years, at which time it will flood your kitchen. I've had two dispensers and both flooded the kitchen. How this product stays on the market is beyond me."
0,"save your money We listened to this once, and kept thinking, ""When will this end?"" It sounds like someone had a cheap synthesizer system, and put it together in their basement. After listening to this version, we put on a stereo recording we had of Bolero by a real orchestra. The difference was astonishing."
0,Strange sound I love music... all kinds of music. Ravel Bolero is one of my all time favorites... but certainly not this one. It was very disjointed. I wish I had save the $$$. If anyone wants it I'll let it go for 1/2 price!I do have to say that the sonics were great though. It did show off my system soncially... but I sure hated the interpretation of this ordinarily fine piece of music. I bet Mr. Ravel turned over in his grave when he heard it.
0,"Pathetic My rating for this product is no stars at all. Of maybe a dozen versions of this wonderful piece of music that I have heard in almost 60 years of music enjoyment, this piece must be the worst. I was so hungry for DVD-Audio surround sound recordings that I purchased two recordings from this company ""ears unheard"". This was the worst waste of money I have ever encountered. I would mail the disks back to the company to let them know my displeasure but it isn't even worth the postage.Yes, it is indeed a synthesizer all the way through. Feel free to purchase it but only if you totally understand that this is an experimental piece playing around with surround sound recording. DO NOT BUT IT IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A DVD RECORDING OF A REAL ORCHESTRA."
0,"expensive mistake I was very dissappointed in this disc. Syntesized instruments don't even come close to reproducing Boleros majesty,not to mention many were out of key,and it was a poor quality attemt at reproducing the sounds of the symphony instuments!!! Don't waste your money,I'm sorry I bought it."
0,A Decent Book Pick It Up ! This was a good book but not what I was expecting. The first few pages had me hooked but then I lost my my pace along with the author.Things that seem to make sense melt into a burning candle dripping down a frozen glacier two degrees north of the equator. Now I'm forever Three Doors Down ! Try it if you dare!!
0,Not worth the penny it cost The seller provided timely shipping. However the product is junk. The sound is muffled and intermittently goes up and down when I move the input cable. I guess you if you buy cheap you get cheap. I have since ordered a name brand device to cassette converter which I hope will work better.
0,"Doesn't work for me. I wish it worked -- but it doesn't for me. I have an old Land Rover Discovery with a working tape deck -- but I place this in with my iPhone attached and nothing.

0,"Toy has a basic design flaw We bought this toy for our 2 year old who loves to play with her toy kitchen. This is a basic fun toy - all kids love to take things in and out of something at this age.However, this toy has a basic design flaw and we ended up tossing it out after just 3 days.The basket holds onto the base with a very flimsy amount of plastic that sort of latches on the bar across the back of the base. This plastic makes a simple hook that is relatively easy for young kids to take on/off but it doesn't have nearly enough material to last. My daughter pushed down on the basket once and the plastic cracked and the backet then hung down. Then we tossed it and were very dissapointed.Hope this helps you pick a better quality toy."
0,Dont' waste your $$$...breaks within 6 months! We bought this showerhead so it could help our skin and my dd's eczema. It was great while it lasted but now cracked in 2 places and is unusable. I can't believe I paid over $60 for it!
0,"Expensive and poor quality - not a good combination Regardless of their orientation in politics, I think most people would agree that a dictionary should give objective definitions of ideas, not opinions of the author. This ""dictionary"" does not have an ounce of objectivity in it. The author frequently substitutes his opinion of an idea for the definition of it.Also, given the price, I expected a bigger book. It's not very large, though admittedly it has had most of the terms I wanted to look up in it.If I knew of a better dictionary for politics I would recommend it; since I don't, I simply recommend not wasting your money on this one."
0,"Wrong, very wrong! I started to read just the introduction and I started to sense that something was wrong, very wrong. Besides the assumption of eco-feminism as compatible with Orthodoxy, he discusses the occult he was deeply involved with in terms that made me more than uncomfortable: admiration, an ambassador's tone in describing occult matters, almost reminiscent of patriotism. This is the sort of thing one should speak of out of deep humility spurred by repentance from serious sin.This is the first time I have purchased a book that I thought was Orthodox theology and didn't get past the introduction before regretting I'd made the purchase.If you wonder, ""Does this critic have anything better to say?"" then <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/author/cjshayward"">I invite you to visit my own author's section.</a>"
0,"Very disappointing video This video focuses on children trying to sing their favorite songs. You don't see very many Sesame Street characters; it's mostly about other children. It lost my son's attention (14 months old) almost immediately.The first video (Kids' Favorite Songs) shows Sesame Street characters singing, and he loves this."
0,"We're dissapointed... My kids (age3, boy & girl) love ''KIDS FAVORITE SONGS'' video . So I purhased this video for them. We do not want to watch an interview program! I want to give my kids song video. I had been deceived by that title."
0,"Unimpressed! We have the first video Kids Favorite Songs, which my son just adores. I was so thrilled to find out that there was a second edition, and bought it for Christmas. It is terrible. He could care less about this video. It is not entertaining at all since they use mostly kids that can't sing, and hardly any puppets like the first one. Very dissapointed and a waste of money. Do not recommend!"
0,"Astonishingly Poor Re-mastering! I cannot believe that this imported product by Universal Music, that contains many of the most important recordings by the Four Tops would be ruined by poor digital re-mastering. The volume level for all of the tracks is low and the sound is thin and tinny. I own another Universal Motown GOLD SERIES box by Martha and the Vandellas and it is re-mastered at 24 bit and the sound is amazing. It is because of the Vandellas collection that I purchased this Four Tops set and instead of getting a real winner, I get a gigantic loser. It is so true that you can't judge a book by it's cover. Now that I have spent my money on this CD I notice that all of the other Motown Gold series critiques on Amazon have 5 star ratings except for this one which has no ratings at all. Poor sound is the reason. Well, you now have my rating of 1 star."
0,"Kindle Edition unreadable Aside from the other flaws pointed out, it doesn't have any chapter breaks. If Amazon doesn't want a good edition available for free for the Kindle, that's their business, but that this one comes up first on the search page sullies the reputation of the Kindle, of free books available over the Internet, and of Ulysses itself. (I'm not going to say Ulysses isn't a challenging read, but it's an impossible one here.)"
0,"This edition is an incomplete text! This edition omits most everything that appears in the print edition centered in the page, i.e. the poetry and songs like ""The Ballad of Joking Jesus,"" noted by other reviewers. Utterly unacceptable for a book written with care to every word."
0,"Unreadable This is not a story. This is nonsense. Other reviewers who called it ""unreadable"", ""verbal flatulence"", ""emetic"", ""well nigh incomprehensible"", are spot on correct. Unless you really hate yourself, do not attempt to read this book."
0,"This is a literary masterpiece??????? The book consists of an overabundance of mini-stories that are irrelevant to each other and there is no real plot. If you took this book into a publisher nowadays, he or she would probably throw it at you and then laugh in your face. I had to have been published on a dare, then banned as a publicity stunt. If you want to read it, I would suggest going to the library. Don't waste your money."
0,"Not for ebooks Ulysses is a book that must be held, not battery powered. I doubt James Joyce would like his books as ebooks. Any more than Shakespeare, Ovid, Milton, Boethius, Sartre, Shelley, Kazantzakis or Tobias would. It's not an appropriate fit. These authors transcended the instantaneous, the inelegance of electricity. They wrote by candle-light, just as Nureyev danced by candlelight."
0,"Pretentious intellectual self-absorption I was tempted to write this review after reading the other reviews. It seems that most readers had to struggle through it or use Cliff Notes. In short, it seems many succumbed to the peer pressure that it was a ""great"" book and that they just ""had"" to read it. It puts me in mind of someone going to an art gallery full of atrocious modern art and faking that they liked it to show how sophisticated they are. The truth is this book stinks.For one thing it is vulgar, which, I hate to disappoint anyone, requires no talent at all. This is a talent any six year-old boy possesses. Is the wordplay clever? Yes, too clever. James Joyce must have been incredibly pleased with himself.(...)himself."
0,"Awful Indecipherable rubbish.I bought this door stop because it is on everyone's list of Great Books. I read 200 or so pages and had to stop, I'd rather have a root canal without anesthesia than read the rest of it. I am a college educated English major, but how this random witlessness can share a shelf with Steinbeck, Vonnegut, Hemingway, Orwell or Forster and a number of other fine authors escapes me."
0,"This book is WAY overrated...definitely NOT the #1 book ever I know the Modern Library picked this as the #1 book of all-time, which was one of the reasons I chose to read it. However, I was sorely disappointed in it. I like books that I can read without having to scrutinize every page in abhorring detail. A book like Huckleberry Finn is a very readable book that I can read on one level and my son on another and both take a lot away from it. A book like Ulysses has only one level, and it's way to deep to enjoy. The ""story"" gets lost in the chaff. I have never used Cliff Notes in my life, but was forced to buy them about halfway through this book and was surprised to find some ""obvious"" things I missed. If you want a good book, read Frankenstein, Huck Finn, any Dickens, etc but skip this ""classic"" and leave it to those folks who like to disect a book and not enjoy it..."
0,"uggghhhhh uggghhhh, after nine months i finally finished this rambling, incoherent string of words.i took this book on because i'm reading the 100 best books of the 20th century (as defined by the modern library). i had read about 20 already before taking on this 'project'. so why not start at number 1? big mistake.when i bought it, i had no idea what it was about, and i actually became excited when i heard that it loosely followed the odyssey. was i ever disappointed. this book just kept rambling and rambling. 2/3rds of the way through i still didn't know what was going.the only reason i know anything about this book (even after finishing it) was because i went on the internet and found 'ulysses for dummies' - a cartoon depiction of the book. my suggestion, save yourself 9 months and read 'ulysses for dummies'whoever listed this as number 1 was smoking too much crack - since i can't afford a nine-month crack habit, i guess i'll never be able to truly appreciate it."
0,"Obfuscation incarnate! I had to read this (years ago) because I took English as a minor when I was an undergraduate. I cringe at the memory and the heated discussion I had with the professor (a Joyce fanatic). Now as a librarian I decided to give it another attmept, trying to keep an open mind. I have to give Joyce points for being clever and kudos for verbosity. After struggling through it again, I had to ask myself what was the point? Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun.To me as a reader, literature requires something more than an exercise in erudition or diction. I may be in a distinct minority here, but I still dislike Joyce for inflicting such a circus upon readers."
0,"Everybody's favourite pitch There are few books that could actually change your life, as in change the way you view artistic creativity, and Ulysses is one of them; reason being because Ulysses is the bible for modern writers in its unparalleld absorption of culture and human folly. Typically, this novel is a university favourite as there is so much to discuss, unravel and admire.I don't see how anybody can say that Ulysses is their favourite read. Like all of Joyce's works it is not particularly warm and, for me, wasn't a work to inspire and enflame the spirit. As you all know, or should know, Ulysses is the most important fictional text of the 20th century and that in itself makes it worthwhile to the patient reader."
0,"""What he's saying, I know not..."" Having gotten through ""Portrait of the Artist"" and ""Dubliners,"" I can now say James Joyce has to be the most arrogant, overrated author EVER. For someone with so clearly a gift for language, he lacked one important thing: THE ABILITY TO TELL AN INTERESTING STORY. Without a plot, it's just a bunch of random thoughts thrown at the wall, which is what this giant pile of excrement truly is. Don't buy the hype, I've read dozens and dozens of books deemed 'classic' and I found most to be labeled so for good reason. James Joyce is NOT a great writer, and this proves it. Awful, just awful..."
0,"A waste of your time Considered such a masterpiece - I HAD to read it. What a waste of time...First - the language: extremely difficult and archaic. Even for English speaking people. Can one enjoy a book if one needs a dictionary every couple of lines ?Then the allegedly 'cultural' riddles Joyce planted in the book for the sole purpose of torturing generations of English literature students and their teachers. Ask yourself - are you going to enjoy a book that neccesitates your literature teacher lie next to you and explain its 'sophistication' to you ? Every other page ?Then the foreign languages quotes in latin, german, irish, italian and who knows what else...Did Joyce expect his readers to be THAT fluent in other dialects ?Personally - I think Joyce wrote the book being completely drunk. Or worse.Last but not least - the story, the time frame and the main characters - boring, boring and then boring again.Your reading time could be used on much more pleasant, interesting books. Really."
0,Soporific I read somewhere that this book has been termed the greatest book of 20th century in American History. I absolutely have no clue why. I think its just a hype.This book is very dry in prose and its hard to keep reading for more than 10 minutes. For me its one of the most soporific books - it makes me doze off in a few minutes in the middle of insomnia.
0,"James Joyce Needed an Editor How could a book like Ulysses ever have made it to print? The grammar is so disjointed as to make it nearly impossible to read. Additionally, the point-of-view and writing style change in nearly every chapter after the sixth. It should also be mentioned that the story is not very well paced. The book is well over 600 pages long, but the events in the story appear to take place over the course of just a single day.I have heard numerous people praise this book, but that would seem to be largely posturing because the story is lost under the weight of inadequate editing."
0,"Der, I like stories! This is one of those books that ""smart"" people like to ""read."" Well if being smart means liking this, count me out! I don't know if it's modern, post-modern or what: but I know this much, I'd rather just curl up with ""Bridges of Madison County"" for a good cry! I don't understand why such a 'great' author can't seem to come up with a straightfoward plot that makes sense. I'd like to have seen Leopold patch things up with Molly, am I right? I mean, let's get down to brass tacks: don't we all hate those intellectuals who consider this one of the century's 'finest works of literary craft'? I mean these are the people who put ""Citizen Kane"" in the top ten...and totally ignored ""Life as a House""! (No offense, but Orson Welles is no Kevin Kline!) Unless Oprah puts it on her book list, I won't be picking this one up again, that's for sure."
0,"English writer,so how much you can expect from him? What an awful book this is?When an English/American writer try to explain his/her ideas about life(I mention ideas about meaning,purpose and philosophy of life)and when he/she try to do this with complicated ideas and long sentences(or like very short ones especially in this particular book);what his/her work become to is:A tremendous nonsense!!!When you see a book like that I mentioned above(and I also warn you against it),all you need to do is:RUN,RUN, RUN AWAY!!!NOTE:My ideas about English/American writers doesn't concern Shakespeare."
0,"Do not buy the Simon & Brown Edition The Simon & Brown Edition is a poorly laid out version of the novel. It appears as if a print on demand (POD) publisher hastily assembled the book from Project Gutenburg or some other public domain source. There are inexplicable spaces between lines and paragraphs, the dialogue is bulleted and has no quotation marks, the page numbers are all on the bottom left of the page, etc. Overall an amateurish attempt. I am returning this version today."
0,This book is NOT annotated! There are no notes in this book. It's just a copy of the text. Please title appropriately. That is all.
0,"Can't Read It, Can't Hear It Tried many times to read the book, thought maybe this would be better. It isn't. Nice package, though, and it will make a great doorstop."
0,"Hugely dissapointing I bought this having been a huge fan of the cartoon series, but Mr Joyce has taken a winning formula and produced a prize turkey. After 20 pages not only had Ulysses failed to even board his spaceship, but I had no idea at all what on earth was going on. Verdict: Rubbish."
0,"An exercise... Richard Ellman in his biography of the famous Dublin-born sponge, points out that Joyce was once asked why he was taking 12 years to write what would become Ulysses. Joyce was living in Europe, hitting up friends, relatives, and would be patrons for money as he masturbated away his talent right in front of the poor, half-wit woman he married. ""Because,"" he answered, ""I can't think of anything else to do."" That about sums up why this book in truth is an eruption of verbal flatulence, a screech in the literary void by a man who was not capable of doing what lesser writers could: compose a plot. There are scenes, passages and conversations from Ulysses that are truly brilliant--but that's all one can say about it. The tragedy is that a man of such talent, who would have secured a place in literary history if he had never written another word after ""The Dead"", felt obliged to labor his way through this doorstop of a novel, when he could have produced something so much better."
0,"text missing which is present in the project gutenberg edition I read a number of reviews pointing out that significant bits of text are missing from this edition, and often the reply is made that the present volume is probably based on the Project Gutenberg edition, and the text is probably missing from the Project Gutenberg edition as well.Well, I looked. In the first section Buck Mulligan chants in a ""happy foolish voice""--I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.My mother's a jew, my father's a bird.With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.So here's to disciples and Calvary.The text is in the P.G. edition, but is missing from the Kindle edition offered here. Amazon should remove this edition, it is a corrupt text falsely advertised as complete."
0,"Such a wretched waste of time Yes, ULYSSES is a mainstay of college literature. Yes, the book is a worthy literary endeavor. But for those who are not brutally devoted to the endless pursuit of mind-numbing genius, ULYSSES is tiresome, tedious, and passe. The appeal of reading the mind wanderings of a pasty, weak pseudo-intellectual grows stale after the first dozen pages. For those enterprising readers such as myself who feel guilty dumping a Joyce work after only a chapter, read on. It gets worse. Confession: the genius mind-maze that is Joyce is sometimes just not worth exploring. One would have better luck escaping the Minotaur than successfully exiting this lingual labyrinth. (Dr. Marcus Smith: I apologize for this heresy against the Modern Epic.)"
0,"The death of literature With _Ulysses_, Joyce truly showed the world what a elitist egotist he was. Unfortunately, too many academics were entranced by occasional flourishes of vivid imagery to see this sham for what it was (and is): An intense act of laziness and hubris by a writer who had trouble telling stories. I think of _Ulysses_ as the precursor to all the self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual garbage that turned so many people off from reading ""great literature"" over the last 60 some odd years. However, the greatest tragedy comes from the fact that Joyce had talent in spades and showed it on occasion, such as with many of his short stories. If he would have tried to make _Ulysses_ even semi-comprehensible, it may indeed have been as great as some make it out to be. In the end, though, it's all just gibberish without a story to drive it."

Description is different then what i receive that all i got to say i got the picture to show it. false advertisement given out cheap piece of crap...look GROSSS
0,"No quality control and minimal support! I ordered a set for a gift. While the chips were fine, the inside of the case was awful. The insert that holds the chips is flimsy and is too small for the case. The insert was cracked in several places, and glued support strips inside the case were exposed and sticky. Amazon was easy about the return. I spoke with a rep and ordered a replacement set on the condition that the set be examined before shipping. I was reassured this would happen. The replacement set arrived and was so bad that the first set looked good by comparison! Again, Amazon was easy about the return but never once offered any suggestion as to what I might buy instead, and offered no 'free shipping' as I had had on my original orders. I think there should be better quality control and I think Amazon should make an effort to ""make-good"" when a good order goes bad."

However the characters were just weird and the parady from Meet the Parents with the cat using the bathroom bordered on just plane discusting.
0,"Worst film I have ever seen, What was Alyson Hannigan thinking??? This has got to be the worst film I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones. Parody's like ""Scary movie"" and ""Not another teen movie"" look like Oscar winning Shakespeare films next to this disaster. Ever since I first saw her on BTVS I have always been a big Alyson Hannigan fan, it is rare to see an actress that can handle both sensitive dramatic scenes AND have a great sense of comic timing, neither of which are evident here, I really would like to see her mix in a few more dramatic roles like she did in ""Beyond the city limits"" (A Very underrated film!!!) but one more horrible disaster like this and the great career boost she got from doing BTVS and the American Pie films will have gone right down the tubes. What was her agent thinking even showing her this project??? Will some director PLEASE save Alyson Hannigan and offer her a great dramatic role to save her career!"
0,"Total waste of time. . . I've alread wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this movie. And beleive me that's time I'd like to have back. It pains me to have to spend anymore time dwelling on this drivel.There are two major problems with this film. First and foremost it's not funny. Maybe I missed an e-mail or a memo or something but I thought comedies were supposed to be funny. And secondly why is this movie "" unrated "". I saw nothing in here that wouldn't have been above a PG-13. My only guess is that without "" unrated "" plastered on the cover it wouldn't have appealed to such a wide audience.The four writers who had nothing to do with this movie have to be some of the smartest people in the world. So if you're eyeing this movie in the rental store, my only advice to you is to slowly back away and move on to the next movie on your list. Do that and you'll be lucky enough to be considered in the same breath as those four writers...some of the smartest people in the world."
0,i want my $20 back. this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen. it was a total waste of money and i want to light the disk on fire just so i can get some enjoyment out of it.
0,"worst. movie. ever. I normally don't write movie reviews because movies are very subjective but in this case, I'll make an exception. I had the misfortune of watching this movie, as I'm a fan of ""dumb comedies"" but this one fails. On every level. Do not waste your time with this one...TRUST ME ON THIS. It is so bad; I don't even know where to begin.Skip it."
0,"Unrated? I'm tired of all these movies claiming to be the Unrated Version and not offering a single thing that wouldn't be included without exception in a PG-13 movie. Add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and I'm pretty ticked-off. Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie, so I won't do it.Tried and true spoof formula is not properly hashed out in cheap attempt to cash-in on quarter-of-a-century craze(Airplane 1980). Top Secret, Hot Shot, Hot Shot Part Deux and Not Another Teen Movie are much examples of this (art) form.Might have given it two stars if they left the Unrated off the box.A lot more of Josh Meyers might have helped."
0,"Zero Stars if I could. It shouldn't even exist... This movie is by far the worst movie ever!!! I'm so pissed that I even watched it. The fact that I sat through this piece of [...] is my ONLY regret in life. Seriously...It's not funny. It's not... damn, it's not anything...I wanted to walk out of the theater so bad, but unfortunately, I'm cheap... so unfortunately I stayed.You're gonna watch it anyway, but don't say I didn't warn you!!!"
0,"not even worth a star the sad thing about me giving this movie a horrible rating is that i love comedies and didn't even expect it to be watchable. it seems like every year there is a new trend or two for movies. the past five or six years, i would bet that at least 1/3 of the theatrical releases have been either sequels, remakes, or spoofs of other movies. the reason ""scary movie"" works (assuming it works because a third sequel is in the making) is because it lampoons supposed scary movies for comedic effect. you know its a bad sign when the movies that DATE MOVIE makes fun of are funnier than the movie itself. also, to all the directors out there: comedy cannot be shoved down the audiences' throat, it has to evolve naturally from the situation."
0,"One of the All-Time Worst Movies Ever Made This movie is so horribly bad that I recommend mature adults rent it just to see how bad it is. My wife and I walked out on this movie after 20 excruciating minutes of stupid, senseless, parodies. At least there was a loose plot to Another Teen Movie and the first three Scary Movies, but not this one. Most of the kids in attendance were teens and preteens, which was not good because of the terribly insensitive scenes like the dating couple beating the heck out of a street bum, or the male date inexplicably faking a female orgasm for no particular reason other than to make you think they might be making fun of When Harry Met Sally.Only trouble is that these gags hit zero on the humor meter. Do not waste your money on this trash other than renting it for sheer morbid curiosity."
0,Wow An Average Rating Of Two Stars.......That Tells You Something! I have to agree with the masses. This movie is a total bore. The repetitive spoofs back to back to back are oh so annoying. My attention drifted away from this garbage and I startd surfing the net.Not only were the jokes bad but they were gross and unpleasant and demeaning. Even Allsion Harrigan as a thin person was not too pleasing to view on the screen. And the scene where the couple roll a drunk like its the thing to do is so mean spirited.Avoid at all costs. The people have properly spoken.
0,"Astoundingly bad Perhaps the worst mainstream, major studio release in the history of American movies. If it was 100 times better it might reach the ""so-bad-it's-funny"" level, but it is far worse than that. Too bad- Alyson Hannigan is hot and the reason I watched this. If she had performed the entire movie nude it still wouldn't be worth watching."
0,"STOP! BACK AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE...(its for your own good) Date Movie? More like a horrible blind-date movie. Instead of buying this movie, go buy all of the movies that this one spoofed. Because this movie is just incredibly dumb...(I was trying to think of a better word for it, but there is none) TRUST ME, if you are a fan of movies at all...don't watch this one, because it will turn you off of others for a while."
0,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!! I never thought in my life i would see a movie so bad. It was pointless. I love all the scary movies but now i know that whenever i see a bad part in a scary movie the 2/6 writers probaly made it up!
0,"Not deserving of two stars I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. I bought this DVD from Wal-Mart's bargain bin and I feel cheated out of $5. I tried to watch it twice, the second time skipping through the especially stupid and unfunny parts, and still could not bring myself to finish it. I've seen just about every parody movie Hollywood has come out with and this one is at the bottom. To quote a great comedy, Date Movie is ""dreadful, embarrassing, terrible, horrifyingly bad, bad, bad..."""
0,"RENT BEFORE YOU BUY I WAS DUMB,,I WENT OUT AND GOT THIS MOVIE BEFORE SEEING IT AND I REALLY WANT MY $12.00 BACK.. STUPID MOVIE,,,SAME DAMN JOKES AGAIN,,IN CLOSING DONT RENT IT DONT BUY IT!"
0,"always laugh at these parody movies...but not this one... The movie was funny the first, oh lets say about maybe the first 20-40 minutes. After that the movie is garbage. The humor and mocking was so dis-tasteful and a little offensive. The cat in the bathroom, ""dead mrs.jones"", the little jokes by the bachellor's parents, the bizarre family relationships, and the mock-sexual references to sex.I was very surprised at myself when i viewed the film. I hardly laughed and didnt laugh when I needed. Like I said I totally love these not another teen movie, scary movie type films...but Date Movie is pure garage. The humor is so awful and the mockery sucks tooBottom line: Horrible movie...never watching it again."
0,What's with all the yowling? Amazing jazz but would be much better without all the yowling (is he okay?). Because yowling seems to be part of the Keith Jarrett jazz experience this was my first and last Keith Jarrett purchase. Check out something by Bill Evans. Make the yowling stop! Please!
0,"Waste of money - Omega 3 oil... Snake oil After taking Thera Tears Omega-3 supplements for 3 months straight along with the Thera Tears eye drops, there has been absolutely no change in my eye dryness or redness. I purchased after reading overwhelmingly positive reviews on multiple sites, but considering that this is nothing more than 1.2g of fat and after noticing no effect myself, I believe this product is just another snake oil/placebo. Don't waste your money.As far as an omega-3 supplement, you can get about the same amount of omega-3 in Now's supplement for half the price and twice the quantity."
0,"Gave me a headache I purchased TheraTears for my eye discomfort from contact lense wear. I was taking 3 pills in the morning, just as directed on the label. I noticed I was getting migraines from taking the pills after the second day or so. I began to get headaches every day. After about the 5th or 6th day, I thought it could be from the TheraTears. I stopped taking them and the next day or two my headaches were gone. I have since discontinued use altogether. Unfortunately, due to the side effects, I wasn't able to use the product very long to assess if it helped with my dry eye. During the short period of time I did use it, I did not see a difference. By the way, this product is not FDA approved."
0,"this is a waste of time!!! the movies on this disc might be good,but from the very poor transfers here(droped audio,picture drop-out and freese pictures ,and all the movies were very very dark almost not watchable)you would never know. skip this mess and look for these movies elsewere!!!"
0,"Trash Infantile depiction of politics, sex, and Panama itself. Insulting screenplay for the viewer. The movie is pure bravado and seems made-up on the fly. No sense of understanding for the people or politics of Panama. Shockingly bad."
0,"Complete letdown I expected a film of at least some dramatic content with Geoffrey Rush alongside Brosnan, but sadly no. This film is awful. The screenplay is atrocious, the directing weak and the character played by Brosnan utterly appalling. My advice, don't waste your cash."
0,"A Keeper? 40 Used DVDs for sale says it all. Aside from the competition of all the used copies now for fire-sale of this bogged-down story, what keeps me from pitching this DVD is to show it as an example of how badly some critics' ""masterpieces"" so completely miss the mark. If you want the ""anti-007"", view the quality of ""The Prisoner"" series. And that ""print-bite"" of this being ""Casablanca without heroes"", that's as much baloney as ""Subway without heroes"" (sandwiches)!"
0,"Wasted effort Without a doubt this is one of the most alienating productions for otherwise good contributors; LeCarre and Brosnan. Having served in ""the trade"" from my twenties, I have encountered more than enough of the reprehensible elements that serve the intelligence field. But ""Tailor"" serves no redeeming message at all. If only to portray the negatives of human nature of some participants the field, the effort was wasted."
0,"Worst movie I've seen in quite a while I can't believe there are reviews giving this movie more than one star! It is a very bad movie. The dialog is muffled and hard to hear in parts, the plot very thin, acting mediocre. Stay away from this movie, or at least rent it and see how bad it is first.Geoffrey Rush does a good job, as good as can be expected from this weak script."
0,"A really stupid flick. I had a back pain, needed to lie down, and decided to look in the local newspaper what was on TV. This movie was listed with a 3-star (out of 4) rating, so I picked it to watch. I guess they would have given 3 stars to anything bashing American and British imperialism with its devilish plans against the proud people of Panama (which, if you don't know, is a Central American country, located where the canal is). There is absolutely nothing in this film to even partially redeem its incredibly silly premise. I first thought that the leading actor was James Woods, but it turned out to be another guy, what put the final nail in the coffin of my opinion. Save yourself the trouble."
0,"The Second Worst Movie Ever Made. Absolutely terrible. What a pity, Mr. Rush is usually so wise in the films he stars in. This is certainly two hours you will never get back. I've been totally robbed."
0,"Shockingly Terrible It's rare to a see a movie where it appears that the entire cast, director AND writer all phoned in their performances. But the Tailor of Panama is such a film. The heavy dialogue drowns itself and its actors, who don't seem to try to tread water. Rush and Brosnan are broad charicatures which might work in another film, but not here. The films jokes and attempts at wit are labored and artificial. What the heck does ""Casablanca without the heroes"" mean? The beauty of Casablanca was that there were no perfect heroes in that movie, everyone had their dark side. Watching this film made me flinch far too many times."
0,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I saw this a few weeks ago with a friend, both of us kept looking at our watches to see how much longer before the torture would end, this movie was SLOW SLOW SLOW, with no real plot. It had some great actors in it too bad they were in such a horrible movie!"
0,"Not worth your time A very deceptive title. Ian Rakoff worked on only a few episodes and his accounts are limited to a few encounters with McGoohan and trivial gossip around the show. The book should've been titled ""Ian Rakoff: A bunch of stuff I did that had nothing to do with the Prisoner."" Maybe 25% of the book is about working on the show, the rest is about his career before and after which makes for poor reading. I didn't even finish it because after the sections about the Prisoner it completely lost my interest. Anything worthwhile about the Prisoner has been written about in other books. Avoid dissapointment."
0,"junk-bad company they do not answer the phone,have called to say glasses cracked after 2 months,they have no phone service to talk to customer service-pissed"
0,"Unwatchable This is one of those films that are made to capitalize on star power, get quick results at the box office, and then disappear into the land of forgotten films.About a half hour into this debacle, which featured whiny children, predictable plotting, and overall lack of likable (or believable) characters, I was forced to just turn it off."
0,"Thoughtless ""The Bachelor"" looks and feels like it was conceived, written, and filmed over a long-weekend, as if it were a rehearsal for a real movie. Watching this is absolutely exhausting, as the script limps along in mind-numbingly obvious directions. Overall the acting is poor, but is otherwise shackled by inane dialogue. I'm ashamed for not having found something better to with with the 90+ minutes this movie stole from me."
0,It was beyond bad plain and simple I was disappointed in this album. no wonder the record label didn't want them to release it.
0,"Thumbs down from a huge Yes fan I got all five solo efforts by the members of Yes in 1975-1976, and the only good thing you can say about this one is that Alan White's effort (Ramshackle) was worse.As the other reviewers note, Steve Howe simply can't sing, and I find his attempts unlistenable. Those of you accustomed to crystal clear vocals from Jon Anderson are in for quite a shock if you get this album.Steve's guitar playing can also be pretentious, and this album lacks other band members to control those impulses. Don't get me wrong - he's a great guitar player. But I prefer good music to continuous displays of virtuosity. He seems to always being trying to say ""Hey, look how good I am"", instead of just trying to make good, coherent, well-structured music.If you like Yes stuff from this period, and want to sample the solo efforts, try Chris Squire's ""Fish Out of Water"" first. You'll be glad you did."
0,"Oh ! the pain. I remember buying this album in anticipation that they would continue where ""Sir Army Suite"" left off. Unfortunately my hopes were dashed and found myself with a new frisbee. I tried listening to it a couple days later hoping that what I heard was a bad dream and that it would be something I could salvage...only ""all good things"" was the only track that had an ounce of playability attached to that word.There so-called come back album or final epitah ""Magentalane"" would only confirm the bloom was off the rose and that Klaatu had nothing more in the tank or anything to offer."
0,"Yikes! With the exception of the first track, I Can't Help It, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile on here. It sounds like they phoned it in on this one. It must have been a contractual obligation record and is actually a painful listen. All you need to play is the track Sell Out, Sell Out and you'll catch on. Sell out, Sell Out ... says it all."
0,"Sorry I bought it. Less than three months after purchase, it's in the shop; an authorized repair center. Picture started ""snapping"" 'till no more picture. They replaced the picture tube and something else. I took it home. Then, it started displaying flickering white lights across the top of the screen and a vertical rectangular discoloration on the left side of the screen. They've been working on it for a week ..."
0,Waste of Money We purchased this product because of its filteration system claiming it would help eliminate hard water stains on our shower doors and walls. It does not work at all and the design of the shower head is ugly. The product was delivered as promissed but without any return address or customer service information.
0,Really aweful movie! Extremely boring with a very weak storyline. This is compounded by the fact that it is very poorly executed. You will start snoring after the first 10 minutes as you realize that there is no character development at all! This movie was so aweful it put me off from seeing other movies for a week...it was that bad! Minus 2 stars!

0,"This is not worth buying... I purchased this product and used it for a couple months... and the click of death happened.I UPS'ed it to the Seagate specified RMA center and received UPS confirmation that someone signed for it at their reps facility.Unfortunately whoever signed for it misplaced it and SEAGATE, is stalling on sending me a replacement drive. The drive was received 11 days ago and they can't get any confirmation from their shipping and receiving dept.I didn't purchase this from amazon, but wish I hadn't purchased it from anyone else either.SEAGATE customer service is the worst, a five year guarantee attracted me to seagate, but it doesn't appear to be worth much."
0,"Fell Asleep. Viewed: 5/05Rate: 25/05: Plainly awful, Airplane II: The Sequel seemed to be a deja-vu of the first movie without anything new to add. The cast was terrible, and even Lloyd Bridges couldn't save the movie. Thinking of the cast, I would like to torture the odious character of Stephen Stucker. On a large scale, the humor was too minuscule at best, trampled by the comparison to the first film. Obviously, there is no story, just a stupid repeat of the same plot used in Airplane!. During the movie, there is a particular scene where Striker narrates his sad story to the lady beside her. She got seasick by the sound of it and proceeded to vomit in a bag. In the end, she got all dried up to the bone. That's exactly how I felt about Airplane II: The Sequel."
0,"More Groans Than Laughs Weak, derivative, and thoroughly unfunny - classic example of a studio cashing in with the old Good Movie Rehash. (...). Although what's funny and what isn't is often a matter of opinion, the element of surprise is what defines humor. We laugh when the unexpected happens. But having seen it all before in the original, nothing - and I mean NOTHING - is funny in Airplane 2. Even the new jokes are variations on a theme. Save your money and watch Airplane! twice."
0,"Airplane 2 Crashes Sequels are often cheap imitations of the original and more often than not, they're usually pretty bad. And ""Airplane 2: The Sequel"" is no exception. The producers and writers of this lackluster endeavor obviously didn't put a lot of thought or effort into making this film. Much of the material is nothing more than a variation of what was in the original ""Airplane!,"" which makes for a rather dull and predictable movie.In ""Airplane 2,"" the writers do try to vary the plot a bit by changing the venue to the 21st century but this does more harm than good. This futuristic setting has some comic aspects but it never really connects with the audience. There are also some futile attempts at political/ethnic/sexual humor but they too fall flat.This is a second-rate movie that never gets off the ground. Don't waste your money on it."
0,"Ouch...Airplane II pains me. No audio commentary to find out what the director was thinking...Airplane II is a travesty. Even if the movie hadn't hastily re-staged almost all the same jokes, excluded the presence of Leslie Nielsen, and generally just sucked...it gets major horror points for having, at least on the VHS copy, a short animation after the credits saying ""Coming Next Year from Paramount Pictures: Airplane III!"" Obviously, someone thought it was going to be a hit...they were wrong. I honestly laughed once at this film, at the classic viewscreen gag performed by William Shatner. What a waste of a lot of people's time."
0,"Strictly for Seattle radicals (all others need not apply). This movie is in black and white (better still, in black and red!) and I don't mean colorwise. It's your standard politically-correct hagiography where good guys ooze beatitude, bad guys reek evil, and if you don't root for the former, you belong with the latter. Like history told this way? If so, then you're gonna love it; if not, at least you'll get some laughs.Mind you, it's not that I object the fake look, dubbed dialogue, hammy overacting or holier-than-thou attitude of everyone concerned in this dated political flick from the sixties; I mean, we were all pretty much ridiculous ourselves back then. But Joan Baez's awful lyrics and worst wailing tear apart the movie's only redeeming asset: Ennio Morricone's beautiful music score. Now that's a true crime!So you've been warned!"
0,"Afflu-Repetitive I had to read this book for summer reading for an AP Gov course. It was a dreadful experience. It was very difficult to force myself to read more than one chapter per sitting because of the book's repetitiveness and dullness. If you actually want to read it, let me save you the time while I summarize it:-Spend more time hiking than working.-Don't get a well paying job, because it will make you miserable and you will undoubtedly go into dept.-take a low paying job, because life will be great. As long as you dont want to buy anything.-Don't buy material goods that make you happy.-Only nature and people make you happy.-Rich people, 90% of the time are littering, stuck-up, scumbags.pack that into 250 pages, and there you go."
0,"A Pointless and meaningless rant I dont know how many times I have read this same book: It rehashes the same old stale arguments heard over and over. The material world is bad, spending is bad, consumption is bad... yap yap yappity yap.Nobody denies that there is something wrong with our economy and culture, and we need to fix that, but the boring and unoriginal rant that Simon offers does nothing for our understanding of the dynamics or nature of consumerism.In the end, this book is nothing but a empty status symbol for the kind of consumerist yuppies that Simon seems to abhor. If you want to show people that you are a concerned pseudo-intellectual, who is all concerned about the future of our planet and society, you buy this book and have it lying around your house.What a load of pretentious crap."

0,"Utterly charmless. Surely this marks the end of Madonna's movie ""career"".To be quite honest it's not entirely her fault.The Next Best Thing is victim to flat direction and an awful script.Is this really the same John Schlesinger who made a film called Midnight Cowboy over thirty years ago?..."
0,"Not Just ""Borderline"" Terrible--It Is Terrible! Thank your ""Lucky Star"" if you miss this one. This movie is so bad I don't know where to start. I don't like Madonna to begin with. It's bad enough that I have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers, but this so-called ""movie"" is quite possibly the worst thing she's unleashed on the public. It's even worse than ""Body of Evidence"" and that's saying something. Maybe I'm prejudiced against Madonna, but I was willing to give this movie a chance...boy, do I regret it. I want my two hours back."
0,"Wished for more.... I had high expectations for this movie and anticipated what I should expect with controversial storyline and the incredible cast. However, it saddens me that the movie lacked realism and honesty. Being a huge Madonna fan, I really was hoping for more, but her performance felt forced and lacked sincerity. I felt most of the performaces individually were outstanding, but with Madonna's ""acting"" the film just didn't work. I do encourage you to see it, explore it, and make your own opinions, but that is mine and I'm staying woth it."
0,"Madonna is an embarrassment... This movie is So very bad on so many different levels, that it is almost beneath any serious movie lover or critic to waste time viewing it. Madonna is at her all time low, and it is a low that few stars ever reach. She is a terribly bad actress and this time out, she made even her die-hard fans cringe in embarassment for her. Simply put, there is no guesswork here...there is not a redeaming quality in this movie. The acting, script, direction, tone, pace, etc., are all at an extremely shoddy level, and DAMN is she getting painful to look at. The only comfort comes in the knowledge of the FACT that this movie was completely shunned by not only critics but by the public as well. Even Madonna's legion of fans couldn't get her out of this one. It bombed on every level."
0,The Next Best Thing The product came quite quickly but unfortunately I'm unable to watch it because it says it's from a different region.
0,"hate this movie... i don't like this movie at all. the plot is just dumb and really bad. the soundtrack is good though. i can't say that madonna is one of the best actress out there but she has a few, good decent films. if you're a fan, just skip this one."
0,"Tragic..... The best that can be said is that this movie kept me watching...I kept waiting for Madonna to 1) figure out where her accent was coming from and 2) let go of the stiff, tense, and downright atrocious acting. Look, I'm not anti-Madonna. In fact, I wanted to like this movie and I still applaud the theory of a ""family movie with a twist"". However, this movie was truly horrid. The acting was so appauling I cringed everytime a laugh was expected. If you are interested in a dumbfounding waste of time, watch ""The Next Best Thing."" Side note: I'm horrified that this was the same director who brought us ""Midnight Cowboy""!!"
0,"The next best thing to tonsilectomy! I just had my tonsils taken out, and that was the most painful experience of my life. Watching this movie was a close second.Madonna has got to be the worst actress to get on a movie screen. Her inability to express any emotion is uncanny. Rupert is no better. Just because someone speaks with an English accent, that doesn't make him a good actor (as some reviewers tend to think). He literally competes with Madonna throughout the entire movie to see who will put the least effort and emotion in a scene. At least Madonna has got her music to fall back on. The plot is so silly that it doesn't even deserve a mention. The dramatic turn, half way through the movie, only makes the actors more uncomfortable, becoming even more unconvincing.Please, Madonna, stick to your music. We love your albums, but your movies stink!"
0,is it a surprise that Madonna ruined a film? Just god awful!!!! Madonna cannot act worth anything!!!! She can barely make decent albums now much less act. You know Rubert only did this as a favor!!! Please!!!!!! Just sad!!!! Not even worth buying if it were 99 cents.

0,"Awful! I had to keep checking the front page to make sure this terrible book was by one of my favorite authors, Diana Palmer. Every character in this novel was one-dimensional, and the book was so dialogue heavy. It never SHOWED me what the characters were feeling, but only what they were saying. I love Diana Palmer but this book was such a dissapointment. I wanted to love it, but I did not care about whether the characters got together or whether they lived or died. This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The only reason I finished it was to be fair to one of my favorite authors. Pass on this one; it's a waste of time. Try Palmer's Lacy."

0,"returned it - preaches deceit; more fluff than substance The author's target audience seems to be salaried employees working unpaid overtime, who are overweight, out of shape, watch too much TV and get too little sleep. His solution to the unpaid overtime is to lie to your employer and coworkers about how much you work at home, use oversized containers to take work home so it looks like more, schedule outside appointments late in the dy so you can just go home, etc. A lot of the book is aimed at helping people take better care of themselves and get their priorities in order, which I applaud. But that isn't what I was looking for in a time management book. I was looking for practical strategies for organizing my work and time, which it is thin on. It has some, and there are some very good ideas in there, but not really much more than a good magazine article."
0,I wan't my money back! There's not much I can say about this movie other than after about 30 minutes it was so painful to watch I had to get up and leave. The senseless action is just unbelievably overdone and predictable. I would rate this movie at zero stars.
0,"Bonus Features Review This movie stinks. Action movies with kids in the story are lame, this one is no exception. I like the Mummy Movies because I like Egypt and the history, but the winks at the camera and the kid are so dated -- it really makes a bomb out of this. Attempts to incorporate every action movie staple really wear thin -- like the pigmy mummies clearly using the Lord of the Rings troll figure -- whatever his name is -- didn't see it -- never will.But there is some true humor here listening to the director commentary and how clueless he is to just how horid this film is. He even ridicules Roger Ebert who had legitimate complaints that these knuckleheads dismiss out of hand -- like they never considered, or finally realized, the movie wasn't good.Some positives: Rachael Weisz is great -- and so is all of the cast -- wasted by bad period directing. ILM effects are great and fun to watch. Some of the extra features are difficult to view, with no ""play all"" option."
0,"wrong product I ordered this for an October birthday. imagine my surprise when we opened the product for viewing and found not ""The Mummy Returns,"" but ""The Mummy"" (which I had also purchased)."
0,CAUTION! Unplayable format HD DVDs are an obsolete technology that WILL NOT play in a Blu-Ray player. Some companies will send you an upgrade to the Blu-Ray version for a fee ($4.95 + $6.95 S&H). DO NOT BUY THIS FORMAT!
0,"Mummy Dearest Such trash the movie studios insult us with. The Cringometer peaked over the red line from the opener and climaxed with some of the worst CG ever. The Rock- more like The Crock! Possibly the worst film in any aspect ratio, preferable on NO SCREEN. Had hoped that Stephen Sommers would be sent into exile for this sub-par Jules Verne abortion, but we've just seen Van Helsing and don't understand why he hasn't suicided."
0,"No Return I received this product in a very timely fashion, however I did not realize that it was only for an HD DVD player, (error on my part). Once I realized I had made this mistake, I contacted the company to exchange for regular DVD or Blue-ray. They told me that they only have HD-DVD's and would not refund. Lesson learned I guess.Not very timely in their response either way nor good customer service.I would not recommend."
0,"1 star for the edition, 3 for the movie Not a very great sequel (like most), but come on, enough already with the double dipping. Granted, we all KNEW this would come out as soon as they announced the third film (I don't count any film starring a has been wrestler as a sequel, sorry, that's just how I roll). Seems we get two new featurettes, and again, as SOON as the third film comes out on DVD, there'll be ANOTHER re-release. Wait for that one, I'm sure it will be ""fantastic."""
0,"bad this is one of the worst movies ever made. I have no clue why it was so popular. First of all, the story is so stupid! Scorpion King? Give me a break! And the special effects look terrible. Woody Woodpecker looks more realistic. If you see this movie, be prepared to see humans interacting with cartoons most of the time. So I guess this movie is just like 'Space Jam.'"
0,"Plays like it was adapted from a video game. If you like non-stop action, care nothing for story or character, and enjoy watching digitized monsters die in a variety of ways, this is the film for you. Otherwise skip it.Brendan Frazier's son has been kidnapped by a powerful, ancient being. In order to save the boy, Frazier must take on countless hoardes of bad guys in a variety of locations. He mowes through them like a superhero from a video game, and despite the non-stop action I found this film almost as dull as watching someone else play Quake for two hours."
0,"AWFUL MOVIE I saw this pathetic movie when it first came out last May and was completely disappointed with it. It's got to be the worst film I've seen this year. The acting is completely lousy as is the script. There is no story at all, the movie is just a bunch of guys running around killing mummies. It's ten times worse than the abysmal first - give THE MUMMY RETURNS a skip."
0,"pretty bad If you loved the first one, this one might be worth a rent from the video store, but i thought that they were both pretty bad."
0,"The worst I've seen in a long time! Never-ending boring unoriginal special effects, that would have obscured the story if there had been one, larded with (not spiced with!) mysticistic egyptianesque mumbo jumbo and mushy sentimentality. The only vaguely interesting scenes are the fights between the bad lady and the good lady. I am glad that I viewed this film as a recording - this allowed me to scrole past (fast view) the uninteresting parts - about two thirds! All this is not the fault of the actors! Its too bad because I liked the first one."
0,"Mummy, I Want To Go Home The Mummy Returns is the worst kind of CGI explosion. Visual noise splashed across the screen without rhyme or reason. An action = entertainment mish mash of woefully inadequate characters, couldn't care less, just plain stupid plotting and special effects turned up to a brash, artless, over-reaching 11.Brendan Fraser struggles valiantly against this background of technical hysteria to give something approximating a likable performance with absolutely no help from the so-called script. And the only suspence in this 'worst of its genre' action horror flick was not knowing whether it would ever end."
0,"This should have been a good movie... but it really wasn't. The returning characters display none of the character traits that made them entertaining in the first movie. The movie simply careens, in a nearly plot free fashion, from one set-piece of computer enhanced combat to another. Now, I like a good, violent action movie as much as the next guy, but this one wasn't good. Watching it reminded me of watching somebody play the ""Mortal Kombat"" type video games of the 90's. If the producers had spent half of what went toward special effects on a better script, this movie could have lived up to its predecessor."
0,The Mummy that Wasn't First of all I was really disappointed in this movie. The first Mummy movie was Excellent. This second movie had no storyline whatsoever. In the first movie The Mummy becomes mortal and Mr. O'C.onnell kills him. Well in the second movie when they dig him up out of the ground and he becomes alive again. How did he get his powers back?I'm not criticizing the acting. I feel that the cast did what they could with a less than adequate script. I feel with a better written script that the Mummy Returns could have been just as good as the first movie.
0,did not save best for last The movie is really sorry.It just doesn't make sense. Plot doesn't flow. It is like it hade been wrote by third graders. However the special effects are good. Rent it first and you will not buy it
0,"If only Hollywood... Could stop making horrible movies such as this, then there'd be a chance for something good to come out more than usual. I can't begin to say how bad it was. The SFX weren't nearly as good as the first, the acting was worse (though I didn't think that'd be possible), and the worst part about the movie was The Rock's head superimposed on a scorpion's body! Ye gods, that was pathetic. I was going into the movie expecting a massive 3-man brawl b/w the Mummy, Fraser, and The Rock. That would've made the movie more enjoyable, but alas, Hollywood couldn't be that interesting. So, if you're looking for an enjoyable action flick, look elsewhere. Go buy ""Predator"" and see what Hollywood used to put out as an action flick. Don't waste your money on this trash."
0,UGGGH! Save your money! This is THE WORST movie sequel I have ever seen. It was so terrible that it inspired me to write my first movie review ever on Amazon. Where's my receipt? You might enjoy this flick if you're less than 10 years old AND in possession of a single digit IQ. It's a huge disappointment following the original Mummy flick. I would like to give it a negative star.
0,The Mummy Returns The Mummy Returns was a huge disappointment to me a huge fan of the great B movie fun of the first one I was absolutly disappointed by this unimaginative typical hollywood sequel formula shlock designed to seperate you from your money with the least amount of effort.Note to hollywood..special effects AND an intelligent story line are the keys to a good screenplay I already have dim hopes for the third installment yet to hit movie theatres.I would recomend to Mummy Fans save your dollar just go watch the first one again it at least frolicked in its own silliness enough to be fun or go watch Indiana Jones Nuff said...
0,"Bad, Terrible, Awful, Horrid..... OK, now I'll admit to sort-of liking the first installment, if for no other reason than it was a reasonably entertaining couple of hours.The sequel, however takes ""suspension of disbelief"" and throws it off a cliff. I would point out some of the plot holes, but I'm still trying to figure out if there ever really was a plot in the first place. Sure the CGI graphics were interesting, but what's the point?There were what, a quarter million or so members of the 'Medjai' in that valley scene just waiting to go up against the Scorpion King's unholy army? Just take a few riders on a ridge over looking a valley, and paint in CGI replicas until you run out of room in the frame.Oh yeah, the DVD is also chock full of self-serving promo junk like stuff for the Scorpion King movie and some hokey-looking Universal Studios attraction. There's a commentary track, but I don't think I could stand to sit through it again.And the upcoming ""Scorpion King"" looks even better....."
0,It stunk This movie isnt even worth rental.Everthing was boring and the mummy was fully regenerated in the first 30 minutes.It wasnt evenworth the one star it got.
0,"Terrible, Terrible Movie! I loved the previous and original 'Mummy' movies, but 'The Mummy Returns' is a complete insult to the audience. The overwhelming, annoying amount of special effects? (Do you remember the cheesy images of the Scorpion King at the end? What was he doing winking at the camera?) The plot that completely forgets that of the previous 'Mummy' movie? There are many actors in this movie with some great potential that spend the whole movie ""acting"" to the special effects? The only thing we are telling the Hollywood studios, by making this movie one of the highest-grossing of the year, is that we want computer special effects to take the place of real acting and story. If we quit wasting our money on terrible movies like this, Hollywood will realize that we are tired of stupid movies like this and start making real films again!I want two hours of my life back!"
0,"SO VERY STUPID & CGI SATURATED!!! First off, did all you people see the same stupid & overblown movie I saw? How can any of you say this film is even entertaining to a bus full of cretins? The computer graphics are so overblown that the movie may as well have been a cartoon! Terrible acting, awful & predictable plot, lousy special effects! Too much! A flying pirate ship? Let's leave the supernatural to the mummies & the realistic to the humans. I really & truly can't understand what anyone would like about this idiotic waste of time. Trust me & ignore every other review!"
0,"Chock full of dumb The Mummy was a dumb movie, but it was a big, fun dumb movie. It managed to weave a bunch of old movie cliches together in a novel way and package it with some fun performances and neat special effects. The Mummy Returns is a dumb movie, but it's not fun, it's just dumb. You can pull something like The Mummy off once, but forget about trying any sequels. Summary: AVOID"
0,"THIS MOVIE [STINKS] Normally I would never write a review, I just don't. But as we have all learned from this past week, terror stirrs us to action. Don't even spend time thinking about spending money on this movie. This movie was almost as bad as Battlefield Earth! Plus, it is in some pre-order competition with the Simpson's Complete 1st season, so don't let the world think that this moivie is even a little good! Help Brendan Fraiser save the world from the Mummy, by not buying it, or even talking about it, or saying the name of the movie out loud!"
0,"Dumb... I just saw this movie last night and It amazes me that The Mummy Returns made as much money as it did in the box office. I believe the theaters should have pad us to see this one. The first Mummy was OK, but not great. I would have given it two stars at the most. But this one only gets one, and that's because I had to put a star up there. If I had a the option it would have got a big fat goose egg. If you plan on buying The Mummy Returns... please return it."
0,"i have seen better 3rd grade plays I thought this was going to be a good movie, WRONG!! I want 2 hours of my life back. The acting was bad, the story was terrible, and the visual effects were even worse."
0,"What a waste of time This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector's Edition. The picture quality is excellent. The DTS soundtrack (yes, this is standard on the R4 DVD unlike the R1)is of reference quality and quite outstanding in dynamic range (especially in the water-wall sequence). Unfortunately, the film was a total waste of time and I think studios should be paying audiences to watch films like this. No where near as good as the original -very formulaic and it felt almost like a cartoon with its over reliance on CGI. I scanned through most of the movie and I feel sorry for everyone who thinks this is worth buying. Even if a free copy was offered I would not accept -because I would never watch it again! And the bonus materials! Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic. I hope I'm not a minority who thinks film substance is still more important than its technical merits. I have invested in home theatre to enjoy films not gunfire, car chases and explosions."
0,"Ugh. Should be Zero Stars The title of the review says it all. This was the worst movie of the year, and one of the few times I ever wished I had walked out of the theater early. Special effects cannot make up for a thin, unbelievable plot. If you are going to set a movie in the real world, nearly a century ago, try and stick with historically accurate props and storylines. A rocket powered blimp just doesn't cut it."
0,"one of the worst movies I have ever seen Please, do not waste your time watching this movie. It is not only a waste of time, but a waste of money too. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I almost left when I watched it at the cinema."
0,"OK as a monocular, not a binocular I could not get these to form a single image of a star or planet because the two tubes are not exactly parallel. I do not know whether that was a quality control issue of the pair I had, or the overall quality specification is so poor that misalignment is typical. Mine went back. A properly aligned pair would be a considerable bargain. If you buy these, buy them from a place with a good return policy. Keep the packaging and invoice."
0,"Help!!! I'm Melting... I bought this as one of my mom's Christmas gifts. Within 2 days the spout cover (not sure if that is the proper name) was melting! The tea kettle was barely used and was not burned or mistreated. Needless to say, I have returned this item for one without a plastic spout cover.Good luck if you actually buy this kettle! I am shocked because OXO usually has great products!"
0,Nasty Metallic Taste We will be looking forward to throwing it out because it gives off a nasty metallic taste after heating the water. We thought it was the tap water but it is indeed the kettle. It makes me pretty upset because my wife drinks a few cups of tea everyday and I dont know what kinds of metals/toxins she is ingesting. Please beware. We had a Zojirushi hot water pot that broke during our move across the country. Please check that out...its the way to go although it costs $100+. They are popular in Japan. We will be getting another one and forget about any kind of kettle from now on.
0,"Poor quality After just a couple months of use on a gas stove, the plastic cap over the pour spout melted. It eventually cracked and fell off. Guess you're supposed to boil your water on a simmer."
0,"Useless I didn't get very far with this cd series so my review will not be very thorough or technical. But what I would have wanted to know before I made my purchase, is that it is a very regional dialect that is spoken in this cd set (Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian dialect). Which is fine if that is what you need, but since my husband is Egyptian, I would like to be able to communicate with him and his family in their own dialect. It was actually pretty comical listening to the first cd with him because he kept saying, ""What? No, we say it this way..."" until we just turned it off.The Egyptian dialect is also more widely recognized throughout the Arab world since Egyptian movies, music, etc. are a big part of Middle Eastern popular culture - so even if you don't have Egyptian family, I think that it would not make sense to learn the spoken Arabic with this dialect - it's difficult enough already!"
0,"The Worst movie of the decade! This movie broke down on numerous occasions into the realm of the unbelievable. Even fantasy and sci-fi movies present ideas and events in a way that the audience can accept as logical for the story. But Mission Impossible contains scenes that are stupid, illogical, unnecessary, and unrealistic.Why would a man who is a genius and the mastermind of the MI Force betray his country and his friends for a mere million dollars when he could easily obtain it legally? Why would this man turn his back on his enemy to kill his friend? How could a man survive a helicopter explosion while traveling at high speed in a tunnel?This is not just a bad movie, it is an insult to all fans of the TV series. Obviously the producers did not care about that. They are only after a quick buck from the name recognition. This is SHAMEFUL!"
0,"Why is this called Mission Impossible? First off I enjoyed the film greatly. Having said that, why make a film and call it Mission Impossible then make it so that it is the exact opposite of the TV series. I could just about accept the plot apart from the apalling travesty of making the baddie Jim Phelps. I would like to know how Paramount could sanction this. It is no wonder Peter Graves wanted nothing to do with it."
0,"Mission Horrible Mission Impossible TV Series had some bad chapters especially duringthe Sixth and Seventh Seasons. However, these Episodes were muchbetter than this Film starring Tom Cruise. This is really a horriblemovie."
0,"I was dissappointed Fans of the TV series should be dissappointed and angry that a good show has gotten into the wrong hands. There is none of the intrigue or ingenuity that was so integral to the series. The movie could have and should have been made under a different title. Why was it necessary to spoil the memory of a great TV series with this nonsense?Without revealing any of the plot, let me just say that the denouement is particularly awful, in that it puts one of the main characters from the TV show in a very negative light. This particular plot element was completely unnecessary and un-called for. No reason to see this at all."
0,"Darn it I ordered three of the Mission Impossible DVD's but from different places. When I tried to watch this dvd, it would not play. It arrived in on time just wasn't able to watch it. Darn it."
0,"Only if You Love Tom Cruise And unfortunately so many people do. Blatant vanity project, the movie's saved only when director Brian DePalma kicks in with his brand of blazing comic book action - which is great, yes, but not enough this time around. Complicated plot? Phooey. Annoying is more like it."
0,"If you're a fan of the television series, skip to MI 2 As an avid fan Bruce Geller's Mission Impossible and its iconic characters and cast, I was aghast at this film and despise it. Anyone who has any affection for Peter Graves and his inimitable portrayal of the heroic Jim Phelps is forewarned.That said, I do like the MI franchise, and find 2, 3, and 4 very entertaining."

0,"Complete Garbage I bought this case expecting from what I heard to not be as good as quality as the XCM but I was very surprised to find out just how bad the quality really was. After ordering this case from Ghost Case I recived the order fairly quick, opened the box and it was a disaster. I recived 2 tops, 2 bezels, and Two DVD spindles, No bottom, so it gets worse, Only one face bezels in the box was the way it should be every other piece in the box had a huge crack on it or busted chips out of it. Just handling one of the tops and seeing how bad it would look by placing on my xbox it went on without that tight of a fit but low and behold another crack :( These cases are garbage and should be avoided like the plauge."

0,"A creepy book I did read this as a child, and though I could not have articulated the unpleasant feeling it gave me--I never liked it, that sad, vaguely arlarmed, looking doll, or the text. As an adult I find it very creepy. The doll who is so lonely and invites in a domineering father figure. THe bottom-up spanking is the illustration frequently complained about but they all invoke lonliness and passivity for me."
0,"Very poor quality! The assertion that ""This is one of the best thumb tips made on the market today"" is simply NOT true.

0,"Awful Recording While I do appreciate the performing skill of American Brass Band, I have to say that the quanlity of CD one of the worst I have ever seen.

0,"Great movie, ruined by touchstone DVD politics.. Touchstone has decided to force you to watch two trailers EVERY SINGLE TIME you insert the disc in your player.

0,Boring! The film has Skinner (Mel Gibson) as a FBI agent sent to a low life hotel to investigate the death of an artist named Izzy (Tim Roth.) Everyone thinks that it was just suicied. But old Skinner knows better and through some searching comes up with his own idea. The film also has Tom-Tom (Jeremy Davies)who's best friend was Izzy as the main suspect. But the film goes and does nothing but burn up two hours. You can even see Mel yawning on screen.It is the one Mel Gibson film we should like to forget. Grade:D-
0,"why isn't there a Zero rating on the scale? This is one of those movies that is ""artistic"" because someone was trying really really really hard to make it that way. People say that art is in the eye of the beholder and I have typically felt that the so-called ""artistic"" movies try so hard to be ""artistic"" that they become... In this case, I am the beholder and I say that this movie is garbage, even for Mel Gibson, who is a wonderful actor. I feel the same way about this movie as I did about Pulp Fiction and Taxi Driver. This movie was... The plot was dumb. The ending was dumb. The characters and acting were ridiculous and .... well I dunno! There are so many bad things I could say about this movie but I don't want to waste anymore of my time. I have other things I could be doing. I just felt the need to print my very very negative review."
0,"not up to standards This book is a low-grade rewrite of dream team, which is a copy of one flew over the cuckoos nest, witch if a rip off of Don Quixote. So we see that everything is a copy of some classic, and as time progresses, the copies get worse, like running Shakespeare through a Xerox machine so the copies get more and more degraded each time.The music isn't even up to par with u2's standasrds. I think that 'passengers' is a better soundtrack like miss Sarajevo which is really a monotonous song, but bono and the lads breath live and power into what would normally be a sub-B side song. But satellite of love isn't up to snuff there are better versions of this song.An odd film to be sure but are crazy people really that virtupus, and do they really see things saner than we do? We should get real with thementally ill abnd increase funding and nor glamorizeing a disease."
0,"The Emperor Has No Clothes Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS-stars. This film is garbage; boring, pretentious, and meaningless. Perhaps other reviews can attach their own fantasies and for them this DOA film may say something. But I found it an irritating waste of time. When a script and the characters within it have no definition, no relevance, and no entertainment value - watching it becomes either self-torture or an exercise in pretending that it serves some arty vision. This is the only time that Mel Gibson let me down. I understand he donated his services to this production and, in that case, he was very much overpaid."
0,"Much Ado About Nothing Despite of having the hand of a true great director at the helm and a multi-star cast (including a top-notch soundtrack by U2), the movie lacks the rhythm and charisma needed to live up to its expectations, with great performances lost in a bad script. It's just a wanna-be art movie, and nothing else."
0,"GIVE ME A BREAK BONO! if your into romanticizing junkies and insanity, you love this pseudo-intellectual pretentious piece of garbage. Even a Bud Cort cameo couldn't save this trash.

0,"A book to be avoided unless you are a sanctimonius humbug I had it as a text book in my high school and hated it.

I know any number of kids who get turned off by Dickens just because they had a tyrannical teacher stuff it down, rather up their brainstems in junior high school. One is asked to read a book in so called dear time, got to read it and follow the party line to get the grades and move on.

But then at times, so is Nabukov. And I've read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, all great, deservedly so. And never painful."
0,The Real Jan was smart for letting the fake Jan take Over!! I saw this and man was this corny beyond belief! Eve Plumb the real Jan turned this down. Smart girl! I love the original classic TV show though which yes can be kind of corny but not as much as that variety show!
0,Ultimate French Was supposed to come with audio CDs but didn't so product is unusable. So they come separate? Would like to purchase the audio for the text.
0,no cd package the book did not come with a cd package at all.i this is a waste of money. i received the book and had a note the rest of the items will be made separately..however it never came.
0,Burnout 5 Is Not Paradise I wish I would have known the following before I wasted $60 on this.Road Rage is still my favorite except Open World = No Instant Restart = Lame. Constantly checking the map sucks. Crash Mode is gone. And there's no split-screen. With the Burnout series the only thing I want to do is Crash Mode and Road Rage with my wife. Thank you EA for making my wife cry!Now go make Burnout 6 fun again...
0,"Wow...HUGE LET DOWN I've been waiting for this game for over a year now. One of the great things about Burnout Revenge was the fact you could crash into other cars and get a power boost...with Paradise if you hit a car from behind going to fast you will crash...why? The race mode is horrible now, you have to keep your eye on the map the whole time because there are so many different routes to take, playing with somebody else isn't nearly as fun because the takedowns aren't nearly as frequent. What a huge let down compared to Revenge."
0,"In-game Advertising I just read an article where EA talks about selling advertising to the Obama campain. There's going to be an ad in the XBox 360 version that reads, ""Obama for President"". I think that is going to far. Revenue from sale of the game should be enough for EA, but no, they have to sell ad space so they can make even more money at our expense. No thanks."
0,"Hate Burnout Paradise I truly wish I would have checked reviews from my friends before trusting the critics on this game. I absolutely hate Burnout Paradise. I loved the games before this one but whoever did this one screwed the pooch. There are no set races you basically just wander aimlessly around a beautifully drawn city with no real goals of any kind. Quite often you'll accidently start a race only to realize too late you did and smash into something and lose.WTF reviewed this game, extremely drunk critics perhaps, that thought driving around and doing absolutely nothing else was the greatest game ever? If you love the Burnout Series just think about how the old games are and then play this game and you may hate is as much as I do. I stupidly bought the game new and paid full price."
0,"Where's the feeling?? I have been an Alabama fan for years. This CD is a huge disappointment. Most songs seem to all have the same rhythm and there is a total absence of dynamics. There is no excitement to the songs and the voices sound tired. The accompaniment is thin, at best. Their adaptation of ""Precious Memories"" is a travesty-dull, dull, dull."
0,"1 star for Amazon.com not Canon I just wanted to report that ""usually ships 24 hours"" is an inaccurate description of reality in mid June. I ordered one and the order page said that expected ship date is 8/22/06, which is 2 months away. So whoever is thinking of ordering this capable, well-reviewed printer just be aware of this."
0,"ill Bury You Tomorrow Caution,Stay away from this film.Do not believe the 4or5 star reviews.They must be on crack.Save your money.I was a fool to believe these reviews.Now im stuck with a $22.00 piece of crap filmmaking.Just run away from this film as fast as you can.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!"
0,"THIS MOVIE IS DISAPPOINTING Stiller and Norton are DEFINITELY NOT at their best. Stiller does a lot of yelling (as does everyone in the show) and Norton seems to be play acting and normally I think these guys are awesome!The story line is weak and unconvincing. There is way too much kissing/sex scenes and there is absolutely NO chemistry between Stiller and ""what's her name"" Really bad. What's her names character is un-believable too. Super high powered flawless business woman. And as if Norton, a priest would go drunk and loud into the synagogue to fight it out with Stiller (who is a Rabi) Stupid.There is one funny moment in this movie and that is when Stiller is out on a date with the aerobics nut and the tug-a-war that ensues afterwards. Hilarious .. But folks -- that is about it.Otherwise it pretty much stinks. 1.5 stars"
0,"comedy supposed to be funny When I hear ""priest and rabbi "" I expect to hear the joke next. Not in tnis film. Couple funny moments in the begining and boring melodrama for the rest. Why are these guys priest and rabbi but not carpenter and musician? And such great actors like Ben Stiller and Ed Norton look just stupid and pathetic, but not funny. Maybe because of Norton's directing. Also, heroine Jenna Elfman play is unbelievably bad, reminds me Macaulay Culkin in his worst. So save your time and money. This movie neither funny nor smart."
0,"Ed Norton - Stick to dramatic acting This film is embarassing. I have liked everything Stiller and Norton have done individually but man this film is bad. Promoted as a comedy, there are very few funny moments other than what you see in the trailer. The rest is a confused badly paced romance that never has any tension. The fact that these guys are supposed to be clergy is laughable. There is no chemistry between Stiller and Elfman and Norton's direction is obviously saved by editors."
0,"irritatingly idiotic Huge fan of both Norton and Stiller, enough so that hearing that either of them is playing the lead in any movie is enough to get me to watch it. Nevertheless, this was the worst work I know of either of them doing . . . and they did it together!While the idea of two guys vying for a former childhood playmate is certainly a viable premise for a romantic comedy, I simply wasn't able to swallow the idea of their being a Catholic priest and Jewish rabbi respectively. Not for a second; and since everything that came after depended on your swallowing this, the film was painful to watch.And overlong. Just when you think it's about time to wrap up things, you check the Display on your DVD and see that there are over 60 minutes left!"
0,"Not funny Hey, like everyone, I saw the cool trailer, the nice commercials on TV so I went to see it in the theater, and I must say that I was really disappointed, except for the first narrating scene which made me smile and a few (3-4) other funny moments like the Rabbi trading cards, this comedy is probably one of the dullest and most pointless movies in recent filmmaking.The plot at first seemed appealing, it talks about a Priest and a Raby who are best friends and in love of a girl they knew from school. And when she moves back to NY, they starts seeing her again...Well, the entire movie is boring with some really endless moments of me and my friends wondering were the plot was going.My advice, don't waist your time or money."
0,Color was really disappointing I ordered the Kiwi color which arrived looking faded and worn out just out of the box. Color doesn't look anything like the photo. Not worth the money.
0,"VERY DISAPPOINTING... Very low-budget program. Two actors who are used over and over again, walking, strolling, reflecting, running, sighing, staring, falling down. Repetitive scenery shots abound. Little useful information, and very few clans. Monotonous narrator. Could have been an informational delight. Instead, a static drone."
0,"Oooooh LOL {gracious me, hahahaha! hahHAHAHA!} You know, I simply do not even recall ever watching this bollywood flick. I can't tell you anything about it other than it shows in my records that I indeed purchased this Salaam Namaste DVD~oh goodness.... just remembered. YES! I had checked it out of the library abt one yr. ago and it was one of the most boring movies I ever set my eyes on, so I fell asleep. The high-pitched singing woke me up, so turned it off. The next day was gathering a bunch of DVDs I'd checked out to return them to the local library, however noticed my cat had knocked this dvd onto the floor & it cracked. This is why I purchased this movie, as a REPLACEMENT for the library as I obligated to. No, this movie really sucked. Good choice for insomniacs however."
0,"The DVD censors at it again. On a special edition, no less! I love this movie. It was one of the first PG-13 flicks to come out, so when I was a kid this was quite exciting. It had some action, some nudity and a snake-monster all rolled into a fun pseudo sci-fi package.Imagine my disgust and horror upon discovering that the DVD of the film had been edited for content! Don't believe me? Compare it to the video or laser version. The comical sex dream scene at the beginning has been altered so that there are no breasts. There are also no children watching. This may not seem all that important to you, but I think that this silent trimming is quite insidious. The film is rated PG-13 after all, which means that parents should be cautious about showing it to younger kids. Why then must it be cut without telling us so on the package?To sum it up, I love the movie, but I hate this version. Hooray for Hollywood."
0,"altered i love this movie, however, for some reason, someone has decided to edit all of the romantic scenes, brief nudity, etc. from the dvd version. if that isn't bad enough, they don't tell you that it has been altered from it's original content. i bought this dvd thinking i was getting the original that i loved only to get a chopped up version. rotten deal!"
0,"This Title Deserved Better No movie censored for content deserves to be called a ""Special Edition"". Recommend this as a possible rental, but not as a buy, even for the current price."
0,"not closed captioned I am a deaf person and I count on the Closed Captioning and subtitles to be able to enjoy a movie.Even though Blow is listed as being Closed Captioned, this copy is not.A waste of my time and money."
0,"Boring... Don't get trapped! This movie is way over rated here at Amazon! Thank God I didn't buy this movie!Everything was terrible:1. Boring story. Yes it is a true story but it doesn't deserve to be written in the first place! Why did they make a movie of it?2. You'll never sympathize or get attached to any character! (lack of emotions).3. Weak dialogue!4. Zero suspense and surprises!The bottom line is don't fall into this trap! It is boring, boring, boring! Even the (Infinifilm Edition) DVD is not worth it!"
0,"Yes it does BLOW! This movie is the worst of it's type to date. More a series of classic rock music videos strung together than anything else, It never pulls you into the world it is trying to create. Donnie Brasco, Goodfellas, even Godfather III. Make this a film I think Johnny Depp should probably try and buy all copies and burn. Get the soundtrack instead. Long and boring non-involving, bad acting and bad wigs make this truly unwatchable."
0,"Dry Treatment of an Uninteresting Plot This movie drags. The plot moves slowly. It is typical of movies with an inverted hero, the treatment of the subject is neither innovative nor exciting.The high point is seeing Pee-Wee Herman, Bobcat Goldthwait, and that 21 Jump Street guy doing a hit of coke, all together, off a bar while girls in bikinis play in the pool.Depp struggles with an amusing, forced, and marginal Boston accent. He seems to have copped it by watching Good Will Hunting about six times. He should have watched it six or eight more times.But, yeah, that triumverate of acting talent doing a line, that's about the high point. The soundtrack is great, and the audio is well produced. But it's not an entertaining movie, or even a well-told story."
0,"worst movie ever seen This is one of the worst movie that I ever seen. The story is boring, doesn't make sense.Casts were ok,cheap production."
0,Review Didn't like the product but my money was happily refunded. Would definitely do business with company again.
0,"Horribly cheap construction quality I was very disappointed with this double boiler. I purchased one, used it twice, and on the second use, the lower handle simply snapped off as I tried to lift it off the counter. On closer inspection, it appears the handle is held on with four tiny rivets. One of the four was rusted, and the handle snapped right off, sending milk all over my kitchen. Even if it hadn't been rusted, you can tell from looking at those rivets that the handle wouldn't have stood up to years of use. It's just a shoddily made double boiler. Look elsewhere, is my advice."
0,"Horrible This double boiler came out of the box just in time for christmas baking. I washed it and got it all ready. It is small but it worked for the purposes and was priced right. After I got done my baking, I washed it and left it to air dry. I checked it to make sure it was clean before I put it away and the cooking pan was filled with rust spots and scratches. I used a teflon baking spoon and silcone spatula while I was cooking, not metal. There is no way I could have done this myself. I now have to buy another one before I can make any recipes calling for a double boiler. It will not be this product!!!"
0,"Rated one star cuz ZERO stars wasn't an option!! What a boring, ridiculous movie. For a film that supposedly starred Treat Williams, he was barely in the movie. Everything about the plot was highly improbable from the plane crash to the weather. The actresses in the movie continued to have perfect makeup and hairdos considering they had survived a plane crash and several days without running water or hair blow dryers. I don't have a clue how the movie turned out as I had to turn it off as my brain was rapidly turning to mush. I hope somebody buys my copy so I can get it out of the house."
0,"rips off scences from other major movies This movie steals scences from the movie cliffhanger (yes their scences) This is a watch before you buy movie. this movie is just not original. sorry, but this movie is copyright crook."
0,"Bad Bad Bad From the start this movie had all the making of a real bomb. The JetStar and DC-9 aircraft scenes were totally bogus. Treat Williams is a pilot, he should have know the flying scenes were bogus. Grizzly bears hibernate in winter. When it is 20 below zero water freezes, but it wasn't frozen in these scenes. Should have been a comdy."
0,"Don't bother. I hated, hated, hated this book. It came highly recommended and I voluntarily (and rather enthusiastically) picked it up. There has never been a main character I have been more disgusted by, a storyline that has been less interesting, and a writing style that has been more obnoxious. I would burn it if it weren't borrowed."
0,"wrong book They sent me the wrong book. It was The Berenstain Bears, Learn About Strangers, instead of The Stranger. It was disappointing!!"
0,"The Only Good Thing About It Is The Title & That Cure Song Being unnaturally obsessed with Kafka, it was assumed by my compadres that I would also like this author, and particularly this book. How wrong they were. The plot makes no sense, the characterization is meager & unconvincing, and the only poetic prose occurs on the last page as our hero (ha!) languishes in prison in the final hours before he is to be executed, wondering what it all means & railing at humanity for treating him like the dog he is."
0,"A horrible translation I have read a previous translation of The Stranger, and was deeply moved. My entire life was changed. The previous translator did Camus justice. Matthew Ward, with this translation of The Stranger, ruined the novel. Ward includes awful cliche and unintelligent description. Unfortunately this is the only translation currently in print in the US. If you are able to, please order from a forgein printer (sometimes printed under the title The Outsider) or consider searching for an out of print copy not translated by Matthew Ward."
0,"Wrong Cover and Translator I purchased this thinking it to be the american translation because the cover was the same. The cover of the book sent to me is very different and it is in fact the british translation not the american. I need the american one for my english class, now I'm stuck with a book I cannot use."
0,"Disappointing I'll keep this short. The book was an awful read save the last ten pages. Everything before that is terribly uninteresting. It is only once he has been sentenced and awaits his end that it becomes something worth flipping through. I have the utmost respect for Albert Camus, but this is dribble."
0,"Confusing and Contradictory Okay, I have read, analyzed, and written an 11- page paper on this book, and I don't have good things to say about it. The critics say it is a brilliant insight on the personality of the absurd, and they believe that Camus is amazing. Please. Camus could not decide what kind of character he wanted Meusault to be. One minute M. didn't care about anything, while the next he was absorbed in Marie's smile. I did not find the book insightful at all, and I honestly feel it is a waste of time to try to find deep meaning in it."
0,"Terrible Existentalistic Trash! Ugh,worst book EVER. Camus'little novel about a nihilistic nobody who sheds no tears over the death of his haggy old mother, does boring things and commits a murder. That's the plot. Gee, I hated this book. Hated it. The main character's behaviour and atheistic beliefs slightly offended me. Don't waste your time on this. Read Ionesco's 'Four Plays' instead. Then again, I might be wrong. After all, a critic's review is based solely upon his or hers personal opinion. It could be a wonderful novel, but not bloody likely. All I know is that at the end I was glad to see the malicous little bugger executed."
0,"This is a book for losers!! I hate this book, though I understand why this book became so popular. We, humans, are not logical machines. I think anyone who have read any of Nietzsche's books would think this book childish and absurd."
0,"Used it as kitty-litter for my cat This book was bad. I read this book when I was in grade 10 and it was very depressing. I probably was not old enought to appreciate the book or the content in it but i was aware of how i felt after reading it and wanted to burn it.The book presents the main character as a person with no heart, no faith and nothing (and no one) to believe in. Sounds like a great book right? Its unfortunate the Albert C does not have any faith in the human race."
0,"The philsophy of old ::yawn:: Here is your plot. The main character doesn't care about anything, about himself the world or other people. And in the end and instead of defending himself (and he is 100% innocent) he chooses to die instead. Wow what a real hero, a true life that we should all imitate. I'll put it in simple words, IT'S STUPID. Don't buy this piece of junk, I had to read it for High School and I think it's garbage. The main character is simply, a moron. Wow how philsophical and interesting. Not to mention it's translated poorly from the French language."
0,"This book has DRM I am afraid that, as much as I love the book, I do not appreciate the limitations put upon this particular edition (Kindle) by way of DRM. How much of a problem DRM is, may vary from user to user, but I would have appreciated it if Amazon had informed me about it in advance of my purchase, as I would then have chosen a different edition (hardcover) where I OWN the book and not merely LEASE it."
0,Confusing and Depresing I had to read this book for a test I am having in Honors English tomorrow. The book made no sense and was all out depressing. I don't know why anybody would want to read it let alone deem it as a classic.
0,"Just Terrible I'm sure that I'm missising something here. Or maybe all of the people who wrote their glowing reviews of this book are missing something, but this was one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing style was like a Junior High School student trying to write their first story. Really more than just a list of sequential events like, I woke up, I went to work, I went to bed. I found after a few pages that I didn't really care what happened to the main character any more than he seemed to care what happened to himself. The only saving grace was that it was such a short book that I was able to read it in about two hours. I know that Camus is well respected and was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature, but based on this book I can't understand or imagine why."
0,"SO overrated This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_, but upon reflection I have decided that I would rather read _Star_ again than read _The Stranger_ again, although I would rather be eaten alive by rabid wolverines than do either. This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it. If I had a time machine, I would pay to have Camus beaten to death on a deserted beach, ultimately preventing this disaster from ever coming into existence."
0,terrible why are we forced to read this GARBAGE in high school? this book was terrible. i really felt like jumping in the book and slappin' that guy around a bit. how could he just act like that? UGH!
0,"Pardon me while I indulge in a moment of shallowness... This book really, really sucks.It doesn't even DESERVE a more in-depth review. UGH."
0,"A story skimmed off the top I was so disappointed after reading this trilogy. The idea of the story itself was what attracted me in the first place. I found the alternating points of view extremely annoying. Because the focus changes from one character to another so quickly, I felt I was only skimming the top of the story. I was also disappointed at how the story ended. She just left the characters hanging at the end of the battle. What happend to their future? I don't recommend this trilogy."
0,"No support for low screen res The interface may be horrific or it may be brilliant; either way, I wouldn't know as that I am running on a laptop with a vertical resolution of 480 dpi. When running at this resolution, the bottom of the dialogue boxes are chopped off - scroll bars, lists of words, et al - instead of resizing as would be expected of even a sub-par user interface.And tech-support's response to my dilemma? Increase your resolution. Sorry, it's a laptop with a fixed resolution; not an option. Guess I'm stuck with Encarta's less-than-inspiring definitions of words."
0,"Who, Which, Where?? There have been more than dozen productions of this piece made available on LP/tape/CD. Which one is this?? If it's the most recent London revival, it's lame. If it's the New York original cast with Elly Stone, it's priceless.What have we here??"
0,"Big Fat Waste of Time! As a big fan of Nicole, I was pretty disgusted with this movie. It was so corny in dialogue and content I had a hard time staying interested, but did because it was so bad, I had to see what happened. And that affair with her student was so dusgusting! The ending was hardly entertaining, and I wanted my $ back at the theatre, which I got!"
0,"Garbage written by a sellout looking for help. Like any sell out of their own, she now cries for protection. She has reaped what she and her kind sowed. 20 years ago, the forwarnings of this where well known, but people like Catherine denounced them as racist bigots, so such. Now, like the sell-out then and now reaping her eternal benifits of such, should now be allowed to stew in a sewer of her own making. Tough Luck kid, maybe next life you won't sell out."
0,Don't Waste Your Money There is nothing of interest in this book. Read the Amazon and Publishers Weekly reviews - they politely explain how little of the content is either new or tells you anything significant about John Lennon. If you buy it you are only providing more money to a very rich talentless person who has parasited the memory of JL for 25 years.
0,"Pure junk...worth no stars Like any bottom-sucker, Yoko continues to feed off the legacy of a deeply troubled, yet brilliant, man. If you have a warm spot in your heart for John Lennon, do not buy this book."
0,"Too Wordy! I was assigned this book through my 10th grade English course. Never before have I been forced to struggle through a book like this one. Conrad's style is adds superfluous information that does absolutely nothing to advance the plot or symbolic significance of the story. The sentences and paragraphs were too large to be dealt with rationally. One of the chapters, which is about 4 and a half pages, is one single paragraph! While the story itself was a good one, Joseph Conrad ruins it with his esoteric and over-descriptive style of novel-writing."
0,"WHY??? I was definitely turned on by all of the hype before the movie. The commercial previews left me with much anticipation....LL, Jada, Vivica Fox, Whoopi!!! I couldn't wait! Then I saw the movie..........What happened? How could they have all of those folks in there and have that movie turn out that way? All I can really say is that I was truly disappointed and I don't know who was at fault. I've seen all of these people in other productions, so I know they can act....was it the director? the producer? Now here's a good question, Toni Braxton WAS in the movie, right? So why in the world would they have Jada up there acting like she was singing?????? I can't go on............."
0,"READ THIS FOR HONESTY I bought this product hoping for a nice poker chip set.It came a week late(i have prime, so this was very sad...)Not only was it late but the carrying case cameBROKEN at EVERY END.The chips are very nice and high quality, so if you don't care about the case, buy it anyways.I simply had to return it because I needed a way to hold and store my chips.Case-0/5 starsChips-5/5 stars"
0,"Disappointed Received the alluminum case that was broken in the corners. At the first look thought it was damaged in shipping. But when I looked for the missing/ broken pieces, I could not find them in the shipping box. Then I realised that they packed a broken poker set. Ridiculuos..... how can they sell a crappy product. Utterly disappointed!!"
0,poor quality set I was very disappointed with the set. It looked like low quality items were selected for the set. The dice looked cheap and were dislodged from the fitting when I opened it. I was unable to fit them back altogether in their slot. It was as if the dice went to another set. I will be looking for a nicer set now.
0,"A waste of time. This book, which tries to act like a full sized book, but is so full of larger print...larger spacing....huge margins...empty pages or nearly empty pages....chapters cut into 10 or 15 pieces, so that they can then insert MORE blank pages....is a big, fat, waste of time. It pretty much reads like a 13 year old girl's diary...sappy, and not in touch with reality. I love a good tear jerker...this one was neither good OR a tear jerker. The only good thing I can say about reading this book is that I got it at the library and did not pay for it....I'd have kicked myself if I had paid for it. My advice? Don't waste your time OR your money. How this ever made the Best Sellers List is beyond me."
0,"I just don't know about this one... My mom passed this book on to me with the words, ""it's a quick read."" And I will give her proper credit, it was a quick read. Unfortunately, the plot is far from subversive and the characters are two dimensional at best. The plot while slightly outlandish (woman loses husband and miscarries, then meets a man that is also dying) could technically happen, but I was not emotionally invested in any of these characters. And sadly, I think that is what this book is missing, characters that the reader knows or indentifies with or some sort of level. When I read, I like to think well I know someone like that or I can picture that character. I didn't do that at all in this book. Patterson seldom gets behind typecasted characters to actually create anyone real. I am honestly not sure what could have saved this book, more exposition or details maybe...not a total write off...but nothing spectacular."
0,"Sugary Harlequin Story If you're a lonely housewife, romantic at heart, and like harlequins, wait for Patterson's book to come out in paperback. It's an easy sugary read, tugging at your heartstrings, but not worth the hardcover price. It also seems to me that Patterson is jumping on a new genre style of writing and ""literally"" losing his fans of Alex Cross. He is trying to capitalize on sappy, romantic, tragic, love stories after his success of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and picking a touristy, profitable town like Lake Geneva, which he may not even have visited for more than a day, just to sell his books and make more money. I admit I like easy, romantics once in a great while, but a classic writer like Patterson should leave the romantic books to R.W.A (Romance Writers of America). And lastly, he should fire his editor and take writing classes again with all his money. This is not literature; it's choppy, full of basic writing errors, and clichÃ©."
0,"Disgusted This book glorifies adultery. Between a married woman and her pastor, no less. She didn't love her husband? Why not divorce him? Why marry him in the first place? Why cheat on him? And, try to justify it to her granddaughter?"
0,"Like getting jabbed by a stick with poo on it. It might make you cry a little, but mostly you're angry that such a thing has been inflicted on you.And it stinks.Really, really bad."
0,"Not Worth Your Time I collect books that feature Wisconsin or are written by a Wisconsin author.This book uses Lake Geneva, Wisconsin as the setting. Nearly every reference to the town and even the way Patterson categories it is wrong.If you don't know the town make up a fictional one rather than try to capitalize on a town's cachet. In the least have someone fact-check the work."
0,"Sam's Letters to Jennifer I knew I should have put the book down and not wasted any more of my time when the author writes that Jennifer puts on her husband's Michigan U jogging suit. There is no Michigan U! There is The University of Michigan (U of M) or Michigan State University (MSU). But I unfortunately kept reading only to subject myself to reading the preposterous scene of when Brendan and Jennifer performing CPR on one Of Jennifer's cats and it lives. So, at that point I put the book down and have no intention of finishing it or purchasing another book by James Patterson."
0,"Disappoionting, Cliche, Predictable, and Poor Materials I'm quite a fan of Patterson's books. To read this kind of poor plot crap was a waste of time! The story was nice if putting in one or two sentenses, but to make a book it ought to have a better research and twists than this! The worst of his books I've read by far!This is a complete junk, lame story. Mind as well read a gossip column from National Enquirer!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"Awful read! You really need to read this kind of trash books once in a while to be able to fully appreciate good books. I picked it up from Borders because they had it on a huge sale. I should have known why nobody would buy it at normal price.A grandma (soon to be great grandma) confessing about an unconvincing extra marital affair to her grand daughter while the grand daughter herself is finding a new love in her life, in a not-so convincing manner! How sick can this get?It is almost like the author just followed a predictable plot line."
0,"Sam's letters to jennnifer Another James Patterson novel. As I reached the end, l realized I have already read the book, several years ago. As Jennifer read her grandmother's storytelling of her romance with a man whom she did marry but no one was told except Jennifer and her Brendan at the end of the story. Patterson tells a good with lots of scenic descriptions and makes the characters seem real"
0,"Sappy, stupid and predictable Boring, sappy, stupid and predictable should have been the title for this review. It says it all. Shallow characters who have ""suffered hardships"" find that ""love conquers all."" The whole story is one big cliche."
0,"confused from page 1 did anyone notice the masculine pronoun ""he"" referring to Sam on the first few pages??? then, when the call from the nursing home came, sam was no longer a ""he"" but a she! i must've re-read the first 5 pages at least 10x, wondering if i was seeing things!!! editting mistakes like that, right out of the gate, are totally bogus. i never bothered reading further!"
0,"Merely a short story I found this ""novel"" to be one of the poorest I have read to date. The characters are not developed, the story line was weak and it lacked imagination. It seemed as if Mr. Patterson stopped by a bar one night and jotted it down on a napkin! It should have been labeled as no more than a short story.I believe the last time I read a book with such a large font, two inch margin on all four sides and less than 200 words per page ---- I was in the third grade!! New chapters were used as a way of extending the story/number of pages --- they were not used as a means to express a new idea or thought.Take my advice -- do not waste your time or money."
0,Why do I bother? I don't know why I bother with James Patterson-all the melodrama and cliches. This book typifies his style. I correctly quessed the ending after reading just 20 pages of this book. It's sappy and silly. I promise not to do this to myself again...
0,"NOT the originals While the sound quality on these disks is excellent, be aware that app. 50% of the tunes are not the originals. Shout Factory should be ashamed, duping customers like this. Rhino Records would never pull such a stunt. Go for the 4-disk Rhino box set (Vol. One) instead. You can find many high quality used versions for sale all over the web, too."
0,"I may be the only one I may be the only one who didnt like this movie, and thats fine with it cause people like different kinds of movies. This movie wasnt my fav because It really wasnt very much like the older verison, that one gave me chills, I didnt see it till after I saw this one but I must say the older one was better.The ending was changed which was a part I didnt really understand, he was alone in the basement(celler) and he turned to a demon he was never bit or anything and yet he turned to one of the zombies. The older one he was shot cause they though he was a zombie, and they never found him in the celler. The older one was a bit smarter then Tony Todd, I am sorry to say but it is, and if your going to make a remake of a movie wouldnt you want to have the same things?..Just try to make it more scarier to people?"
0,"completely silly! Who would give the green light to this?It is a total remake of the 1968 classic. The only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times.Since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it...it pales in comparison to the original. This was really weird to remake this movie.""Dawn of the Dead"" was cool b/c it had a new, fresh spin to the story. This has no scares, no atmosphere, no innovations and no riveting performances.Skip this one"
0,"NO REMAKE NEEDED!!!! this is one of those movies that you have to ask,""why remake a movie that did it right the first time!!! buy the 1968 version and forget this one! skip it!!"
0,"Unwatchable Buy the DVD, the bluray has a terrible transfer. Everything is tinted a deep blue, which makes the entire movie look like it takes place in a room with very dim lighting. You can especially see it when a white moon shows up as dark smurf blue. I have no financial stake in trying to convince anyone this is a great product, I won't even dump my copy on Ebay as its such a poor product. I watched the first half hour, then had to switch to my DVD of this movie because I couldn't see at all what was happening in the movie.Shame on Twilight Time for releasing the worst looking bluray in my collection. Buyer beware. Search out the DVD vs Blu comparison screenshots if you need to they're accurate."
0,Avoid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bad transfer on Blu-ray. The blu-ray transfer is very dark and has a blue tint. Do not waste your money.
0,"really BAD Sony transfer. Saw a friend's copy of this and the difference between the DVD and this bluray is like night and day - pun intended - someone over at Sony when transferring this disc made the entire movie so utterly dark - it renders the disc nearly unwatchable. Granted the film is supposed to take place at night, the new transfer is quite frankly awful."
0,Garbage Never buy this; it worked about 1 week. I will never buy that again. I can't find another similar pump yet.
0,fix formatting in kindle version The equations are incomplete and it becomes very hard to read. Have tried on multiple devices. mathematical formatting is not complete. Very disappointing. Particularly the bras and kets.
0,"Read the SMALL print! Everyone is correct, the movie is a great movie. The problem is in the Amazon descriptions, or lack thereof. This movie has been EDITED! I can't understand why, it was a good wholesome movie in the first place. Amazon should make this information more prominent. We watched the movie and that was how we found out it was edited....what a waste of money. I won't buy anymore movies from Amazon."
0,"I'm rating the dvd only. I had this DVD for a while, and thought I'd come here and comment on how awful the transfer is. I've seen better quality on normal TV without a cable/sat. Connection. The picture is extremely dark in the hospital scene in the beginning. Then there is a lot of grain and I've seen wood with less grain. The grain makes the scene even darker then it should be. Then when he's out of the hospital and on the road, the grain is still very noticeable. I love the movie, but this DVD is just horrible. Sadly there aren't any features on the disc either, so buying the VHS is so much better if you actually like this movie.Transfer 0.5/5Audio 3/5Features 0/5I really hope that the studio that released this film decides to re-release it and do a better job at it. It's not even worth the cheap price."
0,"Returned twice WHEN I RECEIVED MY FIRST ""DOC HOLLYWOOD DVD"" I WAS UNABLE TO HEAR THE MOVIE, THEN I REQUESTED TO HAVE IT REPLACE AND WHEN I GOT IT THE 2ND TIME IT WAS THE EXACLY THE SAME PROBLEM. SO I RETURNED AND REQUESTED MY MONEY BACK, SORRY I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS SELLER."
0,No sure if satisfied yet Wrote to ask if movie was in italian or english...opened to see after no reply..will not play in our DVD so going to try a brand new one my daughter has. If works and is in English we will keep it. If it in Italian or it does not work in their dvd we will be sending it back.Stewart Schofield
0,"Terrible customer service I'll admit, I mistakenly bought this item without reading all the details, which I rarely do. I knew nothing about different codes for different areas (stupid BTW). I paid a sensational amount for shipping thinking I was still getting a decent deal. The product showed up as advertised, albeit I felt the seller was a bit deceitful by not highlighting that this disc is not compatible with US DVD/Bluray players. I attempted to contact the seller to return the item a month ago and haven't received a response. That's bad business and deserves a 1 rating on ethics alone. Don't get duped by this seller. You won't be able to get your money back."
0,"DOES NOT PLAY ON MY REGULAR DVD I am so upset right now! this DVD does not play on my regular DVD player. The cover of the DVD is printed in Italy, the DVD comes and was shipped from Italy. I wanted the English version, as of now, i do not know if the DVD's audio is in English or Italian because it doesn't work AT ALL. Maybe if i was leaving in Italy would work but for some unknown reason this is a bad purchase, i DO NOT RECOMMEND this DVD at all! i was looking forward to get it on the mail for such a long time, i was excited to put this movie on for my toddler boy, since i know Pinocchio sends a positive message to children, and that's why i feel so frustrated that this seller is knowingly putting this out for sale. Amazon needs to make arrangements with sellers like this one! too bad, i know i wont get my $ back and neither my son could watch his movie! DECEPTION !!!"
0,hate it didnt watch this/returned it for a refund/ this was in italian notthe english copy i ordered./ i couldn't watch it / i'll re-order another movie so as i do like this movie
0,will return it Will return it - did not realize it was not in English until Christmas morning when I tried to play it for my son and got message not compatible in this region?
0,"Was Not Happy!!! It turned out to be a Region 2 DVD and would not play on my Blu-ray Player. I had looked at so many before I bought it I must have not looked, or it wasn't posted."
0,Very Dissapointed I purchased this movie for my son(6yrs) and the add stated that the DVD was in excellant shape. We played it once and noticed some sound problems but when went to play this again the sound was horrible. I sent an email to Amazon and received no response. I would like to get a replacement but I do not know how to go about this as I no longer have any information on the person who actually sent it to me.For the most part I have had good luck buying from Amazon but this was a terrible purchase and we are very dissapointed.
0,Pinocchio not the only one who lies! This version of Pinocchio was in Italian! No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version! Now I have to send it back to Italy for a refund...
0,"The Puppet Show This certainly is not one of my favorite Disney movies. I just really didn't get in to the movie I guess but then I never really cared for this Fairy Tale either.The voice actors are good and the scenery, and colors are great. But for some reason this one really just didn't hit home for me."
0,"Just for the Seller... I bought this ""new"" on amazon and when it was delivered I could tell it had been repackaged. Not only that but the plastic circle the holds the dvd into the case was broken for BOTH cds, and the dvd had scratches all over it. I wouldn't even consider this ""like new""Of course, the movie is still a wonderful classic."
0,"NEVER AGAIN!! No where does it state that the DVD will not play in my region. I bought a DVD in America, it should work on my DVD player. The same with the bluray from MovieMars, it won't play because it's not available in my country. What in the world!!?"
0,"NO Slipcover!!! I recently ordered the Pinocchio 2-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition blu-ray/dvd, and it did NOT come with a slip cover, just the basic blu-ray case. All the other Disney blu-ray's I ordered on Amazon came with nice metallic slip covers, EXCEPT this one. I'm almost 100% certain I have seen this item sold in stores with a slip cover. Why not here? I'm considering returning it, as I have not opened it yet."
0,"Disney video The one I bought at a premium price was advertised as being new and sealed. It was from an affiliated store with Amazon.com The seller went by at least 3 different names and one was ?""Milano"". What I rec'd was a pirated piece of junk. When I complained, the crook said he made a mistake and would replace the video but that I should not tell Amazon that I had been sent junk. I never did get the promised video from that crook and so I stopped ordering anything outside the Amazon.com system for a long time and I still do not like the idea of ordering outside the system. I guess the only good thing to come from this is that the pirating crook did not get ahold of my credit card info because he probably would have stollen my identity and run up my bill."
0,"Ooops - who let Goofy in the copy-room? Pinocchio is one of my favorite movies and my children love it as well. What a gift it was to get it on DVD! But upon putting it in the player today, found out that the Prince of Egypt was actually on it. The cover and holder showed Pinocchio. This was a very sad mistake by Buena Vista Home Entertainment."
0,This was a fake Don't believe the item was authentic. Then when I contacted the vendor to return I never got a response. This was a gift and not only was I embarrassed I lost my money. This will make me hesitant to order from another vendor.
0,playability It wasn't clear this could not be played on a VCR in the US. that was in the small print
0,Doesn't Play Bought this as a gift for my niece and won't play in many types of DVD players. Might be burned copy from original?
0,very upset i was very upset with this movie. If you have read this book... dont watch the movie. There are so many different scenes that were switched around from the book. for example in the book johnny tutored a highschool kid not a elementery kid. there was a fire at a graduation party not a drowning. this movie swayed from the book big time!
0,"I've been marketed! According to the dust jacket, if you love a boy, were a boy, or care about boys and the men they become, read this book."" Well gosh, what a coincidence, that includes me! The premise of this book, that we should pay more attention to the emotional lives of boys, isn't exactly a trailblazer, considering the degree to which we've re-evaluated sex roles in recent decades. I can't help thinking that the book was devised to fill an available market niche left open by ""Reviving Ophelia."" The ""product"" is a rambling series of pop psych anecdotes (I sometimes ask, is there any other kind of psych?)and patronizing sermons from the all too male authors. God forbid that my boys should grown up to be as shallow and as self-satisfied as they."
0,"a tired rehash of stuff you've heard before Raising Cain is a tired rehash of child-rearing advice you've heard a million times. It's too bad that parents who are willing to spend moneyand, say, six hours of reading time to learn more about their sons will be so poorly rewarded. My advice: spend that six hours with your boys, doing something fun. Save the money for pizza and ice cream."
0,"Personal Beliefs and Values This book is more for those who believe in a liberal approach to raising their children. While I believed that this book was focusing on treating your child with respect and love...teaching your child in turn to respect and love...it was apparent from reading it that the focus was more on allowing your child to be free from criticism and discipline. I would not suggest this book for anyone who believes in more traditional approaches to raising their children. Also, I do have concern regarding the fact that the authors are the parents of daughters and have written this book by mere observation through a clinical setting."
0,"You are kidding, Right? This is possibly the worst movie I have ever had to sit through, and believe me, I have seen some really horrible movies. The acting is deplorable. The ""special"" effects aren't special. It was a dog. No, that is an insult to that majestic animal. My husband is an Ed Wood fan. Even those movies have a comical appeal to them, whereas this movie is nothing short of inane. If there is a God in heaven, this movie will fade into obscurity, never to be heard from again."
0,"Please I can't believe they made a movie this bad, and worse yet i sat and watched it.In the 1950's this would have made my all time monster list when i was 10 years old.The best part is when they showed Finn Cater bare legs.By the why i found myself rooting for the worms."
0,"Crouching Frenchman - Hidden Plot Apparently in 17th Century France, the laws of gravity were suspended for a time. Everyone leaps around on wires to the point that it is getting silly. The swordfighting is O.K. but, it's heavly influenced by Wu Shu Kung Fu which is understandable given the stunt coreographer for the movie. The acting is wooden with half the cast speaking with a French accent and everyone else speaking Californian.Justin Chambers can't pronounce D'Artagnian, it sound like he is saying ""Darten"" overall, it's not that great a version of the Three Musketeers."
0,"Enough with the Musketeers It's not so much the fact that there have been far too many Musketeer films, as the fact that this movie stinks!!!The acting is totally atrocious!!! SOme of the worst acting I've seen on film. Mena Suvari was so good in American Beauty, but in this dud she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.Whoever that guy is playing D'artanan...he looked a bit like Chris O'Donnell, who did play this character in the three musketeers, he needs to take some acting classes or find a new career. What a bore!While this fellow was nice to look at, he was such a bad actor! He needs to just stick to something easy, like male modeling.This is just another attempt at a swashbuckler film, and it failed miserably. Reminds me of some made for t.v. movie that might show up on the WB network.Watch the Musketeer film with Chris O'Donnell and Kiefer Sutherland. It's a much better made film."
0,"Fluff and Drivel: Perfect waste of film With a ""pert near"" absence of plot, acting, and storyline, Musketeer falls flat on its face. What looks to be a pseudo-copy of the Disney version with Oliver Platt et al, is a hopeless effort with truly awful screenwriting, character development, and fight scenes that imploy so much cloth and whirling that it's impossible to tell who ever gets wounded. I distinctly notice within the first five minutes, however, that the film was quite dead. Please don't make me ever watch a film where most actors have a British accent, but the lead actor mumbles along with an L.A. drawl. Please don't make the mistake of renting this movie: save your money, watch the Disney version instead, which should rent for about a buck at your local video store. You'll thank me for it someday."
0,"ugh! I'm not sure who I am more dissapointed in: the lead actor or the director. Maybe I am too used to watching actors who know how to deliver their lines, but clearly Justin Chambers does not. The utter lack of passion in his delivery gave me the impression that the director wanted him to read his lines as quickly as he could in order to get the movie over with as soon as possible. I don't blame him."
0,I wish there was a zero star.. Unless something comes out in the future to trump this...It's going to go down for me as the worst film of all time. If you have a pet peeve that ruins a movie for you then it is probably in here. I feel symphathy for Tim Roth who must have took this role on a dare.I felt so blindsided when I watched this because I was not expecting the utter trash this film is. The negative review in the Spotlight Review section are right on the money. You couldn't pay me to watch this again. Too bad there isn't a zero star.
0,"How did this happen? If you have any respect for a story, characters or an era...DONT WATCH THIS. The names resemble the characters from a classic story written by Andre Dumas. This is about as far as the similarity goes. This is a big budget disaster. Did they try to keep it real by lighting the night scenes with candles? It provides a washed out set which might have been its redeeming feature.Dumas is turning in his grave."
0,"The worst ever This is absolutely the worst 17th century movie I have ever seen.Words cannot describe how much it revolted me.They could do a better job if they would not try to make a film at all.If halfway through the movie, the actors began to turn into lizards, it would not have surprised me.Controlling the urge to vomit was hard to say the least.As an armourer, reenactor, historian, and having studied the sword arts for more than two decades, I can honestly say that I believe in my own heart that Micky Mouse could have played the lead role and the little pigs could have been the Three Musketeers, which by the way, we do not even get to know the Musketeers in the movie, due to the focus being on superhuman acts of levitation and flight.But if you must watch it, please bear in mind that this movie is pure fantasy when it comes to any historical value and I would not recommend it even to children if you ever want them to learn ""real"" storylines, from ""real"" books, based on ""real"" history."
0,"At least the title was right THE musteteer was about ""A"" musteteer. The whole story was horrible. You don't have to be a fan of the older Musteteer movies to know this was BAD. My advise is to watch the 15 second preview of the movie. This displays the best action that takes place in the entire movie and you can't tell just how bad the acting was. I wish I never wasted my time watching it and I was able to watch it free. Just don't bother with this one."
1,"Delicious! Informative AND charming... I just learned three new cooking techniques! Loved Julia Child's shows when I was little (in the 70's), but I had not seen the original show (starting with the beginning episodes.) What a treat! This is a must watch for me, and, I suspect, anyone who aspires to become a more accomplished chef."
1,"How wonderful to be able to cook with Julie As a youngster, I was quite unaware of the value Julia gave to those who cook. I haven't cooked for many, many years but was inspired after watching this to actually make the dish AND invite guests. How exciting to having something new to look forward to in my life. Instructions are simple and easy to follow.I watched it first, then went shopping and watched again as I was cooking. Excellent."
1,I love it I seen the movie and then got into the series. Have learned so much from this show. I love it!
1,"Julia is a joy to watch! I can't believe how much I learned from the FIRST episode of The French Chef! Julia Child makes French cooking amazingly approachable and gratifying. I felt like my best friend was walking me through her favorite recipe. Best of all, Julia thoroughly explains (and demonstrates) techniques that will improve even the simplest of meals. Bon appetit? Bon appetit indeed!"
1,"Wonderful! I have tried probably half of the recipes already and everyone has been delicious! The recipes are easy to make and don't require any special, hard to find ingredients. I highly recommend the strawberry bread! It's divine!"
1,"Plain and simple Plain and simple says it all. No complicated diagrams, no professional jargon. Each day gets two-pages: one page to log food and excercise, the other to journal your day. Plenty of space to write and very easy to fill out. Although it might be a little large for smaller purses, it's a perfect fit for any gym bag or backpack -- there's hardly any reason to not keep it with you at all times. If you're looking for something to help you keep track of what you eat plus what physical activities you're doing each day, this book is for you."
1,"very happy Nice rain suit, I am very happy with the purchase. Was afraid the material might be real thin but it wasn't. I've worn it many times in real heavy rain and it has kept me dry."
1,"One of the best comedies I've ever seen! The begining of the film is just fantastic!Dialogs are really intelligent , and Babs and Segale work very good as a couple. She once more proved her acting and comedy talent . Loved it!"
1,"Barbra Streisand in The Owl & The Pussycat. Streisand is young, beautiful and sexy in this absolutely wonderful movie. It's a true love story. But if you would be offended by seeing quite a lot of flesh, mostly Barbra's, you may not want to buy this movie. LOL. I WANTED to see Barbra, so I bought it and I did. This is a 10 if I ever saw one. Check it out."
1,"This is a modern ""Romeo and Juliet"" story. ""Endless Love"" is a fine adaptation of Scott Spencer's novel of sexual discovery. The casting of young Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt is excellent, as well as the outstanding supporting cast. Also, I thought the setting and the background music are fine additions to the movie."
1,"Happy days are here again:) I first saw this movie as a teenager and have loved it ever since. I too, had a very poor copy taped off T.V. that was almost worn out. The songs are wonderful (who can forget ""A bride-finding ball""?) and the scenery is beautiful. I wish that I could give more than 5 stars for this wonderful movie."
1,this is the best film ever this film uis the bvest film i have ever seen the music is so fun and the story is great and so magical. I love the cindrella story and i feel thatthis film expands the story in a very successful way. My favorite part of the film is where edward finds cinderella on his horse. It is so romantic i didnt realise until now that you could get it on dvd but i will be ordering it straight away.
1,"A wonderful version of a classic; more people should watch it The ""Slipper and the Rose"" is a wonderful version of the Cinderella story and it is a shame that more people haven't seen it. It is a musical, so people who don't like musicals should avoid it, but it also has quite a few twists on the original story that I find charming. Additionally, although it is an older film starring actors who were once box office regulars but are no longer, I (who am around 30 years old) still found it lovely. The only thing I would want to improve is to have the film on Blu-Ray instead of regular DVD."
1,"""Suddenly it happens, and the dream comes true!"" ""Wonderfully, beautifully it happens and your world is new,"" says Cinderella in this long awaited film, which is FINALLY being released in its entirety -- the full length, British version! This wonderful, lavish musical of the story of Cinderella, stars Richard Chamberlain as the Prince, Gemma Craven as Cinderella, and a wonderful cast including Annette Crosbie, Michael Hordern, Christopher Gable, Kenneth More, Margaret Lockwood, and Dame Edith Evans. The musical score is brilliantly written by the incomparable Sherman Brothers, who also co-wrote the script with Director Bryan Forbes. This is a great film for all ages, and sure to be a perfect addition to your movie collection."
1,"One of the Best As a child the Slipper and the Rose was always on at Christmas on television in the UK. I used to love watching it.I have now moved to New Zealand and they haven't heard of it! I have been hunting for the film for ages, and someone got me in touch with Amazon. Within a week of ordering it, it arrived and I have already watched it twice.A wonderful movie that will go on and on. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good pick me up and oh Richard Chamberlain is yummy in it!"
1,"This is my favorite album of this year I admit, this is my first Mannheim Steamroller CD, but I am a Disney nut, and buy all there stuff...anyway, now I am a Steamroller fan and looking for more of these CDs. If you like Disney, or Mannheim, BUT THIS...it is EXCELLENT."
1,"These Guys Deliver Quality RocknRoll I am a Djay for a comeback radio show. It's always hit & miss checking out all the comebacks of older bands. This one was a big positive surprise. I like their sound now better than in the 60's, with the exception of the masterpiece""The Letter."" The first 4 tracks of this album are super. Wang Dang Doodle is a great blues song that I liked by Koko Taylor and the Box Tops do a terrific version of it here. As I was listening to the album and enjoying it all I thought that the only thing I hoped they'd do is put a more hard rockin jam song in tthe mix, and then they gave me just that with the last track of 6 minutes called Big Bird. I play this album quite a lot and have played 9 of the tracks on my radio show. I've gotten very good feedback about the songs. The Box Tops are still touring and one more album would be nice. This is a great addition to their catalog of great music."
1,"This CD Rips The Box Tops new CD, and may I say first release in many too many years, recaptures those same good time feelings that seemed to permeate the late 60s. The music, mostly covers, is exceptionally well executed and Alex sounds more focused than he has in years. If you were the Box Tops fan that I was ( if you're over 45 years old how could you not be )you owe it to yourself to get a copy of this new recording."
1,"viva la farberware 1-quart saucepan with lid this saucepan is an absolute delight. everytime i see it or use it it makes me feel good (my life is a simple one. obviously). its aesthetically pleasing, user friendly, and cooks and cleans up handily like the true little workhorse it is. i look forward to many more years of enjoyable saucing in my one quart saucepan with lid and am contemplating adding its big sister (2 quart faberware saucepan) to my repetoir."
1,"The best in stainless steelware Whenever I burn out a pot or want new ones I look for Farberware stainless steel. However, it is hard to get individual pots, especially smaller ones, in retail stores, so I usually get it from Amazon.com. I'd delighted that these pots are available from Amazon.com as otherwise I wouldn't know where to get them. The product itself is the best in stainless steel quality for cooking, lightweight and easy to use and stainless steel is reported to be the healthiest material to use for cooking."
1,"Life changing book... This book was given as a gift to me when I visited a small business for a market analysis project. It was the first time someone had presented the idea that a person can have a successful career not at the expense of pleasing God. While few would be called to Tam's same ministry, many people can be changed by the message in this book."
1,Wonderful Basil Johnson is a master story teller and writer. The legends are all deeply meaningful. He really transmits the spirit of the Anishinaubae in a vivid way. I hope he writes down a lot more of these haunting legends and that his hopes for the recovery of the Anishinaubae language and cultural traditions come to full realization.
1,"Fascinating I just wanted to add (to all of the other reviews) that, while the Dirk Gently books may not be as hilarious as the Hitchhiker's book (and at times verge toward drama), I would say they are much more interesting. The plots are complicated to be sure, at times esoteric and puzzling, and you may even have to re-read, but I find it is well worth it. Fascinating."
1,"Van Damme best films. I have no doubt that this is one of the best Van Damme low budget movies. It have everything you need for a action movies. Amazing stuns, great karate choreography, hard hitting Fx, great story and a lot of heart. And don't forget Van Damme do a great acting in this movie together with an amazing director Ringo Lam.The Blu-ray disc itself is a great collectable transfer of the original movie. The picture look beautiful and very clear. It have a awesome main menu and some great special features like Deleted scenes, storyboards and audio commentary with Van Damme and Michael Rooker. For those who speak other Language it only have Spanish and English Subtitles. That's sad.Above all if you like Van Damme I recommend this movie completely. Have Fun."
1,"Funny and great Van Damme stars as a serial killer and the replicant version developed by gov-t. Van Damme acts well and is very funny to watch as the Replicant goes around learning everything around him and gets himself in funny situations. THe movie has a very positive feel overall and is very well done on the story front. Action is great and Van Damme shows off his gymnastics skills again. Everything about the movie is great, so I'd recommend it. It is a fun action movie to watch."
1,great movie bad blu transfer i Love van damme movies he is the best too bad he is getting old no more slits thats done!! Overall the blu-ray to this movie is horrible same as dvd
1,"Replicant Replicant is one of VAN DAMME's good movie ever made by the ASIAN director RINGO LAM.It's a rearlly movies made ,with plot on DNA cloning,whitch is a real scintific process in are future. He plays this sereal killer,very strong,very smart.he goes all over the world, and can never be caught.The police hunting him manage to get a sample of his blood, and from this they make a duplicate with process of cloning,an exac duplicate of the killer, a Replicant,whitch they use the copy to track down the original killer.Jean Claude playes dual roles again like: DOUBLE IMPACT, MAXIMUM RISK and REPLICANT- revolves aroud this clone and original killer."
1,"This is one of Van Damme's BEST! I saw this movie earlier this year, very good effects, stunts, fights, characters, story, acting and all! The entire package is there! I would recommend getting this movie on DVD. Its one of Van Damme's BEST films ever."
1,Works Easy to use/program. I programmed one using a master remote for a main gate and the other for my garage.
1,"Great deal at amazon only!! There are lot many reviews for this set, but I wanted to specifically mention about the cost at amazon!! I find 'em for the cheapest price here!! I got 2 of them and recieved the 25$ instant discount on $125 + $10 rebate on each set + 10% off offer on all the cookware. Overall I feel it as the best deal.And no comments on the set, it is gr8. Little bit not happy with the skillets, but the rest are shiny, durable, well designed.Go for it, its worth of value!!"
1,Still on the job after 39 years! I've had my Farberware cookware for 39 years and have never had a problem with any of it. It has even heating and cleans easily.
1,"Incredible set of cookware This was my first full set. I've bought individual pieces, but nothing can come close to this for the price.The pamphlet that comes with the product says that the aluminum bottom distributes heat so well, you can cook everything on low to medium heat. They are right.The pots are stylish and well built. The pans are excellent -- eggs just slide off the non-stick surface. I'm very pleased with the set and saved ...at Amazon."
1,"LOVE I use every single piece of this set every week. They have lasted forever. They're easy to clean, dishwasher safe and I have the perfect size for everything I need. I highly recommend every piece in this set."
1,"Farberware Classic 13-Piece This set is awesome. Nice and heavy, heats evenly, easy care. I highly recommend this product."
1,A Great Starter Set of Cookware I purchased this set of cookware for my daughter who is a college student living with roommates in an apartment. She is very pleased with the variety of sizes of skillets and saucepans and is impressed with the way she can cook and not burn food like she did before. A real bargain!!
1,"Not A Cadillac, But Not A Yugo Either.... Farberware has been a mainstay in the American home for years. Although I am disappointed that it's now made in Thailand, what isn't? It is still good quality, heavy, transfers heat extremely well and is a joy to use. Whether one uses this set as a 'second', or as their primary cookware, one can't go wrong. Extra piece's are available on amazon, or at your local [store]. When buying cookware, remember one thing, a $10 fry pan or a $100 fry pan cooks a pound of hamburger equally well."
1,"I love farberware's pots! You really can't go wrong with any of Farberware's pots! They really last a lifetime! I have the 3qt,6qt,8qt,1qt,and 2qt. The 3qt is the best for everyday! They will last for generations! My mother still uses them and I grew up with her cooking with them when I was a child and they still are excellent!Believe me you get your money's worth with Farberware! The classic collection is excellent! I know my sets will last as long as my mother's."
1,"Great Stockpot. Farberware Stockpot arrived in pristine condition. Has been used so far for boiling shrimp and pasta and as pot with vegetable basket for steaming vegetables.Cleans very easily and continues to look terrific.This product was puchased at Amazon, a site where I have also purchased Grandchildren Toys, Movies and Books."
1,"Giving is an important part in one's life. Max Lucado's ""Jacob's Gift"" was the best book I've read in a long time! It shows how a young boy gave his project to the couple who needed it. I recommend this book to all young readers and teachers of all grades."
1,always amazing one of the best shows ever. dvd showed up fine with no problems. make the right choice. buy the dvd.
1,"completely tight butthole In my opinion, the first season is the best. But this show makes me laugh every time i watch it. I've watched seasons 1 and 2 multiple times, and this show isn't old yet.Hopefully Amazon Video gets season 3 for complete purchase on here soon."
1,"Refreshingly funny This show is hilarious without being obnoxiously or ridiculously offensive. It's refreshing that it can be humorous without offending half of the world's population. It is not a particularly mature show, but it's meant to be light-hearted and not taken seriously. Every episode will make you laugh out loud."
1,"The best season We're 4 eps right now into season 3 and it might turn out in the end to be the best season yet. But we'll have to wait and see, until then this is the best of the show so far. Along with The League its the best show on cable (Always Sunny is terrible now). You will especially love this show if you grew up in the 90's, tons of references."
1,"Should be three books Three great essays, each of which should be a book by itself. I would love to have read much more about about the frightening religious fervor that permeates so much of American politics and which he describes so well. I often wonder what happened to the separation of church and state.We are becoming no better - or worse - than the third world countries, be they in the Arab world or elsewhere, that base their political, social and most frighteningly, their penal system on religious fanaticism. Of course they don't call it fanaticism. I perused most of the other reviews on Amazon, and it is interesting how members of the religious organizations Phillips describes are offended by the book. Well, what else is new!"
1,"thought provoking helps to make sense of the insanity that's infested USA politics domestic and foreign policy in the last quarter century, with emphasis on the last 6 years."
1,"Eye Opener This book will change what you thought you knew about gov't and special interests. Everyone thinks the gov't has always been controlled by special interests, but most don't understand how deep the connection is. And how long religion and oil(whale and from the ground)has controlled and steered this country from it's inception. This is not a politically motivated book, it's a ""history tends to repeat itself"" book. You will definitely learn a ton from this book. Top notch, but definitely not a optimistic view of the fate of the United States."
1,"Prescient Drawing on historical precedents, Kevin Phillips paints a stark picture of the U.S.A. in her twilight; overburdened by an outrageously large and growing debt, dependent on a diminishing resource, and blinded and misled by fanatical religious elements. This book should be required reading for all high school seniors - we may be able to ""dodge the bullet"" if enough Americans understood the situation - but, alas, this will not happen soon."
1,"American Theocracy I've been reading a lot of political analyses lately (Thomas Friedman's The World is Flat, T.R. Reid's The United States of Europe to highly recommend two) but for sheer, weighty scholarship this one takes the prize. Phillips' critique of an oil-based economy, religion in politics, and the American addiction to debt is meticulously cited, exhaustively examined and ultimately devastatingly conclusive, with a final paragraph that nearly moved me to tears. I wish I could say that I found it comforting to be told that this has all happened before, to the Romans, to the Spanish, to the Dutch and to the British. What really stings is that this guy is a Republican with serious street cred. He's not some wild-eyed way-to-the-left liberal, he's my dad."
1,"""Mr. President, Do You Believe We're In the End Times?"" That was the question the president couldn't answer in his press conference earlier this week. If you want to understand why he couldn't just say ""No, what are you, nuts?"" - the answer's in here.Highly recommended!"
1,Great for fans of Tenchi Universe. This CD is great if you're a fan of the Tenchi Universe series. I highly reccomend it.
1,Princess Leia costume The item was just what I ordered. It came on time and was new and packaged well. I was quite happy with this product and ths company.
1,AN EYE OPENER! Beottner does well to present the factual attributes of the Roman Catholic system. His writings are very easy reading- hard to put down. Artful comparisons between Protestants and Catholics.
1,"A summation of the false doctrines of the Catholic church As a Roman Catholic, who during my early adult life was searching for spiritual truth, this book helped me to learn of the anti-scriptural basis of doctrines of the Roman Catholic church. If you would like to seriously study Roman Catholic church doctrines, and how they compare and contrast to the truth revealed in the Bible, this will be an incredibly important book for you to read and study."
1,"If half of this book is true.... I am a young reader in high school. I attend a Classical School, study Latin, Greek and the Great Books. If half of this book by Boettner is true, it is enough to condemn this church. The chapter on the Confessional appears more hideous than all the gods and goddesses in all the ancient civilizations. I am very interested in this subject and will be getting more books. I am planning to get a degree in classics and ancient literature. If just half of this book is true.....well, one must love slavery."
1,"Great, observational documentary One of my favorite documentaries, ""Startup.com"" follows two high school friends as they create an internet business together.Besides catching history on film, the filmmakers document what happens when friendship enters the business realm."
1,"Sturdy, well-made ergonomic handle This is a good button hook. the zipper pull is handy, as well. Sturdy and the handle is a god design. The shipping was outrageous, however. No fault of the product, though."
1,"Must have for any kitchen This stockpot is a good size for making soup, stew, pasta & chili. It can be used to make two very satisfactory portions or four normal portions (for normal eaters, unlike myself). It is not too large and unwieldy, especially loaded with food. It is simple to clean, conducts heat very well and a delight to use! An excellent value. Farberware also makes a nice pasta insert which is a great addition to this pot."
1,"WONDERFUL POT You really can't go wrong with any of Farberware's pots! They really last a lifetime! I have the 3qt,6qt,8qt,1qt,and 2qt. The 3qt is the best for everyday! They will last for generations! My mother still uses them and I grew up with her cooking with them when I was a child and they still are excellent!Believe me you get your money's worth with Farberware! The classic collection is excellent! I know my sets will last as long as my mother's."
1,"A huge success I bought this for my mother and father who love the Open Road song in the car advert, but had never heard of this gentleman. This CD has been a huge success with them."
1,"Farberware 3-Quart Saucepan I had been reluctant to order this Farberware pan because someone had said it was not the heavy duty pan of a few years ago and that the handle was flimsy. I finally bit the bullet and ordered it because I have another one this size and it is my most used pan. I have a new glass top stove and some pans will rock on the burner and not heat well, I needed a completely flat, heavy bottom. This new one is all of that and more. I could not be more pleased. it is super quality. I highly recommend it.Rita"
1,lasts forever I received farberware pots for shower gifts 42 years ago...I use them everyday and they still look great...I haven't lost a handle yet. Picked up this 3 qt because I did not have that size...love it!
1,"Farberware Classic S/S 3-Quart Covered Saucepan Compared to other products on the market that sell for an outrageously amount of money you can't beat Farberware. I have been cooking for over sixty years and I have always bought Farberware and would not waste my money on any other brand.,"
1,Perfect fit and operation Perfect replacement to my worn out and dead blower assembly. Fairly simple to install in my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Classic once you figure out the best angle to get the old one out. There are only three 8mm screws and one wire harness to remove and re-attach. Save money and do it yourself.
1,"Grab a Canadian dictionary I really enjoyed this book, but reading it at 23 was a small challenge. I didn't know if it was the author, the time, or the region, but I found there were many words that I just didn't know. Some could be deciphered by reading the sentence or paragraph, others I wrote down and looked up; even that was enjoyable. I had done a research paper on Cabbagetown, but really enjoyed a novel written by someone who lived it and loved it.Wonderful story, cool history, great writing."
1,"the best so far I work in a Hastings store in the USA, I was stocking some books one day and as an avid zombie lover, I read the back cover, I decided to come back after work and by the book as I would get a good discount anyway. After it set on my shelf for about a month I decided I wanted to read it, I picked it up and within moments I was hooked! I went back to the store to see if he had any other books out that I might like and to my surprise there was not one but two sequels on the shelf, I bought them up write away! I finished them both in an afternoon! Looking at the back page my heart skipped a beat when I found out there was a fourth book so I instantly got online and found out there were two more!!! But then I discovered I would have to wait for them to release..... the anticipation is going to drive me crazy! I must know what happens next!"
1,"Original and difinative rock & roll-Nazareth Nazarteh, one of the only few whom is distinct, just hear the music and you know whose singing. Nazareth music is powerful but not with alot of ""noise"". Just plain good music, in other words just let the music do the talking."
1,"LoL Comedy Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim was an amazing novel written by David Sedaris. I enjoyed reading this book from cover to cover. The humor was never ending. He took real life stories and told them bluntly with a humor that not many authors can match. The randomness of the novel was what made the novel unique. He talked about the little things in life rather than the big. He told about his family relationships, finding his sexuality, and growing up. The continuous culture shock that is David Sedaris's life was intriguing and hilarious. If you like roll on the floor comedy you will love Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim by David Sedaris.By: Kassie Forman"
1,"David and Amy Sedaris- A modern American treasure The Sedaris clan have easily transmorgified into the Glass family of the Post-ironic set. Between Amy's raucous television appearances and David's inimitable readings these two are quickly becoming the Franny and Zoe, the Ernie and Dodi, the Kukla and Ollie for the clued-in readers/viewers with a taste for the absurdly hilarious. ANY creation these two produce, either independently or in tandem, is sure to delight. Buy it all: read repeatedly."
1,"Very. Good. I've read half of this book and already know that I love it. It bothers me that everyone tries to label David Sedaris as a ""humor writer"" and then come to only expect him to churn out ""humor books."" Sure the books are funny, but a lot of his writing is deeper and serves a more significant purpose than trying to make someone laugh. Also, I like how he is a ""gay writer"" who doesn't just fit into the cookie-cutter by writing ""gay stories."" He branches out...and he loves to explore the psychological implications of situations from his past. Overall, buy this book, and buy Barrell Fever, and expect to laugh, a lot, but don't approach Sedaris's writing as you would, say, Bozo the Clown's work."
1,laugh out loud funny David Sedaris is an absolutely hysterical writer and this book does not disappoint. His stories are always quirky but yet truthful and make me laugh out loud. The only thing better than reading a story he has written is listening to the audio version of it b.c there is just something about his slightly annoying voice that makes the stories sing.
1,"What? Me funny? For self-deprecating laughs and family novelty, read this book. Sedaris is a master at it! You'll find yourself thinking of the funny things that have happened in your life and make comparisons."
1,"This book is a truly enjoyable read. If you like the dry wit of David Sedaris you will love this book. Even if you don't know who he is, once you have read the first page you will probably love this book.Seeing the world through the author's eyes for a while helps us to remember the little absurdities we experience every day and, somehow, cherish them for a moment rather than let them drive us stark, raving, looney.Thank you Mr. Sedaris, for reminding us to treasure even the stranger moments that make up the life of a human being."
1,"Who ever gave this less than 5 stars is an idiot I quote this book more than I quote seinfield. I have become addicted to it, to David's twisted use of the English language. I have read all of his other books, and I highly recommend his cds."
1,"The Best Yet This was Sedaris's best book by far, which is saying a lot since his other ones were great too. I laughed out loud at least every few pages. One story even made me misty-eyed. I haven't enjoyed a book this much for a long time."
1,"An excellent read Another excellent book by David Sedaris. I couldn't put it down until I finished. Anyone who truly understands his humor could in no way be dissapointed by this book. The hilarious stories of his family give you a more personal look into his life. While the stories are amusing, at the same time you're able to see how much he truly cares for his family--despite all their visible flaws. The humor in his writing is matched by few. Definitely an enjoyable read."
1,"Only Sedaris... Only Sedaris could come up with some of this stuff. While I wouldn't say this is his best yet, they're all awfully close to each other and all awfully great reads."
1,"Lovin' Sedaris This was the first David Sedaris book I ever read. After reading this book I bought and read three other books of his. This one has turned out to be my most favorite. Once you start reading you won't want to put down. Sedaris will have you laughing over and over again with his bizarre and intriguing memoir. If you read only one Sedaris book ever, choose Corduroy and Denim."
1,"Different... very readable. I'm a huge fan of The Truth Machine and The First Immortal, and this book was unlike Halperin's novels in some ways. For one thing, I don't think he rewrote it as many times. It's much less intricate and maybe not as polished, yet he displays the same ability to put you right into an imaginary situation and convey an astonishingly logical, believable future. The three stories present a benign, moderate, and terrible outcome of the Y2K bug (not necessarily in that order). My only complaint is that they were too short -- I finished this book in three hours, and it felt more like 30 minutes. Anyway, it's very easy to read, and now I really think I have a more balanced view of the risks of the Millennium Bug. Maybe I'll read it again tonight to see if I missed anything. And even though I'm not as scared of Y2K as I was before I read the book, I'll probably still stock up on bottled water and canned goods, and maybe buy a few gold coins and a generator, too, just in case..."
1,"Always reliable. This pan is perfect. It's large, holds a lot of food and cooks evenly after the pan is warmed up. It's easy to clean, comes with it's own lid, which is always desirable, and it's attractive. To add to this review: I've had this pan for four years now and still love it. However, I was in a kitchen store recently and looked at the Farberware collection and found that the quality had gone down, way down. So those purchased some time ago will find a sturdy pan, but the products coming out of Farberware now (as of May 2011) are low quality and not as durable."
1,"Easy to follow, step-by-step instructions for young people Written and illustrated by Michelle Eva Portman, Compost By Gosh! is a simple, rhyming children's book about the joy of making compost - the process of letting worms eat leftover food and turn into that material into something which is perfect for fertilizing plants. Easy to follow, step-by-step instructions for young people who want to make their own compost (under adult supervision) round out this excellent and very highly recommended instructional book for budding young gardeners."
1,Vermicomposting made fun for children As an environmental stewardship educator I use this book all the time when teaching preschool - 4th graders. The rythming text & quality illustrations works well with the early elementary audience. The rich vocabulary and detailed explaintions appeal to the upper elementary student.
1,"Great Book! Compost, By Gosh is a wonderful read-aloud book for young learners. As an informal educator with a non-profit organization, I need read-aloud books that get across environmental messages in an entertaining way. Because the story rhymes, it's easy to get into that read-aloud groove. This is my go-to book on vermiculture (worm composting) - students love the story and illustrations. Excellent resource for a library or teacher and just a fun read for kids."
1,"a Jewel I have owned this book for years. I've read it six times. End up with tears in my eyes every time when the King and the Primate look back over their lives together, fighting for the freedom of their beloved country.A HUGE story that will totally engulf you in the lives of the characters. If my house were burning down, I would return to rescue this one!!"
1,"Excellent quality and value I bought this in my Gold Box values because I own other Farberware products. This particular pan is not only up to the quality of what I own, but I think better."
1,Daughter in Law Loved It My DIL loved receiving this as part of her Christmas gifts. I have had Farberware for 46 years and it looks as good today as it did all those years ago.
1,"Sanuk Sandal 5 STAR! The Sanuk Sandal is so comfortable! The description of the sandal, size, color and comfort was right on the mark. The sole of this sandal has a slight sponge however does not leave permanent foot marks. The fringe fabric strap between the toes is very comfortable and the sole on the bottom is constructed to conform to the bend of the foot when walking. Unlike some sandals which are bulky the Sanuk conforms to the foot and is true to size. It fringe is suttle and the colors are faded. As a surfer, this is one of the best kick back sandals I have ever own! I highly recommend this sandal. I purchased 2 pair just incase someone removes their shoes and borrows mine!!!!"
1,"These little boots are awesome I got these for my grandson. They are the cutest ever, so soft and so flexible, great for just starting to walk .... the lining is so soft and cozy. I highly recommend this item!"
1,"Tenchi Muyo is the anime for the best J-Pop music! Another great Tenchi CD, and I wasn't surprised that it would be. I'm glad to have both the english and japanese versions of Washu's Lullaby and the opening theme to the Mihoshi Special. Just as good as volume 1, if not better."
1,Awesome! I totally love this CD and watched the entire DVD last night....AWESOME!!!! Hios best record in years if not ever as far as i am concerned.
1,"A Captivating Experience I bought Neil Young's 33 1/3 album, 'After the Gold Rush,' in April 1972. Until April 2006, I had had no further contact with his music. At that time, I just by chance chose to see the documentary, 'Heart of Gold,' at a movie theater in Knoxville. It was a captivating experience. I felt I had been lifted into the presence of honest, powerful art and pure poetry. I buy few DVD's and own few; this was one I had to have. Now I am in danger of over-playing it and wearing the edge off my enthusiasm."
1,"Prairie Wind A must buy. Neil Young is an enduring classic and if you've enjoyed his folk rock over the years, you will certainly mellow out when you listen to his latest CD. ""Just a Dream"" is especially good listening."
1,"Essential Neil Young-Success I have long been a Neil Young fan. His music ""rings home"" to me. The music resonates as far back as the ""Crosby,Stills,Nash, and Young"" days. ""Prairie Wind"" is one of Young's best works. The album is one excellent performance followed by another.The music is symphony-like and captivating.I purchased the CD and the ""Heart of Gold"" DVD the same day. Subsequent to listening to ""Prairie Wind"", I said, ""Wow!"". I like the inclusion of the lyrics on the CD jacket. After viewing the DVD, I said, ""Spectacular!"". If a singer/songwriter should write about that which he knows, and a performer perform with both knowledge and heart-felt emotion, then these performances define success. As a son of the Prairie, I say ""Five stars."" and ""Two thumbs up!""."
1,"Great for the preschool imagination. This is a toy that the 4 year old loves and plays with a lot. It has no moving parts and nothing he can take off the vehicle (he likes to remove the wheels and tractor treads from his vehicles). It is made of a rubberized plastic, but in my house that is not a problem. I prefer toys that allow the child to use his/her imagination and in my household this fits the bill perfectly. The quality of the toy was not an issue. There are more than enough details painted/stenciled on the shuttle to make it look realistic. This is our second shuttle. The first shuttle got destroyed when the puppy got a hold of it and used it for a chew toy. So my only warning would be not to let the dogs get hold of it. It is made in China."
1,Awesom book I've been reading this book for a week and I am not done yet but I wanna say as a college student this book has really touched to me. I think everyone should read this book to understand how could affect a mid-age crisis to a person.
1,"very happy We loved the movie and watched it several times. It came in the mail very quickly. In fact, it came in the mail a couple of days later. The movie was good. I liked how the young man kept his head and worked with the police to get not only himself but his fellow classmates released from the hostage situation."
1,"Prinze and Schroder deliver amazing performances I was impressed with the leads and this is a movie based on actual happenings. Prinze in one of his better roles and Schroder has never been better. the school shooting footage themselves might disturb a lot of viewers and it puts thoughts in your mind. Schroder is electric as the kid who was once a student at the school, comes back. Henry Winkler is great also as the police chief. powerful, violent to the extreme and a shcoking end that will leave you hanging."
1,Canopy screen panel I was real pleased with this screen panel kit.It was easy to install and fit perfectly. I wassuprised that Amazon carried these.
1,"Loved it from 1/4 in through the end. Creepy thriller; Bermuda Triangle(implied); Time Loop; Dollars-to-doughnuts you will not see the ending coming, and it doesn't feel like a cheat."
1,"Very good... First off I have never felt the need to write a review before this movie but I see so many people giving this a bad one I wanted to add my 2c.This may be one of the best ""loop"" movies i have ever watched. It has so much going on inside of that I found myself constantly wondering what would happen next and how it was going to happen. By no means am I a film critic or would ever claim to be one, but the acting in this movie seemed very spot on to me. Watching a woman struggle with so many emotions that she seemed to play so naturally was a real pleasure.I really dont want to say much because anything I do say will almost be a spoiler to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. If you're looking for a new movie to try and and are into a sci-fi/fantasy element then I would definatly give this a look. Very well made and one that you will be thinking about for a long time after watching it."
1,"Awesome grip Very comfortable, had carpal tunnel surgery and this makes a huge difference, especially on a longer walk. Love the gold accent too."
1,"Palm Grip Cane This is a great cane - very light weight , colorful and the palm grip is great. My PT person recommended this grip because I have minor issues with my hand but it would work no matter the issue . Hope you enjoy!"
1,"Impeccable musicianship and phrasing These are wonderful historical recordings that are very well transferred. Most enjoyable is the patrician 'pianism' by both Horszowski and, particularly, Szell (in K454 and K481.) While the uninitiated may find Szigeti's astringent and somewhat insecure tone unsettling, the reason for purchasing this set should be the delight imparted by the impeccable musicianship of the artists."
1,"Beautiful watch I love this watch. It was much less expensive here. When you put it on, you'll fall in love with it. The color is a deep navy and the luminescent hands are very easy to read. Also, it's Swiss made. I like bigger watches(40mm) and this one is perfect!"
1,Excellent I wish I had not read it so that I could read it again for the first time. It was an excellent book.
1,"Great Historical Novel entertainment! Reading about court life from Anne Boleyn's sister, Mary's point of view was great fun! This was the first historical novel I read, and since then I have read 20 more, yet I am still yearning to find something as spellbinding as this one."
1,"Wonderful Historical Novel This is the first Phillipa Gregory novel I read, and I tore through it. I really enjoyed how Gregory takes actual historical events and then uses her skill to create a story that absolutely captivates. It's hard to remember, at times, that it is fiction, and wonderful to learn more about a period while enjoying a fantastic read."
1,"A simultaneously informative and torrid read This book was incredible-- hands down one of the best pieces of historical fiction I've ever read. Not only does Gregory nail the pliable nature of sisterly rivalry, she succeeds in bringing an unknown heroine to life. I could hardly put this book down. Little known detailed facts about the life and daily tasks of those in Henry VIII's court arise throughout this story making every page essential. And at the book's harrowing, bittersweet and shocking end, Gregory masterfully handles a situation you have to read to believe. I was moved and educated by Gregory's tale and urge everyone to delve into this worthwhile novel."
1,"Great historical fiction. Read it! This book was so very interesting. I highly recommend it to historical fiction lovers. I couldn't put it down and when I did, I couldn't wait to get back to it."
1,"A magnificent page-turner, wow! This is by far the best book that I have read in a long time. A beautiful historic novel, couldn't put it down. Never a dull or boring moment, just flawless. Highly recommended!"
1,"fabulous! I absolutely couldnt put this book down. I was sad when I was done because I didnt want it to end. Afterwards be sure to read The Queen's Fool or The Virgin's Lover, loved those too! I have even contemplated re-reading all of these because they are so great."
1,"Loved it! I don't usually read historical fiction books. I primarily read fiction action/mystery books but my friend convinced me to read this one. Boy, am I glad that she did! Every page kept my attention. I couldn't wait to read what debauchery, deception or plotting was happening next. Highly recommended."
1,Fantastic! This is one of the best books I have ever read. I could not put it down. Excellent to say the least.
1,"Great fiction with a historical basis This was a wonderful book, hard to put down. The author very effectively blends historical fact with her own imagination of characters' motives and feelings. Very well done and enjoyable."
1,"Great Read I quite enjoyed this book, my first by Gregory. The way she tells the story, from the point of view of Mary, created an easy to follow flow throughout the book. I read it in 3 days, finding it impossible to put down. It was scandalous, heart-wrenching, and entertaining from start to finish. While I can't attest to the historical accuracy, I was looking for a good historical fiction novel and found it here."
1,"Enjoyable historical fiction I purchased this book some years ago to read during a long car ride because the book was long, and I am a fan of historical fiction (and non-fiction too, for that matter.)I was pleasantly surprised. The book is well-written, engaging, reasonably fast-paced, and I didn't notice any jarring anachronisms or inaccuracies of the sort that usually ruin historical fiction. The story is interesting, to boot, although I was not especially gripped by the love-story aspect.Having not had the privilege yet of reading any Jean Plaidy, the closest author I can compare this to is Sharon Kay Penman, and I have to say that if you like Penman, Gregory's THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL will not disappoint you."
1,"I couldn't put it down I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much. The greater than 600 pages was a ""quick read"". After finishing I was interested in researching the facts about that era."
1,"Best book this summer I read a lot of historical fiction -- and more than a few about Henry the 8th and Elizabeth I's time -- but this was by far one of the best I've ever read. I couldn't put it down, and stayed up all night two different evenings until I fell sleep. Even knowing that the general outcome of Anne Boleyn, it was completely fascinating the way Phillipa Gregory developed every character in this book. Each person became alive -- good and bad, villain and angel -- so that you felt like you actually could see these people, hear them talk and knew them intimately. It's a tale about the human spirit, and a wonderful love story that is intricately woven in with a great deal of historical fact. Anyone who loved the trilogy about Josephine Bonaparte will especially love this story."
1,The Other Boleyn Girl Enjoyed the book. Easy to read. Read this book even if you have seen the movie. Gives you more details and makes you understand the time in history better. I highly recommend this book for leisure reading.
1,"Loved it, sad it had to end! I am such a huge fan of Phillippa Gregory -- and this book started it all. This historical fiction is exceptionally well-researched, and keeps you caught up in the sexy drama of the relationships between Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn & her sister Mary Boleyn, while offering some insight to the powerful family leaders trying to influence the king. Offers a beautiful feel for the period. Even though you know what's going to happen to Anne, it's a joy to read, and I hated for this book to end!"
1,"The Other Bolyne Girl If you like historical fiction, this is a ""must-read"". You can't put it down once you get started."
1,"What a great read! Don't be deterred by its length, The Other Boleyn Girl is a worthwhile read. With this novel, the reader gets history, mixed with drama and adventure. As a reader, you grow to have true feelings for these characters, while you might know what historically happened to them.A fine novel!"
1,Stunning! I had given up on finding any more books that suited my liking. After reading this novel I became obsessed with obtaining the rest of the Philippa Gregory works. I'm currently reading The Queen's Fool and The Virgin's Lover at the same time. They are fabulous books and brought me back to reading. The politics are exciting as well as the love stories that made history.
1,"A brief review and account of reading experience I read this book twice. Each experience was rich, and in the end of each serving, I remebered the mood from the story and it stuck with me. I'd have to say I quite admire the stubborn spirit of 'nan bullen' and also the wisdom of her sister, mary.Not only is this book detailed historically, it serves for an excellent experience. As an avid reader, I am usually going on from one book to the next. This book, however, proved to be worth a second read AND one of the most cherished it my library collection. If ""nan bullen"" still lived, (impossible nonetheless)I would thank her. Thankyou, Nan, for teaching me ambition and flirtation!**** GRUDGE WHO GRUDGE"
1,"more than your normal historical fiction This novel is so JUICY! It was reccommended to me by one of my best friends who is a history buff, so i had my reservations about reading it at first, thinking that it would be a bunch of facts thrown together with a simple plot - But as soon as i picked up this monster of a novel, i could not put it down!the relationships are intricate and the characters are fascinating... overall a really great read."
1,"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL Marvelous, fresh version of the Anne Boleyn episode of history, narrated by her younger sister, Mary. I found myself totally caught up in the story, even though I've read and seen many versions of the tale of Mary's sister Anne, Henry the VIII's second wife. I had a difficult time putting the book down and could not wait to get back to it. The times and lifestyles are so clearly dileneated that I felt part of them."
1,"A fascinating glimpse of history ...but an even better story of a girl's journey to womanhood. Philipa Gregory's Mary Boleyn was a three dimensional character who sprang to life in the pages of the book. Mary Boleyn was her family's pawn, married off at an early age and tossed in the king's bed shortly thereafter. But as the story unfolds, Mary finds herself and finally has the strength to marry for love.Gregory's ability to weave a fictional story into a historical work was breathtaking."
1,"One of the best books I've read in a while The story of Henry the VIII is so convoluted that it can be hard to believe it actually happened. Based on historical facts, with the dramatic flair and touches of a true fiction novel, Gregory does a wonderful job bringing everyone back to life and depicting the relationships and situations that made Tudor England so memorable."
1,"A Very Good Read Being a junkie who loves to read about British nobility, I have found some books on the subject to be big yawners, much like college text books, but not this one. Philippa Gregory has a wonderful perception of the lives of her characters, which is evident in her writings. They have become more alive for me than with any other author.I would highly recommend this book and am looking forward to reading the others she has written."
1,"the other Boleyn Girl I really liked the book. It is a story that is a romanticized account of history. She uses actual bits of history, but fills in the time in between with fiction. I thought it was very entertaining, I would recommend it and I would read her other books."
1,"Awesome This is the first book in the series ofthe Boelyn girls that I was referred to.I liked it so well, I have since readthe others!"
1,"the Other Boleyn Girl - Better than the Movie! I initially picked up this book because I loved the movie. I immediately realized that this powerfully written book far eclipsed the movie. Set in the court of Henry VIII, this is the intriguing story of the Boleyn Girls, Anne and Mary. The characters come to life as they fight for the King's affection and advancement of their family. I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction."
1,"The Ofher Boleyn Girl This book captivated me. Although, this book is a fiction, it provided historical information on the wives of Henry VIII. The Tudor dynasty has intrigued me throughout the years and this book gave me information which I did not know and it provided a wonderful novel to read. I truly enjoyed it. My next will be The Boleyn Inheritance, which I understand is as good a read."
1,Couldn't stop reading! This book is great! I love all of Philippa Gregory's books but this one was just amazing. I was having a hard time putting it down! She did a wonderful job at taking you into the time of King Henry's court and making you feel that you were actually there listening to the conversations and watching all of the scandal unfold before your eyes. I recommend this to anyone!I am a BIG fan of Anne Boleyn. I actually make Anne Boleyn jewelry based on pieces she wore on the tv show The Tudors. [...]
1,Rich and sumptuous. If you loved the other books by this author you will love this one. A definite page turner. I strongly reccomend it!
1,"One the best books I've ever read. I can't say much except that this is one of the best books I've ever read, hands down. I can read it over again and again and feel like I'm actually living during this time period and understand the author trying to captivate my emotions. It's a truly brilliant novel. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
1,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!! Okay, so while you may not use this novel as a reference while writing a paper on English history, if you need a book that will keep you enthralled you have most certainly found it.The Boelyn family wants nothing more than to elevate themselves within the English social hierarchy. As players in the court of Henry VIII from a very young age, siblings Anne, George and Mary know how to play the game well. When young Mary catches the eye of the King while at court, the family, under the guidance of their ruthless uncle, meet to determine how to best use Mary to further the family's social agenda. What follows is a thrilling tale of love, murder, betrayal and sibling rivalry. Descriptions of the English court and the actions within will keep readers immersed and interested. The horrific exploitation of women and children and the social acceptance of it all is both riveting and nauseating. An excellent piece of historical fiction, not to be missed.DYB"
1,"Awesome! I loved this book. Bought it on a whim, I was in the mood for it for some reason, although I've never enjoyed historical fiction before and have never wanted to read it. After a few pages I was hooked and can't stop reading her other novels. I hate history, but this book got me interested in this time period and I can't get enough. It was very interesting, a real page-turner. It made me feel smarter for reading it. I can't compare her with other historical fiction authors because I haven't read anyone else yet. I have to get through all of Gregory's stuff first, then maybe I'll try others. But I truly truly loved this book. So far, my favorite of all of her novels."
1,"Two thumbs WAY up Having never read historical fiction before, I was marveled by Gregory's work. I started it wondering if it would grab me enough to hold me for 600+ pages. Instead, I found I was drawn to this book like practically no other - every spare moment I had was spent reading it and I finished it in under a week. Gregory spins her tale seamlessly and enchantingly and her book has piqued an interest in Tudor England that I never would have had otherwise. She made every character spring to life and I felt like I was inside those courts everytime I opened the book."
1,"GREAT views I have always had problems with binoculars, and I always figured it was because I had a vision problem in one eye and that must have affected my viewing through the tubes.WRONG!I had just been too cheap to but good binoculars. I bought these for my wife, and I could not believe that I could actually use them as well. These are great for all purposes. We both love them, I need to get another pair!!"
1,"I'm used to Walmart Clearance rack stuff.... It's only been the last 7 years or so that I've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house, I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning! All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks, and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart. I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe, when it got here and I wore it for a couple days, I really like it.I bought the Large Black robe; I'm 6ft, about 200lbs, a little heavy around the middle, and the robe fits pretty well. The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist. The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs. It ""flows"" nice too, when I walk, not like the heavier terrycloth robe. And the silk lining makes me feel ""rich""!Overall, I like it!"
1,"Hefner aint got nothing on me! Wow I am completely impressed with this robe. I bought the silver/grey robe, and one big thing to note is that the picture just doesn't do it justice. The outside fabric (mainly wool) has a pattern that is hard to explain but looks very sharp. The seams are silk and really accent the robe in the right way. The inside of the robe is smooth silk and the entire robe is not heavy or light its right in the middle. I bought the medium size and it fits perfectly. I am 5'10 and the waist/arms were a spot on fit. Kudos on the fast shipping as well to Amazon!"
1,"Classic Cleopatra So many use the word Diva to describe the movie and recording stars of today. Well that last time I checked in the dictionary the word Diva had Tamara Dobsons picture by it. I saw this film the first time in the early seventies and I still think it was ahead of its time. Shes awesome to look at, has martial arts down to a science. I think an updated version would be a great vehicle for Rupaul. Do you agree? Can't wait to get it on widescreen."
1,"A BLAST FROM THE PAST We saw this movie in the seventies and were blown away with Tamara Dodson's presence. I was excited when I found the movie on this site. I am glad we found it because when we need a seventy fix, it right at hand (You won't be disappointed). Outstanding movie. Thanks"
1,"13 Ghosts is Scary & Fun Another chilling low budget horror film from William Castle and Robb White. This one has the penniless Zorba family inheriting a haunted house that contains 12 ghosts. They need a 13th to set them free. This has some interesting casting. Margaret Hamilton, who is best known for playing the Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 Wizard of Oz, appears as Elaine, the housekeeper who is also a witch. Very fun movie with real ghosts. It can be scary at times, especially the scene where Sy Zorba is locked in a secret room and sees all the ghosts. The spectre of a butcher with a meat cleaver is frightening. Good family entertainment for a stormy night."
1,"Illusion ""O"" is Illusion ""No"" with this DVD,but still a great flick!!! Okay,like many reviewers have stated,no 3D glasses are given with the product,sort of a letdown(since the DVD packaging said it included a pair of glasses!),but if you can find a pair of 3D glasses sitting around the house,they should do the trick,saying that it's still a nice widerscreen transfer of the film in BOTH Illusion O and w/out Illusio O.The DVD does have some nice supplimentals,just not the darn glasses,guess like William Castle himself,this DVD must have had a small budget,tried to contact Columbia Home Video,but they did not contact me back,oh well,still a great cheesy little horror flick!!! The Tingler(Also from Columbia Home Video) is also good fun too!!! Still very recommended!!!"
1,"Filmed in glorious B/W and in ""ILLUSION-O"" Some folks may consider this movie over the top, over the hill or just lame but I---who saw 13 Ghosts in real time (1960)---considered it the best of the spooky matinee fare of its day. It had a fantastic built up to the climax of the story. All the actors and actresses were top notch. But the true power of this movie was that it filmed in glorious B/W and in ""ILLUSION-O."" You can't beat that combination! And those who are critical of this movie ought to take a time out from their self-imposed and sanctimonious attitude and appreciate it; directed and produced by William Castle himself. They don't get any better!"
1,"very inspirational My hobby is studying missionaries, especially videos, and this video is the most inspirational video I've watched. It clearly shows the power of God through a humble servant who sacrificed all to lovingly care for the precious people of India. His faithful ministry yielded great fruits! You will be amazed at the ending and his accomplishments."
1,"Nice Great item. Easy to use, I didn't get any ink on my fingers or anywhere else. It really is simple to use. I've used other refill systems, usually just with a needle attached to a squeeze bottle,but this automatic refill system is so much cleaner and simpler. Once your ink cartridge is full the refiller automatically stop putting ink into it. The instructions don't say to, but when finished I put a small piece of tape over the fill hole. Give it a try."
1,This was easy The shipping was faster than I expected. GEAT shipper. At first I thought that this would be complicated and won't live up to expectation from the reviews that I read. Well it was easy once I read the instructions. There was no mess and I din't get a drop of ink on the sink or on my hand. I highly recommend this ink refill kit. Just follow the instructions. I'll be returning to purchase more.ChuckW213
1,"Love it! The oil rubbed bronze finish of this floor diffuser is perfect. It is well made compared to the cheap contractor grade one I was replacing and looks spectacular on my tile floor. It dropped in perfectly and matches all the hardware, fixtures, and lighting I also have in the oil rubbed finish. A great addition to my kitchen!"
1,"A must-have for any breastfeeding mother When both mom and baby are inexperienced at breastfeeding, the last thing you both need is to be fumbling around trying to get comfortable. The Boppy is just the right fit for everybody and there is no baby product that I used more than this pillow. If you're looking for a practical shower gift, get her the Boppy. Mom will use it 8-10 times a day and take it everywhere she goes!"
1,"I couldn't live without a boppy. The boppy has been a wonderful purchase. I actually have 2 here in the house, one upstairs and one downstairs. I use them every time I nurse, and my husband uses it when he gives our daugther a bottle. We also have 2 additional boppy pillows that were hand-me-downs. I keep one at each of the grandma's houses so I don't have to cart mine around. I find that the boppy luxe is well worth the additional cost over the regular boppy. The fleece texture and the velvety texture are wonderfully soft. The cover is extremely easy to remove, wash and replace. We purchased an extra cover to rotate with during washing."
1,"Couldn't have nursed without it! The Boppy Luxe was my best friend while nursing. It's fuller and firmer than the regular Boppy. I have a long torso, so it put my son at the right spot for nursing, however a friend of mine said her son was too high to nurse. It's also great for babies with acid reflux or gas who cannot tolerate being on their backs. Some days it was the only place my son could sleep comfortably.I got this as a shower gift and went back and purchased another to keep at Grandma's! It's well worth the $$$!!!!"
1,"You should be ""bopped"" if you don't get one One of the best things created for moms in the last few years. Definitely a must have. It makes breastfeeding so much easier, plus it has other functions like propping baby up and to introduce tummy time. I absolutely love it, and there are so many different designs or covers. Great registry item!"
1,So useful I love my boppy. So much that we have two for different parts of the house. I use it for nursing and as a seat for my baby. I have been using it recently for tummy time as well. He is 4 months and leans his chest on it as he plays with his toys over the side.
1,"if i coud give more than 5 stars, i would! i love this boppy, i use it every day. i have two of them so if i stack them and sit my son in the middle, he can sit almost upright and not fall over. he loves this. he also gets tummy time laying on just one of them with his arms over it."
1,"A must have! I use the Boppy pillow everyday to nurse my seven-week-old son. He fits perfectly on the pillow (the pillow is the right height, length and firmness). When I was at the hospital, they let me use three pillows to sit him on while nursing and he would sink down or start falling off. Pillows just aren't as effective for nursing. The Boppy is also great for tummy time or to help him sit up for a moment. I highly recommend that every mom (nursing or not) get a Boppy pillow, it's a great investment!"
1,"A MUST HAVE!!!! I love this product. Infact, I have two of them- one upstairs and one downstairs. They make life so easy when nursing or bottle feeding."
1,"Boppy Pillow not Recalled Just read the review that the boppy pillow had a full recall on it. Went looking for more info, ... and there is an impersonator pillow from some boston company that is the culprit... not this one. This is the original one and currently has no recalls on it. This one is ok!"
1,"Great Product We have used our Boppy for 3 mo's. We don't breastfeed but we still find Boppy to be indispensible. When Isaiah was born, Daddy made a special trip home just to get our Boppy for us to use at the hospital. Everyone loved bottle feeding with it. It has just the right smooshiness for supporting Baby and helps old Mommies and Daddies like us avoid those numb arms and crimped necks. We enjoy it for tummy time and sitting practice, too. During pregnancy, it was a mystery to us when friends told us to register for a Boppy and it seemed expensive but, once Isaiah arrived, we learned very quickly that a Boppy is worth every penny. Other friends have tried the Boppy competitors and not been satisfied. It's hard to believe that the smooshiness, shape, size, fabric type, etc. are so critical but, when you feed a baby round the clock, they are, and Boppy has them mastered."
1,"Great pillow After my c-section this pillow was a godsend; trying to hold a child in the correct nursing position with your abdomen stitched shut can be incredibly painful those first few weeks, especially when they take a few times to latch on correctly. This pillow supports their weight for you so you don't have to. You can also use bed pillows, but my son is now 5 months old and I still enjoy using my Boppy. It still positions my son just right for nursing even though he's grown quite a bit. I definitely recommend this product."
1,A Must Have For All Moms This pillow is great for breast or bottle feeding. Comfy and soft and big enough to fit around my still swollen abdomen!!! The cover washes easily... I got mine as a gift and would buy one for any mom to be!!!
1,"Can't live without my boppy! I've had the boppy for my most of my kids. I LOVE IT! When they're newborn, you can use it for breast/bottle feeding, and I could let an older sibling hold the baby by putting this on their lap and the baby on the boppy. Once they're old enough to start trying to sit up, you can prop them up on this. It also helps for tummy time. My older kids use boppies sometimes as pillows while watching tv! Boppies come in a ton of wonderful designs and covers! I Love Boppies!"
1,The BEST invention ever!!! This was our life saver for our sons first 9 months!!! We used this for ever bottle feeding. Our son was super comfortable and relaxed during feedings. Was especially great those first couple months during the night feedings. I could sit up in bed and feed on this him well I was still relaxed!!! The fleece cover is the best too. Super soft!!! The other covers feel kind of scratchy and are definetly not as soft as this one!!!!
1,LOVE IT! This boppy is by far the best! This particular pattern is so soft and beautiful. My daughter looks so comfortable when she lays on it. It is a must have when you feed your little one.
1,"The best soft cover boppy around Even though this one was a bit more than some of the others out there, it is the most soft! I have talked to other moms who have different ones and they say the fabric isn't soft enough and they need to use a towel on top of it."
1,"This thing is great! Okay, so I'm not a nursing mother. In fact, I'm a dad, so I guess I can't speak from personal experience about the usefulness of this product for nursing. I do know that my wife loves it, though. And I even use it sometimes when I'm holding our son--I find that it is just high enough to set on my lap, and I can rest my arms against it and hold the baby without tiring my arms.The boppy has many uses, one of them being that you can put the baby in the hole in the middle and sit him up in a sort of reclining position. Our son finds this to his liking, and we often sit him up in it while he naps.Overall, this is an excellent product, highly recommended for moms (and dads)."
1,nostalgia This book brings back lots of memories for anyone interested in major happenings of the mid-twentieth century. There is something of interest for everyone. It is worth a look and makes a good gift.
1,"another delightful book by Atwell I love how Atwell sees the world from a long term perspective; it did not begin when we did but long, long before us. It will go on long after we are gone. It is up to us to be stewards for all time. Atwell conveys that message nicely in this book."
1,"Prisoners enter the Hampton Court Flower show In a medium to minimum security prison in England, a new program is started to teach inmates how to garden in preparation for their parole. In the meantime, they make the prison grounds look nice. This is an unlikely group of gardeners, one short timer and three lifers, one of whom is dying of cancer. The four of them learn gardening from books written by a Ms. Woodhouse, who later hires them all in a sort of work release project renovating a garden in a local estate. There are many twists and turns and surprises, but the gardeners find their way to Hampton Court and happiness in the end. Helen Mirren, Clive Owen and the rest of the cast are perfect in their parts and the story is very good."
1,Such a good movie! Why more people haven't heard of this movie I can't imagine! It is such a good movie and I never tire of watching it. Clive Owen and David Kelly were particularly good in it. Worth every penny and then some and please do not stop the movie when the credits begin to roll at the end otherwise you will miss a very funny remark that Clive Owen makes. I love this movie.
1,"This was so funny I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute, original story and all the actors were great. Clive Owen (who was in Croupier last year) was especially good - he is going to be a big star. This is a movie for everyone who loved Saving Grace and Waking Ned Devine."
1,Lovely More people should see this delightful movie. The storyline is a bit unusual keeping you interestedThroughout and cheering for everyone in the show. A true delight to watch!
1,"Unexpectedly delightful The Princess of Dhagabad is a joyful tale, not your average every day Genie in a Bottle, grant me 3 wishes formula. Besides the imaginative storyline, the book leaves you wanting to go back to the Ancients Sands again. Finally, it makes sense why this incredibly powerful being, a genie, would be in a bottle. The story develops both the genie and the girl who is his master, as she learns from him and learns about herself and he learns from her. A fantasy story that is NOT based on Tolkein."
1,"A classic! If you are an adult who loves Harry Potter, you should definitely read this book. It is set in the ancient Middle East instead of modern day England, and it has those sensual parts that are definitely not appropriate for young adults, but this book has the same genuine purity of an all-time classic. It tells of a princess growing up in a richly described world of the Arabian nights. She is a shy and quiet child with a lot of responsibilities, but her life completely turns around on her twelfth birthday when she finds herself in command of an all-powerful djinn who obeys nobody else but her. It is not simply an adventure book, although you will find plenty of magical adventures an near-death experiences there. It explores the meaning of wisdom and suffering that comes with it. Also, the meaning of true love. The book is beautifully written and deeply moving and it will leave you wanting more."
1,"A Classic Sometimes you just happen upon a book that just draws you in and becomes an important part of your bookshelf. This happened with Lord of the Flies. I'm normally one who steers away from literature in the 'classics' section at Borders, as it gives me memories of bad books that we've all been forced to read in high school (then again, maybe I'm just to young too appreciate The Awakening or Mainstreet... ) I just happened to randomly pick this book off the shelf and start reading while I was waiting for a friend to find something. By the time she came back, I was so engaged in the first chapter that I bought it. I enjoyed it...it's the type of book that you can ponder about afterwards and it's not a boring read (*cough*Lord of the Rings*cough*). In fact, I ALMOST enjoyed writing a paper about it senior year! If you'd like to read something unique, disturbing, and thought provoking, then this something you should read."
1,"Huh? Oh, I get it! This book has too much symbolism if you can't think deep enough. The book is mainly about human tendencies. It could be read on a political level, but that takes too much brain power. There is some killing and graphic violence. Above all, the book is one of the best books period."
1,"The Head of an Animal . . . Well, most people in America have already read ""Lord of the Flies"" by William Golding, which is definitely a classic. So I'm not going to give a synopsis, just a general appraisal of the work.The main characters (Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Roger, and many more) are very complex and very riveting. You can clearly observe their distinctive personalities with their actions and their dialogue. And you feel sorry for these characters when something goes horribly wrong.There are many symbolisms in this book (the conch, the pigs, the flies, etc.), and they work very well here. Interpretations are open (except when it comes to the obvious ones). Tensions are high as we slowly move towards the climax. No Hollywood ending here.Golding has created an influential work of art, as highlights in this book are many. This isn't an innocent story, and it's no clichÃ©, either. Kudos to the author.A+"
1,"A Great Read! I read this book a year ago, but I still remember almost exactly what happened. The book is burned into my memory. That's how good it was. It's a tale of a boy growing up, and the evil in our society. We see how the boys decivilize during their stay on the island, and degenerate into savage groups. As in Jack London's ""The Call of the Wild,"" the characters revert to their natural instincts. In this case, the boys become savage group hunters, similar to eary humans thousands of years ago. This book is hard to understand; cryptic, but will give you a new view of the world."
1,"A REVIEW OF THE BINDING The novel itself is excellent, a modern classic. But what I always want in a book review is a description of the binding, so here it is. The Classics of Modern Literature Series has done an excellent job in printing handsome modern classics, including 'The Godfather' and 'The Once and Future King'. This book has no dust jacket, the colors and lettering are printed on to the cover. I find this preferable, because dust jackets are a bit of a hassle. There is no lengthy introduction, and the last page of the book that has writing on it is the last page of the novel itself. So this book is very straightforward. It does have a bar code printed on the bottom of the back cover, which may not bother some, but I don't like it. Other than that though, I don't see how they could have done a much better publishing job. This is a great edition of a great novel."
1,"Survivor Explained I was fortunate to read this book in the 8th grade, it explained all the social interactions of Junior High School. Unfortunately many people never get past Junior High society. The popularity of Survivor has demonstrated this, the weak, the different, and the above average are rejected by the collective might of the average and mediocre. No dissent or thought is encouraged or permitted. An elite few determine what is correct and acceptable. Here is the social model of Liberalism, Socialism, and Communism, you are free to say whatever you want, as long as you agree with them. Personal attacks replace any debate on issues. It is no wonder this book is no longer used in public schools, it raises to many embarrassing issues."
1,"The reader from St. Louis is dead wrong Hey, reader from St. Louis: I don't think so. Yeah, forget Lord of the Flies -- just read Into Thin Air! Are you kidding? This is one of the greatest works of the 20th century. While you are at it, why not read some Danielle Steele -- it's better than this Golding garbage!"
1,"Review/Blog The book is about a plane crashing leaving a bunch of kids stuck on an island. They are celebrating their independence at first but after a while their chance of being rescued is slim. Day to day, they create their own laws and rules to somewhat form their own government. The moral of the book is the importance of the government and how it regulates the rules and laws.I would recommend this book because its very suspenseful and leaves you guessing. The Morals and values can relate to my life and may relate to yours too. The value of the government is often taken for granted as we don't follow the Laws/Rules. The book teaches the importance of how you should follow the laws and to not be a menace in society."
1,"Lord of the Flies tells about what it takes to be a leader. I just finished Lord of the Flies not more then 20 mins ago.I had my doubts on this book very much.I have read many books in my life but this one had one of the best endings.I wasn't that happy with the book for the first 100 pages or so,but the rest was all good from there.Lord of the Flies shows the meaning of the struggles it takes to be a leader.There were key moments in the book nthat foreshadowed the ending.One was in the Beginning when Jack Showed a certain quality that showed that he had the quality to be a leader.When Ralph blew the Conch the First words that JAck said were ""Who is the man with the trumpet?""That foreshadows the leader qualities he has by his curiosity for his choir's sake.I am not going to go any more into detail but you should buy this book and do not give up on it.It has a great ending that you will enjoy."
1,"Excellent Depiction of a Cruel and Barbaric Society A great book... A wonderful depiction by Golding of a group of teenage boys that are supposed to be ""civilized"" boarding-school students but turn wild and barbaric as a result of the harsh island environment that they are set in. This book provides a powerful representation of our own society, and how these animalistic natures all exist in the underlying shadows. Although the adult in his ship rescues the kids at the end, the point is made by Golding in the Epilogue that, even though the kids are rescued, who will rescue the adult? Lord of the Flies connects all readers with its harsh, gritty setting and the personalities of all characters"
1,"A must read! I've been meaning to read this book for a long time now. I've heard about it since my school days but never really had the urge to pick it up. Honestly, I'm glad I waited. I don't think I would have appreciated the novel quite as much as I do now if I had read it in my teen years.Though this book was published in the 50's, it is relevant today. It is raw human nature at its finest. It is audacious, and I love it! It is a haunting depiction of society - an allegory of civilized mentality, which is revealed here as chaos.I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
1,The truth of man lived out in children This book is a classic because it shows how human flaws and strengths can lived out and experienced by mere children
1,"A thrilling journey into the dark side of the human psyche. 'Lord of the Flies' was written to show that no matter how civilized the human race thinks it is, it is all an illusion created for our own safety. We are all animals in soul, if not in mind. I was drawn into the book, I thought of the characters as real people, with real problems, and real personalities. I feared for the characters lives, for Golding's one-in-a-million writing style brought the story to life. 'Lord of the Flies' had to be one of the most believable books I've ever read. With an exciting, realistic plot; well-thought out characters; excellent imagery; and superb symbolism. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to see the hidden side of the human spirit."
1,"""All we have is the rules"" Ever fantasize that you are on an island free from the restraints of society? William Golding has taken that scenario to the nth in this story of a bunch of English boys, plane wrecked on an island during WWII.We see the fabric of society slowly and most assuredly ripping as the rules are discarded one by one. Golding is very graphic in his description of the demise of pigs and plants.One will never look at fun and games in the same way.Lord of the Flies: Essential Art House"
1,"My time to hold the Conch A true masterpiece. To me on par with ""Heart of Darkness"" and ""Crime and Punishment"" on the subject of human nature. Each of the boy's, or groups of boy's, personalities are spot on in representing individual human traits. Death, innocence, jealousy, it's all disturbingly spot on. This is a must read for anyone."
1,"A Classic Lord of the Flies by William Golding 5/5I first read Lord of the Flies in high school, as do many Americans, and recall being the only person in class who actually enjoyed the book (and also the only one who disliked Frankenstein). I picked it up off of my shelf a few days ago (cracked binding, faded glue, and all the pages falling out) and finally reread it: I still like it. It's the story of a group of English boys trapped on a deserted island. In an attempt to be rescued, the boys being to cultivate their own civilization with structure and orders. This all to quickly falls apart. Lord of the Flies is a short masterpiece of children's lives mirroring the adult sphere and, like so many other books lodged in the annuals of high school literature, too often is read at an age when a person is most likely to lack the understanding of the full implications of the book. A splendid read."
1,"THE Boys Own Adventure I will first of all admit that the book is a trifle overweighted on the symbolism angle - notwithstanding, it remains a superb adventure, fable, morality tale and social examination. As for being put off by having read it at school, I can only assume that it was taught too early, or by a bad teacher - I stole my copy after the end of the school year and have been reading it ever since!"
1,"Just a school book? I dont think so! I am 14 years old and loved this book. I have read many books and liked and hates some. But this book I loved!! When my friends and family told me about it it made me sick to think of KIDS killing each other. Once I read it I loved it. Golding really understood that kids will only want to have fun. I recomend this to anyone who likes to read and to anyone over 13 years old. Most teenagers thought it was stupied, but you got to remeber that, that is how life is, there is good and bad people, most peoples like the bad people because they make life seem easyer. If you put kids on a island they would do what happens in the book. Any thing to say to me you can e-mail me at angel73339@hotmail.com I love to hear what people have to say."
1,"School student gives Thumbs up It is evident that many high school students do not appreciate the artistry and terrible truths that Golding has demonstrated in this Ballatyne novel. I, for one, a normal 13 year old, highly recommend this book for all readers. The story line is intricately weaved together to form a tragic, provocative, yet beautifully written novel. The story revolves around a a group of marooned English schoolboys. It follows their struggle to maintain order and it allows the reader to reflect on the state of man kind. I am a school student and give this compelling novel and thumbs up! Buy this book and you too will be spellbound by one of the most celebrated of all modern novels."
1,"One of the best books I have ever read!! What can I say? I LOVED this book!! I read it in my own free time and not for school, perhaps that is why I liked it. But I also found the story line gripping and Golding's style of writing with his descriptions excellent! It seems to be the sort of book that you either hate or like, and I'm sorry that there are people out there who, unlike me, thought the book was awful."
1,"Poetic, Powerful, Authentic writing Not only does this book deserve 5 stars, but it is books like this one that should be the criteria for awarding 5 stars. When I read a book, if it doesn't move me like The Lord of the Flies, I hesitate to give more than 4 stars. However, after reading Golding's novel, I rushed to award top marks. An airplane full of English schoolboys has crash-landed on a deserted island. As their condition detiorates, loyalties and protocols begin to crumble and the animalistic side of human nature emerges within the group. As I stated in the title of this review, the writing is authentic. You won't find the string of cliches like you see with other authors. The story is beautiful and terrifying at the same time. One wishes for 200 more pages as the story climaxes with page-turning exitement. Golding's use of symbolism is genius. This book is on my ""must reads of a lifetime"" list. Put it on yours."
1,"Shocking I loved this book. It explores social interactions between young males, and the limits of the conscience. The ending was shocking... be prepared for an exciting story! (This is middle school reading)"
1,"SPELLBINDING I'll make this short, because there's lots more 5 star reviews to be read! The Lord of the Flies is simply amazing! The way the boys turn to savages presents a chilling reality of the human race. Read it. Now."
1,"Fire on the Island . . . Well, most people in America have already read ""Lord of the Flies"" by William Golding, which is definitely a classic. So I'm not going to give a synopsis, just a general appraisal of the work.The main characters (Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Roger, and many more) are very complex and very riveting. You can clearly observe their distinctive personalities with their actions and their dialogue. And you feel sorry for these characters when something goes horribly wrong.There are many symbolisms in this book (the conch, the pigs, the flies, etc.), and they work very well here. Interpretations are open (except when it comes to the obvious ones). Tensions are high as we slowly move towards the climax. No Hollywood ending here.Golding has created an influential work of art, as highlights in this book are many. This isn't an innocent story, and it's no clichÃ©, either. Kudos to the author.A+"
1,"An excellent peice of literature! I think that the author believes in original sin, because it portraits this in the book. This book has lots of themes, and I think that it also shows the loss of innocence. The author Mr. Golding described the setting so detaield, that you could watch a movie in your head. Each character represents a meaning. For example, Piggy's glasses represent clear-sightedness and intelligence. An MUST READ book! Not boring at all!"
1,"One of my all time favorites It doesn't get much better than this. I just read this book for the 4th time and still get chills at the end. True to human nature, Golding has tapped into his youth and the selfish and brutal nature of a society that fails to speak up and defend its weaker parts. One of the best examples of the birth of a dictatorship. Loved it."
1,"extremely interesting This book is quite interesting and does indeed depict society to a great extent. its point to the fact that given a small population isolated form external influences will bring out the primeval and basic instinct with which we are all born...in other words we revert to forming our own society, based on our so called strength at the time aka aggression. In ""polite"" society today this is largely masked and the aggressor does not literally kill the weak, but subdues, dominate etc by economic power."
1,"the what ol' days? I cannot say enough about this book. There is so much depth in it and so much ot think about. There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader, Jack, becoming the most evil on the island. I think Golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion, as shallow as the choir boys' outfits. Being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school, I would vouch Golding's implications hold true even for kids who aren't lost on desserted islands. Ultimately, the island signifies a pre-adolescent's experience, as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions. I'm glad this book exists, because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth's experiences."
1,"A Lost CCM CLassic One of Glad's early recordings before they became an acappella unit. I did not recognize it at first due to the change in cover artwork (my old LP had the band in front of an old juke-box but without the green border. Superb songwriting, musicianship and vocal harmonies are what's in store on this excellent recording of diverse tunes assembled in a attention-holding mix.. The music style blends rock, jazz and pop styles effectively. This disc should be re-issued if it hasn't already, but then the CCM record industry seems reluctant to do so with many if not most of the early to mid-era classics. Get it when you find it!"
1,brilliant as 2 A-level students who were not at all interested about history or the second world war we were made to read this novel. It's the best novel we've ever read and laughed and cried throughout it. We either loved or hated each of the charecters and were drawn into their lives. We realised the sadness of living in war times. However we felt the brutal beating of the pine martin Psipsina was unnecessary. We also found it disrespectful when a stray cat was given the same name.
1,"A great book which will turn you inside out... This is a great book with strong characters and a riveting story which evokes thought about life's rich, historical context. The characters are so real and well-developed they seem like you truly know them. Some are lovable, some are charming, and some may be detestable, but all are unique and interesting. The story is fascinating... set in a small village on a greek island where the reader experiences the village's sleepy existence, its turbelent military occupation, and the outcome of those (and other) events. The history of the island and characters evoke thought about life's rich, historical context. It shows how history shapes nations and races and how personal experiences shape individuals. Importantly, it also illustrates how each individual plays an important role in defining both the present and influencing the future."
1,"I Loved It!!!!! This was the best book that I have ever read. After having read it, I couldn't stop thinking about the characters lost and all those years of seperation between 'Barbara C'relli' and his 'kotitsi'. Pelagias life really made me come face to face with reality and sometimes I wondered 'why couldn't things just stay the way they were?' Unlike Louis de Bernieres, I really can't find the right words to express my feelings about this book; sometimes I think back to it and cry whilst other times I remember the more humourus stages such as Stamatis and Kokolios, psipsina, Iannis and the priest (but then I come to remembering that they were all lost lives and I get depressed again). A beautifull story! I'm going to read it over and over again but this time, I'll leave out the last few pages and try to pretend that those events didn't occur."
1,"Absolutely Beautiful My Wife, Girlfriend at the Time, introduced me to this Album back in 1998. I remember she told me that she wanted to show me the most beautiful music that she had heard. When she played it for me I had to agree that it was indeed beautiful, I had never heard anything else like it. Soft Black Stars has never lost that for me, no matter how matter how many times I have listened to it."
1,"Awesome book to learn by. Not just for kids either! I've never found books to be too terribly useful until I came across this one. I work at an ice rink in my local town where I teach basic figure skating and coach hockey. My boss had a copy of this book and I started to look through it just for tips. I found so many things that I had wanted to learn - the mohawk, three-turn, and waltz jump - as well as things I hadn't thought of. If you want to advance your skating skills, no matter what your goal, this is the book for you. There is everything from stretches and balanced diets, turns, skating techniques, and even pairs skating. It's a wonderful learning tool for all ages (definitely not just kids!!)"
1,"Great Movie, DVD Only Makes It Better ""Franklin and the Green Knight"" is a top-notch production in so many ways. The story itself is very charming, captivating and enough to hold the interest of a wide variety of viewers. The music is well-done, from the feature's vocal musical numbers to the excellently scored background music. The animation is bright and colorful and the characters are all well-suited to their roles. The DVD enhances all of this. One of the best special features is a ""making-of"" featurette, which includes interviews with Paulette Bourgeois (the author of the ""Franklin Books""), Noah Reid (voice of Franklin), Kristen Bone (voice of Snail) and many other crew associated with the program. Also including is a ""music video"" feature which lets viewers quickly view any of the movie's musical numbers. For those that have a DVD-Rom on their computer, there are also games."
1,"great dvd we have viewed this dvd several times , and each time pick something new we really enjoy this dvd and each time we watch we pick up something new, it was a replacement, and we are glad we reordered it"
1,"A wonderful insite to the mind I'm a HUGE fan of Baum.Always have been. Ever since I was a kid. Reading Baum in published order is an ever ongoing project with me. Now I'm not one who wants to take apart the wonderful stories and put all the elements into little boxes and find out what they are make of, but this book does something that is just the opposite. It takes the stories and looks at them in the order in which they were written! This book is a wonderful look at the ""periods"" in the Baum Canon. This is a great look at how say something like the Life and Adventures of Santa Clause and Queen XiXi of IX relate to each other. Great writing and research makes this book a MUST for any Baum collector."
1,"So You Wanna Be a Comic Book Artist This book takes you all the way from inspiration thru getting your meterial out there to be evaluated. Chapters include: starting a studio, tools of the trade, illustration tips and tricks, creating the characters, creating the story line/scripts, putting it all together, copy-shop comics, promotion and getting publicity for your work, submitting your comics to publishers, video game designing, sources and essential comic book terminology. The book is a complete source for anyone interested in pursuing the field, old or young--anyone."
1,"Spellbinding - a must read! Here's a true realization for that tantalizing opening of Jane Austen's last novel! Critics have always agreed that SANDITON would have led her into new territory. Not only would it have taken her out of her bit of countryside into a bigger geography, but invited her to venture further into the realities of her Regency world. The Sussex coast bring her into the mania and speculation of the new health faddism and more.Julia Barrett has taken Austen's themes up boldly, and carries them to the conclusions she had in mind. And, Barrett's done it with bravura, wit and style. Better still, all this serves as a background to what always concerns Austen: that age-old game lovers play."
1,Extroidinary Novel This book was beautifully and passionately written. It is a love story unique and philosophical. Do we choose our own fates? Alvina will tell you.
1,"Numark PT01 Portable DJ Turntable Excelent product. I connected to my computer easily, could play LP's, 45's and 78's, has speaker; earphone connection, does not need pre-amplifier and once you get the music in your computer with a program like Audacity or DAK Editor you can copy, edit and put into Wave or MP3. Highly recommended for the price, if you're a high tech person this might not be that great but for must of us it works perfectly"
1,"Numark PT01 Portable DJ Turntable Review Excellent value.I have over one-hundred 78 RPM records. I copied the records onto CD's using this turntable connected to my computer and Microsoft Plus software. The result is a sound that was better than the original and much more convenient.The turntable is very compact, easy to set up and operate. I had no trouble at all."
1,"A rare find I found this album only because it was playing in a local record store when i was there. I immediately loved it and purchased it that visit. This album has a very downbeat sound that is mostly instrumental. The lyrics that are included are very fitting and the music never seems to get beyond a pleasant, soft, and medium speed. With mellow and almost hypnotizing rhythms, it is perfect music to listen to in the evening, and mellow enough to sleep to. Apparently there are two good things out of Iceland."
1,"One of the CDs I'm really glad I bought. ""Everything Is Wrong"" is my personal favorite of Moby's albums. It has such techno as ""Feeling So Real,"" such minimalist classical as ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters,"" and many more. It's one of the CDs that I listen to constantly, and yet do not tire of."
1,what would be better title than Review For everyone who was too young at the time for listening him.For everyone who got to know him only by that time when his creations started to belong to up-to-date and soooo cool outfits.For everyone who is wondering what's this special music that's coming out of the speakers in Target.For everyone who wants to know how his whole masterwork started.But most importantly: for everyone who is able to recognize that he is a real genius -and it is really rare today...
1,"WITHOUT A DOUBT MY FAVORITE ALL-TIME ALBUM! I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM BACK IN 1995 AFTER LISTENING TO ONE OF THE TRACKS AT LA BOOM IN CANCUN, MEXICO. IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT AN ASTOUNDING ALBUM. I COULD NEVER GET SICK OF IT. THE DAY THAT I DIE I'LL TAKE THIS TO THE GRAVE."
1,"Excellent Read for Mom & Sons Me and my 2 1/2 year old boy just LOVED this book. He is very much into numbers and has been counting for a few months, so I got this book for him. It's one of the few books he sits for through the whole story. He especially loves the page for ""four"" ;).It is also good for his older brother, who is in kindergarden and learning how to read / spell the number words."
1,Another road classic A great gift for someone who is a huge fan of the road pictures. This is the last one we have yet to see and I am sure it will be great.
1,"wonderful I had all the movies in this ""road"" series that spanned 20 years, except Road to Rio. So glad to have found the DVD version as I only had the VHS one and it was worn out. Love Hope and Crosby and Lamour in all their road movies and will share them with all my friends."
1,"The Wolf's Swan Song This is the last album The Wolf recorded. It has some top-notch songs on it, and a couple of not-so top-notch (the electric harpsichord is overdone!)For any Wolf fan, this is a must. Even after a heart attack or two and kidneys that no longer functioned, Wolf showed on this album that he could still howl like no one else.Recommended"
1,"...whoa. I watched this movie yesterday. um.......wow. Weirdest thing ever. It should be rated R. There is only one word in the entire video and it's ""Help"". Personally, I think this movie was made by a very bored animator who was not doing what he was supposed to and was in the middle of a phsycotic breakdown.Yup.Buy this movie.It is worth your 85 cents."
1,"a great book A very good book indeed, it brings in a lot of information,although there is no way one can confirm it or not."
1,True Gospel I really love this CD. The songs will not only get you through the week but the month and year. Vickie is really encouraging the songs give hope and joy. This is a must have for everyone.
1,"Great book! The book essentially describes our three and a half year boy. The first chapter is almost a biography of him. We have gone through some of the same frustrations that other parents have had (especially with an incompetent audiologist). The book confirmed what we always suspected that our boy is a very bright and very analytical child (very good with computers, etc.) that just happens to be a late talker. We will have him evaluated by a pediatricain specializing in a development clinic just in case but we are convinced that there is nothing wrong with him. This is a great book!"
1,"Answers with a twist A FANTASTIC read... The ""twist"" is that it bases the core reason for late talking on heredity ~ specifically tying in close family members with analytically-thinking/based careers and abilities (engineers, scientists, mathematicians, pilots, musicians, etc.) I didn't know this when I purchased the book and wanted to share that specifically. We got a lot from the book because our daughter falls into that category (otherwise the book may not have been as useful to us). ""The Einstein Syndrome"" provides great insight on ""why"", what can be done in the meantime and on ""early intervention"". If you have a late-talking child, as well as analytical minds in the family, this book definitely provides answers. **Also recommended for speech therapists/pathologists who aren't familiar with these recent, brilliant findings."
1,"TAC from California is an idiot! This Triumph DVD is not staged or studio recorded or anything of the sort. It is a live concert in Halifax. The times have changed and yes the material, music and sound are dated but it is what it is. An amazing 80's cocert that held it's own and despite the less that Stones budget Triumph used to record it, the concert does them justice. Yes, Rik Emmett was Triumph and without him they would never have existed. Anyone who knows the band knows Gil Moore and Mike Levine were no Neil Peart or Geddy Lee. but they banged out great 80's type rock that people all over loved jamming to. Buy it! It is Triumph at it's best live and you're not going to find anything better if this is what you're looking for."
1,"Brings it all back Ordered this in June and finally had a night where I just needed to forget about the day (can you say Presidential Debate) and enjoy being 21 again. Well this brings back 1986 at the Rosemont Horizon (not where the show was filmed but where I saw it).Lay it on the Line people, these guys just had fun and made great rock and roll.Dave"
1,College for Free This book is an excellent choice for the parent and the student to read to get a good background prior to researching and writing good scholarships. The book was in excellent condition and the delivery was earlier than expected. Thanks to Amazon
1,Attending College for Free This book was worth purchasing. There are some great suggestions in this book for applying for scholarships. I would recommened this book to future college students. Book was shipped promptly and received in great condition.
1,"Great 'how too"" college bound text for Juniors and Seniors The perfect text for juniors and seniors planning to attend college. Lots of useful information organized in thoughtful chapters. I highly recommend this book for any high school staff working with students planning to attend college. Also would be very useful for parents wanting to collaborate with their son or daughter looking to reduce the cost of attendance."
1,"Will Get Your Kids Scholarships Hello everyone,I just wanted to write in and recommend this book. It is great for those parents who want the best for their kids and who want to help them take some initiative with scholarships. This book helped get my son off the couch, and he's already won several scholarships. Now that's what I call a gift for parents! :)"
1,"My Coffee Tastes Good Again I have a small Cuisinart 4 cup coffee maker with the metal carafe. After having 2 Cuisinart 12 cups, bite the dust in less than 6 months. I had to rely on what I considered my little back up. I refuse to buy another Cuisinart 10-12 cup again, unless they bring the manufacturing back to the USA.But, I digress. My little metal carafe was black from coffee stain, and no amount of Dawn and scrubbing would get it clean looking. I purchased the Dip it, filled my little carafe with boiling hot water and added the Dip It. 20 Minutes later the water was pitch black when I poured it out, but my little carafe was clean, all the stain was gone.Made a pot of coffee right after it was cleaned, I'd forgotten how good coffee can taste."
1,"Best thing to remove coffee stains from your pot We bought a new coffee maker that came with a stainless steel carafe. After six months or so, the insides started getting dark no matter how many times we washed it. My wife tried vinegar and a bottle brush which helped a little. I remembered a product called ""Dip-it"" my mother used to use. I looked in grocery stores, department stores and specialty stores. No one had heard of it. I should have gone to Amazon.Com first.Following the directions on the box and letting the carafe soak for about 1/2 hour, it was spotless, like a brand new pot. I'm glad I opted to buy a box of 8. This is the only cleaner I'll ever use on my coffee pots."
1,Dip-IT Food and Beverage Stain Remover Dip-It Food & Beverage Stain Remover: 5 OZI love this product! Try it to remove the residual coffee stains from an insulated coffee pot! Your coffee tastes fresh again!
1,"So what? Okay, ditto on the Spencer/Stone/Parker fan interested to see how he handles a female heroine. Okay, ditto on the similarities between Spencer/Sunny, right down to the dog. But to it all I say a resounding so what? By the end of the book, I was so interested and attached to Sunny, Richie, Spike, Brian, Millicent, and ever her mother, I didn't care! So, write on, Robert (all puns intended)! Long may you type!!"
1,"Parker's back, full throttle! The best Parker I've read in ages, tho even his lesser books are great fun. Sunny is sharp, wise, funny, tough - the writing sings, and the character descriptions made me laugh. I'd rank this right up there with the best Spenser (Early Autumn, Looking for Rachel Wallace). Parker is back in touch with his twinkle, and his love of women -and at the peak of his form. Best in genre I've read in years."
1,"The very best of Moby...if you are not the usual Moby fan. If you are not interested in the dull, grey, median, this cd is for you. Moby is flirting with the edges of the extreme, from trashy songs like Someone To Love and Heavy Flow to songs that are themselves a mix like Say It's All Mine towards the more usual Moby stuff. A pity most Moby fans don't like this.I don't see him do better than this ever..."
1,"I love this one This is the perfect marriage of heavy and soft via Moby. Who knew that the little electronica man had metal in him?It's amazing, and remains my favorite Moby album by far. ""Face It"" is the best!"
1,Great Series and Great Author I have enjoyed every book written by David Moody and the whole Autumn Series is awesome. He does a great job writing about human reactions to desperate situations and if your tired of happy endings then you will love any book by David Moody.
1,"Excellent product If you are like me and hate your foot slipping to the front of the shoe, this product is for you. It also provides extra cushioning and works with pumps, peep toe, sandals, boots and sneakers mary jane style. I've used it for years and so far no complaints!!!! This product is available at drug stores but a much higher price (between $6.99 and $10.99). For me the affordability offered through Amazon is the cherry on top!! I recommend this product!!"
1,"Excellent book for history buffs and sci-fi fans Harry Turtledove, master of alternate history, shows his flair for writing with this tome. This book shows what would have occurred had aliens attacked the Earth during World War II. Turtledove's grasp of history shines through with his treatment of major figures (FDR, Churchill, etc.) and weapons. Among the strange things that occur (and they are legion) is a British bombing raid protected by GERMAN fighters. In this first of the Worldwar series, the aliens attack and the Earth desperately tries to unite to repel the otherworldly invaders. Read this book."
1,"A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE Being a WWII buff I was in the bookstore one day picking up books about WWII that I thought might be good reading. When I got home and looked at the cover of WORLD WAR: IN THE BALANCE I saw the words ""alternate history"". That's when I said to myself ""OH NO!, What kind of silly book did I manage to pick up this time?"". When I started reading it though I became so captivated that I literally couldn't put it down till I finished it. I was so addicted that I had to read TILTING THE BALANCE, then I had to read UPSETTING THE BALANCE, and finally I had to read STRIKING THE BALANCE. The worst part is waiting for the sequel books to arrive after you've ordered them if you've already finished reading the first one. Excellent reading, and highly reccommended to all people as a must read...."
1,Skijor with Your Dog Love this book! Used it to gain plenty of knowledge as to the fun sport of Skijoring. I was able to confidently start up this sport and referenced the book many many times...we better understood how to set up our dogs for the sport without the trial and error process. I loved being knowledgable about the sport while introducing my dogs to it. Did this for fun..never tried it for the racing aspect but I would have felt very confident moving towards this aspect of this sport.
1,Great messenger bag!!! Bungalow360 makes great stuff! This whale bag was a great gift idea!!! They offer bags with different animals that are cutely designed!
1,"Great songs with an even better twist! All of the songs on here are covers of older song except for the last one ""Brave Reality"", but please do not let that stop you from getting this CD if you are a fan of Evergreen Terrace. They have done an exceptional job at makeing some good classic songs even better. They still manage to keep that sound we all know, love and expect from Evergreen Terrace. This CD gets better and better everytime I listen to it. It has from Tears for Fears ( Mad world) to Smashing pumpkins and offspring. Its a little sort only having 10 songs but what would you prefer, a CD with 10 great songs or a cd where you only listen to one or two songs then switch cds? Ill let you decide but I give this cd my full recomendation."
1,"In case of fire - grab this cd first I love these guys. They're extremely tallented and they put a spin on songs that are at best mediocre and make them phenominal. I know this wasn't meant to be a huge cd for them, but damn skippy, they did it anyway."
1,"excellent l love this bracelet, everybody in my office asked me where i bougth it...I recommend it to women that want to look fresh, nice and well dressed..."
1,wonderful Idea especially for Hill Side Landscape As I web searching a lot of Hill side design and idea. Finally got this wonderful / Beautiful design. I can't imagine moving thousand and thousand stone and set up on the Hill side. Made the slope become beautiful just by 2 manpower. I like it !!

1,"Weeds Season Four This wacky series of soccer mom, Nancy Botwin never seems to disappoint. Wildly entertaining."
1,"Simplemente maravillosa Esta serie ha sido desde la primer temporada simplemente adictiva para mi, se las recomiendo a todos..."
1,"Great show! Great cast! Cant wait for season 5! The first time I watched weeds I didnt like it. For some reason I watched another episode and absolutely fell in love with it. I now own seasons 1-3 and have just preordered season 4 (which I have already seen on showtime). The cast is great. I really like Kevin Nealon's character, absolutely hilarious!If for some reason you are having doubts as to buying this season, believe me, it is as good if not better than the other 3. I would encourage you to start from season 1 (which is also cheap on amazon.com) so you can see all the character development. Season 4 is great on it's own(it was the first season I watched prior to buying 1-3) but watching the other 3 first would make it even better!"
1,Great series A must have series. On the lines of Sherman Oaks if anyone actually saw it). Hats off too showtime. I only wish i could find the Sherman Oaks series on Amazon.
1,"Great series..... The video is in good quality and DVD was shipped in 3 days without having to pay for extra costs. It was hard finding Season 4 at any department store, book store or electonic store. You'll definately enjoy season 4 it flys by and you'll be tired the next day cuz you stayed up all night watching ENJOY"

1,"Grinning ear to ear If you liked ONE LUCKY LORD, you'll love THE ABDUCTION OF JULIA. I found myself laughing out loud in some spots, and falling in love with the hero, Alec.The only bad part was that it ended too soon. This is one reader who is eagerly anticipating Ms. Hawkins next release."
1,A KEEPER! I enjoyed this book immensely. The characters were very fun to read. The heroine was very spunky and hero was wonderful. She is a dedicated reform worker from America and he is a rake from England. She marries him so he could take possession of his fortune. She wants a portion of the fortune so she can continue her charity work. She has loved him for many years and he falls in love with her after he marries her. Her cousin and his cousin are trying to foil his attempts at getting the fortune. This was a great book. I cannot wait for her next one.
1,Wonderful read! I thought this book was wonderful. It captured my interest right from the beginning and held it to the end. I was able to connect with the characters right away so I felt like I had a vested interest in the outcome. Karen Hawkins is a very talented writer. When I got to the end of the book I found myself wishing she would do a book on Alec's friend Lucien. I picked up the second book of hers I had ordered that day and it was about Lucien! I am reading that now and am just as enthralled with it.
1,"love it This ink is so durable and the color is great. Just what I want. Oh, I bought several bottles in 2006. It is still good."
1,"Wonderful book! This book arrived really fast. I already had a copy of this book; I purchased a copy for a friend because I think it's great. It's great for beginners, or writers who feel blocked."
1,"Wanna see it in use? I really didn't plan on writin a *movie*, but I was looking for something that would serve as a cheerleader and coach, a mentor with a deadline, to get me to write and finish SOMETHING, hopefully in a relatively short about of time."
1,"If you can't get past page 60... I am a working screenwriter, and this is the only screenwriting book I recommend. Why? Most of the screenwriting books out there are very useful - for rewriting. This book actually gets you to complete the first draft - a huge hurdle for beginning writers. You probably won't finish in 21 days, and the draft you write probably won't be very good. But that doesn't matter, because you will finish a draft, and then you can rewrite it and make it good.I still use this book to clarify my thinking, or if I'm on a tight deadline."
1,"Awesome, ignore reviewers that DO NOT read the manual I personally have been using this fountain for three years now and PLEASE read the instruction manual PEOPLE! ( im only saying this because I know for a fact ppl did not do it correctly and made a bad review for their ignorance)You have to put the pump in the water for it to cycle the water back into the machine, once the pump is placed CORRECTLY you will hear no sounds of the pump. You also can control how fast you want the water to flow , which is wonderful. You may have slow flow which sounds like a slow moving creek or turn the water up and you can enjoy sounds of rain, from sprinkles to raining hard! Hope this helps, and everyone please read manuals when you buy something, haha :)"
1,"Not just for women This book has turned my head around concerning marriage, love and sex. Even at 58 years old, she taught me about things that I always had questions about but was unable to even formulate the REAL question so I could deal with a long term marraige that has become boring. I now have direction and purpose. This is a must read for all genders and ages if you want to, really live life."
1,"Love these! I love these, they making shipping items so much easier and are a lot cheaper than bubble envelopes. I don't have to worry about them getting torn and products being lost or stolen."
1,Great buy These mailers are a great value. They are thick enough to hold items securely and seal well. I would reccomend them.
1,Favorite Christmas Album! You'll love this album! I have lots of Christmas music but 'Christmas Under the Western Sky' is without a doubt my favorite! It's a collection of Christmas classics performed in an easy listening but upbeat country instrumental sound that is never tiring.
1,Replacement Cord This cord has a straight plug into the back of the receiver. Much better design than original cord with 90 degree bend.
1,"Surprized If you like campy, independant horror flicks, you should enjoy this one. Not too cheesy and not too serious- The acting is pretty good and the special effects are decent. The storyline is fairly well-developed for a movie of this nature. I thought the ending was very good. Also reccommended: The Seven Doors of Death and The Dead Hate The Living."
1,"Not what you think-100X better! I bought this book because I needed some motivation in life and was expecting just that. What I got was a book that motivates, clarifies, and changes your perception, which if you think about it, when you are lacking motivation that is usually the cause. Each section, their are 100, tends to blow my mind in some way, and causes me to think-Wow! I have recommended this book to everyone I love. Do not call this a self help help book! This book clears the dust out of your mind and makes you feel a little bit superior, because you may be thinking better thoughts than the rest."
1,"very effective simple. states the obvious, but easily forgotten ways necessary to achieve success.very practical, with nice analogies and specific examples from life."
1,"Shocked. I'm a reader of self-help since the 80's and am not usually shocked after reading a self-help book, but I am with this one, this book actually left me feeling happy, motivated and inspired. I can't say I feel that way every time I'm done reading a book, but with this one I was, so if your feeling stuck, lost or unhappy then this book may be for you. I Loved the format, short and to the point, great references, tips and ideas, it's a fast read, a book you can't put down."
1,"100 Ways to Improve Your Life One could easily pass over this book by simply looking at the title. Chandler's suggestions will not just motivate you, if you follow them they can change your life. His suggestions are based on his own experience. He is passing on what has actually worked for him and his clients so his comments are rock solid. One of these suggestions is worth the price of the book"
1,"the best This is the best book for motivation. It's easy to read, but the sentences keep in your mind for months (maybe for years) so you can practice them."
1,"LOVE BARBARA HAMBLY For years, I have loved Barbara Hambly's fantasy novels, but wasn't sure how I would take to a non-fantasy from her. I shouldn't have worried - she has such a magical way with words that she could probably write a cookbook and make it spellbinding. Sold Down The River is the fourth book in the Benjamin January novels and, like the first three, will keep you up all night reading."
1,"atlanta/time A excellant CD/DVD single,from these extremely talented musicians,there stage performances like there music is exciting ,and an extravaganza .If you liked there follow up album SHINE these two extra tracks are BRILLIANT!too.A welcome addition for a devoted fan like myself of these dashingly beautiful talented ladies.GREAT MUSIC."
1,Good start When I purchased my LRH Magic Molder I purchased this and several other plug profile cutters.One reason is I used this to find the centerline of the unit on my tablesaw with a zero clearance insert and also needed it for a profile in molding I am making. All profile cutters are sharp and cut well with no chatter. Nice product and well worth the money spent!
1,Work great I purchased one of these last year for a relative who lives abroad and she is very happy with it and uses it a lot. Her daughter who also has neck problems tried it and loved it too so this year I am sending one to her as well. Good stuff.
1,tall stainless pasta canister is a must have Excellent product for price. Great storage for long pasta products and is a sleek and updated design. I will buy more!!!
1,"Pumpkin sexy hair Love this product. My hair is soft and smells great. I looked everywhere for it but sadly, it has been discontinued."
1,Very much worth the money! Our daughter is 6yrs old and this is her 1st musical instrument! She has played none stop for the past 3 days and has already picked up the flash cards that came with the guitar. Next are guitar lessons!
1,"A poignant book from the best! Roger Tory Peterson author and artist of many bird guides, writes a wonderful 'chapter book' with wonderful illustrations for the young. It brought back memories of my father, my first fellow birder. An excellent book!"
1,"Barely behaving This is a great read as everything written by Jennifer labrecque. This writter cautivates the reader through the whole story with sensuality and laughs.The moment veterinarian Niall Fortson spies Tammy Cooper sunbathing in the nude, he knows his new neighbor is naughty-and a knockout. With a bad reputation and a bad attitude, Tammy has trouble written all over her. And though Niall isn't looking for a scandal, he can't resist her. Luckily Tammy has a solution to cure them of their mutual case of lust-a two-week secret affair....before they were barely behaving!Tammy soon realizes the boy next door is almost more man than she can handle. And she's enjoying handling him -a little to much. After all, someone with her track record is all wrong for a guy dreaming of white picket fences. Still Niall's determined to be more to Tammy than just a boy toy. And with the way he makes her feel, Tammy's inclined to let him convince her..."
1,"Terrific plot and acting, wise and warm - a classic! I never write raves. But this is a very underestimated film. The screenplay is spare and polished. The actors - sublime. Regina Case is amazing in this role. Should have won all kinds of awards. Completely absorbing. Best film I've seen in a long time.No violence, restrained sex - real life, with somebody you are really rooting for."
1,"AWESOME i hate american rap. it is so lame. it was hot when it first came out like 25 years ago, now its just lame. now Uk heads are making this sick grime stuff overseas, i think US needs to watch out and rethink where we are heading."
1,"Still an excelent book Almost in each project which I write I find this book to be valuebale.If you are willing to put more time on ant than just to know the trivial parts, than you must read this book, no matter what.You will learn how ant works on all types of projects (web, EJB, web services etc...).D. Orbach[...]"
1,"The Worst Witch Collection - very nice short stories. Very nice stories. Liked the 3-volume box set. Wish it came in DVD format. Nonetheless, it is a great product. Enjoyed very much. Sincerely, L."
1,"The best reference for medical transcriptionists. Since I am new at transcription, I needed a great reference book to be at my side. This book is great because its sections are in alphabetical order - if you need to find out the correct spelling for ""mid portion"" you simply turn to the ""M"" section, and there is ""mid"" and the different and correct uses for the word. I have used this book frequently and I haven't seen a book for transcription that has been this useful."
1,Easy to use and very informative! I was surprised by how easy this book is to use. I can very quickly find the information I need and get back to work. I love having the AAMT style guidelines at my fingertips!
1,Time Life Presents: Soul Celebration Vol. 2 Yes I enjoyed it very much. Yes I would recommend this to someone. I am a fan of old school.
1,"Deliciously inventive and surprising What a treat this collection is.Deaver is lke a masterful pitcher who keeps changing speeds and spins to keep you off balance. Almost every one of these stories delivers a twist that is deliciously inventive and surprising. As a previous reviewer wrote, ""Triangle"" is particularly clever.My least favorite was the Lincoln Rhymes Christmas tale, which was too long and sentimental. But that's a small quibble. Overall, Deaver succeeds marvelously."
1,"nice I liked this. I read it twice & gave it to a friend to read. It had some surprising endings, and what I liked best was I didn't have to read through lots of details to get to them."
1,"A treat and another star in Deaver's crown for this O.Henryesque anthology of short and yes, very twisted and unique short stories. Each one can stand alone; yet packaged and tied with a bow in this manner, they give the reader a present that opens anew with each and every turn of the page.If you imagaine that you can outwit this author and surmise what the twist will be, you have another think coming. How versatile Deaver is in his range of scenarios, in his wild and wonderful surprise endings; in his choice of characters and his imaginative prose!I recommend this collection to anyone who wishes to be entertained, enlightened and absolutely thrilled to the bone. An exciting and memorable read by the author who has easily soared to first place on my list. I had just finished his 'Speaking in Tongues' when I picked up 'Twisted' and was given hours of reading bliss. Don't miss any of Jeffrey Deaver's works; he is truly gifted!"
1,"Pravana Leave-In Treatment is a necessity for me. My step daughter introduced me to Pravana Intense Leave-In Treatment several years ago and I've been hooked on it ever since. I have dry, natural wavy hair that is frizzy when it's humid outside. Pravana helps control these frizzies. Several of the girls I work with complained of static when brushing their hair so I gave then samples of my Pravana. They too are now faithful users. Oh, and it smells wonderful!!!"
1,"Detangles My Long, Thick, Wavy Hair It really did a great job detangling my hair, actually better than most other products I have tried. I like how it makes my hair feel soft without weighing it down."
1,"Perhapsnotwhatyouexpected...... As a recent ""first time listener"" to this piece (shame on me), I was most pleasantly impressed. I expected the music to be more challenging to the ear. That's usually just fine but the dominance of melody in the songs definitely wasn't a hard thing to handle. Each song seems to have its own individual approach - superb orchestrations by the legendary Mr. Bedford, some tender balladry, some Frank Zappa stylings, some blaring ""War of the Worlds"" horns (after all, we MUST have a few challenging parts). Well worth repeated listenings. I know that for long time fans of this music, the alternate song versions are deservedly welcome, but I would have wished for some unreleased original studio material."
1,wow really good songs I didn't think there is any good rock coming out new anymore this new Saga cd is really good. well musicianships really good and the songs I was surprised how good the songs are. they are still putting out good music which is why nobody will hear it cuz if you have talent and if you play good it won't be heard. you play like you don't know what you're doing then you make money I'm glad I got this saga cd if your a fan of good songs good musicianship or saga you'll love this CD
1,"Through the Narrow Gate In ""Through the Narrow Gate,""Karen Armstrong gives a poinant description of the 7 years that she spent in a convent. She entered an especially austere order with precepts based upon the military, predicated upon Victorianism, upon the misoginy inherent within the patriarical structure of the Catholic Church, upon a revered masochism, and upon a form of brain washing meant to destroy the ego of a novice, supposedly in order to fashion that novice's personage into a more humble, more devout entity. Ms. Armstrong herself is not harshly critical of the Church or of the particular order, but readers no doubt will come to these crucial judgments themselves. We can only rejoice that such contorted religious training has been abolished."
1,"Through the Narrow Gate This book is very simply written but portrays the joy and difficulty of being a religious sister at the time this young woman entered. Since I was a religious and left, I found a lot of what she said helpful in validating my experience."
1,"Great skillet for cooks This is a very good skillet. It retains heat well, cooks with little or no oil and is a breeze to clean."
1,"Ms. Freda Chao Madden This skillet is perfect for a large omlett which you can put anything you like. I love it. I hope it will last longer than my last one which was as heavy as this one, but only lasted three years."
1,"Perfect little non stick pan Great construction, great coating. My wife said it is the perfect fried egg pan, she said she has yet to burn something in it."
1,"Best Non-stick I've ever owned It's a bit heavy, which I actually like in comparison to my cheaply made lighter pans. After about a week of daily use, this is absolutely my favorite pan. Heats up quickly, totally non-stick, so much that you don't even need half as much oil or butter as usual, nothing burns on, and it cleans up easily. The soft grip handle is comfortable, a nice plus. Would definitely recommend."
1,"A surprisingly nice pan I've gotten spoiled by >$200 Demeyere stainless/copper cookware, but needed a non-stick pan for eggs. From everything I've read, non-stick pans all eventually scratch, flake, or otherwise wear out, so it's not worth buying a $200 lifetime pan in non-stick. For the money, this is an excellent pan -- I'd compare it against anything else. The handle is firmly attached, comfortable, and stays cool, while the non-stick surface is smooth and non-stick.The one thing I miss about Demeyere vs. this pan is the rivets vs. welded attachment of the handle. Especially for non-stick, having an entirely non-stick interior with no odd shapes would make the pan even better. I'm not sure why other pan vendors don't weld their handles on -- it takes a little bit more work, but it makes the pan a lot more functional and easier to maintain."
1,"Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized 8"" skillet The fry pan was really well. It doesn't stick and you hardly have to use any butter or oil. I works so well that I'm going to order the next size up to complete the set. I wanted to make sure it worked first before purchasing a larger size. I bought two other skillets that didn't work at all."
1,"Great Skillets I have bought all three now: 8in, 10in, and 12in and they are the best skillets I've ever had. Very heavy duty."
1,excellent. great pan This is my go-to pan. Cooks great for one and cleans in a snap. After much research--this is the pan for me.
1,great cookware this is my 4th anolon advanced purchase. they are made to last. i am slowly replacing all my pans with these.
1,"Sex Pistols live! Filth and the Fury is a great documentary from director Julian Temple on the Sex Pistol's.Film shows how the Pistol's became England's public enemy#1 in 1976 and 1977 by shaking up the status quo.They went against the grain and took no prisoners. The main speaker is Johnny Rotten,and he gives his version of the story,which sounds a lot better than their manager,Mclaren.Has a great interview with Sid in 1978,a year before his death,he seems quite lively and funny, and it's quite sad that he died at 21.Overall a great flick."
1,"great docu Great docu on the band. With great footage of England in the 70's. Great band footage and lot's of great interviews. I laso reviewed the book. It's pretty cool, but this dvd is awesome. Great insight into the whole time period of how bleak everything was. And how they came together to create something that no one realized would become the voice of the youth for a decade. Great film."
1,"Hunting Badger Scores High Tony Hillerman scores again with his riveting tale of greed and pursuit in the American West. His descriptions of the landscape of the Navajo reservation are just masterful. The characters are well developed and the story is beautifully crafted as usual. If you haven't read any of the Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee stories this is a good one to introduce you to the world of the Navajo. Hillerman is a great story teller and ""Hunting Badger"" will keep you turning pages until the end."
1,This book makes you think it out! I hated for the book to end. It left waiting impatiently for the next one.
1,Nu-salt This salt doesn't have any sodium chloride in it and something else in it that gives it a little tingle on the tongue.
1,"Great Album for new aged music lovers! I bought this CD 1) because I love Cibo Matto 2) Because I am a new aged music listener my self, and 3)Cibo Matto`s lyrics dont have to be understandable to say what is said. The beats and techno style music I think is going to be the music people in the future are going to be listening to the most. NOT COUNTRY!"
1,"I Can't Stop Listening to It I had never heard of Cibo Matto, but I read a review of Stereotype A in the LA Times which seemed to indicate it would appeal to me. So I listened to some sound samples and then took a flyer and bought the album.All I can say is I am absolutely under this album's spell. I cannot get over how good and interesting and moving and funky it is. It is fantastic and has rarely been out of my car's CD player. When friend's hear it they all say ""This is great. Who is it?""...""Cibo who?"" Best Album of 1999 in my opinion"
1,">_< This is dne of the best books in the world!!!! I fell in love with this book as soon as I read the 5th book, A darkest hour! I've been reading all the Warriors series ever since!!!! Please don't stop writing these excellent books@!!!"
1,"Just sample it.......please ! I iâ€˜m the biggest â€œhunger gamesâ€œ fan ever, but i would have to say these book are almost better! You have showed me erin hunter â€œnever judge a book by its cover â€œ so please just sample it."
1,"warriors rule! I havnt yet read this book (and i cant wait to) but i read all the warriors books up to this one, and i enjoyed every one of them. Me and my friens even made up numerous names for ourselves and clans. i am Pinestar leader of ForestClan and Mintwhisper medicine cat of FroestClan. i love so many warriors characters such as Leafpaw, Sandstom, Sorreltail and more. buy this book and the entire rest of the series youll enjoy it!"
1,Txighovohckhvkhvkhvihi It was really good I think people will like this book bchchffbbfhfh Chubb church. Changing funding. Find entrenched this finch fish disobedience
1,"Romantic minimalism at it's best! One of the calmest, yet vibrant collection of songs I have heard in years. The way it presents itself is at first almost unnoticeable - like a rain in the forest which plays itself out and crescendos like the force of a waterfall. Meditation music has never been so beautiful."
1,"For Christians who like Classic Rock I'm a long time listener of Glass Harp and Phil Keaggy. I'm not a music critic, so this review will be simple. This is a good classic rock album for people who like the Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel. They're kind of mellow on this album. Phil Keaggy has some great guitar solos (made even more amazing by the fact that he has only 9 fingers)."
1,"THE definitive study of monastic life at the high tide of the Benedictine tradition. The most compelling feature of this relatively short book is its level of detail about monastic life at Cluny over two and a half centuries. I've read several books on the topic, and none match the granularity and scholarship of Evans' work. Why is this book out of print?"
1,"Best of the Year! alittle bit of everything Llanas's sings with so much emotion, every song is believable"
1,"Grammy winner - just needs promotion! Sam Llanas of Bodeans displays his immense songwriting talents - a personal album, but addicting, as the best music can be. Thanks, Sam & Absinthe boys (& girls), keep it up...."
1,"Sweet sword must buy i bought this same sword at the mall. it is a fine quality sword good balance, a fine piece."
1,"Bronson's Final Bow Charles Bronson gives his final performance as Police Commissioner Paul Fein in this very good telefilm. It may not be the best movie, but Bronson gives it his best and goes out in style. Highly recommended for any Bronson fan."
1,"first soundboming 2 now sway & tech 99 seems to be the year of mix tapes first soundbombing two now this what next? this cd is phat from what ive heard. ive already heard the anthem, get you mad by Eminem, and Chino XL's joint and belive me ill be picking this one up."
1,"Fresher than fresh! To all you gangsters out there! This is hip-hop in its purest form and this is how it should be. All this gun, money, Versace, and crystal talk in today's rap just plain wack. So, know your hip-hop and buy this dope mix tape! (ya heard') P.S. Watch out for those ""sucka emcees."""
1,"Blew Me Away I am going to keep this review brief, but if you are on the fence about buying this stop thinking and do. It's one of the most poetic and musical film(s). Although the films are short they are dense and pack just as much of a punch than any full length film. Definitely worth it."
1,"Best Shoes EVER I have always had problems with shoes fitting. These have been the best shoes I have ever had. I have problems with my left foot after tearing all the ligaments, these have been a life saver."
1,Excellent shoe for the price This shoe is cushiony and comfortable. Rooming toe box is a plus also.As good as Nike TL4 for less than half the price.
1,"This cd is raw! i just bought this cd, and i can alreayd tell that this cd is as good as his last. i just listened to track 17, that is the chillest SONG EVER! if you are a no limit fan this is a must have!"
1,"GET THE ALBUM I DO NOT KNOW WHY YOU, MR. EAGAN,MN,IS DISSING FIEND AND HE'S NEW ALBUM IT IS GOING TO BE THE BOMB. AND SO WANT HE HAS TO MUCH SWEARING WHO DOES'NT. SO WATCH ""STREET LIFE"" IS GOING TO BE 2x PLATNIUM JUST WATCH, YOU'LL SEE."
1,Babe review This is a very endearing film. This is a movie any one of any age can enjoy. My toddler watches it and has learned alot about caring and kindheartedness. My 68 year old father in law watched it and loved it just as much! It's one of the few films you can feel good about seeing and can watch over and over again and enjoy it every time!
1,"One of my favorite movies of all time. I'm a 22 year old guy, and I love this flick, it's great family fun, and Even I like it haha. It's got a ton of adorable animals and a pretty good story line. A must have if you have any kid under 13 years old, or just dorky kids like me!!"
1,"the movie is the best, and better than the new one! the talking mice are hilarious!The pig thinks he's a sheep pig!The movie is the best of pig movies! The puppies are so cute!!!!!!!"
1,"Pig of Destiny A fable celebrating the triumph of the improbable in the face of convention. Clever use of storybook titles, narrative, lighting & music make this a captivating experience. Ntl Soc Film Critics, Best Film. Golden Globe Best Film (music / comedy). 6 Academy Award nominations incl Best Director"
1,"Who can forget the goose having a hissy fit at the window? The movie Babe is so completely filled with memorable and hilarious gags and scenes and one-liners that it's hard to pick a favorite.I'm a sheep pig.Baa-Ram-Ewe.The goose flapping outside the window.The farmer's wife passing out on the motel bed.Etc., etc., etc...Marvelous, marvelous tale of a little pig on an Australian farm who is adopted by the farmer's border collie and trained to herd sheep. The improbable movie turned into the surprise hit of 1995, the video has probably been bought by more families than any other film of recent memory. With its message of hope and salvation, it's a hilarious and sentimental film you can watch again and again."
1,"Amazing and moving! The dvd is great for Spanish as well as English speaking households. Both languages are well dubbed and the cinematography is magnificently beautiful. The Spanish version contributes a quirkier, more ethnic humor that just cannot be translated into English. Highly recommended, you will want to see it over and over again. Wish there was a widescreen version."
1,"A TRESURED, CHARMING, & SO CUTE! This has beed on my top favorite movie lists since i was 2 years old. the songs are GREAT! It reminds me of my childhood. This story has talking animals but they don't talk to humans. It is very sweet and charming and you will be missing out on a lot of you don't watch it! Great family movie!"
1,"the best! suitable for wide span of ages, adults included... beautifully made. One of my favorite ""kid"" movies of all time! watch it"
1,Perfect Classic This dvd should be in every collection of great movies. We loved it the first time andactually re-watch in at least once a year. Good old fashion love story between man and pig.
1,Voted movie of the Decade in my hometown In my hometown of New Brighton Pennsylvania Dundee 2 was voted movie of the decade. The story line was a bit complikated for most of us to handle but we felt it was the movie that best represended our small town. Hogan was brilliant. A must see.
1,"Better than advertised This is my second piece of Analon cookware and I really do ""love it"". It's just the right size for not worrying if something is going to run over the sides while cooking on high heat. It's heavy duty and nonstick as advertised. I will buy this as a gift for someone else in the future."
1,"No more burning things, easy cleaning I've used this pan a few months now, and the non-stick part is still working just fine. I usually just rinse in really hot water, and wipe it clean. This pan heats evenly, and has solved my burning problems on my all electric stove, especially at the center of previous pans. I has nice square sides so the food isn't always trying to slide to the middle, so it effectively gives you more usable cooking space. One hidden gotcha, the manualy saw to never use more than medium heat, but it cooks just fine at medium since the heat is spread out better. You might need another pan if you want to seer something over high heat, however, but that's probably true of any non-sitck coating."
1,Walking the walk you talk. I appreciate this author because he speaks from experience. He uses a straight forward approach which I also relate too. The book is in excellent condition as have been all the used books I have purchased. Thank you. Signa
1,Raw & Ballsy Raw & ballsy... Jimmy at his best. Like no one else. He'll rip your heart out and rock you out of any stupor you may be in. Get it and be amazed.
1,"Geezers stay excited... Excellent album after a few listens. Love the concept of how Brits ""invented the language"" not us Yanks so don't tell us Brits how to speak. :-)Each album has been different, and that shows artistic development (not that Mike Skinner needed to prove that to me).Would be nice to have some Grime or Drum'n'Bass remixes to play in the clubs. How bout it Mikey?"
1,music raw&hard jimi talks and plays with the crowd and then explores and unloads then steps back and re-aims.that's what this disc sounds like to me.he can solo and groove and keep people in the palm of his hands and then stop on a dime.this is a must have for folks who enjoy sheer raw talent and history .jimi was ahead of the curve.
1,"EXCELLENT, BUT DISHONEST A good mix, much better than the '94 botch-job. A few criticisms however. Kramer did make tracks like 'Spanish Castle Magic' & 'Lover Man' listener-friendly by editing out Lee's lead guitar, but in doing so he has altered the character of the original performances. They are good examples of Gypsy Sun & Rainbows band workouts. [Brilliant but flawed.] Why alter the truth? 'Jam Back at the House' could have been left unedited too. Gone are both the percussionists' solo and Mitch's drum solo. Why? The lax percussion break offers the song a little space. Apart from these minor complaints the rest of the tracks are well edited."
1,great I love this book just as much as i love 'The Last One.' I feel that this is a great book for all guys and girls that like things about angels and demons. it is very well written an d while reading it i found myself not wanting to stop. so for a short time i was late doing my homework as well as my lesson plans.
1,"great movie i love this movie, the second one isn't that great but the price was so great for the double feature that i opted from purchasing just the 1st movie, great price"
1,"Kevin Ayers and this whole world How one band, let alone one English town, could've produced both a Robert Wyatt and a Kevin Ayers is beyond my imagination. I'm not familiar with Kevin's later works, but of his early post Soft Machine work, i find this to be the most challenging and rewarding. The album is four tracks long, though all are the containers for several lovely songs that are pieced together through sound collages and disjointed jams. Fans of Gorkys Zygotic Mynchi, Super Furrys, and OTC should definitly give this a try. I would suggest also ordering it directly from the label's (BGO Records) website where it can be purchased for 10 pounds."
1,"Excellent, Fun read This is a cool book. I love his writing style and the information was very helpful to me.PLUS, I worked with Ken for years and never knew he was a mountain man with a beard!!"
1,"A MUST For Any Library This is one of the BEST books that I have found. Not only does the author tell you important information, she has a great sense of humor and style. This book not only tells you what herbs to use for what purpose, she also tells you how to grow them. I found this book just in time to start my own garden. I found so much important information, and now have a great garden growing. I have recommended this book to all my friends."
1,"garden witchery As a beginner, I found this book informative and enjoyable.It was easy for me to understand and i came away with wonderful ideas for my small Magikal Garden.I now also understand why I feel so good in my small Garden space!!!Chalice"
1,"Perfectly Magickal ~*~ This was my first introduction into the world of Ellen Dugan and a pleasant surprise. I was excited to find a book that combined my love of gardening and my growing curiosity of Wicca or the Pagan lifestyle. Ms. Dugan writes in a simplistic manner that is very easy to follow. She includes humor, folklore, and shares her experiences, thus making for an enjoyable read. I also find myself using this book as a reference of sort. She includes items such a flower correspondence, spells, rituals, and creating an environment. This book has suggestions for everyone!You may be surprised...you may have a new sparkle ~*~ when working out in your garden!I would recommend this book for the new, emerging, and curious reader. Someone with an open mind and who can appreciate all that nature has to offer. Take a stroll down the garden path and create a little magick of your own.Enjoy..."
1,"Informative and Pragmatic I also would like to disagree with the reader from Jersey who completely slammed Garden Witchery. As a gardener with a couple years experience, I found this book to be quite useful. This book includes help/ideas on how to plan a garden, it goes over the different types of gardens, has info on pH levels in soil, fertilization, how to take care of your garden (i.e. pruning, dead-heading, etc.) and also includes fun ""magical"" correspondences to plants, flowers and trees. If you love to garden, you will enjoy this book, even if you're not into the whole ""magical"" aspect of it all. Even then, that information is at least fun and interesting to read. Honestly, when I was finished with the book, I wanted to run out and plant pumpkins! Read the book- you'll see..."
1,"Outstanding cookware This is my first piece of Anolon cookware, and it definitely will not be my last. While a bit pricey, it is an excellent piece of workmanship, heats evenly and fairly quickly, cleans up very nicely with just hot water. It has become my go-to pot for items like hot cereal, rice and thick sauces. The lid fits beautifully; the lid's handle will get hot during long, slow cooking (no surprise), but the pot's handle usually stays quite safe to handle (unless I let the gas flame get too high, and overlap the sides of the pot).Definitely gets my evaluation of excellence."
1,"The Best Place to Learn About Reformed Christian Theology I have been reading through this edition of the Institutes for a little over seven months with the goal to finish it within a year. I have finished the first volume and have started the second. I am learning so much from Calvin's writings which teach me why I believe what I believe. I am much better informed when defending orthodox Christianity than I ever have been before. You can follow my progress at [...].This is a very easy to read translation unlike several others I have looked at before. The index is great for looking up doctrine based on key words or Scripture passages.If you are looking to purchase a copy of the Institutes, this is the one that I would recommend. It seems to be the one that most seminaries are currently using as well. There is a book calledAnalysis of the Institutes of the Christian Religion of John Calvinthat is a perfect companion to this edition of the Institutes."
1,"The only reference you will need for the exam I'm somewhat of a certification junkie (MCP, MCSD, SCP, and now SCWCD) so I've had my fair share of good and bad certification books.With a basic understanding of JSP and this book, I took the exam and broke the record for the highest mark at the testing centre.This is one of the few books that will likely get you certified without prior J2EE reading or experience. (Assuming you are familiar with J2SE)"
1,"Excellent book I work as a contractor and I had to get the SCWCD certification because my company forced me to. I bought this book mainly for this purpose and I am very much satisfied with it as I passed the exam with 93%.I have been working with JSP/Servlets for an year now, and I had no intention to spend a lot of time in studying for the certification. I just wanted to cram the required stuff and get it over with. However, while reading this book, I really felt like reading it because it is filled with information and the writing style is so easy going.I would recommend it even if one is not studying for the certification."
1,"A must have book for certification This is a best book i have read for a long time. A must have book for SCWCD exam. All aspects of an exam are covered throughly and in depth. I recently passed an exam just studying this book.The language used is very easy to follow and all examples are explained fully. I think it would not be wrong to say, anybody learning Servlets and JSP must read this book before refering to any other resource. I give 6 stars to it out of 5.Looking forward to some more good things form the same Authors. I will be the first one to buy."
1,"Perfect book for SCWCD as well as JSP/Servlets in general!!! I just took the SCWCD after finishing this book. This is THE book to read for cracking the SCWCD! And not only is this the perfect study guide, but it also explains in a most lucid manner several aspects of JSP/Servlets that may have been difficult to grasp before. In short, as good as it gets!"
1,"Great book!!! This book covers pretty much all areas in JSP and Servlets for Web developers exam preparation. It covers J2EE and even Tomcat in details. Worth buying not only for exam preparedness, but, also as a reference guide for all your answers to the Web development using Java."
1,"best certification book I've read Many others have sang praise of this book. Suffice it to say, they are correct. This is a great book -- not just to pass this certification, but also a great reference.I passed with 93% after studying it for 12 days and it took me 43 minutes to write a 90 minute exam.I know this exam can be passed by doing a brain dump. But I didn't do that. I read and understood all the concepts in the book, and it was more than enough to do well on this exam."
1,"Awesome book - recommend for every J2EE programmers This is the best Servlet/JSP book I have read - I read so many other books but no other book duplicates the coverage and depth of this book.I passed the test using this book but I am happier about finding this little treasure. Currently, I am converting WebSphere to WebLogic application and I'm keeping this book right besides me. I'm refactoring this old legacy code and converting to the latest standard.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn servlet and JSP. It may be not for the beginners but definitely you need to have a copy of it if you are serious about servlet/JSP."
1,A Book with both EXAM & REFERENCE COMPONENT. This is an excellent book. I would recommend to carry this book even after passing the exam as it serves as a good reference on many areas within the J2EE.
1,"Best Test Preparation Material for SCWCD 1.3 This is not only a good book for SCWCD 1.3 exam, but also a good reference for web application development. I read this book thoroughly and took some mock exams available in the internet, then i appeared for the real exam. I got 98%. I would strongly recommend this book for customers to buy."
1,Passed with 98%!! A great book not only for the exam but for future reference. The writing is precise and concise. The material is well laid out both for the exam as well as for a quick lookup for information while at work. A great bridge between the person taking the test and the dry and boring specification from Sun (they are meant to be that way). Their handling of JSP tags is better than the 2 books I have on Servlets/JSP.Wish they had a book for the Sun Certified Business Component Developer exam.Raj Auradkar
1,Way better than shaving and/or waxing!! I have owned this product for a month now and I love it. I was tired of shaving my legs every other day it seemed. Waxing was too expensive to have done professionally. And I found it too messy when I tried to do it at home. So I went searching for another way to solve the problem. I stumbled upon the Philips Norelco HP6409 Satinelle Soft Epilator. I did some research online and decided to give it a try. I totally love it. It works really well. At first it hurts a little but I didn't think it was as bad as waxing. After a few times though you really hardly feel it anymore. I like the fact that you don't have any sticky wax and you don't have to have water and soap or shaving cream. You can just whip it out turn it on and away goes the hair. I have only used it on my legs so I can't comment on using it for any other hair removal. If you are tired of the mess and hassle of shaving and/or waxing I recommend you give this a try.
1,"A classic. Not for everyone This is agreat book for anyone who has a good understanding of behavioral psychology. If you do, this book will help explain the concepts employed by psychologists today. It also gives the reader a good feel for the attitudes that prevailed in psychology in the 1950's. If you do not have a strong background in this area, I would suggest reading one of Skinner's later books first."
1,"my favirote craft book this is my most favirote book ever. love cabot's writing, even though she seems a little strict, but i look past that and i look at what the book really means."
1,"One of the best for beginners I read the reviews on this book and decided to purchase it and couldn't be happier that I did. I love the way the chapters are set up so I could jump around if necessary and I love that it included aspects of Wiccan history and the science behind some practices, which many books don't include. Although it may not include absolutely everything it includes enough of a background on everything to help a beginner start their studies. I would definitely recommend this book it is one of my favorites and up there with Scott Cunningham's work."
1,"Required Reading This book is a MUST. It grounds Witchcraft in both Science AND Image-ination, a balance absolutely necessary for anyone practicing the Magickal Arts. From there on it's up to you, but this book is one of the best ways to start."
1,"Good Morning! This was my first book of this subject, actually given me by a friend. CAbot's writing is super, and this book taught me a lot. It's informative, instructional, humorous, and very useful to me. Thumbs up ^"
1,"Power of the Witch by Laurie Cabot and Tom Cowan This was the first book I ever read on Witchcraft...my life has not been the same since. I see the world through different eyes now. Laurie Cabot does a wonderful job of dispelling the myths about Wicca as she unveils the beauty of it. Power of the Witch is a must for anyone seeking the truth about Witchcraft. This book is easy to read and follow. I have read literally hundreds of books on Wicca and Witchcraft....Power of the Witch is still my favorite, and I recommend it to all. Just reading this book is a magical and transforming experience in itself. I have never read any book that has had such a profound effect on my life. Absolutely the best!!!"
1,"autry superstar This CD is great . I play it all day . I put this CD on my Computer and dropped a tune or two from play list that were not my Fav. like 'Good Night Irene' and now I play it a lot . Great Sound , Great Tunes . Gene Was Tops and deserves all 5 Stars on The Walk of Fame ."
1,"Guiding the Family - excellent Very good reference for this chaotic world. Teachers, parents, and caregivers can learn a lot from this insightful book. It would give you an idea why being permissive to children is not advisable. Each adult should be responsible in raising children. You can just imagine yourself like a shepherd and guiding your flock of sheep towards the right path. If one sheep strays away, you pull it back again to follow the flock once again.Excellent reference even for teachers. It provides a deeper insight on families. It will help teachers on how to relate with their students and their families more effectively. Advice, suggestions, comments, and biblical teachings included. Truly, it shows the many support groups, institutions, and organizations in the community that you can collaborate with."
1,"praising The LORD every song in this collection is inspiring! One of my all time favorites. All of the songs are good, unlike some collections that only have a few good ones..."
1,"This Book Rocks! A new twist on the Fantasy genre, this book literally transforms the modern world into a magical setting. The idea of America losing technology, and magic returning to earth is brilliant. This is no generic hack and slash novel, and it isn't some boring philosophical treatise, either. The characters are real, and have both strengths and flaws. They get in fights, yet have to rely on each other for survival. There's plenty of action, but there's actual substance between the battles. Oh yeah, one more thing, the magic ROCKS. If you like Weis and Hickman, McCaffrey or Jordan, this book's for you."
1,"Excellent! Highly Recommend! This is one of the most unique stories that I have read in a long time! Not since Stephen King started his Dark Tower series have I read a book this intriguing and different. The characters are all very interesting and the story is quite compelling. It was hard to put the book down! If you are looking for a great science fiction story that's a cut above the rest, this is it. Can't wait for the next in the series!"
1,"Excellent Biographical Documnetary I am lucky enough to have an 1822 published book by Duke & Brown of SC and purchased another newer reprint to read. This book is told as a matter of fact document about the remarkable life of Archibald Campbell as he spent 6 yrs at sea. It does not have an emotional quality and reads dry. However, reading between the lines you begin to get an insight into the hardships, perseverance and tenacity of this man. A truly inspiring biography. Books like this should become part of a well read library."
1,Great movie My mom died and recommended this to my siblings...I can relate to it!DeNiro is fabulous...and many families may experience this scenario.
1,"BIG SHOW AND BIG WINS I have bought many wrestler specific dvd's over the years, most I have rated three stars or less, this is a five star dvd no doubt about it. Most of the time when I buy a dvd about one of my farvorite wrestlers the match selection is terrible because which ever wrestler it may be the Undertaker for example wins about half of the matches on the dvd. Another negative about wrestler dvd's is too many of the matches are of little or no importance. The Big Show A Giants World does not have these problems, as this dvd has the best match selection I have ever seen, and The Big Show actually wins most of the matches (18-3-1). The matches on this dvd are also some of the most important of The Big Show's career these include, 5 world title wins, 2 world tag team title wins, 1 united states title win, and some successful title defences. If your a Big Show fan this is must have dvd. If I could I give it ten stars."
1,"More than any website I've read the websites, and I've read this book, and I have to tell you the book is better. It's easier to read (duh) plus it has stuff that I've never seen on ANY any web site. Not to mention that you have to reread and study this information if you want it to work--and that's way easier with a book than on a screen."
1,"Great for the price. These Batteries are worth the money. They are cheap and you will not go wrong.I did have a problem with 2 of the 4 I bought, but it is minor. The Batter Indicator will not show up and is showing ""Invalid Battery"". It works fine, sometime the indicator will work and sometime it will not. I can get a good 4 days out of it with no problems."
1,"Very Good Read on 8th Air Force B-24 Missions I really enjoyed this book. I have read several autobiographies and accounts of aerial combat in the ETO and this is one of the best. The author describes his experiences in details that kept me aware of what was going on and how he felt.Also, it was a great read about the ""other"" bomber in the ETO, i.e. the B-24 Liberator.Thanks Keith!"
1,"Vivid This is an amazing novel containing unforgettable scenes in unexpected places: Angie as a high-schooler at a keg party in a field, her father ice-skating on a frozen river, her brother and his girlfriend attending a family wedding in Iowa. Funny, convincing, and gripping."
1,"Well-earned great reviews These folks have earned great reviews and deserve them. They are prompt, and their product is ""as advertised"" or better."
1,"Better than swiffer I have had no problems with swiveling the mop head, as another review had suggested. It does a fantastic job of dry mopping the kitchen floors, and wet mopping worked extremely well. Just some generic pine-scented cleaner, hot water, and the mop pad. When I'm done, I just toss the mop pad in the wash with the towels and it's ready to use again. Great for the environment and great for your wallet."
1,"microfiber mop This product is fantastic. For dusting, pollen, dog hair and everything else on the floor or walls this is the go to mop. Very wide head and mop head adheres to handle by velcro. Washes beautifully."
1,"A masterpiece, pure and simple. Buy it. Gervais and Merchant prove that their combined Midas touch works as well on the big screen as the small. I had tears in my eyes from laughing so much it hurt, and also because they just know how to create those emotionally poignant moments between characters that send shivers down your spine - as anybody who has seen episode 12 of 'The Office' and the Christmas Special of 'Extras' will already know. Everything about this film is perfect, and the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission. Buy it, and love it."
1,"Wow, now thats a shave!!! Clearly the mach 3 is better than the rest, more is not always better dude, the mach 3 is like.......well, it's like one of those sleeper razers. You know, your like getting ready to shave and in your mind your thinking, ""Three blades? this can't possibly...WHOA!, what the heck was that?"" Well Mr., that there was a quality mach 3 shave."
1,it's all good I was hesitant about the size chart because I ordered as a gift but I had no problems.
1,Fantastic Products The clogs are perfect. They are very comfortable and the color is exactly what I wanted.
1,"A most inspiring story by a most courageous woman The story begins when Ruth Bohle, a young American woman falls in love with a young German businessman. She moves to Germany, marries and starts a family. And lives in Berlin during WWII.Through Ruth's eyes, we experience the wartime hasrdships of raising children with coal-gas-food rationing, daily bombing, family separations, foot and train travel, a husband who becomes severely wounded, homelessness, and fear as an American in Germany.We also see the goodness of family, friends and strangers...and how important this is to Ruth's survival through continued adversity.Ruth is the glue that holds her family together during those difficult and emotional times.Ruth's account is REAL!!...Real people, Real feelings, Real war...experienced by a Real American wife and mother.A wonderful read -- the absolutely best book I have read in many years."
1,"Amazing - Motivates kids to eat healthy and be more active! How many ways are there to get our children to read, eat healthy, and be more active? Answer - NONE, until I found Race Against Junk Food. The story is wonderful, action packed but non-violent, and it gently moves a child's belief system into a mode that encourages a healthy lifestyle. What could be better? Read it with your child and see if you don't become more active and eat more fruits and vegetables (and leave that couch & cheeseburger behind)."
1,"Awesome candy snack Unfortunately I can't see to get these for some reason, but when I did try some samples around Christmas, they were super. I have been looking for a store that sells them without any luck. I hear I can get them from Japan, but at what price?"
1,Great book! This is a must have for all x-philes like me! I love this book! this one is so awesome! I always make sure I have it when watching and old X-Files rerun!buy it!
1,"Ethnography with tables of offsets! I hunted this book down after seeing a beautiful ""rodney"" boat from New Foundland on the internet. I didn't realise it was an ethnography when I ordered it, but now that I have it I appreciate it for what it is. I enjoyed reading about the boats and the vanishing breed of men who built them. One of the things that makes this book so interesting is accounts of the use of archaic methods that result in very sound, beautiful, useful boats. The author does go into the building procedures and provide lines and offsets for a few boats."
1,"Great author...great book...Top of the list! This guy is simply my best author of all time....I like his style. He gives me hope that there are people out there who make use of their hearts and brains in seeking after God. His books generally stimulate me to search beyond the usual all-so-familiar religious stereotypes. Larry is honest and clear. He has set his heart on pilgrimage and has drawn those of us who feel him towards the same road.I first read his book ""Inside Out"" about 10 years ago and since then, I buy every book he writes or has ever written. For some of his books, one needs to ""spiritually grow"" into them before you can actually comprehend his line of thought.Anything less than a five star would be an injustice to a man who has poured out heart and soul into seeking God and being honest!"
1,Terra Cotta Garlic Roaster I ordered this item so use in my microwave. It works perfectly and I am very very pleased with it.I would recommend this Roaster to my friends and family.
1,"Terra Cotta Garlic Roaster Purchased this for my sister-in-law for Christmas and it is exactly what she was looking for. I was looking for a small one to use with one bulb of garlic, but this will be able to hold two, possibly three small bulbs of garlic."
1,Windows Vista It is so great that I want to install the Interactive Multimedia DVD in my new PC but seems it doesn't work with Windows Vista. Did anybody solved this problem?
1,"Excellent! This nine-part documentary is not only a history of the Jews, it's a history of the western world! Hundreds of thousands of dollars were probably spent in the production of this series. Abba Eban takes the viewer all over the world to examine one of the world's most gifted and intriguing people - the Jews. These tapes will not put you to sleep. The music and images allows the viewer to relive Jewish history. And consequently, come to understand the world we live in today much better. I know the tapes are pricey, but own this documentary if you ever have the chance. You'll never regret it."
1,"Recommeded!!! It takes 9 hours to watch a complete set and it worths it. It interesting that my 6 years old daughter was watching some parts with me and we both enjoyed. There are a lot of reasons to watch the program. First, it gives a good overview of the western civilization from sumerians. Second, the quality of the material is superb. You'll see a lot of beautiful places around the globe. Third, you'll learn about the jews.Some things are quite surpising. The program is focused on dates, places and events. It tells you what happened and where but not much about why. Also it doesn't tell much jewish religion or traditions. If you want to know about jewish holidays, what kosher is etc, you'll need to look for other sources.Overall, it's a great history program!"
1,"A fabulous soulful album! This album definately lived upto expectations. I also purchased some of the album for gifts and were received with great thanks, and the reivews I had back were very favourable. Definately worth buying!!"
1,"Back where he belongs! It's taken him 26 years to produce a new album but it really is worth the wait! Always too good to be a side-man in my opinion, he has worked along side the likes of Eric Clapton, George Harrision & Roger Waters playing guitar but his marvellous distinctive voice has gone unheard for too long. This album is a breath of fresh air for those who like me are rather depressed at the lack of real music out there, Every track is strong and you can tell that he has worked very hard on producing such great lyrics. It's musically sweet alright and deserves to sell by the truck load. So buy it and buy your next door neighour a copy too!"
1,Golden Secrets of Mystic Oils: Over 550 Oils and 1300 Spells Golden Secrets of Mystic Oils: Over 550 Oils and 1300 Spells is a great book by anna riva for her oils. A must have reference!
1,"I AM THE SINGER""S (jack russell) SON THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST. IT'S GOOD FOR ANYONE (i'm 12). TELL YOUR FRIENDS, TELL YOUR ENEMIES."
1,One of their best if not their Best!! What an incredible CD. First time through it I loved it. But as I listen to it more and more I feel that its probably their best Album yet. In my opinion this band is one of the best they have been around for awhile and continue on putting out great albums. Their style is just to sweet. Lets hope they keep the great albums coming. This CD offers their hard rocking style as well as their softer ballads.
1,"Rock is back! This album smokes from start to finish!! The first single is killer ""Rollin' Stoned!!"" This could be one of Great White's best performances in years. Rock on guys!!"
1,Legion It as everything I thought it was I enjoyed very much. I like movies that I can watch more than once and still enjoy them
1,Marvelous Characters This is the first of Miranda Jarrett books that I have read and will definitely read others. She with a wonderful flair. Her love scenes are stirring and the interaction of the characters is very nice. Franceseca and Edward are definitely meant for each other.
1,"Honest and Daring This wonderful book, about a relationhsip with one of the most mysterious and charismatic rock stars, is blatant in its honesty. Often, through her perfectly timed and wickedly dry sense of humor, Ms. Huddleston simultantouesly shows us her naivete in direct conflict with her alter ego which knows better than to think for a moment that Jim Morrison will actually rise to her girlhood-like expectations. Revealing in every way, funny and touching, I read this one straight through!!"
1,The Only Review Book You Need This is a great resource!!! I recently took the ARRT board exam in Radiography and I used this prep book to prepare for it. I scored a 98% on the exam. I would recommend this guide to anyone who wants to rock the boards. AsB
1,Great Resource I was in retired status for almost five years. Had to re-test in order to get my registry back. This book is the only resource I used and I easily passed the test! It had been around thirteen years since my original test date.
1,"Love the stuff I bought this at a local Walmart, but had to share how much I love it. I got it w/the purpose of trying to help control my acne prone skin, dryness and facial redness. All the ""typical"" acne cleansers & moisturizers you find out there either make my face super red (compared to the mildly red it usual is) or makes me break out more.This stuff may not end all blemishes, but I've found that the blemishes I still get aren't noticable at all, and my facial redness is finally under control. Not to mention my skin looks worlds better now that its not dry (I was never able to use a moisturizer bc they always make me break out, even the ones that aren't supposed to).I now use this in combination w/a tea tree oil fash wash."
1,Very Nice Product I have psoriasis. This is the product I reach for the most. Releives the burn and itching. My doctor is also a fanof tea tree oil. This blend works the best!
1,"Exactly What I Wanted This is a great set of pots and pans. Not only did I get this set, but I also purchased about 5 more pans, and love them all. I was comparing this set to the Calphalon Contemorary. I went to various department stores to talk to sales people that work with both companies, and they all preferred Analon Advanced. These pans are truly nonstick inside and out. The only place where food gets stuck is on the bolt(s) inside the pan that hold the handle(s) on. The handles on both the lids and the pans never get hot. I have even put them in the oven, and they work perfectly. The only thing that has happened is the bottom of the pan where the flame hits it has slightly discolored. However, I keep my pans in the cabinets so it's not an issue."
1,"Don't waste time buying anything else but this Analon Advanced I have waited about one year before writing this review to observe the performance of this cookware over time and.... I loved it the first time I used it.... and I still love it today ! This cookware is heavy duty and is a joy to use and clean. I love the nonstick both on the interior and the exterior, after 11 months of use, they look just like they did when I took them out of the box. This would be an excellent choice for the novice or the professional cook."
1,Great Item I got this to convert some floor speakers to mount on pole stands. They were just what I needed and expected. Very good quality and even come with the mounting screws. This was a great buy!!!
1,Love to cook in large amounts This product was purchased to match previous pieces in a set. I love the size of the stock pot
1,Excellent book Very pleased in service and product. Product was shipped quickly and was well wrapped. It is always nice to have this kind of service.
1,"Steve Wozniak, Inventor of the Apple Computer This book is perfect for a school book report! It is both interesting and easy to read. Though it is written for older children, it is sophisticated enough to be appreciated by adults. It includes many details about Wozniak and how he became involved in creating the original Apple computer. The author writes in an easy-to-understand style with touches of humor and details that make Steve Wozniak come alive as a ""regular guy."" Includes many black and white photos and a great glossary of terms."
1,"Great book! I have been using this book for several years and absolutely love to make gifts for my friends using the book. The recipes are easy. The book describes how things are to be stacked in the jar to look their prettiest, and the instructions are very easy to follow. My friends love the gifts. I have used the prepared jars for my own ""quick"" cookies and the cookies are delicious! I highly recommend the book."
1,"Exelent album The best album of Peter Tosh,and my personal all-time best reggae album.Incredible songs like No Sympathy,Burial,Why Must I Cry...incredible meaning lyrics and phenomenol music and sound efects.It really is a 5 stars album."
1,"Great Peter Tosh Debut Album Legalize It could very well be Peter's best album. There's a little bit of everything on this album, including the humorous Legalize It, the excellent Igziabeher, and a softer side of Peter on Ketchy Shuby. But some more real talent is on the old Wailers classics, Burial, No Sympathy, and Brand New Second Hand. My favorite track is Why Must I Cry, co-written by Bob Marley. Every track is good in it's own right, and this is a great cd to buy for any collection."
1,Gloria****** Is truly a God honoring song. This couple is definitly glorifing God. The cd is FIVE STAR
1,GREAT SAW THEM LAST NIGHT IN CONCERT THEY WERE GREAT. THEY LEFT THERE WATERMARK ON ME WISH THEM ALL THE LUCK MAY GOD BE WITH THEM
1,"Worth every penny. This cookware set is simply wonderful and is a delight to use. The pots and pans are heavy (which I like) and very well-built. The stay-cool handles are an added bonus. I own cookware sets by Calphalon and Lagostina, and I have to say that the Anolon set is my favorite and the set I use everyday. I can't recommend it highly enough."
1,"Great Product. Great Price I bought this cookwear for my wife last year. It cooks well, it washes well (that is my job) and it looks good and we display it on a pot rack.We had bought some individual pieces of Anolon, but the 10 piece set is a bargain.Almost every time my wife cooks with these pots, she thanks me again for buying them."
1,"Terrific cooking tool. Makes cooking more fun! I bought this set almost a year ago, after having used a set of old-fashioned pots and pans for many years. These are a delight to use! Sunny side up eggs, which always stuck in the old pan and were often tough and rubbery, come out tender and I love just sliding them out of the pan onto the plate. I don't even have to use a spatula to loosen them. Even for food that doesn't slide out, clean up is really easy.I did take the time to not just read, but actually learn the manufacturer's instructions for taking care of them and follow them to a T. (My Dad taught me that if I take care of my tools, they'll take care of me.) So they still look and work like new.I enjoy cooking much more now that I don't have to worry about sticking. I'm more adventurous, because I know that even if the food doesn't turn out great, at least it won't be a hassle to clean."
1,"Excellent Home Gourmet Cook Set I spend some time researching to finding the right set of non-stick for someone who wanted to do a little more than boil water at home. My final authority was Consumer Report, who ranked this set very highly in terms of quality--and it was cheaper than some of the more prestigious competition.I have been using the cookware for a month and so far, I have not been disappointed! The non-stick works beautifully, although I have been trying to clean up quickly after use (this may not last long). I have even sauted vegetables with no oil sucessfully. The handles stay extremely cool and the glass top lids make staying in control easy.Not necessairly negative but prospective buyers should be aware that they are noticably heavier than cheaper cookware.From my view, the only negative (minor) is that the two sauce pans are a little slimmer/taller than I would like, although total capacity is fine."
1,I got what I wanted...*smile* I got the product I purchased and in a timely manner. The had one small stratch from handling but nothing to make me regret my purchase THANKS!!
1,"The Best criminal investigation show out there. This is by far the best criminal investigation show out there. The characters are very good, and the show never dies down. It's never predictible and there are so many twists and turns. One of the best shows out there!"
1,"ncis season 3 well first of all ncis rules!! i adore all the heroes, the story and especially gibbs!!Its not just a normal criminal series, it is funny and keeps you anxious! buuuuuuut it was really sad that kaite died i liked her ncis will never be the same:/"
1,movie series-NCIS Fantastic DVD..........hope to buy all the other DVDs. Good price and very quick shipment.
1,"Great series Great series, love it bunches. Purchased it for a gift. Arrived quicker than expected and was well packaged for protection."
1,"NCIS great The third season NCIS arrived right away, in excellent condition, and it has been very entertaining. We especially like the added features (visiting with the cast, etc.) in addition to the series itself."
1,Love NCIS I LOVE this series. The characters are all so great. Getting the DVD for the season was even more enjoyable ... no advertisement interruptions. Waiting anxiously for the next season ... on DVD and TV.
1,"Great Show - Fantastic Season!! I just recently discovered NCIS (I know - where have I been?). It is just a really wonderful show - funny, intelligent, engaging. This season is better than the previous two, for two main reasons: 1) Character development of the leads is hitting a ""high point"" & 2)Ziva...great character, big improvement over Kate. Pick up the 3rd Season and ENJOY!"
1,"Great Purchase I was so excited to have recieved my DVD's of NCIS. I have watched all the episodes already, and I'm really happy with the condition and the packaging of the product. Really happy with my experiance, overall.Thank you:))"
1,"An Excellent Season of NCIS! Season three of NCIS is great! So much suspense, adventure, excitement, Tony, Gibbs, McGee, and Abby! Great new characters, though I think that Lauren Holly should have never cut her hair."
1,great price The price I was able to get for Seasons 1 and 2 was great. The 3rd season price was a great buy and they shipped it very fast.
1,action movie If you enjoy war movies you will love this one. This is without doubt the finest production of any war movie ever made. The cast is star after star after star and the action is realistic including some actual footage taken during the war.
1,"One of my favorite movies Movie showed up on time and in perfect condition. As much as I enjoy this movie (and have for years), the producers comments about the making of the movie were even more enjoyable and interesting then the movie itself. I will not give away any of what I learned. Also the comments were quite substantial. So I spent one evening watching the comments and another night watching the movie."
1,Another great war movie This is one of the best will watch it over again enjoy the old cast of actors They don't make them like that any more... SORRY to say..
1,"FROM THE DOLITTLE RAID TO MIDWAY ISLAND... When I first saw this film, I was blown away! But after seeing TORA! TORA! TORA!, I must now say: I'm, still blown away! The film is a masterpiece! It has great acting (which TORA! TORA! TORA! lacked), great visual effects (several borrowed from the aformentioned TORA! TORA! TORA!, but hey, at least SOMETHING good came out of that film), and historical accuracy mixed in with great fictional characters (which is what made PEARL HARBOR, the best film of 2001, an instant success). Anyone who loves war films and dramas will love this film! Count on it! Grade: A+"
1,"The resource on Carson City Gold A wonderful book with accurate, awesome information thatwill definitely please the reader of this book. DougWinter and James Halperin are two of the highest regardedexperts on mintmarked gold known today...Pick it up! You won't be disappointed."
1,"excellent introduction to Weber's work Gerth and Mills' reader provides an excellent introduction to Weber's life and thought. This edition includes excerpts from _Economy and Society_, the brilliant essays ``Politics as a Vocation'' and ``Science as a Vocation,'' plus a brief critical biography and material from other sources.Weber had so much to say about so many subjects that any anthology would require a well-considered method of organization; this book has that. It is easy to navigate. When I want to know what Weber said about a particular subject, I look in _From Max Weber_."
1,Scrolls of the Prophet: The Best of Peter Tosh THE MAN IS A PROPHET. Anyone who loves reggae will love this album
1,"Excellent Box-Set! This 2 DVD Box Set of The French Connection I and II is very well packaged and has lots of intriguing extras. The films themselves are quickly becoming classics, with Gene Hackman putting in stunning performances- especially in The French Connection II during his rehab sequences.I am most impressed that the film took advntage of the gritty and confusing street layouts of both Poughkeepsie and Marsellaise to add to what is an already filmatically challenging spy/crime story.Very good collection- would recommend to those who like good 'private investigator chasing dangerous drug lords' crime films."
1,"the best slow movie ive ever seen A lot of these older horror films fall into the rut of being slow involving little dialogue with long stretches of setup for the messes, but I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE manages to have enough intrigue to hold on. I have a horrible attention span for movies, usually finishing them in several sittings or not at all, but this one was definitely a sitdown watch it all the way through movie.Obviously, it is about rape and revenge. It's incredibly graphic in the rape, and just as heartless. Then it's those long stretches of setup, but the payoff is great as we see her inflict double the terror upon her assailants."
1,"Not as squeamish as everyoneis saying Rape is nothing to joke about. However, I found this movie not as graphic, compared to today's fare. I was excited to get to the part where she gets her revenge and they all deserved it. Parts of the rape scenes especially in the woods, I did feel uncomfortable, because the whole scene went on for like 15 minutes. I first heard of this film when I was 13 and I avoided the film until now, but since I saw Serbian film UNCUT I felt like nothing could be as graphic as that. I don't recommend I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE for sensitive viewers, however if you like justly deserved revenge films this might be your type of movie."
1,"for my husband My husband was very interested in rewatching the original version again after the recent remake was released. He loved it, and now has both films in his growing moving collection."
1,"Not dissapointed I read reviews and asked a couple of people about this movie. I was very impressed. I have already watched it twice and i'll watch it again. Every woman should watch this movie. It was a very real situation that is never dealt with in that way.A woman leaves the city for some quiet time to write a book and runs into some problems. 4 Guys decide they want to rape her and they continuously do so. But they don't do it back to back. They toy with her. They beat her. They leave her for dead. Only, she isn't.She takes matters into her own hands and exacts her revenge on these guys. Every revenge scene was great. One particular bathroom scene, especially.This isn't really for the weak hearted. But it is a good movie (to me). My suggestion, watch it."
1,"A Fascinating Book About a Little Known Woman The Case of the Pederast's Wife, by Blossom Elfman, is an incredibly well researched and written book. the first thing one notices is the quality of the writing and of the scholarship and research. Oscar Wilde was a complex and intereting character and until I read this quite marvelous book, I had no idea that he had a wife! He was, after all, an avowed homosexual. As one reads the book one comes to understand the restraints of the time Wilde and his wife, Constance, lived. Many books, plays and films have been written about Wilde, but Constance, his wife and mother of his two sons, has been neglected, even avoided. Applause and kudos to Ms. Elfman who had the intelligence and wit to discover Constance Wilde and to bring her to life in a wonderfully written book."
1,Organic and tastes great! I love this product. I am very excited to keep ordering this product. All the seeds grew. I will order again from this person.
1,wheatgrass Seed sprouted easily. I am very satisfied with this wheatgrass. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone desiring to grow their own wheatgrass at home.
1,"Wheat Grass This grass grows very well and very quickly. I just use it for ornamental purposes, and it looks great!"
1,"Met my expectations Just what I ordered...seeds. I planted them and within 7 days they are green and several inches high. i am growing this for a wedding centerpiece and It's beautiful, so I didn't eat it. but my rabbit did, and she approves!"
1,"From seed to grass - HOLY COW! As I am writing this I can see these seeds growing. Just kidding but it has been 4 days and each and every seed has sprouted and is over an inch tall. I cannot believe how fast these are growing. I am looking forward to juicing these seeds. I have 2 15x9 plastic containers sitting next to myAeroGrow AeroGarden Pro 200 with Master Gardener 1-Season Kit and Gourmet Herb Seed Kit. The light from this bleeds over onto the wheatgrass seeds. I dont know if its the lights, the soil or the seeds but these are amazingly fast growing seeds.I didnt even bother planting the seeds. I just sprinkled them on the surface (like in nature), of damp soil and covered it with a cellophane covering. They have all dug in and have jumped up.I will update this review after we try the first juice from these.Overall a fantastic product, performs better than advertised!Thank you for reading my review."
1,"A Great Book This was my first time reading a Kristin Heitzmann book, and I loved it. I stumbled across the title at a library book sale and thought it looked interesting. Once I got started, I couldn't put it down. I look forward to reading more of her books!"
1,"Lifetime Keeper Give one of these to a very special person only, never give it lightly. They will keep it for a lifetime. I got one years ago and I paid it forward. I know the person appreciates it because when she is feeling low, I see her using it for her coffee."
1,"Blue Sea Voltmeter Well made and reliable instrument. I used it to measure the state of battery charge on my boat. I would prefer that it had a red, yellow, green indicator overlaid on the scale to make it easier to know the battery condition."
1,"It's a re-release, so what? Yes, this is a past collection with a new title, but that doesn't mean it's a bad book. All three stories are terrific, but different enough to keep the reader from getting bored. I like the new title - it makes it easier to distinguish it from the other Long, Tall, Texans anthologies."
1,pleased as always Was very excitied to find this book on amazon was here within days. Have found this very helpful with this being my first mastiff pup thanks again for being there amazon
1,Great Present for my Grandkids I read this book to my daughter when she was little and now 20 years later I am enjoying it with my own grandchildren. Fun story and illustrations.
1,"Great for beginning readers!! My first grade daughter really enjoyed reading this book. There were many words that were repeated which really helps out first time readers. In addition, there were enough new words to keep it challenging for her. The book was just long enough, not too short and not too long. I highly recommend this book for beginning readers. A plus for us, this book was on her AR list."
1,"Straightened hair the easy way I have wavy / curly hair and had all but given up on ever wearing it straight besides when my stylist blows it out after my haircut. Well, after receiving this styling tool, I have had great luck! It is super easy to use, if you can brush your hair, you can use this styling tool. Great, easy results quickly. Definitely love it."
1,infiniti I have used many hand held dryers over the years. This is the only dryer that dries and straightens at the same time. Cant find in stores now. But excited I found it at amazon.
1,Best hair appliance ever! I have fine frizzy wavy hair. Flattening irons tend to leave my hair without any body. The Infiniti BC173 smooths my hair and still gives it some lift. It's very easy to use which I like since I don't enjoy spending a lot of time styling my hair. I've even used it when I've let my hair almost completely dry naturally and it has already started to be curly and frizzy and this dryer smooths it out. Amazing!!! I've been using it for about 3 years now and it still keeps working like new. I've been thinking about buying another one in case Conair quits making them. I'm sure the one I have won't last forever. I hate it when I find something that works this well and then the company stops making it. Hopefully that won't happen. I don't usually bother to write reviews but this product really deserves a good one.
1,"Infiniti ROCKS! I've never been able to use the brush stylers so I was kind of skeptical about this one but it's a great hair dryer and straighter in one! Don't use it with your hair sopping wet though and you'll get better results. I have thick hair that's wavy, not super curly, so it works perfectly! Need to get a second one for the road!"
1,This is the one! My wife has owned and used this model since it first came out. It is the easiest one to straighten and style her very curly hair.
1,"Top-shelf fountain pen ink Noodler's Black Bulletproof is my go-to ink for serious work. It's waterproof, fraud-proof, and will write well on any kind of paper. This is the only fountain pen ink I know that can be used for crossword puzzles on newspaper pulp without feathering or bleeding through. Once the ink dries on the page, it's not removable. I once ran a note through the laundry in the pocket of my jeans, and the writing was still perfectly legible when I discovered the washed piece of paper in the pocket later.This is well-behaved ink, with only one minor drawback: it exhibits nib creep in most pens. If you don't care about seeing a bit of ink riding the top of the nib as you write, this is not an issue, and the great properties of Noodler's Black more than make up for it.If you write with a fountain pen, and you want an ink that's smooth, waterproof, and rock-solid permanent once it dries, there's really only one pick...Noodler's Black Bulletproof."
1,"great ink at first i was slightly disappointed as i thought it wasn't waterproof like it claims, but i later realized i must have had some old ink still in my pen barrel combining with the noodlers. completely satisfied with this product, just make sure you don't mix it with any other ink... it loses it's ""bulletproofness"" if you do."
1,Quality Ink. Good ink. Just make sure you shake it. I've been researching the blue bullet proof ink as well. Main reason why I buy this particular ink (among the many Noodler's inks) is that this one is bulletproof. I learned that it is non-messy to use a syringe to refill the pen.
1,"Great Fountain Pen Ink!! This is very good ink for fountain pen, and it has 3 oz compare to parker bottled ink only 2 oz and for almost the same price, and best of all, it is made in U.S.A!!!"
1,"a most excellent ink. This a most excellent ink. If you don't believe it, write on a piece of paper then submerge it in water overnight. It will not run and it will not fade. It's the only Ink I buy now. Excellent range of colors and ink options, eel, baystate blue, etc."
1,"Excellent Value I bought this ink for use with a Cross fine nibbed fountain pen that I use on a daily basis in my work. This ink is excellent, it flows immediately and smoothly with no skipping. Its a very dark black that looks great on almost any grade of paper from the cheapest recycled copy paper to heavy cottons and linens. It also completely lives up to its bulletproof billing; for my own amusement I've tried everything from ammonia, bleach, carpet cleaner fluid, gasoline, kerosine, lighter fluid, etc and nothing I've tried will get this ink to budge from any paper I've used. Also, when they say 3 fluid ounces they mean it, the bottle is filled to the very brim so exercise caution or you'll spill some."
1,"Excellent product, will continue to use this brand. Ink is of excellent quality; does not run or easily smear. On most paper I do not require a blotter. Flows smoothly and consistently, and tint is very dark. Happy to find an inexpensive, high quality product made in USA."
1,"Great product Used to fill up a Waterman. A bit messy since I haven't manually filled a fountain pen for a while, but the bottle seems to last several dozen fills easily (unless the cap does not seal properly and the ink evaporates, which seems unlikely given the quality of the bottle / cap).Great color consistency and richness."
1,"Great Product As a college student I do a lot of writing in the form of notes and tests. I use my Lamy Safari pen with the converter and this ink. I love the deep color of it, its a nice dark ink. I don't have problems of bleeding through pages with regular store bought college ruled paper either so that means I can write on both side of a sheet and not worry about my notes turning in to a muddy mess. I will be buying this product in the future and I highly recommend it."
1,"A great, easy flowing, black ink I use this ink in a Pilot Plumix with a converter (not exactly the most high brow pen) and it flows like a dream. The is nice and dark with out spidering out, even on some pretty crappy paper I have used. It cleans up pretty easily with water if it is spilled on plastic or other similar surface, but is very durable on paper. I haven't had any problems with smearing even a few moments after writing something."
1,"We love cooperative games! Once you get over how cheap-looking the game is (so you may not want to buy it for a gift, if that would bother you), you'll realize how refreshing it is to play a cooperative game! My daughters loved working together to save the princess! Another friend likes playing it every time she comes over and has requested it for her birthday, so we're buying another.We also really like the ""Max"" game and ""The secret door"" from the same company. I think ""Max"" is the best game we've tried so far."
1,"Great It has so many parts. Colorful. Very nice for small and even older children. My grandchildren love the animals, also how they can set it up. Great for take along!"
1,A+ tribute to the Duke The CD has awesome jazz vocals from some the greatest. Is has quickly become of my favorites.
1,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS!!!!!! i adore this book and hope you will give it a chance. because out of the three hundred books i have read this is one of my very favorites.
1,"FIRST RATE THRILLER John Dahl should smash the box-office one of these days because he truely deserves it. Unforgettable is his best work effort, a gripping suspensefiul script supported by an excellent cast and a director who knows how to keep you on the edge of your sofa. The Dolby Digital track is very dynamic and does justice to Christopher Young's remarkable score. This widescreen edition is not anamorphic, as marked on the back cover, but the image is sharp."
1,"I love to watch Mr. Liotta act.... It is a pleasure to watch him act and how he responds to each scene, and how he responds to everthing around him and how he wants the scene to be understood and the emotions he wants the viewer to feel....this is a good movie if you know what you're looking at."
1,gret album from Mr.Excitement Jackie Wilson was one of the baddest Musical artists ever. the Man was smooth and could Sing/Sang with the best of them. he was in the same class as Sam Cooke and James Brown back in the day. He truly had a unique style about him. this album is smooth and on time. the Motown band is on here and Jackie is leding the way. the Man could sing anything and make it sound so smooth. a Must have. the Brother is so underrated.
1,"Solid I took this book from a neglected stack in an Acupuncturist's office, and was struck by the repugnant cover (imagine the worse possible detail job on a van from the 70s - it was an earlier edition than the one you see on Amazon). But the information is solid. Good understandings of time, healing, choice and destiny are woven throughout the material. Simple exercises are presented with direct and encouraging language that does a good job addressing the problem of doubt.Not at all pertinent to this book, yet Interesting to note: this Amy Wallace is the author of The Sorcerer's Apprentice, a memoir of her years as a follower of Carlos Casteneda."
1,"""Till all are One"" One of the best cartoon movies to be made in my time.Transfomers The Movie if you didn't see it as a kid you have a chance to make up for it and do yourself a favor and buy this movie the price is great."
1,Everything I expected This movie is everything I expected it to be. Certainly brought back memories from my childhood. The extra features are very nice. A must buy for any and all Transformers fans.
1,"it was the best cartoon movie ive ever seen i saw it a long time ago, and have been looking for it ever since. all i can say is that i loved it and i wish i owned it."
1,"Greatest Cartoon Ever Okay. I am 13yrs old..and I have watched this movie since I was 2 EVERY day. When this comes on DVD(IF, OF COURSE IT WILL!!)I am getting it and taking it everywhere..MAN OH MAN This is a great movie..Think of it as a real movie with robots only animated. Most of my favorite characters died..but of course this came last after the real series..then the cartoon show that took place right after the movie..think of Transformers as a never ending universe...5 stars. Great. BUY IT! Best movie ever!"
1,"Took me back to my childhood If you are a true Transformers fan, you will appreciate the movie, commentary and extras that were included in the DVD. This is truly a prize for Transformers fans of all ages!"
1,"excellent Every male from the age of 20 to 25 should love this movie. I remember watching this when I was in kindergarten, and have wanted it ever since. I am so excited that the DVD is finally coming out. I think this movie will make an excellent gift. It also sheads some light on the new transformers that is out now and provides background for that series."
1,"The best American animated movie, PERIOD. This has got to be the best animated movie of all time. You can't get better story, animation, soundtrack, voice acting... With numerous stars as the lead roles this movie delivers. If you are looking for fast paced action, lots of cool robots and great animation look no further."
1,"classic one of the best movies from my childhood. I remember going to the theater to see it when if came out!( the theater isnt there anymore, its a Layzboy store now.)"
1,"Transformers-The Movie is just AWESOME! This movie is the best cartoon ever. Autobots Vs. Decepticons in the war for Earth Megatron's plan after he already won Cybertron from the Autobots. And if you really want to see Optimus Prime and Megatron fight, this is your movie. And of course we can not forget about Orson Welles's voice as the evil monster planet Unicron. This is a must see movie for all ages. ( Including the uncut version too ). To find it you can search The Transfomers The Movie. ..."
1,"small correction as any knowledgable ""transformer kid"" will tell you, altough i am now no longer a kid... SoundWave is NOT an autobot he is a deceptacon. Just a fix for all you transformer guru's who were angry. 8-) there problem solved"
1,"Transformers the Movie If you were a kid during the 1980's and you loved Transformers like I did, this is a must own."
1,"The best version of this film on DVD yet! To drum up publicity for the live-action Transformers movie next year, Sony Pictures has given the 1986 animated movie the deluxe treatment. This two-disc version promises a remastered, anamorphic widescreen transfer with ""corrected colors"". No word yet on a remastered 5.1 audio track to go with that improved picture. Sony does include a fullscreen version of the film as well as a third version that borrows from VH1's ""Pop-Up Video"", adding interesting facts about the movie and other Transformer-related information while the movie plays. Other special features include toy commercials from back in the day and a commentary track with producer Nelson Shin and voice actress Susan Blu, who was the voice of ""Arcee"". If you're a fan, this is a no-brainer. Pre-order today!"
1,"Amazing! Quality is amazing, looks brand new even though it was listed as Very Good. Shipped same day as order, and came earlier than expected. Extremely satisfied with my purchase and glad I chose Knick Knacks!"
1,"Just a tiny point Yeah I'm sad for pointing this out, but maybe there's loads of others have too,I just haven't been botherd to check. Soundwave wasn't an Autobot as the editorial comment states, he was a Decepticon as far as I can remember."
1,"Without the shadow of a doubt, the greatest animated film ev First of all, in response to anyone who dismisses the graphics as mediocre,.. this film was made in the mid-eighties...I believe that when you look at it in a more relevant eye, it more than holds it's own. It's a great period piece. The visual esthetics are nothing short of artistry. Imagine someone seeing Orsen Welle's visual masterpiece 'Citizen Kane', and putting it down for not having any color... Also, whether you prefered if Optimus Prime didn't die or not has no bearing on judging the quality of the film. It's unbelievable to me how ignorant some people are..."
1,"Brings Evolutionism to it Knees! Straight to the Jugular! Dr. Sarfati, clearly demonstrates to his readers that evolutionism is nothing more than a belief system, and therefore inaccessible to empirical science. A must read for anyone who is truly a ""freethinker"" or someone, who just wants to know what vital information has been censored in ordered to keep evolutionary interpretations and beliefs alive. After reading this book, you will understand evolution so well you will know why it is an absurd interpretation for the origin of the world and the life on it."
1,"Scientific Foundation for Faith If you want data and science to help enlighten technical-minded friends and family about the Truth, this book will help. It still takes Faith though, but no more Faith than arguing that evolution has occurred, as humanists proclaim. There is no absolute physical Proof either way: either you have Faith that Creationism is the answer, or that Evolution is the answer..."
1,"Life sprang from nothing- right genius! One strand of DNA holds as much info a set of 26 book encyclopedias. And not random info either. Change one sentence and the whole thing falls apart. Yet idiotic evolutionists believe DNA magically came into existance by random chance and then went through billions of positive mutations to advance to all the different stages and types of life today.One genetetist said that's about as likely as a tornado going through a junk yard and producing a fully assembled and functioning 747 aircraft.Sorry, I don't have enough faith to believe in evolution; I'm only a Christian."
1,I love it! My wife bought me this drill in 2002 for Christmas and I don't think I will ever need another one. It's the perfect size and weight for almost any job and has more than enough power to keep up with tough repetitive tasks without overheating.
1,"Great Voice - Great Pop Song This is simple a beautiful popsong sung by one of the most beautiful voices in modern pop-rock. Nash, best known as the singer of Sixpence None the Richer, is here into a more mainstream pop-style than she's usually known for. But as long as the material is as great as in this case, it doesn't really matter."
1,Great Merchant I purchased this as a gift and my wife loves the fragrance. Dealing with this seller is a pleasure and I will most certainly do so again.
1,lovely I only wear Annick Goutal and this is one of my favorites. Citrusy and not over-powering it is a lovely clean summer scent.
1,"Fantabulous! Super duper! Oh the JOY of reading Doctor Dolittle books! This is a great one. How can it be no publisher(s) have reprinted all the books including the zoo, the moon, the garden, the post office, puddleby adventures etc.?? Are they mad? These books are timeless stories that appeal to animal lovers everywhere!"
1,"SEXTETTE: Don't Let This Happen To You! That Greta Garbo retired from films in her mid thirties did more to keep her memory and ""the mystique"" alive than anything else she could have done. That Mae West decided to film ""Sextette"" in the late Seventies, when she was in her mid eighties, is the flip side of Garbo: the Baby-Jane-Norma-Desmond syndrome descended upon a new world with new values. And to pair West with the young Timothy Dalton and expect the audience to take the romance seriously further complicates this already messy film. Part musical, part comedy, part Grand Guignol, this film should be seen for the five-star lesson it presents: know when to gracefully retire, leaving only the fondest of memories, Garbo-like, captured on film forever."
1,"Petzold as always Whenever you hear the name Petzold, the only thing to examine is if the subject is for you. This is for beginner programmers who want to start in C# and not ONLY for beginners in C# but otherwise experienced in other environments. All negative reviwers here state that simple fact!So if you are a beginner in programming who wants to start in C# this is the absolutely FIRST book you must own. PERIOD.Also, dont think that the material is outdated, since it covers the basics."
1,"The Writer of Writers Wilbur Smith is the kind of writer that makes every other writer want to break their own fingers and take up goat herding. He's that good and Men of Men clearly demonstrates that talent with its unique storyline, remarkable history, and great adventure.Does he measure up to every reader? Probably not because he tells epic adventures with hardships, battles, love, sex and violence that's not for everyone's palate. But with millions of books sold and a fan base that spans the world a few times around, he apparently reaches a lot of readers who keep coming back for yet one more adventure...readers like me."
1,Awesome from begining to end Caviezel and Quaid are simply awesome. The movie keeps you in suspense and the end is the best. This movie is a must see for anyone and everyone. (Especially if Caviezel is your favorite actor...sigh*) But seriously no Bias. If you dont see it youre missing out.
1,"A great movie, kind of unexpected Frequency is a very good movie. It's entertaining and suspenseful the entire way through. The actings great and the story's even better.I'll admit that the beginning of the film starts off kind of slow. They really try to develope the characters in a great way. There are a few moments were I wonder why it wasn't edited better. After the first 40 minutes the movie really picks up and it doesn't stop until the end.Quaid gives the performance of his career. Caviezel puts on an excellent show in his role. Andre Braugher gives an outstanding performance also. There were a few weak performances, but not many.It's a great story. One that really draws you in each second you watch. Definitely worth a rent or buy."
1,"Brilliant thriller - one of Quaid's best I've been a fan of Dennis Quaid through some good movies and some not-so-good movies, but here is a role just perfect for him, as a 1969 NY fire fighter. Jim Caviezel is great as his cynical, 36-year old son in the parallel 1999 storyline. The time bridge is well done [willing suspension of disbelief required, but easy here] and the palpable link between father and son -- the son's loss at his father's early death -- is heartbreaking but ultimately life-affirming. Buy it, rent it, borrow it -- but see it. You'll be on the edge of your seat, but the payoff at the end is worth it."
1,"Kept me at the edge of my seat! I have to say that the plot to this movie is original. It makes you realize that one decision you make can change your life completely. I really liked the pace of it, and I felt involved watching it. Because of the nature of the plot, you cannot really predict what will happen next. Five stars!"
1,Very Intense! WoW! Great movie! Ok... its a tad hooky and it moves a little slow... (Just a little) but there are parts that keep you watching the whole way through that are just intense!!! Of course when the plot begins to unfold you are on the edge of your seat the rest of the way and the ending is unbelievable! I was just amazed at how wonderfully entertaining and clever the entire movie was. If you watch this movie STAY FOR THE END because this movie makes you feel great!
1,"Frequency Frequency is a totally different story-line than the usual fair anda much overlooked fantastic movie. It certainly never received theattention it should have. It is a movie you'll never forget anddefinately want to own. If it seems slow at the beginning, staywith it -- it gets really dramatic and when you figure out what isgoing on, you'll be intriqued. Great Movie!"
1,"The reason I read Scifi When sorting my search results for science fiction books with telepathy as a subject, I was not a bit surprised to see Catspaw come up as readers' number 1 selection. I have a bookself with my all-time favorite scifi books, the ones I would lend to someone who hadn't read much scifi, and this book is the first I would pull out. It has a sympathetic character, great world-building, and a fabulous premis that starts you wondering about the future and possibilities beyond the everyday experience."
1,"One of my favorite books, ever I have been trying to figure out why I love this book so much. It obviously has to do with the main character, Cat, who is at times the quintessential underdog, then the hero of the universe (for at least fifteen minutes). Ms. Vinge creates characters (major and minor) that you not only want to know, but you want to become in some higher sense. The action, intrigue and adventure in Catspaw are also incomparible.I also highly recommend the prequel and sequel to Catspaw - Psion and Dreamfall, respectively. They are both wonderful books, but Catspaw remains my favorite."
1,"Coal Miner's Daughter - Great Reading For All Ages The movie is good but the book is excellent. Perhaps the best autobiography ever written. The chapters flow with stories of sadness and humor expressed in Loretta's one phasing. For someone without much of an education, the wisdom and values Loretta shares within the book is inspiring. You will be left wanting to read more about this wonderful lady. This book does not disappoint."
1,Great condition This book was in excellent condition when received. Some of the poems are interesting. Many provoke thought - leaving you wondering what mind set was the writer in when they wrote the poems.
1,"Yeah Silver! Now We're Talkin' Hello everyone,If any of you ever want a great book (no matter of length) on Wicca this is the one for you. Yes its lengthy but you can do it. The best book for everything Wicca, it has eveything (short of wands, athames, etc). Even a section on herbs. Lots of Mythology too! Can't stress how great of a book this is enough. Love you Silver. Blessed Be"
1,Great Book I highly recamend this to anyone interested in the field of wicca or witchcraft! Excellent book. Very good condition.
1,Excellent book If you are into Wiccan rituals or want to learn more on spells to help with health ailments or protection it is worth buying. I found a lot of useful information in it. I initally found this book at a national book retailer and decided to look on amazon.com just to see if amazon would have a lower price on it and my hunch was correct. I received it sooner than expected.
1,"Great Book Great book, received in great time. I haven't finished but I know that I will truely enjoy it."
1,"An Encylopedia of Knowledge They aren't kidding; it really is the ultimate book of shadows. It covers just about ever topic in magic/Wicca imaginable. It's rather hefty, and it takes a while to read if you read it cover to cover. But, it's well worth it. I refer back to this book all the time. It was one of the best buys on the topic I've ever made. I highly recommend it!"
1,"Pro Silver! I was going to buy this book long, long ago but fell victim to the opinions of others before finally deciding to give it a go myself. Silver Ravenwolf's 'Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows For The New Generation' is everything a Witchcraft 101 book should be; an absolute must have for the aspiring Witch. Ravenwolf writes with the perfect combination of joy, humor, wisdom and fact, and this book is no exception. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this book and already refer to it on a daily basis. Don't be put off by negative reviews. Silver's books are FUN (I can't stand a typically boring book) and hugely resourceful!"
1,"Silver's Best Efforts Yet! I am always amazed with Silver's work, but this book absolutely blew me away. Silver has a rare talent of taking some extremely tough subjects and putting them in a way that anyone can understand. Although this particular book has a leaning toward teaching the teen witch, it is also an indepth study for us crones :-) After all of her books over the past 12 years or so, I can't imagine what she could possibly write next - but believe me, I'll be first in line for her next book!"
1,Wonderful book! I was so surprised with this purchase. Raven Wolf is an exceptional author and teacher. I was also thrilled with how quickly this book arrived and the condition it was in. Fully happy with this purchase!!
1,My go to book When I need help for guidance this is one of my first go to books. I love the information that is in here and have been able to use some of the referances as a guide to start my spells. Also use the blessing water a lot with my spells. I love Silver as a writer and recomend her.
1,"perfect This book was listed in good condition but not 1 single flaw on or in it. Amazing book in amazing shape. Thank you. Oh, and it arrived ahead of schedule."
1,"A great game for families with young kids This game basically combines the games Memory (where you turn over tiles to make matches) with Clue. The production value is low, but the game play is good and the artwork and theme are fun. Makes me want to try other games by Family Pastimes."
1,"Fun for everyone My 10 year old son and I have played this game and found it alot of fun. Not only the game is fun, but it is fun to play a game where you work things out together. You either win together or lose together. It is a great game for anyone who has a problem playing games against another person or anyone who is a bad loser or a bad winner. It comes in a heavy duty box which is great for those of us who have spent half our lives taping game boxes back together."
1,"If you're into this sort of thing... Then you'll love it. If not, then rent Bambi. For those idiots that STILL believe all those lame rumors (removing ribs to perfom felatio on himself) well then you shouldn't be watching this sort of video and should probably stick to wrestlin' anyway. It's a show...it's for shock value....GET IT?!?! Why do you think he does all the ""bad"" stuff (ripping bibles, giving oral sex to Twiggy on stage, self mutilating, etc ) he does? TO GET PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION! Wake up America....this isn't the wonderful place many of you seem to think it is....he's trying to point that out...trying to wake people up. Do some history on the guy before you rip him, he actually went to a CHRISTIAN school...yeah that's right......and there he learned how cruel this world can be. It's a great video depicting an over the top performer.....but as I said...if you're into this sort of thing then you'll love it!"
1,this video shows marily manson at their best. This video shows Marilyn Manson at their best. The sound quality and video quality are excellent. Pick it up if you like Marilyn and after you have watched it...You'll like them even more. END
1,it rocked harder than manson himself i liked this video because it showed his better songs.it rocks and if you don't believe me watch it for yourself.
1,"SHOCK ROCK AT ITS BEST This film is a night on the barricade taken a step further. A bit short, but a must-see for all Manson fans."
1,"How did I not discover Lee Smith a long time ago? Deft storytelling, timeless truths about women's lives, and an authentic voice that I can vouch for, having spent time with family in that part of the world. Ivy's story helps me to finally understand a lot about my own late mother, who grew up there and would have been only a few years younger than her. Like Smith, when I went to college and read Faulkner, I wondered what South he was talking about, since what I knew was Appalachian Virginia. Finally, this wonderful writer has captured the essence of that other, fascinating ""secret"" South, which has little to do with the Civil War and is more than just Hatfields and McCoys. I cannot heap enough praise on this book."
1,Highly recommended Demo releases are often for fans only and reveal blemishes that are later fixed by clever producers. I find the opposite here. The slick production on the studio releases removed a lot of the personality of this band. This CD includes what I consider to be the best versions of many Records songs and makes me wish I had seen them live early in their career.
1,"I agree - Amazing DVD - Amazing animation I agree with the other reviews that this is an amazing DVD, and want to mention that it has incredible animations of the Qi energy in the body, as well as easy to understand diagrams of the the brain, glands, and internal organs while the instructor explains how these internal exercises work.Also, many of the exercises are taught in three stages, beginner, intermediate, and advanced, and each stretch is held for three minutes, so I doubt many of us will work our way up to the advanced version of the three minute exercise very quickly.Its a DVD that you can really grow with!"
1,"great story I usually don't like heroes to be princes and royalties from some unknown kingdoms but Rolfe was a great one. I liked his story and his behaviour (or at least I could understand why he behaved the way he did). The same goes for Angeline - she was a strong woman who was able to stand for herself and still stay gentle and caring. The story was full of action and though Jennifer Blake used quite flowery language, I really enjoyed reading it. Very well-written and believable with a lot of interesting side characters (the royal guard). I definitely recommend this book, and also Surrender in Moonlight from Jennifer Blake. (but beware, the love scenes are pretty steamy :-)"
1,"Great Romance This was the first romance novel I read, it got me interested in the genre. I loved the characters, they were more developed than other characters in subsequent books I read."
1,"Great intro to the genre. I bought this book way back in 1986. I was 18 yrs. old and had just gotten over a case of the flu that was so bad I thought I was literally going to die. When I was finally well enough to leave the house, I bought this book at the supermarket to celebrate my coming back to life, so to speak. It was my very first hardcore (read: steamy and sexy) romance. Unlike so many others, it had an interesting plot and characters. RS was the perfect blend of good storytelling and steamy love scenes; it's an excellent introduction to the word of romance novels."
1,"Why is he always so right? As always, Lewis Black never fails to deliver, and this album is no exception. I learn more about politics from him, than from any other source! (kidding.....but you have to admit, he gets to the core of the issues) This album was much better than his performance on Last Laugh 2007. Now....if only he was not such a hot head, he'd make a good president!! Enjoy!!"
1,"Plain out great X-Files book! What else can I say, Ground Zero is an oustanding book. Great literature, etc."
1,"Loved this Harlem Globetrotter story when I was in 8th grade Been 30 some-odd years, but this book inspired me to play basketball when I was in school. Definitely had an impact, and I remebered the book but not the title, till yesterday I found my 8th grade journal and I had written excitedly that my book had arrived (shcolastic books) ""Go, Man, Go!""It Chronicles the story of the Harlem Globetrotters, how they got their start, how they improved, and how they forever changed the game. Now I am ordering a copy for my kids. I cannot say if this is a book adults would enjoy, but I loved it as a kid."
1,"Refreshing and reality based It's not very often that you are able to come across a writer who is so charming and, at the same time, pretty far out there. I absolutely loved the book and, will truthfuly say that it has significantly changed my life for the better. It is a quick read. You will however, be tempted to read it over and over again. I won't go into what it's about. Just read it! I consider myself to have moderate to conservative taste in my reading but, this one really blew my boat totally out of the water. One warning, if you are one who is not even the slightest bit spiritual, you might not like it. Ya now, meat and potatoes only types of folk."
1,"The greatest book I have ever read!!! The greatest book I have ever read! Without a doubt Carlos Castaneda's best. This book made me SO sad it is unbelievable. Once you understand everything that is involved in becoming a man of knowledge you have to ask yourself 'am I willing to give up EVERYTHING?' After reading this book I have made loads of progress in my own spiritual quest, no, I haven't stopped the world, yet. But at least I know now which way I am heading. If your leaning is towards sorcery and the revelation of it's secrets, you simply MUST read this. I have read everything on the occult (I kid you not) and I have to say that this was the one book that 'did it for me.' God (or nagual ) bless C.C."
1,"Best movie we've seen this year I love Danny Kaye! This movie has everything - witty music, great dancing, funny repartee, and Danny Kaye at his best. Lyrics by Sylvia Fine kept us in stitches. A great family movie, although kids might not understand some of the lyrics."
1,"Life Could Not Better Be I have to say that the Court Jester is my favorite movie. It will keep you entertained, and it is full of laughs. I don't need to say anymore, except that you will love it, and cherish it."
1,"Magnificent Comedy A pleasant mix of slapstick and word play, this movie ranks up there with iconic films like the Princess Bride and Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail. Danny Kay and Angela Lansbury are brilliant."
1,"Perfect This movie is a gem. Danny Kaye plays Hubert Hawkins, Who joins up with a band of Robin Hood Clones in order to place the Real king (The baby with the Birthmark on his bottom) on the throne. He ends up getting into the palace, where he meets Sir Ravenhurst (Basil Rathbone), the Evil Bad guy. The Whole movie is a jumble of hilarious medeival misunderstandings The songs are awesome. The best part in the whole movie is the fencing scene at the end. I laughed SO hard!I highly reccommend it."
1,Fun for the whole family! This was a family favorite for me growing up and we still quote several lines from this movie. I recently introduced this movie to my young children and they liked it as well. Danny Kaye is amazing!
1,"One of a kind by a one of a kind star My first taste of the comedic genius of Danny Kaye was when I saw this movie late one night when I was about 13. I waited anxiously for the movie to be on again and thus began my life long addiction to the sweetness of Danny Kaye. This movie is an absolute must for anyone who loves to laugh. This is one of the best musical comedies I have ever seen. The songs always manage to tug at my heart especially the lullabye. Danny was truly a one of a kind, I have yet to see an actor reach his level."
1,"Great! I've grown up on this movie. I've loved it ever since my dad sat me down to watch it at age 10. It's got everything you would want. And my favorite line: ""I found a bow and arow and learnd to shoot. I found a horn and I learned to toot. Now I can shoot and toot; ain't I cute?"""
1,"Funniest film ever??? If this film is not the funniest film ever made, then it certainly has the funniest scene ever filmed. The ""pellet with the poison"" scene is truly hilarious, and it goes on for about 10 minutes. I can't think of another picture with a scene that will make you laugh that long. Also, the image of the baby pig coming through the gate instead of the wild boar in the nighthood test makes me laugh each time I think of it. The old adage ""They don't make 'emlike this anymore"" is certainly true here and applies to the cast as well as the script."
1,"Comedy Could Not Better Be! Danny Kaye stars in this uproarious, hilarious, witty, timeless comedy about a Jester embroiled in affairs of state, romance, and laughter in a medieval kingdom.This is a film to watch over and over again!""Life could not better be, better be, better be..."""
1,"Classic comedy One of the best films Danny Kaye appeared in, and backed by an equally fantastic cast in top form: basil rathbone, angela lansbury, etc. Great comedy, great musical numbers, and a healthy dose of action. This movie is seriously funny."
1,"The BEST prog with a pop edge! The Morse bros. and company continue to grow and grow musically, with this easily the strongest material to date. Their last effort ""Kindness Of Strangers"" (still an unbelievable disc) was strong but seemed to lack the direction that ""Day For Night"" displays. Awesome vocals, awesome musicianship, awesome arrangements,......AWESOME! If you consider yourself in the least to be a fan of the modern prog movement DON'T let this one pass you by. PROG RULES!!!!!"
1,"The best prog band in the world outdoes itself Spock's Beard is the best progressive rock band to burst onto the schene since the music's heyday in the 70s. With Day For Night, the band has made its most fully realized album yet. Incredible musicianship and songwriting meld seamlessly into a listening experience unlike any other in contemporary rock. If you enjoy beautiful melody, virtuoso technical mastery of instruments, amazing vocal harmonies, thought-provoking lyrics, and great pop mixed in with the intricate musical passages characteristic of prog, Spock's Beard is a must-have, and so is DFN, their best album to date."
1,"This movie is real life... First of all, i like to state that Larry clark's ""kids"" is more like vision of how real kids act who barely enter 10th grade act nowdays and when i seen it? I was suprised that it was made few years ago because it seems like it was made just today because thats how kids realy act...Specialy the white boys who act black its so true and so real i relay ddi like it for that part.. Watch it! It's f*cking sick..."
1,"If you don' see the brilliance in this film, you're crazy As I said above, if you don't see the brilliance of this film, you're crazy. This film is NOT at all influencing teens to act the way the teens in the movie did. This movie is a wake up call to parents. The last line in the movie is a teen saying ""What the hell happened?"" Think about that as you watch this movie, I guarantee that you'll love it."
1,"KIDS I first heard about the movie ""KIDS"" from the Logo Channel in kck and wanted to see it so i could see just how others viewed teens and the ever so frightening subject of teen sexuality and the scare of contracting some sexually transmitted diseases. It was very interesting to see how they actually picked up on how the young kids of today really act in big cities, and most likely in small towns also. Makes one want to be able to keep a watchful eye on their children alot more. I thought it was a good movie and very informative to parents."
1,"Life in the big city? This would have to be Larry Clark's best movie. His other movies are very good too (Bully, Gummo), but this one stands out a little bit more. In most movies, the characters are people you can either (a.) relate to in some way, (b.) sympathize with, (c.) feel absolute pity for, or (d.) absolutly loathe. I think in this movie, you can sometimes feel all those emotions at different parts of the movie. But in the final analysis, you tend to think that these ""kids"" are just super predators headed to a life of crime.... But the beauty of this movie are the small scenes of urban decay and deliberate dialogue. Observing them interact is very watchable, and you can also pick out scenes where they behave in a very normal fashion. Their brutal, conniving, sexual way of living life in NYC may or may not be typical for kids their age, but in this story, at least some of them will pay for their ignorance and apathy with the ultimate price: their life."
1,"excelent movie I believe that this movie portrays real life adolescence, and they're views on life. Many people believe that the video is a fallacy, however from the perspective of a teen growing up on the streets, the movie couldn't have hit the nail any closer to the head. Unfortunately teens believe they're invincible and will go throughout life bouncing from wall to wall until they crash. I believe that this may as well be a documentary on the street punk/skater teenage subculture."
1,"A Real eye opener and truth to the consequences of ""kids""! When i first sat down and watched this movie i was utterly indistgust and suprised, it really opened my eyes, im 18 male and improud to say that im a virgin and other teens should know that this is a bad road to go on if you are doing this behind the backs of your parents, To the parents, you should get your kids and sit down together and watch this movie, It's a real eye opener and see that this a wrong path to go on having unprotected sex, drugs alchol. all teens should look at this movie. Unproteceted sex can get you killed it's a death warrant and suicide."
1,"everyone needs to listen up! the first time i saw this movie, it really gave me a reality check as to who i was as a person. it appears as though the people who are always putting this movie down are people who either grew up in a very secluded neighborhood, or people who think that their kids could never get involved in an atmosphere such as the one seen in ""KIDS"". What people do behind their parents backs, is most of the time expected to be undiscovered and Mr. Clark has given today's society a very long-overdue wake up call to the parents out there, so that they are more involved."
1,"I think it is a wakeup call for every teen, and parent. This is a movie that i will keep, and watch with my children in their teen years, or maby preteen years.This is a movie that every parent, and teenager must see."
1,"It May Not Be Your Reality But It Is Mine It kills me when people say that Kids is an unrealistic discription of teen life. For one thing, the people who say that are 40+ and are hoping this is not what their kids are doing. Second, these kids were not living in the cornfields of Ohio, they were in the ghetto. They were not acting psycho, they were just being kids, reckless, searching kids. Just like me. I never once doubted the reality of this movie. I was just wondering why someone took so long to bust the Breakfast Club bubble of the 80s and tell the truth about the 90s teen. We do stupid things and think we have every right to do it. Why should anyone have control of our lives, it not rebellion, its God given freedom. This is how the teenage mind works. Those miniture ""psychos"" are going to grow up and inherit the world. BE PREPARED!!!! If your kid doesn't know people who act like the characters in Kids, they ARE the person who acts like that."
1,"Realistic niew of adolescence Ever wonder what your kids are doing when they say they're staying at a friend's place over the weekend? Ever think to yourself ""Im sure i had another $10 in there""....This movie is not only entertaining, but educational to both parents and adolescents. My only quam is that in some cases it glorifies the life these kids are living. No doubt in their own mind they are living in glory, however, the stark reality is quite the opposite, and i think this message gets blurred at times."
1,"It is an excellent book. This book is a well-written critique on character education. It realistically categorizes the popular sects of moral philosophy and gives each one a fair yet tough analysis of it's strengths and weaknesses. The writing itself is very good, and makes a relatively dry topic entertaining. If you are interested in understanding the trends of contemporary moral education, I would suggest buying this."
1,"AMAZING! When i found this Cd i was so excited because i fell in love with the song, ""Thunder"" for it's romanticness and the rest of the CD IS INCREDIBLE> Upbeat, fun and very very catchy! I have it all memorized!!! It's easy to relate to and to sing along to!!I love Be my escape, Hero/heroine and Thunder~~ The whole cd is wonderful.Keep Rocking guys!"

1,The Semite people are our friends This book finally reveals and understands the in-depth relationship of Christianity and its roots. There are millions of people that have lived before Christ was on Earth but they believed in the same God. You will see them in heaven although they have never met Jesus personally while on Earth since Jesus was born after they died.Other recommended titles by Christian authors:Apocalyptic Secrets of the Hebrew Sanctuary
1,"Excellent insight into Jewish lifestyle for any Christian I have purchased 20 of these books and given them to friends. The search for Christians to reach out and understand their Jewish roots is vital for the correction or misapplication of some of our beliefs. This book points toward a more powerful and insightful lifestyle, and brings understanding to a much needed area."
1,"Well read and enjoyable. This is a lovely version of, ""Emma"", by Jane Austen. However, I discovered it was one of my least favorites by her, so I now have ""read"" it via audio book and can now say I don't need to buy the hard back version. Thank you for your great service."
1,how chick flicks should be! Jane Austen gets it right again with the heroine being worthy of the great guy. Fun story with good characters.
1,"Great regency novel Emma is a favorite in our house, and it's great to have the text in a free Kindle edition. Thanks."
1,"Please...it is Jane Austen, what isn't to love? Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors and I'm tickled my oldest daughter also loves her novels. I prefer paper books, but nothing beats a Kindle loaded with amazing books when you are traveling and don't want to carry the bulky dead tree editions."
1,Great Service I was very impressed by the response time and professionalism of the seller. I would definitely buy again from this seller and appreciate someone that takes online purchases seriously.
1,"This was a wonderful book, no matter what others say! This book was wonderfully uplifting and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely, and I believe you will as well, if you like amusing stories dealing with romance, confusion, friendship, matchmaking, and true love. Do not listen to some of the other reviews that say this book is a rip-off of Clueless. Obviously the people who posted those are incredibly ignorant, especially since Emma came out a very long time before Clueless, and if anyone was eligible to sue, it would be Jane Austen (if she was still alive) suing the makers of Clueless. Again, this was a very enjoyable book, and I would definately recommend it to anybody!"
1,"Austen Lover ""EMMA"" may very well be my favorite Austen novel :) ""PERSUASION"" may be a close second, or possibly a tie for first!Jane Austen was so witty and engaging. I really come to care about her characters. It may be harder to read for someone who doesn't enjoy the language of period pieces.The social structure is also sometimes hard to stomach!AND, I might add, that anytime a classic is ""free"" for kindle, you should at least give it a try! How easy it has become to be ""well read""!!"
1,"Excellent and arrived earlier than stated My son and I just received the bokken set and are quite pleased with them. They are well made and very well balanced. Better then most that I have had over the years. So far they are holding up nicely to impacts, though we really aren't trying to hit them very hard as we purchased them for Kata practice. The black finish is excellent which does make it heavier than the natural one. The guard fits tightly on both and needed no glue to hold it in place. Our order was shipped the day after we ordered it and it arrived a day earlier than stated. They were well wrapped to protect them and the box arrived with no damage. I will be purchasing more from them in the future as long as their quality maintains at this level."
1,"A REAL love story What is *real* love? In this film, it means: 1. the willingness to let yourself be killed by and for the person you love, and 2. the willingness to kill a person (that you once loved) for the person that you now love. Altogether a brilliant and arresting concept of love...utterly at odds with the usual kitschy notions of love.Why oh why, can't Hollywood make such startlingly original, beautiful and haunting love-stories like this, instead of ""Pretty Woman"" and its ilk?"
1,Obsession or Love? This is an unusual film about a man who gets out of the service and begins to look for a job. His girlfriend Trini recommends a landlady Luisa to him. He rents her room and trouble begins. He has difficulty making up his mind what and who he wants. Same goes for both Luisa and Trini. See this film!
1,"The Rescurers Down Under My five year old grandaughter really got into this book. I think this was much better than the original""The Rescurers"". It teaches children to respect animals."
1,"DVD movie This was a gift for my granddaughter. The movie arrived inpristine shape and very quickly. She loved the movie. Funny,her daddy did too at the same age. Some movies are ""timeless.""This is one of them.Would recommend the seller."
1,"cave twins review from grandkids. Or rather my Granddaughters love it. Recommended to them by Grandma who has fond memories of reading it when she was their age. The feedback from Heidi ( to whom it was sent ) was "" Wow Wicked Brilliant !"""
1,"A ""MUST READ"" for all Home Inspectors! This book is the premiere reference book for new Home Inspectors. The authors' knowledge is based on thousands of inspections. The layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference. There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ"
1,"Awesome Game of strategy My 5 year old grandson absolutely loved this game and didn't want to stop playing. I thought it was great because we worked as a team to beat the cat. It wasn't about winning as an individual, but winning for the critters so the cat wouldn't catch and eat them. It was great fun to watch my grandson think through what he should do next in order for the critters to get home safely. I would highly recommend it for children ages 4 to 10."
1,Great game!!!! Our kids grew up with this game and always loved it. We plan on keeping it for our next generation. Now I am getting it for another family to be able to enjoy in the same way.
1,"A great series for early language acquisition I have been using this entire series with my son since he was born, and he is now 14 months. He loves the pictures and turning the pages. The books use the format of one word per page and it gives both the English and Spanish form of the word. This is a great series for early language acquisition."
1,"A Prophetic Film -- 35 Years Ahead Of It's Time This film should be required viewing in every high school or college in America. Aside from being one of the first animated British feature films, as a poignant parable, it so perfectly explains how the Russian Revolution turned a bad situation into one of the three worst of the 20th century (the others being Nazi Germany and Communist China). Reviewers harping on the film's ""upbeat"" ending sound unaware of just how prophetic that ending turned out to be (remember what happened to Soviet Communism in 1989). This is a great film which -- incredibly -- may have now slipped into the public domain. (...)"
1,"Then and Now I have never seen the movie before (the review is more for the book since I didn't see the movie), but I read the book. Before you can read the reviews, you must remember that this book was written during the Age of Communism, and the movie also set during the Age of Communism. So, before reading or watching Animal Farm, just remember.....the book and movie take place in the past, and that is how they should be watched/read."
1,Abundant living A quintessential E. Stanley Jones daily/weekly devotional suitable for all believers wishing to strengthen their walk. Mr. Jones has an excellent way with words that causes the reader to yearn for more.
1,"Awsome learning aid, great format, clearly spoken. This CD travels with me from car to home to work. I enjoy the format and timing. I hope they followup with a quiz CD that says the word in spanish and allows you responce time, then immediately says the same spanish word and the english word and it is catagorized like this CD is."
1,"Egermeier's Bible Story Book When I was little, my dad used to read this book to me every night before I went to sleep...I enjoyed it very much! I wanted the same for my grandson, so I bought this for him...It is wonderful! Just the same as I remember! I'm happy that I bought it for him."
1,"Classic Bible Story Book Excellent Bible Story book for cildren over 8. Our church gives a copy to each family with children. Only negative, a few extra textual comments that fill in the story line nicely but are not in Scripture."
1,One of my favorites from childhood. This book is fine for any age that would like to learn Bible history. The stories go from creation to the early church. Children like the stories that follow the Bible very closely and adults get a great over view of Bible History...now it is easy to know when the divided kingdom started and who were the kings of Judah and the North and when the different prophets had their time of ministry.
1,Excellent The stories are well written covering the major points and simplifying the story to captivate and hold the young reader.
1,my son's favorite and MORE This was my son's favorite book for many years. He now reads it to our grandchildren - his neices! We run a full-blown preschool with an average of 110 children each year and I read it to each class every year and they all LOVE it. I lost our copy at the preschool and NEED another one so I'm buying a second one. WE LOVE THIS BOOK!
1,"One amazing book! I love this book. I could not stop reading! At one point I read 80 some odd pages. Man if it was my choice make more books especailly about RIVERCLAN! Please,I beg of it! I mean Thunderclan's cool but seriously. The book get's scary. JUST AMAZING!"
1,"Great Book!!! I think that this is a very good, thought out book. When I first saw it in the book store I was sort of interested in it but I didn't get it. I thought about it for awhile and the next time I came back I decided to just buy it and give it a try. I am glad that I did because it is turning out to be better than I thought and I can't for the next book!!!"
1,Best book ever! I read this book in 1st grade and I still like it now! As soon as I read this book my favorite animal became a cat. I liked how Erin Hunter told the story from Rusty\Firepaw`s view.
1,love it!!!!! could not stop reading until i had read them all i loved this book because it gave me a resonable idea of what my catcould be thinking my cat is dead now but i have 2 newborn kittens who love the out doors i just hope they do not go join a clan!!!!!
1,"For Readers of all Ages. I started reading the Warriors series when I was about 11, and I was immediatly captivated. First off, I was searching desperatly for an animal-fantasy book, so this series was like a miracle. I started to read the book, and I couldn't stop. Each character is so interesting, and the chemistry between each was wonderful. I read the whole series as fast as I could. It's been two years, and I am still a faithful Warriors fan. The stories themselves have interesting plots that twist and turn in every direction. These are still some of my favorite books, even though I'm 13. These stories are a good pleaser for all ages."
1,"A great book!!! This incredible journey will take you and Firepaw on an amazing adventure. This book is fun to read because Firepaw goes on so many different adventures. He starts out as a normal house pet and gets invited to a clan. This clan is called the Thunderclan. At first he is teased and insulted, but ends up as a great warrior. You will never ever want to stop reading this incredible journey!!"
1,Amazing! A adventurous and heart warming book that will keep you glued! If you love cats and clan loyalty you'll love this book
1,I love cats This book is amazing I can't wait to get the 2nd book I love firepaws New name fireheart is the perfect name for him I give this book......................5 stars hands down I love your work Erin Hunter
