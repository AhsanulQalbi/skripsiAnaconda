0,"Buyer beware This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!"
0,"The Worst! A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book."
0,"Oh please I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all."
0,"Awful beyond belief! I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"
0,"Another Abysmal Digital Copy Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon."
0,"Batteries died within a year ... I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power."
0,"should be titled ""Hollywood Debacle"" The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid."
0,"Nothing you don't already know If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!"
0,"Doesn't work on a Mac It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!"
0,"TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk."
0,"Not! If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated."
0,"Very poor quality. The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid."
0,"Bad Deal!! I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future."
0,It Drew Air This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book.
0,"Buyer Beware!! I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!"
0,"ADDONICS PORTABLE CD DRIVE - I am disappointed in its performance I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon."
0,"I got fooled... I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!"

0,you will not be able to buils a timber frame house This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder.
0,Dont like it This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
0,"Not professional quality I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others."
0,"New Wave 80s I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the ""Starlite Singers"". The description of the record says that it is by ""various artists"" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it."
0,"Buyers Beware!!!!!!!!! This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!"
0,BEWARE!! Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ....
0,"Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for."
0,"""Uh oh he's been using Brand X"" An embarassment. Steer clear of this one folks. Just when you thought these guys were the last real ""fusion"" types about...Since when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions? Where the hell is Phil when you need him, oh yes, Tarzan. The star is for the Bruford and Wilding/Bonus tracks, and well does one really want those?"
0,"Molly Myers Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme."
0,"Just a few. These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!"
0,Stiff and Smells like drying paint You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.
0,"False Advertisement The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied."
0,The product I received this time is like fake one I have been used this product for many years. But somehow the product I received this time is like fake one. It's very thin. I have to used double amount.
0,"Has No Range I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product."
0,"Don't buy from Eforcity -- slow, disingenuous What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon."
0,Does not work! It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it.
0,"Extremely Disappointed with this video I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know."
0,"A long promo for the Thomas center(s) Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money."
0,"My Son finds it annoying My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD."
0,"Too bad.... Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad."
0,"Doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again."
0,"Do not waste your time....lousy This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is ""the best ever experienced"" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier."
0,"this album is garbage,straight bfi material cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this game.the beats where alright but the rappers a terrible.none of the have a goog flow to accomidate the beats.try again cmr.maybe next time."
0,"THIS IS A ONE COMPARED TO JUVENILEZ 400 DEGREEZ ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!"
0,The worst rap I ever Heard This is what is in the dictionary under wack. I can't belive that this many people bought this (...) The hot boys are just a fad like bellbottoms. (...) If you think this is what rap is about u just plain stupid and I'm glad this hot boy stuff is almost over wit. When some of my friends play this crap in the car I just rather get out and walk.
0,super wack just like No-Limit Cash Money has no shame at putting out garbage music.wack beats and no lyric ryhmes.who is buying this crab? all the stuff sounds the same and it's not that average.it's all bad.
0,"My Daughter Hates It I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat. It tastes awful, and it's just not meant for a young child. I got it after a recommendation from another mom, and it was a bad decision. I'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow."
0,"2/3 of a great book, then... blah I listened to the audio version of ""Cruel & Unusual"" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the ""who"" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, ""great book, bad ending..."" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?"
0,"I guess it was a mystery In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia."
0,"Soooooooooooo NOT Funny This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage."
0,Nasty People! Nasty Film! Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film.
0,"UNFUNNY PEOPLE I used to enjoy Sandler's movies but this one is just....jeez, how to put it? Well, UNFUNNY.All characters are if not stupid, shallow and egotistical...Don't care how 'dramatic' was this supposed to be, his misogynistic prick persona is the worst ever. Just, don't watch it, really...You'll want those minutes from your life back."
0,"I wish Adam Sandler wasn't in this. I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However, having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it's true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude ""jokes"". I have to say we didn't make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing."
0,"Not what I expected... I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie. They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up! When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it. My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while.If you're into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight, then you're going to like this film. However, if you're looking for humour like Adam Sandler's previous films (i.e. Happy Gilmore, etc) then you can forget about it.I give this film 1 star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film. :/"
0,Absolutely NOTHING Funny ! This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"The L O N G E S T movie... EVER! Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny. This however, just, well, wasn't. I really do believe that this movie had potential, but there was so much going on, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 movies out of it.It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD."
0,Seth Kept this movie from getting a 'ZERO' star rating!! A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian.
0,Stupid.... Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!
0,"Sandler's worst! I normally love Sandler's movies but this was just horrible. None of it flowed right, jokes were horrible vand stupid and just all around made no sense. Don't waste your time and money on this."
0,waste of time I must say I never liked Adam Sandler. There were so many more talented people who just never got a chance to be on the screen. I still don't get what's with Adam Sandler.Besides that I decided to give it a shot. It took half hour when I stopped watching.
0,Moron How can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performs?This guy is just a moronic retard.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM.
0,"Winning Cast, movie fell short This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw. When in fact, it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre."
0,"ACTUALLY NO STARS for rating pf Funny People movie Save your money. Your time can be MUCH better spent. This was one of the worse movies I ever sat through. Actually, I drifted away close to the end and was thankful I didn't waste that time. Its AWFUL."
0,Not Funny People Not worth the time.Pros: there were several good one-liners; introduced me to new comediansCons: excess foul language; adultry;
0,"Unpleasant and disappointing This is a nasty, mean-spirited book that exhibits contempt for the Torah and Torah values. When I picked up this book at the local library, I assumed that I would just love it and want to buy a copy for my college-age daughter (who is also a cat-owning Rabbi's daughter). But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and ""show"" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant. Warning: this book is not suitable for children!"
0,"Self-Serving Message This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children."
0,"Not what it looks like on the cover. As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book."
0,"Drivel Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the ""little dog"" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!"
0,"Fraud,not as advertised This DVD was entiled ""Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985"" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. I consider it to be a total fraud and misrepresentation."
0,"If you can't say anything nice, Well, that's no fun. Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story"
0,"You have GOT to be kidding This could be the worst novel I have ever read. It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists."
0,"A wildly implausible thriller This book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. I found all the other character two dimensional and all the ""intrigue"" regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence. Has Cornwell done better? I don't know and, after reading this, am in no big hurry to find out."
0,"No one will edit this, because I'm Patricia Cornwell At least, that's how I felt about this book, which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels. I recommend the first three books in the series. I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling. However, not having a fireplace, I filed this under G."
0,"A Piece of Crap! Noisy, crude five point vibration pad.NOT! a massager, a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless, no, worse than worthless!"
0,"No theory what so ever The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no ""objective"" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice"

0,"Unsatisfactory and very outdated I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's."
0,"Capitalism straight, in small unpalatable doses If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice."
0,"over-simplified diatribe Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free."
0,A historical gem whose title obscures its intent Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.
0,"More politics, less economincs I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view. The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter. After skimming a few pages I threw it away; I didn't even want it in the house."
0,"This book's title is misleading. This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase."
0,"Straight to the trash can! Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!"
0,"It wasn't very good! This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review."
0,on order I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.
0,"poor fit After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper."
0,"Upset I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down..."
0,"Squeem I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable.I returned it,"
0,"Pass The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. I am very dissapointed."
0,"Broke the 2nd time I wore it, great until then I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved."
0,"Uncomfortable! It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50.."
0,Waste of time for me I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me.
0,"itchy I washed it before used it for the first time. The next day I wore it, I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach. And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that."
0,"CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!"
0,"Poor quality and lousy customer service The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. I'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. The threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. They've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks."
0,does not fit me! So according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 28-31my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp!maybe it's just me but i am terribly disappointed
0,Too small Usually a size XS to S but this girdle's small did not fit true to size. Had to return back to Amazon.
0,"Awesome! It's pretty awesome for such a price! It definitely gives you great posture, I was sitting up straight like no other! although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise it's wonderful!^^^^^ was my review when i had it for 15-20 days, now-- after ordering it on Jan, 21, 2012-- it's SO useless. I've washed it with care, it smells like rubber, and it's pretty nasty. I'd rather pay $$$ and buy something that works the way it should."

0,"WARNING: This is the worst book ever written As most people readers know, Jack Higgins has written many fine action-packed books. However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review."
0,"Worst of theYear...or, maybe the decade Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it."
0,A Waste of Time This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it.
0,"Good story- Poor writing Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books."
0,"Disappointment on every page I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead."
0,"This is not the Jack Higgins I know This is by far his worst effort that I've read. He's not my favorite spy author,anyway. This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher's contract or obligation that Mr. Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry. The characters are not at all fleshed out, and the story line is too contrived. I would advise not wasting time by reading this book."
0,"Cartoon Arab-Scottish Villain I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further. His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish-Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible, pointless heritage. But, what do you expect from a middle-aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket.... depth?"
0,"Can't believe I read the whole thing Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can't believe I read the whole book. I guess I kept waiting for the action to start. It never did."
0,"I'd rate it 0 stars if I could have... Very few books contain their own review. This one does:""Stone said, 'It really is like a bad movie, Harry.'""'You can bleeding well say that again. . . .'""This book reads like a 7th grade reading-level condensation of an outline of a screenplay: The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long; very few words greater than two syllables are used. No complex thoughts, no character development, no suspense, and little description. Pure formulaic twaddle."
0,"A bad book, poorly written. The plot is not believable, there is not a shred of character development, and there isn't even any descriptive atmosphere. It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel. I shall not buy any more of his efforts."
0,Poorly Written The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again.
0,"Can't believe the publisher had nerve to issue this book A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to ""speak Irish"" but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing."
0,"Two Hacks I don't know who is worse- Higgins or Macnee. The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next. Completely implausible. Macnee's narration is so overdone it is laughable. Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky. A real stinker. Wayne Schwartz, Los Angeles, CA"
0,"Worst ""Live"" recording I've ever bought! I bought this CD for one song only, ""Steal Away"". I knew it was going to be ""live"", but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a ""muzik, lounge"" sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then, the only other song I recognized was ""Hot Rod Hearts"", again, done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most ""live"" recordings. I was very dissapointed, and I still don't have a decent recording of ""Steal Away""!"
0,"A thorn in the side of literature. Hawthorne's use of symbolism throughout the book is undeniable, yet his obvious alcoholism takes over as the underlying factor present at all points. He relies on ambiguity far too often without the build up to a climax. The climax(es) happened before the book started and only happened to a select few who read this book. Read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, or virtually anything by Aldous Huxley if you want some entertainment."
0,"technical problems with cassettes This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left. Most auto systems have that capability. However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound, it can be difficult (and maybe impossible) to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time. Unfortunately neither the packaging nor the website will warn you of the problem. You therefore should think before buying. Once you have opened the packaging you may be unable to return the product."
0,"Classic? Really? I will never understand how ""Classics"" become Classics. So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics. Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense. The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was, but it doesn't. It is better than Dickens, but then again everything is."
0,"Duller than dirt I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students. I don't know who suffered more, me or them.To be fair, as one of America's first novels, it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job.On the other hand, it is excruciating to read. There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad."
0,"Who Chooses Classics? I don't see how this book gets so much attention as being ""one of the best novels ever."" It's very short, and very boring. It's written in old english, which adds to the difficulty, and even if you can understand it, you finish the book and say, ""Ok, so what's the point?"" There is absolutely no point to this novel. Entire chapters of the novel are void of dialogue and appears as a wall of text, and the description is so vague that you can't even tell what a character is doing half the time."
0,"""Hallelujah!"" is what I said when I finished this book This novel was the most boring book I have ever read. I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long-winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance. Even though there is much symbolism to be found, when is one supposed to find it, while they are sleeping? Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece. How did this book become a ""CLASSIC""?"
0,"Landscape book I guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape. I didn't think it was necessary, it's just a book right?I guess it's supposed to be easier to read in bed. I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red book.If you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns; first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom. This just seems really irritating to me."
0,"Ugh. I read this book for AP English and had to do a blue-book assignment of it. The word ""ugh"" summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through ""dost thou"" after ""dost thou"" isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book ""The Classics Reclassified""."
0,"Avg. Rating too high I've bought this book, underlined every hint of symbolism, found all evidence of romanticism, followed every quote involving thematic oppositions, and noted every example of Pearl's rebellious nature and social alienation, but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding. The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace."
0,Received a different book I ordered a specific ISBN No. and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different ISBN No.The picture seen online is not the one that I received.
0,"Oh my... This novel is absolutely awful. Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs, at zero. Where to begin... perhaps with the run on sentences, the failure to create significant rising action, the flat two dimensional characters... This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant. Post-modern society does not really care about, ""Baby daddies,"" and the revelation which is made at the end, and beginning, of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury. Unfortunately, Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster."
0,"I read to pages of this novel and I had to stop! I have yet to actually complete this novel. It is so dog-gone hard to understand. On top of this, I have an essay that is due: TOMORROW! Is there no relief?!"
0,"I don't get it. I was assigned this book when I was a sophomore in high school (22 years ago). I couldn't get through it; the Cliff Notes version help me pass the test. I found it turgid and laborious reading.I graduated in the top 10% of my high school class. I have a master's degree. Despite my academic success, I don't understand why this book is a classic. I don't understand why Hester didn't just pack up Pearl and her stuff, move to another town and tell everyone she was a widow. That would have saved everyone alot of grief, especially young readers like me."
0,I hate this book. This is the worst book I have ever read. The attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period. I hurled it across the room at one point in agitation and disgust.
0,"get it away I usually have nothing to say but good things about book I read! But this book, it does have it's interesting points but I just don't get into it. I rather would burn myself at the stake that read the remaining chapter I have to finish for my English Class. What did I have to do to deserve this? I stood there reading the book with my book in one hand and dictionary in the other, I ended up reading Chapter 9 about 10 times because the information wasn't getting to me. And the way the author addresses the reader, I want to scream. I'm sure in the 1850's this was a wonderful book because of the message it stated back then, but more than 100 years afterwards, people seem to lose interest. And the fact that they make HS students read this book is just plain homicide. STOP THE ASSIGNING OF THIS BOOK! DON'T PUT YOUR STUDENTS THROUGH TORTURE!"
0,"Don't pay for this on the Kindle Unless you have the correct size font, you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle. It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text, the next line has a single word, then another full line and so on."
0,"Awful I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word ""Classic"" stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was ""meaty"" (whatever that is), ""deep"", and ""powerful""; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle."
0,"I HATE THIS BOOK I'm sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better, if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language. I don't know about the production of narcotics in the 1800's, but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasn't on a natural high if you know what I'm saying."
0,Don't READ THIS BOOK!! THIS BOOK SUX! Who cares about Pearl anyways! Someone shoot me in the head before i die of boredom!!!
0,slowly falling asleep The book is boring if you try to read it without a good look at the movie first but it gets easier to understand once youre in class failing every single test your teacher gives you on it! Then she decides to explain what's going on to you later. It was boring and I fell asleep everytime I went to read it.
0,"one of the worst books I've ever read typically, I will force myself to read even the worst books (for class, for ""fun"", because I think I should), but when I read this book for a [...] English course, I quickly realized it was one of the worst books ever (not to be taken lightly, seriously), certainly not worthy of a classic, boring, endless details that no one cares about... blah blah blah. Terrible. I was bored. It might have been too difficult for a 9th grader, but I wouldn't read it now either.on the other hand, my brother loved it."
0,"I only gave it a star because I had to. This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good. If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown, they can actually write!"
0,"paralyzing fear The pain brought on by this archaicly verbose peice of literary kindling is so great that, while reading, I was greatly tempted to gouge out my eyes to prevent any future encounters with Mr. Hawthorne's ""work"". Please, for the love of all things sacred USE CLIFFNOTES!!! It will save you from years of therapy. I am scarred for live. My soul will be tormented after death and i will be forced to walk the earth in search for reconciliation."
0,"This book is a wast of good paper Oh man, where do i begin with this one? First of all, I want to say that a 1 star rating is flattering this novel beyond all means. The Scarlett Letter is one of the most boring pieces of junk that I have ever been assigned to read. I realize that there is a ton of symbolism in this novel, but if you can't stay awake to find it, what's the point? Also, it really helps when Hawthorne decides to use 15 letter words in each and every sentence. Only person that I would recommend this novel to is an insomnia patient. This one ranks right up there with A Tale Of Two Cities (another ""Classic"")."
0,"Painful This was one of the most boring books i've ever read. Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel, that was a mistake. I'd pass on this one if i were you, if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online."
0,"Incredibly confusing; have a dictionary on hand! This is probably the most confusing and worst book I have ever read! The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely won't know hat you are reading. From my point of view as a high school (with mostly A's and good at English) student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students. The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all. Long setences also makes the book drag on. If I didn't have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start. This book had me in tears because it was so difficult. I had to ask my English teacher to explain this to me. Read this book at your own risk, but i do not reccommend it to anyone."
0,"Ick. Three words to describe my feelings of this book...I HATE IT.Hawthorne's writings are dull, dry, and other words that mean bad that start with D. The character's a boring."
0,"The Next Best Thing to a Sleeping Pill! This book literally put me to sleep. I could wake up at 2 in the morning and find the book in my lap, and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class. I mean, some of the sentences are about 15 lines long, and the plot, if there is a plot, is incredibly slow. If the author would just tell it like it is, and not drag it out for pages, the book would be only about a third of the length that it is. Boring, boring, BORING!"
0,"How Can Sex and Sin Be So Boring? Throughout this entire book, one part of my brain was in a state of wonder, trying to imagine how anyone could make a book about scandal, sin, adultery, public shame and cowardice so dull. To finish the book was a test of will, and was accomplished because I hate to leave things undone.There are many fine, engaging, interesting novels, both of our age and of Hawthorne's. I can't imagine why one would want to slog through this one."

0,"1996 edition of book is outdated The book WAS good in its time but EVERYTHING related to traveling in this area of SE Asia, especially Laos, has changed drastically in the past three years. Frankly, a 1996 edition should be sold as remainders at about $2, then someone who wanted only info about the people or the temples could get ethnographic info only! I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most published info, except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong Khai,Thailand, who does visas to Laos, was wrong and very outdated--especially the most important things like availability of visas and safety of bus/road travel. Real traveling info from books like this that are so old could be very misleading!"
0,"Disappointing This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style."
0,"Arrived broken! Well, this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" kind of reviews. Didn't pay much, didn't expect much, but basically functional would've been nice.

0,"Nauseating! If you are adamant to watch this movie despite all the negative reviews, please do it after the Holliday season. This is the most depressing, sad, pathetic, sarcastic and cruel movie that I've ever seen in my life.Through all the movie I felt that I am going to cry and was depressed for the rest of the day. Basically it is a movie about a guy that lost his parents during his childhood, twins with serious genetic disorders and a single mom. How somebody could find it funny is beyond me.If you want to kill the Holiday spirit and get into a deep depression than this movie is perfect for you! If not - skip it."
0,A very disappointing movie Its sad that a animation that is clearly made to attract children was made with such rude humor and disrespect towards others. How this animation could be recomended for anyone is beyond me. Shame on you Adam Sandler that your ability is not used for more postive purposes.
0,"Parents - Don't Let Your Kids Watch This Movie Someone I know bought this in a discount rack, thinking it was what it pretends to be -- a children's holiday cartoon. Nothing could be further from the truth. I could not believe what a disgusting piece of filth it is, full of perverted sexual innuendo. Movies like this should not be marketed toward children, and no matter what the rating, that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a children's holiday cartoon. It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it (and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever). I can't give this as strongly negative a review as it deserves! I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give it none."
0,"i want my money back Most likely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! I went to see this movie with about 5 or 6 friends, when it was over, we all wanted our money back! The movie is not funny at all. Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy, there are alot of sad parts in it, but they label it as a comedy. All this movie actually is happens to be is a fairy tale for little kids, huge waste of money. If you want to see a real adam sandler comedy wait for anger management or rent happy gilmore."
0,"Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams Movie! This movie was terrible!""WARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLE!""Well it starts out with Davey, a drunk who is crude and mean. Then when he gets into trouble he's doomed to community service with the town migiet Whitney, (No offence to little people out there, that it not my intention to offend anyone). Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack, and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isn't any better.Well Davey does all he can to offend Whitney. That is until his place burns up! So he moves in with Whitney and his sister, and they set some ground rules. Then as the movie goes on, they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion, and when he cries it's all the sudden a big deal! And for some reason the deer in the woods talk, and help Whitney out. What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa Claus?I hate the music in it, the voices are annoying, and the characters are mostly unlikable! So warning to parents, keep your children locked up from this totally bad movie!"

0,"Nightmare Before Hannukah I love Adam Sandler. Well, I used to love him, before he made Eight Crazy Nights. Not only was this cartoon not funny, it was downright trash. I would not recommend this ""feature"" to anyone. ""Eight Crazy Nights"" was short on story, long on time, and wearing on patience. I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I'll never get that time back. So now I sit here, typing away a review I doubt anyone will read, wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie! HUMBUG! Watch ""Ishtar,"" you'll get more out of it. Oh, and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star. I did this under protest."
0,"Okay. There is a movie worse than Stargate. Let me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies. I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Sure, they're not great films, but they've given me plenty of laughs. So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies I've ever watched, you'll know it isn't because of some bias against Mr. Sandler.This may be the worst movie ever made. It is cloying, stupid, unfunny, weird, and pathetic--in a bad way. I could go on about the awful story, the grating voices, the cliches and schmaltz, or the bad songs. (Yes, Virginia, this is a musical. The worst musical ever unleashed on film. No, I haven't seen every musical; but you don't need to in order to fully understand the depths to which this film sinks.)Don't see it. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't send any signal that they should make more cr*p like this."
0,"Worse Movie I've Seen In Ages I gave this 1 star because they wouldn't let me have 0 stars. The movie is just plain horrible. The 12 year olds in the audience enjoyed the juvenile, flatulence and other bodily function humor. But, this was the same audience that was passing gas in the theater and laughing at themselves. It will be a long time before I waste money on another Adam Sandler film."
0,"Sucks Yeah well this movie was just terrible. Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible. I mean this is a stupid movie, one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him. It's almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more. The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler's character but once again it fails, we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge. This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film. And one last comment, Why the hell is this a double disc DVD? All of Sandlers good and/or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment. This movie sucks."

0,"Why so expensive??! Why does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows? Especially considering these don't even have the original soundtrack. The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show, and it's missing from this way over-priced version. As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy."
0,"Spun Out The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are (1) Elvis' opening production numbers (including a nicely staged ""Adam And Evil""); (2) Deborah Walley's ""girl drummer"" role; (3) the Deusenberg; and (4) Elvis' closing production number, the medium walking blues ""I'll Be Back"". Everything else is redundant."
0,"The Road To Love Is Full Of Danger Signs... Three lovely young ladies all want Elvis' gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that's so bad it ROCKS! I just love the title song sequence where Les and the guys 'provide' Elvis with ""...lots and lots of girls."" And who was that chick, the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King? She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before! Elvis looks embarrassed. Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way."
0,"Piece of junk! This would be a nifty little contraption if it wasn't for the fact that you can't change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.I have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus. I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder. Oh, and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort."

0,"This is a Bootleg,Don't buy. I would like to recommend to anyone who have thought of buying this box set, to stay away. I've been a die-hard Metallica fan since the 80's, and i have never bought a bootleg album w/out hearing something off of it. I'm also in the Official Metallica Club, we are notified weeks before anyone else that a new album is coming out. They never mensioned this one, so then again i'd advise you to stay away from this item. The Garage Inc. CD is great. I've got all the versions of it except this one. I of course don't plan on getting it though. Who in their right mind would pay almost $140 for an item not even licensed by the band. I hope everyone who was thinking about buying this reads this first, so you all don't get ripped off."
0,"Don't buy it ! This pepper mill does not work well at all, it takes a lot of hand crunching to get the pepper ground and the refill 'twist off' plastic cap on the bottom on mine does not even open.The lip of the plastic cap hits the side of the pepper mill plastic body not allowing the refill cap to come off ! I used it until it ran out of pepper and that's it. Writing the manufacturer to get a refund. Shoddy construction. Get yourself a good old-fashioned wooden pepper mill."
0,"Hard to clean We had to buy a new lunchbox for our son after 2 months (a different brand, machine-washable) because this one is way too hard to clean.

It is very durable, but we can't get rid of the smell or stains with a reasonable amount of effort."
0,"Just horrible I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off, I bought it without hearing anything by them before, but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So, why did i personally find this so painfull?Well, the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off, the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons, but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell, being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan, was I recomended this? It's bland, it's week, and the dubby bass, boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually, forget it. The whole package. It is just lame."

At this moment, we do not have any working one for your computer."
0,"Not even a day... I bought this to replace the supposedly same power adapter that I purchased last year. This is NOT the same adapter as pictured for the item (I see that a customer has added two pictures of the true product). I was not concerned with this difference but would have preferred to have a light indicating the power is on. At first, it seemed to power my powerbook G4 fine, but later it started to cycle as charging and not charging, thus making the screen brighten and darken. When I shut the computer and let it charge, it did charge some, but I'm concerned about ruining my battery (which is also a replacement). It simply does not work when you are using the computer..and I'm ALWAYS using my computer! I will have to find an alternative to this product. I thought it was bad enough that the one I got last year quit working, but this is ridiculous."
0,"Does not work with ibook G4 This product does not work with my ibook G4. As stated by some earlier reviews by other customers, the charger toggles between charging and not charging. Occasionally, if it is left on, it will continuously charge. I thought about keeping it, but it is unreliable and there are other third party options for $10 more.This one is going back to Amazon."
0,"Bad Product: Cycling on and OFF Nice form factor etc...but bad function. Product appears to charge my Powerbook G4 12"" when it is off or asleep, but when working it cycles on and off and emits a faint buzzing sound from the brick. Try another product."

0,"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IBOOK G4 I'm sure this product is great for G4 Powebooks and G3 iBooks, but nowhere in this product description does it say that this adapter is NOT for use with iBook G4s. I tried this on my iBook G4, and the computer kept switching back and forth between battery power and the power supply from the adapter. I'm returning this to Amazon tomorrow, but am upset that I wasted $20 overnighting this adapter because I absolutely need to use my computer this weekend. I wish they would update the product description to make it explicit that this is for Powerbook G4s and iBook G3s ONLY."
0,"note to self: read reviews before buying I'm now on my third charger for my Powerbook (my dad says I'm rough on equipment). Let me tell you, the Macally is NOT it. Like others, it fluctuates between charging and battery every 1-2 seconds and the brick makes weird squeaky noises. After not having a computer for a week and being so relived to finally get this charger, I was almost in tears to find that it is a piece of crap. It charges when the computer is off or in sleep mode, but that's not going to cut it. If you have a Powerbook G4, don't waste your money on this."
0,"Defective product, bad service I purchased this adapter to replace another PS-AC4 that worked for about 18 months before going belly up. This one lasted two weeks. I called MacAlly and quickly got an RMA number, then I overnighted the defective item to them. That was ten days ago, and I'm still waiting for the replacement to arrive."
0,"Faulty Product - Horrible Support I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened. No power- nothing.When I unplugged this adapter the negative metal ring from the plug stayed lodged inside of my computer, I had to remove it with needle nose pliers.I had to call the company 5 times before getting a rep on the phone as I was continually placed in automated limbo for about 15 per call. The rep actually admitted to me that this happens alot because the rings are too small and fit to tight in the computers.I was really looking forward to saving some dough. But this adapter was surprisingly worse the the original that came with the computer.They are sending me return authorization."
0,"Bate and Switch We ordered the Macally PS-AC4 power adapter and received an entirely different product from a differnt comany. As noted by other Amazon shoppers we received th Inspire M8482. This adapter is differnet in the following ways..instead of the 10'cord with a velcro wrapper, it has a short cord that leavesthe transformer hanging from the input of your computer. This will ultimately break the DC connection from the board..this is not repairable. Their is no led power light as advertised leaving you wondering if it is on. It is clearly a cheap knck off and we are taken for idiots who might not recognize that. I am mad! I just went through a similar thing with Overstock. Months of emails, calls and waiting on hold...for a grain of satisfaction. It is insulting to think that these big companies have so little respect for us!"
0,"They are selling defective merchandise -- look at recent reviews! I too have the same problem most recent reviewers have had: when I plug the charger in, it cycles between charging and not charging every two seconds. The computer doesn't end up charging.In addition, the version I have doesn't look like the picture on the Amazon web site, and doesn't have the power LED.Clearly there is an epidemic of defective chargers. And we, the customer, have to go to the hassle of obtaining a return authorization and sending it back.I notified the seller. I am also going to notify Amazon to research this topic, and take the product off the site until they can resolve the issue. Other than this charger, my experience with Amazon has been exemplary.I strongly suggest that if you too have bought one of these chargers and have had trouble with it, please post here."

I tested it with a multimeter, and found that it had an open lead.I contacted Amazon (even better, through their web site - no waiting on the phone or waiting for an email), and they shipped another.This second one had the same problem as the first.I contacted Amazon again for a refund.The product was junk, but the service was excellent!"
0,"Cheap, Doesn't charge, dangerous, power cord This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15"" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the ""brick"" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better."
0,Macally Power cord Macally is a terrible company. NOT worth the money you save. I recently bought a power cord thru them that emits an electrical current thru my computer.

0,"Works great... for about a month Everything the other reviews say about this product is largely true: the cord is thicker and more durable than the Apple adapter, the brick doesn't get as unnervingly hot, you can deal with the fact that it's not powerful enough to be used as a power source... but one day it just mysteriously stops working. I bought this to replace my broken Apple adapter and was generally very pleased with it, but about a month later I went to plug it in one day and it just wouldn't work. My laptop showed no connectivity, the little charge light on the brick didn't go on, and after tinkering with the thing at length I couldn't get anything to change. If you want a cheap, temporary replacement charger, I guess this would be fine. But for anything long-term it might just be worth shelling out $80 for something that at least lasts a year or two."
0,Terrible product. Broke twice. Don't buy!!! Don't buy!!! This charger does not work. It broke twice before Amazon told me they would not send me another. The customer service was excellent from Amazon.
0,"Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4 This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned."
0,"Stopped Working Day 3 Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear."
0,"sparked, then didn't work We plugged this on only to have it spark and not power our ibook G4. It went back the next day."
0,"Another defective one... This product would intermittently charge my computer, charging about half of the time and not charging the other half. It has 3 1/2 stars as an average from so many reviews because you get exactly what you pay for with this one - a cheap alternative.I was happy with the first one I bought. It lasted about a year and a half with heavy use. I thought I'd try another one but odds are you'll end up with a defective one of you buy a few of them."
0,"Disappointing and dangerous Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. What I got was never quite up to speed, but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in, the quick charge wasn't a must. Unfortunately, after a scant 8 months, with very little movement or unplugging (I've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time), the power cord has given out. There seems to be a short between the wires, with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire. Needless to say, I'm not going back to this product!"

Halfway through the show, the singer was having serious trouble hauling his fat *ss around the stage. He sounded like an exhausted pig, gorging himself at the trough.

0,a real pain I bought this item 2 months ago because it was small and cheap. I use it daily. The grinding mechanism is already tired. Now it takes a lot of patience to actually get the desired amount of pepper/salt and it's getting on my nerves. So I'm browsing amazon for a real and efficient mill set.To be fair there is one thing I like in this product: the magnets that let you stick them to the cooker hood.
0,Don't waste your mony Don't waste your money on these. They don't grind well at all. I just bought celtic sea salts and got rid of my table salt and was very disappointed as these just don't grind the salt or pepper. I have to go buy another set and hope they work.

0,"Bill James it ain't No doubt the worst of the many attempts to cop the ideas and success of Bill James, Pete Palmer, etc. over the past decade. Cute names and sophomoric humor aside, there isn't a great deal of meaningful analysis here, and if you take the time to go back and look at the previous year's addition, you will see that these guys are wrong a lot more often than they are correct. Their arcane formulas and measurements totally miss the point of something as simple and palatable as Runs Created, and the result is a dull and confusing mass of EqA's."

Me, I love Archie's music from 62 to 70, this music is CRAP. Strangely, Things Have Go to Change was amazing - Archie you had it in you to be greatImpulse wanted a hit LP this was never going to be it!!!! Archie was misled or not up to say NO!!!!!!"
0,"Slick, over-produced bluegrass I hate to disagree with so many people who love this CD, but I find very little to like about it. I found the ballads weepy, the upbeat songs cliched, and the singing/musicianship professional but uninspiring. To give you an idea of my tastes, my favorites are Nashville Bluegrass Band ""American Beauty"", Steve Earl/Del McCrory Band ""The Mountain"", Ricky Skaggs/Kentucky Thunder ""Bluegrass Rules"". In my opinion, ""The Grass is Blue"" does not approach the artistic standards of these and many other current CD's. Once again, no offense is intended to the many people who are so fond of this CD. The bottom line: I plan on making the day of somebody who wants to own this CD by selling my copy to a used CD store."
0,"Band saves CD As usual, Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She's attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it doesn't work."
0,"Only for the ""Waltons"" I love ya Dolly, but this music is the WHACK, or it is to this city boy! This is a Cd only the Waltons could love!"
0,"Disappointing One truly great song (the first on the disc) followed by 11 weird takes on Mexican folk music and depressing moans. The brilliant arrangement and accompaniment of the first song ""Mi Cara de Pared,"" a sexy, mournfully loping tango, led me to expect greatness within, but alas, Lhasa is a one-trick pony, one with a potentially great voice, which is reduced to strained yodelling on the subsequent uninteresting numbers. It's almost as if she were undecided what category she wanted to present herself in - is it world music? Latin? Pop? Rock? Unfortunately it seems to be none of the above. If I want Mexican folk songs, I'll call Linda Ronstadt. The arranger and producer (name forgotten) should have waited to present the CD when he had more tricks up his sleeve and the singer had better songs. A great disappointment - but that first number is a killer."
0,worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
0,My review The Castle in the Attic was about a 10 year old boy named William who lives with his mom and dad in Pennsylvannia. And he has a baby sitter that stays with him for 13 years and desides to go back to her home in England. William doesnt want her to go so he takes her picture of her husband who died in the world war 2. She finds out and is said for him and gives William a go away gift which was a huge toy castle with a led knight.
0,"This is NOT a VHS tape, It's a music CD. This was sent to me by mistake. So free it was but not a bargain.I dislike this imported 2 disc, 40 tract album very much. The is from the 30's I would think. With high quality headphones this stuff is to hard to listen too.The sound is very thin and hissy. Fidelity is low and overall listen-ability is very weak. This big band stuff without the big band sound. Song after song, it all sound the same, very boring material with sound to match. Just a throw-away."
0,"waste of money!!!!! Oh man, this is horrible! I'm a Lara junkie, and I'm completely embarassed by this horrid game. The PC controls are a joke, you just seem to spin in circles when you're just trying to make a simple turn. I feel completely ripped off by the folks at Eidos for releasing such a bug filled game. Game locks up at the worst possible moments, cut screnes are too long and dull, just let us play the game without the need to watch a movie every level...put all that energy into fixing the movement controls and lock up issues. Please, don't waste your hard earned cash on this!!! Maybe Eidos will get the message."
0,"Robocop dressed like Lara Croft I was expecting Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness since last year, with a similar performance as Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, but now when I receive the game, I saw this little girl that walks like with an umbrella inside of her pants.The graphics and sound are great, but Lara rotates like a robot and when I try to make her run, she doesn't agree with me and moves extremely slowly.I have a 2MHz PC with 500Megas RAM and GeForce4 Graphic Card, and there is no possibility that only this game needs to practice Ctrl-Alt-Del each 15 minutes in order to play it.I'll find the way to sell my game and suggest Eidos to make a research in order to define how many of the customers are really satisfied with this game and determine if a refund to the customers is the better way to maintain the good image of Eidos until today.It's a shame."
0,Do Not Buy This Game Inspite of the two patches offered by Eidos the game crashed very often. Lara's movements are hard to control and choppy in stairwells. You will be nothing but disappointed if you spend your hard earned money on this game.
0,Don't waste your money I bought this game at a reduced price and still feel like I got ripped off. The controls in the PC version are an absolute nightmare and make what could have otherwise been a decent game horrible. Sometimes you feel like you have no control whatsoever. Good thing two successful movies have been made about this game otherwise EIDOS would've been out of business with this horrendous offering. In fact I'll think twice before purchasing anything with the EIDOS name or CORE DESIGN name attached to it.
0,"This [stinks] I will have to assume this game is going [to stink] Why would it's release be pushed back a third time? I am tired of waiting. This game must be so bad that Eidos/Core must feel it needs some severe refinement before release.On top of the release date changes, neither Eidos or Core have bothered to put the news up on thier sites. ..."
0,"Bad Eidos, Bad! Oh. My. God. I remember when Tomb Raider first came out, and my husband and I got it on the original PlayStation. It was great, for 1995. We got Angel of Darkness for our computer, and WHOA! It looked like Eidos had REGRESSED! The animation is choppy, jumps (basically all moves, in general) are hard to control and judge, and I read on a review for the PS2 version that you'd better come to love the phrases ""save successful"" and ""load successful"" because that's what you'll do, over and over and over! It's completely ridiculous how bad the game looks and plays. Holy cow, and the Glitches! At one point in the church, if you move Lara to JUST the wrong spot then the game gets stuck on the two boxers in the ring fighting, and you have to reboot the computer to get out of it! This game wasn't even worth the discounted price I picked it up for. Don't buy it, it's a trick..."
0,Angel of darkness is correct This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
0,Come on here people... This control sceme made Tomb Raider 1 unplayable. This control scheme kept me from passing the TRAINING levels of TR: Last Revelations. This control scheme was horrible but barely useable when I played Resident Evil. This control scheme caused me to die like a thousand times on the first level when I played Fear Effect. This control scheme is still compleyely horrible in this game.Would someone please tell Eidos to change the controls in any future Tomb Raider games. I really want to like this series but every one of these games has been unplayable due to the control scheme.
0,"Do not buy this Brand!!! I was originally pleased with the make of the washer but the connector between the washer and hose broke, when i ordered the replacement parts it took them over 1 ""YEAR"" to get the replacement parts to me. That is not a typo and i find it ignorant that it took that long to replace a plastic part that they should have had mass produced with plenty of spares. Do not buy, the customer service is horrible and the machine breaks easily, not to mention to get it fixed takes a year."

0,"WARNING - Does Not Help This is one of those books that copies all of the information from other books and tries to call it their own (an does not give all the information needed to do the few examples). If need information on bookbinding, the best I have found is Hand Bookbinding: A Manual Of Instruction by Aldren Watson (also available here)."
0,Waste of money This looked like it would be lots of fun but it's very hard and uncomfortable and doesnt vibrate very well at all. Dont waste your money
0,"Just in case anyone is as stupid as I am This may be the best product out there ... I wouldn't know because I had no idea what I was ordering. It didn't dawn on me when it said pneumatic that I had to have an ""air supply"" ... plus it doesn't have any grinding points. I just wanted something to etch my name on the metal prints of my artwork. So back it goes and I'll look for something that's simple enough for me to understand what it is and how to use it."
0,"I am not impressed with this product! I bought this bag holder to use in my yard to collect leaves anddog droppings. The construction is very flimsy and the little tabs that hold the bag in place are VERY VERY hard to get off!. After several months, it now can barely stand up by itself and I have to constantly tighten the wheels and other screws. It would be nice if it was better made and sturdier and if it had a cover to keep out the flies...It seemed like a great idea, but the products is not well made."
0,"Cheaply made product I often struggle when trying to empty the clippings from my lawnmower into a garbage bag and I had hoped that this product would make that task easier. I was disappointed, I must say. The frame is very thin and unstable. The assembly instructions were hard to understand and the product was hard to assemble with only one set of hands. I am not pleased with this product at all. It seems as though it would collapse if I were to use it for my intended purpose. I do not recommend this product at all."
0,"flimsy poor instructions, had to modify by creating new holes in the metal. The rubber bag clamps were too difucult to remove so replaced with wood clothespins. Don't bother with this thing."
0,mismached The item as pictured was not sent. Instead a holder was sent that had no provision to hold the leaf bag nor did it have wheels. Not worth the ;money
0,BUYER BEWARE This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
0,don't waste your money The worst item I have ever purchased it is so flimsy you can only fill it to half full putting it together nut and screws stripped out and had to go to ace hardware to buy new bolts and nuts save your money
0,"I would rather chew my leg off than have you read this book. Please let me begin by agreeing with most reviewers that Aldous Huxley was a brilliant man, one of the most forward-thinking men in modern history and (on the whole) a wonderfully gifted writer. That being said, this book is absolutely, unequivocably horrible. It is 354 pages of plotless, repetitive socio-preach. Mr. Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" is, in my opinion, one of the best novels ever written. ""Island"" does not rise to that same level, though, and I would not wish it upon anyone."
0,Software is Horrible! This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
0,"Wrong title and director There are two mistakes about this DVD. The English title for this Italian movie should be either Bread, Love and Dreams (original: Pane, amore e fantasia) or Bread, Love and Jealousy (original: Pane, amore e gelosia). The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them. Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932. Both Italian movies are very good, but the one star is because of these mistakes."
0,"A Rookie Game Everyone knows that a good strategy game involves somewhat of a steep learning curve and an advanced difficulty level. This game is simply a click and attack real time strategy that does not involve any heavy thinking. In fewer words it's the bunnie slope for youngsters that are just discovering the thrill of these games. In conclusion I feel the word strategy is innapropriate altogether! True strategy players will want to return the product, rookies will like it because they'll feel moderately challenged by it."
0,"Very Disappointing. I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade, but sadly they have not. Having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out. Now that Kim is in her 40s, you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past."
0,"Don't Bother w/the Muffs...just Noise. Bought this CD thinking it would be similar to their cover tune, Kids in America.Was I wrong, this is worst cd I've has the displeasure to listen to.Old chic, lead singer does nothing but scream throughout all the tracks. The tunes are simplistic, lack depth and show no inkling of creativity.If you like endless screaming to nonsensical lyrics then this rubbish is for you."
0,"Promising, but a let down. Sorry, i just didnt get it. We all know the lessons provided in this book. Seems too repetitive. There are plenty of other self help books that are more useful than this one."
0,"Simplistic, humorous book on life. This book really wasn't for me. It's the same tripe as 101 other books of the genre. Although, it might be useful to the right person. I'd happily recommend it as a gift for a teenager, or anyone who doesn't usually read books. The book reads a lot like the ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" series, with quirky quotes and anecdotes, but very little substance. On the bright side, after reading Chomsky or Neitzche, McWilliams is a comic relief."
0,"Total disappointment I was totally disappointed with the book for two reasons. One, it had a different author than the one I ordered. Two, it was tremendously boring. A waste of the little money I did spend to get it."

0,"Poor quality and high price... are these knock-offs? I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34. I already had some Wranglers. The waist was way too small, the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way. These were made in Mexico, just like the ones I bought at Target, but the badging was different, a rubber badge on the back right pocket, not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist. Were these knock-offs? Not sure. Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $15.99 each (they were Original and Legendary Gold, not Cowboy, but still, half the price, pard)!"

0,"Unbelievable I'll have to reserve a higher rating until I finish this saga. I think I will have to agree with the previous reviewer that gave a low rating.

0,"Lousy workmanship This product does its job, but not very well. All the end pieces, except the shovel, and the handles have to be attached to the rods. The poker, the main tool used, does not fit on the rod very well, and will spin loose when trying to move a log. My husband said he will weld it on so it won't move. Would recommend a different product, probably something that is constructed of one piece."
0,"Disappointing I purchased these fireplace tools with great anticipation of beautiful, warming fires. The tools are cheaply made and if you don't put them into the holder the right way they get stuck and it's difficult to remove the handle. Do not recommend."
0,did not like This set is very small. Not happy at all. Bought it because other people gave good reviews. We have a wood burning stove. The poker is not long enough to safely move logs around.
0,Disappointed I was disappointed in the CD because I am a fan of the trio and this one had too much input from other musicians. I guess I was looking for unadulterated Steve Newcomb (sp). My error.
0,"Wrong Country for the product Had to call the MFGR'er to be informaed that the model I was sent does not fit on any GOLF with US Specs,it was manufactured for the UK version of the Golf, which has less ""plumbing"" and emmission gadgetery.For my model, the only option is the replacement filter (square) that fits in the filter box."
0,"Mathematical nonsense Mathematically speaking, this book is all nonsense. For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice."
0,"Too blunt for me! All I can really say is I didn't even finish the book. I love romances but this one wasn't for me. I found it too much to read about sexual desire and how the body responds to it, that was too much for me. I would say this book should say blush or some kind of note to let people know its not clean romance."

This is the first book I have deleted before finishing it. I read to 35% and just could not take any more! It was not funny at all, it was super annoying and predictable."
0,"Too old to matter This book really should be removed from circulation. While basic MIDI information is in there, it is so out of date it just makes it hard to read. Examples are of obsolete or vintage gear and has no real relation to todays musician.Illustrations are all cheesy and look like bad microsoft clipart. Photographs are all poor and dated. The section on MIDI and a personal computers lists atari and commodore as possible good choices - get the picture!If you are looking for charts of Control codes etc, - they are in here, but you can find those anywhere. If you are trying to get information on MIDI in the last decade or so, buy a different book."
0,"very poor construction For the price this very simple apparatus should function flawlessly. Its one job is to hold sand. I wish I noticed out of the box that one of the edges of the bottom where it meets the frame was bowed out enough to leak sand (salty looking sand) all over my desk. Annoying. I scooted as much sand out of the way as I could to duct tape this edge on the inside. When I have the time, I'll probably dump out the sand and tape all the edges because I don't trust it.The hassle this has caused is definitely not zen."
0,"do not buy this piece of c--p do not buy The Great Indian Wars. the same hollywood movie stock played over and over, sometimes without even turning down the borrowed movie's audio. i couldn't concentrate on the narration, and that was a shame because the narration was very well written. the narrator also had a fine voice and read his stuff superbly. i felt sorry for him, being assocaited with something that went so bad through no fault of his own. someone ruined this ""documentary"" with the choice and use of the visual footage.i even tried turning off the picture and listening only to the narration but the silly dialogue and old-western music score made trying to listen only to the narrator sheer torture. i only wish i could have given this film a rating it really deserves. MINUS FIVE! the fact that they used 2 tapes when the entire length is only 96 minutes proves to me that the intent of the producers was only to flim-flam the public into thinking they were getting a lot for their money."
0,"The Great Indian Wars 1840-1890 This is without a doubt the worst video I have ever watched.The videos picture could not tracted without jumping lines and wiggling screen it was painful for me to watch.The movie itself was out of focus.They used old black and white movies"" indians meet the cavalry "" to illustrate the action and pencil drawings of the indian chiefs while they spoke of them. There was one man speaking with a monotone voice.After five minutes it became very boring to watch.The movie was put together very poorly and hard to watch the pictures had very little contrast, and hard listen to.It was so bad I could'nt retain any of infomation,my mind kept wandering off.

Previously I had a Viewsonic 17"" LCD monitor which was pretty bad too. The Soyo has a bad stand that is supposed to be adjustable, but I could not do it and had to prop it at an angle with a book. The User's manual is nearly incomprehensible. The speakers have to be the worst sounding ones I've ever heard.

0,"I do not recommend this vacuum We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner."
0,"Very poor vision of Wolverine I have seen an episode of this show and all I could say is WOW, what a travesty. This show is completely not Wolverine. First Logan is Canadian not Japanese, short not tall, older looks middle aged even though much older not like a teenager. Voice acting is poor. This show is the William Shatner of Wolverine, extreme over acting and over dramatized action sequences. This is supposed to be Marvel Comics Wolverine not a Wolverine DragonBall Z. If they want to make a good Wolverine Cartoon keep it on par with the comics both in the character models and story, and use voice actors that have worked in the past, and if you really want to do Wolverine Justice make it a Mature rated cartoon and show Blood in the battles."

0,"JUNK! (says China on product) When will people stop digging for the lowest possible price? I would have paid three times this price to have a quality product. After three pumps the check valve that holds the air in the rocket failed. You would push the pump in and all the air would get sucked out of the rocket when you pulled the pump back out. Then the mounting nipple snapped off when releasing the rocket from the clamp. Never worked once! Would like to find one that works, but they all look the same."
0,"Can't get it to work I used to love these rockets back in the day when I was a kid, so I got one for my 11-year old son. When it arrived, it looked like the ones I had as a kid, but was obviously of cheaper quality. Then again, it cost only a few bucks. Problem is, when I put the water in and then snap close the end of the pump, all the water leaks out! This happens whether the rocket is pointed up or down. The rocket is totally useless and we had to throw it away. Too bad, those rockets sure were fun a long time ago..."
0,"Memory Lane?? I bought 2 of these hoping to show my kids one of the toys I had growing up. Wow, these are straight CRAP. Why would someone produce a product that SUCKS this much?!! The clip that holds the rocket to the pump doesn't hold the rocket on. The O-ring is a dried, hard, brittle piece that doesn't seal. Then, when you get past ALL that crappy-ness, the pump shaft will either pull completely out, bend like a pretzel while pumping, or leak water into the pump itself! I got three launches out of 2 of these. I was more disappointed than the kids were. Boooooo!"
0,"Ron Not as pictured. Doesn't seal well for the launch and so it is pretty much worthless. I had the one pictured when I was a kid and was pretty excited to order and now left with disappointment. Order what you see and you may get something else and cheaply made. Maybe should have bought this back in 2006 when it got better reviews. Amazon, please take this off your site!! It indeed is less than a quality product and your company is deceiving those who buy."
0,"Junk Wanting to share my water rocket memories with my kids, I decided to try this rocket out in spite of all the bad reviews. I agree, it is junk. While the whole thing is cheaply constructed, the biggest problem I see is with the pump. The valving is so defective it simply will not pressurize the rocket. Even though I was very gentle with the pump, it came apart after only a couple pumps and the rocket never flew. I'd love to find a good one of these but this one is not."

0,"NOT WORTH THE MONEY This is totally different from the ""classic albums"" series of DVDs that have come out which I love. This is a ""classic album under review"" which basically has a bunch of fat old guys talking about how great AC/DC is. The clincher for me was the fact that they had an AC/DC tribute band on to play the guitar riffs from this album. A TRIBUTE BAND?!?!? I'm sure that was great fun for those guys to do, but I think the people watching would rather see the actual band playing the songs. This DVD went on WAY too long and only had little snippets of the band playing live. Way too much filler for me and not what I thought this DVD was going to be. I do not recommend it."
0,"Come on............. We know Back in Black was one of the best albums in history...do we really need some ""experts"" to tell us this ??I'm a big AC/DC fan I would not buy this...."
0,"Unbeliavable.... So they release a DVD to say how good ""Back in Black"" is (as if we needed to be remembered of that...) and they put a photo at the front cover with SIMON WRIGHT in the line-up, instead of Phil Rudd! Wright joined the band THREE YEARS after the recording of ""Back in Black"".This fact alone is a very good omen of the real intentions of this product: to make easy and fast money and offering nothing new about this classic rock album. Useless."
0,"BIG THUMBS DOWN I rented this thinking it would be an interesting subject on American-Chinese tradition here in the U.S. But I was wrong, it was a total disappointment. The story and its sub-plots are too contrived. The script is very formulaic; even adding a twist at the ending was typical and intentional - just so for audiences who likes a twist in their movies. Any viewer wouldn't get involved watching this film. Basically this is about a group Chinese-American siblings who has hang-ups with themselves and among each others. Set in the affluent neighborhood of San Francisco, it portrays an embarrassingly rich family by showing the amenities of the matriarch's sprawling extravagant house. Tennis, a dip in the pool, jacuzzi anyone? Jeez! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
0,"Beware The set is cute to look at, but as far as actually using, it is terrible. The glasses are fine, but the shaker is so hard to use, I actually took a chunk out of my finger trying to get it open to refill it! I've never used it again."
0,Not good! I purchases this set for simple craft projects...mainly to cut card stock and cardboard. I tried hammering the punches with my 12 oz. hammer and it didn't go through the card stock. Got my husbands big beefy hammer...it still will not punch through thin card stock. I am very disappointed in this product. Glad I didn't pay a lot...complete waste of $
0,Dull and dirty Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we'll see
0,"Broke within the first week I bought this binder for my son who started middle school. Withing the first week, one set of rings did not close properly and now my son has to carefully go through his notebook so the papers don't fall out. Everything gets stuck at the point where the rings don't completely close. Poorly made product."
0,"Probably the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen I have a relatively high tolerance level for bad flicks, but this one is beyond tolerable. If you check the credits after the movie it appears as if the producer hired his family and friends as the actors. Summary (no pun intended): Horrific acting (I could have acted those scenes better than the so called actors; Frightful script (who talks like that anyway ""The zombies are breaching our stronghold, I would advise that we seek an alternative egress route in order to address the impending conflict""; Brain Blending effects: Nothing like a karate kick to the face that missed by about 6 inches yet knocks the zombie through the window. My review is more interesting than this movie. Give me a camcorder and an Amazon makeup kit (shameless plug) and I could have done this movie. There is nothing redeeming about this... NOTHING!"
0,dont waste your time or money. lower then low budget with horrible dialogue and acting. Two six year olds could have done better with a couple of kindergarten actors
0,"Too small and stained I ordered this for my average sized 8 year old. I purchased the medium (size 8-10) and it is way too small. It's too short, tight around the shoulders, the boot covers don't cover her foot and the mask won't go around her head (not even close and again she's 50%ile in both height & weight for her age). This size would be better for a 5 year old! And if that isn't bad enough, the cape has a dark (non-removable) stain on it! I'm hoping I can return it w/o paying for shipping considering this item is damaged."
0,"Bad thing The fabric is very common, the finishes are really bad, the mask was broken the first time, the layer has no seams, the fabric also is leadership, not what I expected."
0,"Item was nice color This rod was too flimsy in my stall shower to stay up more than 10 minutes with a curtain. We put it up at least four times and it fell down. I returned it. Color was nice, it was extremely thin."
0,This DVD is not as represented in the description. There are only 8 out of about 24 episodes from the Baking With Julia series on the DVD. Amazon would not guarantee me a full refund if I returned it since I took off the plastic.Even though I had not viewed it. I didn't notice that it was only 8 episodes till after a tore the plastic off and looked at the back of the dvd. Definitely is not work the money.
0,"Sent damaged product I received this DVD in a well packed box with another item. The other item was in perfect condition. However, this DVD's case was broken in several (at least 4) places. As I said, the box was well packed and insulated. The DVD had obviously been sent in the damaged state it was received in. Most disturbing is the fact that the damage to the DVD case was so OBVIOUS. Pieces are broken off inside the celephane wrapping that you can see and, when you pick it up, you cannot miss feeling them.The DVD itself skips in several places.Unacceptable and unethical behavior on the part of the sender. They had to have known they were sending me a severely damaged DVD case. It had to have been damaged at the time they packed it in the box.As a result, I was not able to give it as a gift as planned."

0,"Sorry, not convincing at all Well, as a vegetarian and resident of a country seeing exploding diabetic population ( India) I find this approach to diabetes unconvincing.ONE, the emphasis is on animal foods. This has three difficultiescultural prohibitionsbiological concentration of alien hormones, pesticides and antibioticsand last not least, the cost factor of such a diet.TWO there is compulsive testing of blood sugar levels.THREE it encourages dependency on the clinician.Where's the sense of freedom in all this?In my counselling sessions I use sprouted whole legumes, leafy vegetables, NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS, resistence exercises, meditation, family support. It all works fine."
0,Not Really for Diabetes II This book is mostly for those with Diabetes one.This is his second book.His first book was a good one and full of useful info for both types of Diabetes.If you are a Diabetic type I then this book is for you.If you are a Diabetic II then buy his first book.I am a Diabetic II and this book was really a waste of my money.
0,Misleading Blood sugar is only part of the equation. Following this type of diet causes high acidic levels which causes illness. This diet is nothing new. My grandmother followed this kind of plan back in the late 40's because they thought ALL carbs were bad. Today we know that the brain needs glucose to function. Carbs + high fiber leaves lower net carbs. And diabetics need a balance---in fact all people need a balance of healthy whole foods and exercise and fresh air. One more thing; my grandmother died of a massive heart attack on this kind of plan. She was only in her 50's.
0,Core Sports Performance A complete disappointment and waste of time. The narrator couldn't seem less interested; almost as though bothered by the project. Look somewhere else for a sports hypnosis cd.
0,"Not authentic The title of this video mentions Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, what is being taught on this tape is not authentic Argentine Tango. Not even close. It's ballroom tango. There is a huge difference: in music, style, steps, posture, etc... Don't be fooled by ballroom instructors trying to teach Argentine Tango. The only authentic instruction available on the market comes from authentic Argentine instructors from Buenos Aires."
0,"Nice Title! It's rather amusing that some harmonica band (or whatever the hell it is) decided to give their album the same title as one of the greatest rock albums in history (Styx: Pieces of Eight). And to Mr. ""Please push sales"" who wrote the other ""review"": I bet your cover art isn't QUITE as good as the incredible Hypgnosis masterpiece of the Styx album. ;-)"
0,"Save your money! I received this software as ""bonus"" with Photo Explosion Delux. It's terrible. Was easy to create the slideshow and it looked great on my computer. Tried it on 2 DVDs and it didn't play. Tried to re-record it on a CD-RW and it still didn't work! It did run on my husband's laptop, but out of 6 computers I tried it on at work it only was recognized on 1! Very frustrating software. SAVE YOU MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER."
0,"Poor quality of wrapping I received my ""new"" product a few days ago but it wasn't in brand new conditions. The box had been worn around the edges and you can tell it had been rewrapped in a different plastic cover. When I pay extra money for a brand new item I expect it to be exactly that."
0,"Sipder-man ""The High Definition Trilogy"" [Blu-ray] only works on PS3 I agree the comment from reviewer GWIRTH ""ginnyww"". Somehow these Sipderman blu-rays are not norm. They can only play on PS3. No luck with Samsung blu-ray players, not work with Sony blu-ray players either. Manufacturer needs to check what's going on. I also checked two sets of Sipderman blu-rays, one set from Fry's electronics, another set from Amazon, same problem, so that is not random disc defects."
0,"WANT REFUND! The movies do not play in my xbox 360 console, which is my only source of a DVD player. i would appreciate a full refund considering i had to wait over 3 weeks just to get the DVDs that don't work."
0,this is not a region 1 set I bought this set for my husband and brother for Christmas last year then we ended up buying a different set for the movie cash for the new movie. I went to sell this set at used movie retailer and they informed me it was from overseas and possibly a bootleg. WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!
0,"Not a real collection boxset. I like the movies and I want to add this trilogy to my DVD collection. However, this set is not a collection boxset that I am looking for. They are 3 separate spiderman movies in their own packages, and bundled together in a newly design cardboard box and called them ""Trilogy"".The worst is that they are the unsold inventory which they applied white stickers to cover the barcode in the back of each box. I felt cheated by Sony Pictures. They should have done a better job by creating a real boxset in a nice package with some additional materials.If you are looking for a nice collection boxset, please skip this set."
0,Perfect if I Lived In Europe Received DVD's with no issue. The problem was that they were formatted for a region other than the United States. This is strange to be due to the fact that they were shipped from an American address to an American address. Amazon refunded my money with no issue.

0,Cable not what it is sold as Cable is sold as having the ability to transfer video from a camcorder to a PC.It doesn't do it. I spoke to the company and they told me that there is no cable that does that. I asked them why thet advertised this cable as being able to do it and he told me I should have known better. They then charged me 15% to take the cable back. You would be smart to shop elsewhere. They don't know what their products do and they charge you for their lack of knowledge.
0,"what a rip off, sony's using customers as cashcows, get the cable from apple instead for only $29! I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called ""Thin Fire Wire"". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.Shame on you Sony."

0,"Break too easily My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past."
0,"Not a scholarly book The book was written by progressives as an attempt to rewrite history about the Christian heritage of the Americans who signed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. This is not a scholarly work. It has no footnotes for reference. It was debunked by scholars the next year after it was written. It is an interesting reading to understand the effort that the authors and the people they represent would go to to advance their political agenda. It is a very unfactual book that distorts truth. With this understanding, people should read scholarly books to understand the Christian legacy of these people."
0,"Brain washing I would like note that if you look at the footnotes for this book as to where they got there information, they do not have a shred of evidence to back them up. They simply state they they have forgone the traditional footnotes and that we should believe them just because they have a PHD. I know that if I were writing any type of paper for these gentlemen in college they would fail me if I didn't show where I got my information. Furthermore, There is a man in Texas who has the world's largest collection of artifacts from our founding fathers and he has loads of evidence which point to the extreme opposite. In fact he has a copy of bibles that were printed and distributed to every family in America through funding from Congress. I would encourage anyone who sees this to watch the documentary called ""MONUMENTAL"" by Kirk Cameron, exposes the truth about our constitution writers and points out the damage that books like these have caused to our society."
0,"Baseless, made up propaganda This is a book that is used in colleges across America, but contains almost no primary source quotes, no footnotes, no endnotes, and thus no scholarly support for any of it's assertions. Did the author even bother to read the founders' letters, speeches, published works, etc? Probably not, bc actual quotes from those who founded this country would really get in the way of their made up speculation, hearsay, and biased opinions masquerading as historical fact. Pathetic."

0,"I can't belive LJS wrote this I am a huge LJS fan, I have read almost all of her books well over 10 times except this one. It was so boring I really disliked to book. It didn't have anything to do with the NW until the book was almost done, and Gillian was so pathetic and whimpy. David.... I really didn't like his character at all."
0,"I can't believe she wrote this! LJS's other books are great, but this one was so boring! There was absolutely nothing dangerous about Gillian and David being in love, and that's the whole point of this series! Also, it's kind of unlikely that someone could just cut her hair and wear makeup and then suddenly be popular. I didn't like Gillian at all. She's superficial, not to mention being Little Miss Weakling. David was an idiot because he fell for her as soon as he saw her with short hair and makeup. Let's get realistic! He cheated on the SATs and Gillian still wants to support him. Plus, he's BORING! LJS's other books are all 5 stars in my opinion, but I hated this one."
0,"Left-Wing Propaganda This old chestnut of a book should be put out of its misery. It's written with style and a tone of authority, but careful reading shows that it is hopelessly slanted. On every significant point which involves historical uncertainty or controversy, the authors unquestioningly accept the left-wing/labor point of view and cynically disparage or totally ignore any other interpretation. This is Labor's ""untold"" story because no other reputable historians have ever had the nerve to write such an openly propagandistic book. Academic labor historians who think this book is so wonderful are merely showing their left-wing ideological colors. There are much better and more objective accounts out there."
0,"No stars but they all think they are and have stuff to say. You can be a rock star and not have a clue as to what haiku is. This book has been around. It has been the brunt of jokes in the haiku community. I can't say I know how to write a decent haiku but if you google, you WILL find some great haiku poets. PLEASE - if you don't have this book, keep it that way. It may have been a year but not a haiku one."
0,"Definitely NOT haiku - poetry? Maybe... This is indeed a book of 3-line poems passing itself off as haiku. This is not harmful certainly UNLESS an unwary reader picks it up and assumes that it is, basing all future opinions of this delightful poetic form on The Haiku Year.""There are those who regard haiku as a kind of 'do your own thing' poem, and never consider its foundations. But the haiku, as soon as it goes beyond the beginner's efforts, becomes a matter incorporating traditions and established values, aesthetic and otherwise, and can not be written well outside them."" - Robert Spiess"
0,"The only stars is the rocker You make it in rock and you think you can do it all. This book proves you can't. It is a truly poor excuse for a collection of haiku and it is particularly offensive because there are those who will buy it thinking it the real thing. Do yourself a favor and buy Higginson. You can look at this in a few minutes in the bookstore. It might be good for advanced classes in ""don't let this happen to you!"""
0,"It's the end of haiku as we know it... This is what has become of haiku in English- and it is all bad. Haiku in America in general is vastly misunderstood and each of the verses in this volume show it. Some have three lines, some do not, some have kigo, some do not. By the looks of this, one can deduce that these ""poets"" gleamed their knowledge of haiku from Kerouac (another haiku fraud) rather than Basho. This is just an experiment really, conducted by a circle of friends who jotted down their thoughts and sent them to one another. Please, please avoid this title if you really care about or want to learn about haiku. Amazon should allow ""0"" stars when rating items such as this!"
0,"poorly written nonsense The author apparently has some theory relating to unexplained phenomena, but you'll never figure out what it is from reading this book.

Of course there's no support for the claims.Don't waste your time on this book."

0,"Bogus...bunk...B-A-loney I enjoy reading about ""unexplained phenomena"". I really do. I love ""real"" ghost stories and the like. However, I prefer an author to take a very scientific stance, exhausting all possibilities. Keel does not. He's a ""true believer"" and that's the problem.Somewhere in the book he supposes that this mysterious Mothman could have been a man on a hang-glider. ""Wow,"" I thought. ""That could almost be construed as logical."" However, he IMMEDIATELY debunks that theory with a statement to this affect: ""But hang-gliders were not very well known at that time.""*shaking my head*Whatever...the man needed to become familiar with Occam's Razor."
0,"SHAME ON YOU MR. KEEL !!! Let me just start by saying that the "" MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole.

0,"Boring & Unbelievable Story Normally, I prefer books to movies, but Mothman Prophecies was not only boring, but unbelievable. Non-fiction! The story was a product of the author's imagination. Perhaps in 1975, when the novel was first copywritten, it was spectacular. To those who are thinking of purchasing this book, (especially after viewing the movie) I'd say pass it up, and purchase the VHS or DVD."

Holy mackeral. i've never seen such bad writing. Someone else mentioned incoherent, tell me about it! This was all over the place. I had absolutely no clue was was going on in this book.

I bought this book to delve further after seeing the movie, and ended up more confused. Go to the movie--forget the book!"

0,"Broke in less then a month I bought this tent on 6/6/2005 for my 10 month old boy and used it once at the pool the rest of the time it sat in my dining room. I went to bed one night and it was up, but the next morning it was halfway down. When I went to see what was wrong I saw that one of the rods had snapped off in the metal holder and cannot be fixed. This could actually suffocate a baby if noone was in the room or the baby could hurt themselves if they found the broken rod. I was very disappointed because the size is great. I also agree with the other reviews it is hard to put together because the rods are so tight you have to have alot of strenth to get it set up. Please don't buy this we are going to return but it's such a hassle to spend 39.99 plus tax on something and it breaks in less then a month."
0,"Where was the editor? Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy.Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues)."
0,"Beware of packaging Sorry I know this is supposed to be a review of the item, but I want my complaint heard by anyone that might buy it. The hat itself is great, if you buy it at the store. New Era hats have large bills and a tall crown, but as long as you don't have a tiny head it will look fine. My complaint was that they shipped me this hat in a dvd box. Seriously. The hat was completely flattened, leaving two huge creases on either side of the logo. Ruined hat if you ask me, and will be returning immediately. You're probably better off buy this item in a hat store and spend the extra few dollars, at least they will have treated it right up to that point."

0,"Repetitive and monotone I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly."
0,"Disappointing I had hoped to read a colorful story about life in the Caribbean, and was not expecting the story to be happy and uplifting. However, I was disappointed to discover that the most prevalent topics in the book were the character's bodily smells, excretions, and sex life.

0,"Worst book I've ever read This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality.

0,"Puzzling After all the hype, and comparison to Camus' ""The Stranger"", I suppose my expectations were high for this book. I found ""Autobiography of my Mother"" completely benign. In some parts, pointless. Unlike Camus' protagonist in ""The Stranger"", Xuela's world-view is too fully revealed to be cleverly wrought and too self-perpetuating to cause empathy with the reader. A self-pitying character, Xuela is hard to empathize with because she decries her father and the white ""conquerers"" for exploiting people and destroying the aboriginal population's culture; yet, Xuela also takes advantage of many -- emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, Xuela just comes across as bitter and codependent and the reader is not compelled to sympathize with her situation. I also found nothing sensual about the book -- the author's placement of masturbation description seemed to come out of nowhere and appears simply awkward. Overally, the book does not deliver compared to the hype"
0,The autobiography of my mother It's not a book I'll ever read again. It was very boring. Glad I didn't pay that much. I give it a star.
0,"Pseudo-nihilistic garbage. A waste of paper and ink. What's the point here? It was never fully explicated, and the narrator does not inspire enough interest to carry this woefully inadequate plot - and I use that word loosely. Jamaica Kincaid needs to go back to domestic work"
0,"Do I have to give it a star? Even that single star is more than this book is worth. My Engligh professor assigned this book to me during my sophomore year of college (along with Nectar in a Sieve, a far better, though not terrific book), and what little I remember of it was that it was just awful (and offal). Her writing is repetitive and choppy, perhaps descriptive but disgustingly so. Do we really need to know the ""wetness between [her] legs"", or that she cooked her menstrual fluid into some poor soul's dinner? I couldn't stand the book. If you want quality, read something by Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King (his descriptions of a girl coming of age in Carrie are much better than this book). Drop the book, throw it, burn it, whatever. It's just not worth reading. How many trees did we lose to its production (and, more importantly, how many talented young writers were rejected because this woman was published). It's just a book not worth reading about a story not worth telling."
0,"Don't buy this book Jean Giorno assigned rights to this story to the public domain. Unscrupulous, evil American publishers are acting contrary to the author's intent and prostituting this work by cracking down on English language versions (including online versions), even new translations from the French. Don't give your money to greed heads who are 180 degrees in conflict with the principles of this book."
0,"Reading an RFC is more fun and more informative too! The editor and publisher of this book should be ashamed. It is an extended rant by the author that has no business being bound in hard cover. The Pine Mountain Group recommends excerps from this book to get up to speed with SNMP. I wonder who at PMG is friends with the author. This book will teach only members of the ""network management community"" anything. Anyone seeking entry into the network management community will need to find another door. By reading no more than 20 to 40 pages a day I managed to go through the entire book but I am afraid that I did not add anything to my understanding of SNMP that was not already there from studying for my MCSE. This book was a profound disappointment. It is at once dense, superficial, earnest, and sarcastic. The shame of it is that this author could educate profoundly if a good editor enforced some discipline or a co-author came in to help with communicating with those who are not the author's peers."
0,"Not just disappointed, angered. It's hard to believe that this book was released by a major publisher. It is rife with misspellings and grammatical errors. The thin index is almost useless, as a close examination reveals it to be mostly a list of the author's friends and their nicknames."

0,"It's Garbage. Koontz can write. But he sucks as a story teller. Books are supposed to have a COMPLETE story in them, no? Well this one has no ending. No end at all. These 2 detectives are clued in to the fact that Dr Frankenstein exists, and is creating his ""perfect race"" to some day kill off all humans. That's it. You meet the original, now educated and ""at one with the universe"" Frankenstein's monster, you meet the main characters, and they have some conflict. That's the whole ""story"" in this book, which it really isn't because the basic elements of a story are a beginning, middle, and end."
0,"Don't bother Definition of a bad book: a book that doesn't make you want to get to the next chapter. I kept trying to see if this would eventually grab me, but after maybe 10 chapters or so of plodding prose, I gave up. Thank goodness it was a library book."

0,"Nirvana is awesome; but home demos of great songs played with terrible quality and instruments isn't Although it does not mention it that the songs on the CD are demos in track listing, almost single song on this CD is cheap home made demos with terrible sound quality, with the exception of a few acoustic and live performances. If you want to buy Nirvana's greatest hits and enjoy the studio quality sounds and recordings of the ones of the best bands in alt rock history, this is not your album and do not be tricked like I was."
0,"Completely Useless I don't quite understand why Courtney is allowed to put these things out, and even more surprised that the other members agreed to it (since they have to). Everyone who already put out the 50 bucks for the box gets a whole three song bonus, songs which don't even sound like anything special. Nirvana was an awesome band who made some of the greatest music of all time, and this CD does reflect that. It's a good CD, but it's useless. It's nothing we don't already have. If they're going to put more Nirvana stuff out, it should at least be stuff we haven't heard. Just buy the three songs off of iTunes or something and save yourself the money from buying this CD."
0,"Tasteless Trash If I could give this half of a star I would. I am a big fan of Nirvana, but this was a total disappointment to me. The tracks sounded awful. I felt like I was ripped off in every sense of the way. I took it to a buy-trade-sell place and not even they would offer me anything for it, which shows you the poor quality of this album. A word of advice; DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
0,"$ Scam The songs on Sliver are easily some of the best of the box but the completely ignored some of the best, also. Its said for me to watch the ""Nirvana Corp."" aka Courtney Love to do something like this. Ultimately, if you don't realize that this is a shtik for $ then you must be confused. Nirvana released a best of cd and then a best of the box? Im just guessing but i think this is what the record company was saying:""We'll throw a couple new songs on it and we'll get some true fans to buy it just to have it.""It's been released for the cash. And this is something I know Kurt wouldnt have approved of. Hopefully someone takes this into consideration before buying it. yea,its good for the collection but its sad to see this is happening. I bought it for the cover art and stuff just to have for the collection nothing more. If your looking for some music get the actual box set."

Take everything you liked about ""Friday"", ""Booty Call"" and ""CB4"", leave them out of this movie and this is what you get. 90 minutes of [stuff]. It is low budget beyond low budget, and you get a headache from listing to fake, incoherent characters who look like they were picked off the street of some ghetto. And those who like to see booty-there is basically none, just one scene which lasts about 15 seconds and features a silent, unattractive ""dancer"".. If you are a fan of these movies, rent it first, you'll see. If you buy it, you will find a movie devoid of beautifull black women and good looking guys, but which is filled with stupid humor and a story which will put you to sleep."

0,"Poor support from Plasplugs About four weeks ago, I purchased at a Home Depot in Florida the Plasplugs ""Master Tiler"", model number: DWW180US-BX.I am using it for a porcelain tile installation. The original blade worked ok for the initial cuts, but I need to replace it for the proper blade type for the tile. I had bought a porcelain tile replacement blade from a blade mfr when I bought the saw. When I got around to replacing the blade, I found out that the Plasplugs machine uses a different ""arbor"" than everybody else. The replacement blade was worthless to me.I then called the Plasplugs US office to order the ""high glaze"" blade. Much to my chagrin, I was told the ""all blades except the standard have been discontinued"".I just bought this saw four weeks ago! I think it is very irresponsible for a manufacturer to behave in this matter.You can be assured that I will avoid any Plasplug product in the future."
0,"Not very good I cannot recommend this tool. When I first used it, I couldn't cut the tile. I then noticed the blade was spinning backwards! When I turned the saw off, and then on again, the blade didn't spin at all. Finally, I realized that I had to ""spin"" the blade manually as I switched on the saw to get it to turn correctly. Not what I expected from a $[$$$] tool. Once I finally got it working, I was still disappointed with the performance. Cutting was very slow, and not very accurate. ..."
0,"Very poor This is a very good concept, but poorly executed. On my particular saw, the tilt section of the table didn't fit flush, so it made the right side of the table useless. Once raised to the 45 degree position, the tilt section was wobbly, as one of the flimsy plastic props did not even touch its rest. The blade ran neither true nor parallel to the fence. The blade retaining nut had to be tightened about every 10 cuts. The blade actually flew off the shaft a couple of times. The tile caught on the plastic end caps of the fence, which stick out. I could easily stall the motor with ordinary 1/4 inch ceramic tile. Can't remember all the other thigs wrong with it, I was in too much of a hurry to return it."
0,"Buy Something Else! The first tile I cut... I knew I had purchased the wrong saw. Maybe to use the rip fence it would work ok, but to cut tile freehand, it was useless. The blade comes up through the table, like a table saw, with the blade spinning through 1 inch of water in the bottom of the tank. The blade picks up the water and sprays it all over the inside of the clear guard over the blade. This makes it impossible to see any lines marked on the tile. It is impossible to make an accurate cut if you can't see your cut lines. Using the saw without the guard is not an option, unless you are working outside, and don't mind getting drenched. Bad design. I'm returning it and spending the extra money to get something good."
0,"PlasPlug Master Tile Cutter Bought at Home Depot for $199. It is a toy, not suitable for serious work. Flimsy contruction, difficult or impossible to adjust. Recommend getting a brand name."
0,"spend the additional money and get an MK My main complaint is the fence, getting both sides square to the blade and locked down will take you about five minute's and even then don't put to much pressure on the fence as it will ether bow or one side will move. An MK is much faster put the tile on the carriage push the tile to the blade make sure the kurf is going to be on the correct side of your mark slide the carriage back set the fence (if you'd like) turn the saw on and cut. I renovate older home and many times the walls are out of square so your cut tiles are going to be getting bigger or smaller as you go God help you if you get into this position with the Plasplugs tile saw...."

0,"Expensive experiment that didn't work I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well, this is pretty convenient, just swipe. But it did nothing for me. I wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts. However, my skin remained the same. And while it doesn't really have a scent, there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because I have quite a sensitive nose. I switched to using them on my back and got the same result, which was nothing. So it was an expensive experiment that didn't work. It may work for someone else but it did nothing for me. Most disappointing. I have since switched to the salicylic gel peel, which hurts a whole lot more, but gets the job done."
0,"Horrible product, wish I could give it negative stars.... This is just a horrible product. If you want to waste $72 on a product that will ruin your skin, look no further.

If you want to have to deal with a company that just doesn't care about anything except for making a quick buck, buy from MD Skincare."

0,"Unbelievable! I am amazed at the high ratings this book received. It was, undoubtedly, the worst book I have ever read. It might have been better with good editing. There were many unimportant characters and many horrible descriptions that could have been omitted. Who really cares about the dogs, many of whom have no relevance to the story. Who really cares about the detailed description of the decor of a room. Yes, I did finish the book that, by the way, had no ending. Toward the middle of the book I actually started editing it.

Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on ""Tess.."""
0,"The book was boring, because of its victorian ideals. Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards."
0,Disappointing I was really disappointed in this book and surprised that so many people think it is a wonderful story. It was such a depressing story and reflects all of the worst things about the way women were treated in that time. I don't think this story had any redeeming qualities and very few likeable characters (even Tess was quite irritating at times with her pride getting in the way of asking for help to make her life a little easier).
0,Buyer Beware This was a VERY used paperback of Tess sold as new with library stickers on the binding as well as the front cover. Amazon is definitely not trustworthy anymore.

My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction.

0,"A waste of paper. This book is one of many written during the ""Bubble Era"" by ""gaijin"" (primarily Americans) who really knew next to nothing about Japan, yet somehow found a publisher, usually Japanese. Another of this quickie genre published about the same time was a book for teaching profanity to Japanese studying English.""Learning to Bow"" may by an accurate account of the author's experience living in Japan and teaching in the JET program. However, that's all it is. It's full of cliches, sweeping generalizations, and offers no insight into living in Japan or understanding the culture. What could the writer possibly know after only two years?"
0,Upsetting I may not a good reviewer because I stopped reading at page 50 but I believe this is not at all a good book to read if you want to learn about Japanese culture. As a Japanese born and raised in Japan I find this book extremely humiliating.
0,"Sarcasm and fabrications I was very disappointed in this book. I have lived in Japan for 6 years (and still do), married and taught on the JET Programme. As a former JET I was disheartened as this book does not paint an accurate picture of life in Japan as a JET. Granted people's experiences differ from prefecture to prefecture and from school to school, but Learning to Bow's anecdotes and observations about Japan are far too extreme and at times border on lies. Also the frequent use of sarcasm and satire is not in anyway humorous and portrays the author as ""god's gift to English teaching"". For anyone curious about life on the JET Programme, teaching English in Japan or life in Japan in general, I do not recommend this book."
0,"Highly overrated It is extremely meandering and never seems to end. It's all about atmosphere and erotic cool and Prague, etc., but at some point a car chase would really liven things up.

0,"the ubearable pain to watch This movie is the lamest peice of pseudo-intellectual crap I have ever seen. It is painfully self-serious and a major bore.

0,"Is This A Movie? I didn't too sure about this. It was on special movie channel so I gave it a listen. All that happened were people in not many clothes (was the movie at the Beach??) looking sad most times. Also there was a hat. While I watched all I kept thinking was about other things like drinking water that were more exciting. I notice near the ending that the man in the movie was the angry man from the gangrene movie - I almost lost him because he was so different! In the other movie he was mean; here he was just bored or looked like he was looking at something very far aways. He didn't talk much but was a doctor so I guess he is smart. There is a car crash in the snow near the end, but I don't think that was a learning part. The movie is like watching the home films from vacations when you are at boring cousin house, or shows on the public channels. Drink water for more fun - or watch with pillows!!! One sleepy star this time! (wait: there are pretty girls in here, so be careful watching!)"
0,"Please read Kundera's book instead Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera's book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera's novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: ""The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential."""
0,"One Great Big Sleeper I am sorry, but I just can't agree with the reviewers who praise this piece of work. It was so boring that I had it running while I did other things around the house (that was after I actually watched the first 80 minutes). I guess I just don't relate to guys who are constantly ""bedding"" every girl that walks past them. Where is the art? The depth? The complexity? Sorry, it was lost on me. I totally agree with the reviewer who said it was about two sad-looking people. I mean the guys is a heel. What happened to being faithfull. Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially. Where is the depth? Lewis is a fine actor, but the material is not the most exciting or throught-provoking. There, I've shot my wad and now I am gonna list the movie for sale for someone who can appreciate it more than me. Bye."
0,"Either you get or you don't..I didn't. This is written by a 43 year old male who is a true film fanatic. I love all the great directors- Spielberg, Hitchcock, Wilder, Kubrick, Landis, Scorsese, etc. etc.""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" was one, if not the most tedious films, I have ever had to endure. Why is it so talked about is beyond me unless, there is nothing definable to discuss. The scenery was bland, dialogue uninteresting and unengaging, even the shots were dull.It's the first film I ever returned to Amazon...ever.When I took Cinema History in College, the Professors I had kept talking about this film as a ""must see/ will change your life"" sort of thing. Curious, as we never saw it in class (must have been the explicit erotic nature it has at times). Now I think they wanted the girls in the class to see it on their own, because they may have wanted to discuss it with them personally after the class was dismissed, if you catch my drift.I would pass on this one-big time."
0,Lacking The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology.
0,"So If I'm A Jerk Do I Get To Live In Perpetuity, Too? Okay, folks. Let's get real. This movie/book is essentially about the insipid sexuality of three spoiled brats with soulful eyes, zero body fat, and no moral compasses. Worst of all, there's no search for the compasses. Why is this exhibition of unbridled existential selfishness so popular? Because the protagonists are European-and ""misunderstood"" quasi-intellectuals to boot. Translation: culturally paranoid Yanks just eat this kind of lean cuisine right up. If you're the type who likes being hungry 15 minutes after eating, don't miss this movie or ""The Sheltering Sky,"" mind-numbing fare featuring filthy rich American ""seekers"" ransacking the blistering desert (or desert tray) for spiritual bargains that won't make them too heavy with self knowledge."
0,"Repeated book material & out of place reviews Man Kzin Wars IX has four stories. The lead story by Poul Anderson is OLD, a repeat from another in the series. However, neither the Amazon entry nor the book itself make note of this; the publisher's dishonesty here is a real shame. The other three stories vary in quality, but at least two are good enough for this to be worthwhile in paperback next year.The one star rating reflects my poor opinion of repeated material with no warning. It probably would rate 3 stars otherwise. BTW, I am an old Niven fan, have read all his SF multiple times, and have read all of the Man-Kzin series.Amazon's automated machinery, or a hurried employee, has mixed in a bunch of reviews here that apply to other books in the series. It's too bad, but I've seem them mix up numbered series before. (See World Radio TV Handbook which is an annual series; they were selling the 2000 edition at a small discount to those who bought the 2002 edition!)"
0,For Simple Minds I bought this book because of the reviews and am shocked at how one can become an author by simply stealing life experiences and stories from other peoples lives.

0,"Shallow I found Dharma Bums suprising. I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better."

0,"Wait for Special Edition I made the mistake of buying this version. But luckily I didn't open it once I got home, so I was able to return it today. I'm not going to fall for the same money trap again(Avatar). I'll just wait a few months and get the Special Edition one with all the extra features.Now me just ranting here for a bit. But what the hell Paramount, I know times are tough for everyone but do you have to do this to us. Trying to rip off the loyal customers is not good business."

0,you pay less at the theater Its just thye movie with no special features.I made the mistake of buying it. Had i known i would have never bought it. Avoid wait till the special features come out.
0,"If you're 16+ don't bother These transformer movies are horrible. The special effects are the only good thing about these movies. The actors, especially the main actor have drab storylines, stupid dialogue, and the transformer voices are poor. Unless you're a kid, this movie is not for you."
0,"no speacial features This is a good movie. Just stay away from this version. I was excited and bought it on release day only to find out that it is just the feature film. I was really disappointed. I would never have purchased this movie if I had known that it was the feature only. Yes, I know, in my excitement to get the movie, it was my own fault for not looking carefully at the back of the box, although, nowhere could I find that it says feature film only. I used to download movies illegally. I stopped and started buying them legit again because the special features are really enjoyable. When the companies charge full price for the feature only (which i can get from netflix anyway), I feel cheated. Maybe everyone should start downloading illegally and really send hollywood or whoever a message that if they want our hard earned money they need to work a little harder for it. This is just my rant."
0,DONT BUYYYYYYYYYY!!! Dont give money to these filmakers that later on down the road release a better version of the same movie..If you want extra features this version WILL NOT have it on the disc!! Wait for the deluxe version!
0,"Not even rental worthy Ok so I heard that this was better than the last Transformers (didn't see that one), so I thought it must be ok. It's got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, not sure why Shia LaBeouf is an actor...think Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, but without the charisma. If you are into cartoons,explosions and superficial story telling then it might be palatable for you....otherwise you'd be better off watching the grass grow."
0,Love 3D hate the Price. who is on crack that they think any movie is worth 42 dollars 3D or not. This is just another scam like with cell companies and internet providers charging for data like there is some limited amount that isnt self imposed. The technology is not so overwhelming in RD to cost 4 times that of dvd and twice that of blu ray.Dont get me wrong love 3D and this was one of the best 3D movies I have seen but honestly 42 dollars just is taking advantage of consumers in a market that has no where else to go. If this disk was 30 bucks Id by it hesitantly but thats the problem with blu ray they charge way to much for the theatre experience. Sad too cause this movie and captain america are ones i would have bought but i refuse to let them think this is a good going price for the gimmick.
0,sucks i just got one word this movie blows one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time the first part of the movie put my wife to sleep. any body who reads this it is not even take the time our the money to by this movie
0,"Not really a good movie This film is like a teenager with short attention span. Storytelling is like facebooking.Too many plots to cover, horrible pacing, no depth."
0,"AVOID at all costs!!! If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. They are doing the same thing as Avatar. This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features. Not so much as a trailer. They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd. ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time. Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned. And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a ""movie only"" release."

0,"Even Amazon Prime can't Save Optimus Prime this time Ugh! What a steaming pile of predictability this movie was. At least I didn't pay to see it and was able to read a software tech manual while ""watching"" this. The plot is thinner than the paper it was written on and the acting, well its typical Michael Bay which means you can see more believable productions at you local high school. It was easily an hour too long and the special effect have been used hundreds before. I think the saddest part was hearing Lenard Nimoy as Optimus Sentimental, I mean Sentinel. Gratuitous sci-fi pandering at it's lowest."
0,"Be careful when searching for ""3-D movies"" I used the search window using ""3-d movies"" as the criteria and this movie popped up along with dozens of other 3-d movies, but when I received it, I realized I had not read the description close enough to see that this movie was NOT 3-d. Amazon-please don't place 2-d movies selections in with the 3-d ones! I had to pay $2.98 to return an item that shouldn't have been offered in a search of 3-d movie selections. Ouch. All in all I love Amazon, but I'll be more careful in the future. My bad."

0,"Bleh It takes more than special effects to make a movie. The first film was good, the 2nd one mostly decent, but this was unadulterated, predictable, garbage, full of bad acting eye candy. The heroine of this tale couldn't find a coherent sentence with a conjunctive map. Should have stuck with Megan Fox. At least she had some real attitude."
0,"1 was a sin, 2 was an atrocity, 3 lacks a word to describe its awfulness When I saw a review giving this movie 0 out of 5 (the 3rd time this respected source has ever done so), I should have listened. If 2 had plot holes, 3 has plot chasms. There is no story. A few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film (plot, charisma, fan service). Michael Bay really needs to stop raping people's childhoods (a la South Park George Lucas style).Go watch the '86 animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is The Dark Side of the Moon (and I'm not talking Pink Floyd)."
0,"Kiddie Fodder... Crap, crap, crap. Bad acting, big explosions, and video game CGI a good movie does not make. Like a 2 hour Hasbro toy commercial. This film made Star Wars Episode 1 with Jar Jar Binks seem like an Academy Award worthy film. And I'm a Superhero/Godzilla/Monster geek...this is just awful...terrible. At least the first one was semi-watchable--and where's Megan Fox? That would have been the only redeeming quality in this junk-fest...I mean alien robots who change into cars and trucks??? It's a movie based on a TOY for God's sake! A bad toy made into an even worse film. Avoid like The Plague."
0,Movie is horrible... Bad acting and a cheap love story make this one of the worst Transformers movie to date. I wish the Transformers movies would focus more on the actual transformers of the movie instead of a bad love story. I remember Transformers the animated movie was all about the transformers and didn't try to focus too much on the humans and their problems. The fight with Megatron was epic and Unicron was an amazing villain. And the rivalry between Skyscream and Megatron made for an interesting plots on the decepticon side. The exploration and fights on the distant planets was fun and exciting. My suggestion to make this movie great instead of bad or mediocre is to fire all the bad actors and do a movie strictly about the transformers and their backgrounds. Or simply remake the animated movie into an actual motion picture.
0,"epic fail very disappointing. The plot for sam was really lame, the woman they got for his fiance was the worst actress ive ever seen. pretty sure its because she is a model and doesnt know the first thing about acting. the movie was ok as an action movie but if you buy this expecting something on par with the first two movies you will be sadly disappointed."
0,Avoid.. Falsely advertised Very disappointed with this purchase. I bought this based on product details on Amazon which listed special features and extras - a major reason for my choice. There is only the movie on bluray and DVD. Please correct item details Amazon.
0,"Dear Mr. Bay, Please stop ruining the Transformers franchise I love to see the Transformers in movies but I will never get the time back that I spent watching this movie. Good actors in a crap movie do not make a good movie. Fantastic special effects do not make a good movie. A well written story and characters that you care about make a good movie."
0,"Redefinition of LAME I had low expectations and they still weren't met. My only satisfaction is that I didn't have to pay to see it on Amazon Instant Video but I'll never get my time back. Seriously, this movie has redefined LAME; bad acting, bad editing, bad script. If it weren't for the two little fuzzbots, it would have been a total loss. The ""stars"" who did this film must have had a bad round of luck in Vegas and desparately needed the money. Don't waste 2.5 hours of your life on this, especially when there is so much other less crappy stuff to watch!"
0,"Please, if this is the way this franchise is going... STOP! This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see. I found it to be a total waste of my time. Unless you are a devoted Transformers Fan that must see or have all things Transformers stay away from this movie."
0,"instant video is mislabeling it's movies as 3d I did a search for 3d movies on Amazon instant video and this movie came up, but when I purchased it I was disapointed to see that it wasn't 3d. I am writing this review without watching more than 5 minutes of the movie so it's not that the movie is bad. Amazon needs to re-label their 3d movie selection."
0,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon This is a disappointing film. The first two films managed to include a story with the special effects. This one didn't really bother. Mind numbing, and in a bad way."
0,"Another 'video game' type of movie, Whyyy? Lots of loud noise and quick movements. Just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy. Please...for the love of God, do not make another sequel. This movie really sucked!"
0,Not 3D THis company advertised this as a 3D movie. When I received it it was only a Blu-ray. They told me I would have to ship it back to them to prove it. I was very upset and they are horribel to work with.
0,"Ugh! The nicest thing I can say about this movie is it is really bad. There's talent to burn in the cast but they should have burned the script instead. The script is so terrible it makes ""Never Too Young To Die"" look Oscar-worthy. Rosie Huntington is like a blonded Megan Fox but without the charm or gravitas (which Ms. Fox isn't exactly awash in either so you can tell how wooden her replacement is). The movie is actually painful to watch for teh first 2/3 but at least some of the action scenes in the final third are cool enough to make it not a total loss."
0,"Bad movie? You're soaking in it Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague."
0,"Ouch In a word- horrible. I am a HUGE fan of the first two. Watched the cartoons as a kid, and i really couldn't wait to see this movie. It was horrible. Rambling, incoherent, and unfocused. I missed Megan Fox every minute that pouty, big-lipped female was talking, and fell asleep after 20 minutes."
0,"Yes, but no cigar Why did I buy this thing? Well, I saw a preview and it was great. Make no mistakes, is a good movie if you like machines beating up humans without the humans being make into jelly.The opening was the best in the world. If they had only kept it that way... But no. It desintegrated into pieces. The FXs were fabulous, but you can't make a whole movie out of that.Sorry fans. I was disappointed, but then I'm not a kid anymore, so that's probably the reason."
0,Horrible Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.
0,"Not a good movie at all...stinks!!! Well the critics got this one right; Michael Bay was a good director until he got big and lost his perspective. Dirty old man syndrome? Yes, what a joke. I was looking forward to intelligent Sci-Fi and got crap. The reference to Obama in an unreal world was stupid (I came to get away from real world politics). The treatment of the woman in the movie was degrading (glad the other actress bowed out...what a tear down}. It was a shame that the very good actors that came back to do this film had to deal with a totally self-involved director. The animation was excellent but the story was trash. I am soo sorry I spent any money on this film."

No rabbit holes running deep here, just peoples pockets that are succorred into buying the bare-boned Optimus...I hope this truly helps you out, seriously.."
0,"Don't buy this movie I am glad I watched someone else's movie before I spent money on this lousy thing. I will always be on my do not buy list. Rose what's her name is not worth seeing in the movie. It would have been better without her all together. And she didn't hold a candle to Megan Fox. I did like the FIRST TWO movies but this one is a total waste. Boring from the word go other than some things about Kennedy and the early space program. It would have been better as a cartoon. If they come out with another one, I will not be spending any money on it. This one was so boring during the middle of it I about fell asleep.I would not waste the money on it, just borrow someone else's movie and save your money for a good movie.Oh and I might give it a 2.5/10 but since this is on a 5 scale it only gets a 1 and I would have given the other 2 movies a 4/5."
0,"The movie itself is ok, the streaming for it was crap. The movie wouldn't play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn't fast enough to play the movie.My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon's customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.This is the first time I've had problems streaming with Amazon, but it was awful. Every 10-15, the movie would stop and pop up the error message. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck."
0,Not a good movie. Not for children. Not recommended for children and not even teenagers.Poor story.Nothing new or interesting.I was expecting something better.Dissapointed.
0,"garbage Man, I wanted to like this movie. I'm a big sci-fi fan. I do not think revenge of the fallen was as bad as people say it was, I even enjoyed the first transformers, but this. Oh-my-gosh. What a piece of garbage. I rate this down there with Avatar (the movie version of the nickelodeon cartoon, also a fan, huge let down).I am very forgiving of sci fi movies as I do not expect much in the way of plot/story line. I am a big fan of cool special effects, but this was so corny, cliche and chock full of redone and rewritten old jokes and plagarized scenes, that even I could not take this. I am becoming angry even now, while writing this.20$ for this piece of copro-cinematic excrement is $19.50 too much!!!!"
0,"No Special Features First, the movie has incredible special effects, but the script and acting are horrible. However, the real problem with this package is that the disc does not have any special features!"
0,"Terrible movie with good special effects The plot was terrible. The acting was terrible. The effects were as good as the other ones. If you want to see pure action without any story, then enjoy. Otherwise...it was a complete waste of time."
0,Digital Copy Doesn't Work Bought this after the Digital Copy expiration date had elapsed. Nothing on the Amazon site indicates the expiration date. The package has this warning on both the outside and inside. Amazon offered a full refund. That's a stand up company in my opinion.
0,"garbage Transformers the Movie (1985) was awesome. But these Transformers look like a pile of garbage throw together. The CGI animation makes everything look like synthetic barf. The Transformers movies need a reboot, where the characters actually look like they are supposed to. And without the worlds worst director Michael Bay. Disgusting. Don't let your kids watch this atrocity."

0,"I Am A Fool For Having Suffered Through This Dreck Two dimensional characters, dropped plot-points, flat dialogue, bad acting and an overall story that makes a 1962 comic book look Shakespearean. Michael Bay you ruin everything you touch. And I'm worse for having seen this."
0,"Wort. Movie. Ever. Transformers 3 is seriously a terrible terrible movie. yeah wow cool, special effects that i have seen time and time again, ridiculously long battle scenes that are so incredibly boring they literally make me fall asleep EVERY time i watch them, Terrible story, terrible plot, terrible rendition of classic characters. Why I even gave this movie a third chance is beyond me."
0,"no 3D version I`ll make it short and come to the point quickly: I think its a shame that Bay is starting milking the cow too by NOT putting the 3D version in this set. Pirates 4, Thor, Tron and so many others included a 3D version. I won`t buy this release and wait (let`s see for how long) for the 3D release. I know many of you hate 3D - I love it on my 65"" panasonic and was soooo looking forward for this. just my personal opinion..."
0,"Makes a great drinking game! Here are the rules: 1) Every time a character says or does something that's supposed to be funny but comes off completely lame instead-take a swig. 2) Every time the movie veers off into some completely random direction that has absolutely nothing what-so-ever to do with anything, take a swig. 3) Every time a transformer does a somersault or twist in the air in slow motion before attacking-take a swig. Follow these simple rules and you'll be bombed 15 minutes in. Seriously. While watching this movie I kept thinking how many millions of dollars were spent to provide us with idiotic jokes about red coffee cups in yellow rooms and effeminate assistants with Russian accents. Every time I see one of these movies, it saddens me. Given the insane visuals-tight, more serious stories could have really made this series into something amazing. Unfortunately that's not the case. At least there's no leg humping in this one. That's something I guess..."
0,"Fun movie, but not worth buying at this price--my bad! if you are like me and like to go through specials features and ""making of"" documentary, this is not the BD to buy. This is the second time I make the same mistake. The first time I bough Avatar BD when it came out, and it only had the movie nothing else. It is a waste of BD room space to make such releases without having a single special feature. Wait for the Special Edition, full feature, BD release! The movie was fun, but this BD should have been price at $10.00 USD which is the price one pays these day to see just a movie. I will have to wait for the Special Edition, and give my copy to my young daughter who lives with her mom. As I said, the movie is fun, but not the price of this BD, and this will be the last time I make this mistake. I need to be more patient and not fill these mogul movie makers' pocket with our HARD earned MONEY. What do you think? Any opinions?"
0,"Terrible This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart."
0,"Yawn 30 minutes into it and I'm bored out of my mind. Woe is me ""hero"", terrible acting, yes it's an action movie, so let's see some action, don't try to wow me with dialog. If you're looking for something to grab your attention, this isn't it. Thankfully I didn't have to pay for the movie."
0,cool robots bad acting sloppy story The Decepticons play the Autobots like a used violin and demostrate Cybertron's AI still has a long way to go.

The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth, it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark."

0,"Laughably stupid I gave this movie 1 star for only one reason Kelly Carlson is beautiful,other than that the movie goes as follows,marine gets dishonorably discharged and seems to be ok with it,wife gets kidnaped,he gets beat up,knocked out several times,gets burned,blown up,by the most overdone explosions and walks away without a scratch,this movie is pure hollywood,it was a waste of money and time,you really have to wonder if the producers ever spent any time in the military,I have never met a marine worth his salt that had to go telling everyone (Im a marine), every soldier I have ever known that talks like that was always in some bar fight or some other altercation with someone,It was a laughably stupid movie"
0,"One of the worst movies ever Hey Im open to wrestlers acting in movies. The Rock is doing it, Hogan did it for a bit. I did enjoy wwe's other movies but this...this was just plain bad. Cena has to be one of the worst actors to ever get a starring role in a movie released in theaters. Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back. WWE could have easily found someone better. Skip this movie. In fact do someone a favor, buy the dvd and destroy it so no one would have to witness this horrible movie. I would give it a 0 if I could. Nothing about this movie is good"

0,"Typical action film with strange attempt at humor This is a typical action film with lots of fight scenes and gun fights but little logic. It's amazing that hundreds of bullets can be fired at point blank range with no one getting hit and people getting hit in the face with fire extinguishers, pieces of wood and other objects without so much as a scratch. And then there are people surviving incredible explosions, again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably. They were not only not funny but were very wierd to me.I enjoy watching John Cena in action, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was fun to watch, but this movie just didn't impress me anymore than wrestling does. I think one star out of five was being too generous."
0,"Ha-Ha-Ha... If the cover for this low-brow action piece wasn't a hint, then you're probably one of the producers target audience. One of the things I think hurts hollywood is its irrepressible desire to shove the American flag down our throats by making these ""patriotic"" movies. We have the American flag, Iraq, marines... and wrestling!!! I guess if cow-tipping is a hobby you enjoy as much as practicing a suplex, then this movie is for you.As for a review, it stank. If you see it on the shelf of your local video store, leave it there.If you're a hollywood producer, please stop making movies starring wrestling ""stars"". If your name is Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, John Cena (The Rock is OK) please stick to your day jobs."
0,"new answer to the question ""What the worst movie next to Missing in Action I""? This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre. That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie. WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best - wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle. Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life."
0,"Bad... ...really quite staggeringly, breathtakingly bad - unless you're particularly fond of big explosions, that is, in which case you'll absolutely love it. If you don't, prepare for a totally ridiculous tale woodenly acted without much conviction. Not even Robert Patrick's nasty chief villain can save this monumental turkey. It has but one good moment, when a minor baddie, seeing the chasing ex-Marine, says, ""He's like a Terminator"", and gets an annoyed glance from Patrick, who played the liquid metal Terminator in ""Terminator II""."

Was that supposed to be funny?Who wrote this anyway? He should be tried in a criminal court for waisting my money and my time.The acting was also some of the worst I've seen. I will never be able to watch Terminator 2 again.Oh, the explosions were impressive. Maybe if you took away everything but the explosions it wouldn't be too bad.Thanks.

0,"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE PRODUCT Do not believe any of the so-called good reviews! This product is nonsense and simply DOES NOT WORK. I was able to install it rather easily. However, the flashy sophisticated website is NEVER updated! The play list are NEVER available! I am very dissappointed in Sony. Great concept, good looking product as usual fom Sony. Typical lack of performance. My experience is 180 degrees from the good reviews and I don't believe they are real or honest."
0,"Not Needed -- Free Alterative This was bought for me as a gift, but it is completely unneccesary. It's simply a case of a company using widely available technology to make some money off of peoples' ignorance... If I hear a song that I wonder ""...hmm, what was that?"" I simply log on to the StarCD website and choose the radio station I was listening to and the time. It uses the same data that this device does. The only thing this device does is record times. If you think its worth spending the money for a keychain timestamp-thingermajig, go ahead. Ill just jot it on my hand with a pen. (I have no commercial or otherwise affiliation with StarCD, I'm just an impressed user.)"

0,"THE WORST THING EVER CREATED I'm sure you can see by now with everyone else's reviews that this product is garbage. Well, hey, if you pay close to nothing, don't expect anything much in return! Just save yourself the money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... instead, put some gas in your car or something!"
0,"Don't do it! It's still in beta... Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you, it's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws. Here's what the other reviews (written by Sony employees?) and the literature don't say:* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL; you have to not only use another browser, but also set that browser as the default.* When you plug the emarker into your computer, it ""automatically"" loads your marks into the site...or at least that's what it's supposed to do. On 3 browsers and 2 different computers, I haven't quite gotten this to happen.* Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers' inadequacies, they (over)designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either. Simple HTML would have been fine, guys....Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0....this is the first time I've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true..."
0,"worthless Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing, I should have read these reviews first. All the bad you hear about this little thing is true. I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in, so I dont even have one station to mark. The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to ""enable"" itself. Whats the difference though, cant do anything with it anyway. This is typical Sony. My advice, check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area. Believe me, they wont tell you it will not work in your area. It, however, is a neat idea. Needs lots of work."
0,rip off no place in the ad does it say the use of this depends on the radio stations in your area must belong to their service for this to work none in my area of south west florida seem to least of all my favorite stations and it seems that the music you listen too must be of the lastest out or there is no info on it or where you can buy it so yes i feel like i got ripped off ... thank you sony
0,"SLOW very very slow Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on. The only song information I could get was ""information unavaiable check back in 24 hours"". They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours. This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours. So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site. Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker."
0,"CAREFUL! SONY rips you off! I can tell you that I used to have a small smart device called the iTag from Xenote and that worked VERY well. Plus..........it was FREE!! I used to use it in the Bay Area and the selection of the radios was great, the Web site very easy to navigate on. I could even get my info in real time which was great. Unfortunately, this start-up, as many others, had to close doors for the lack of $.... Too bad that those guys at Sony have too much money but do not care enough about their customers to launch a decent product... After the PlayStation 2 fiasco launch, they keep going on...... :-("

0,"Does what it says, BUT. . . This product works exactly as advertised. Click the button and find out what the song is. The website isn't set up very well, and it's slow because of all the annoying flash stuff, but with broadband it's definitely usable.Unfortunately, it's only usable for the rest of September. Emarker.com is shutting down, and that makes the eMarker useless. Thus, the 1-star review.

0,"It only remembers the time, not the station. Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a [$] clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you"
0,"Terrible I bought this thing to get the names of songs on the New York spanish stations. I checked it, double checked it, called customer service, and STILL I got incorrect song information. Maybe its the radio stations fault, maybe its E-marker's fault, all I know is that it DOES NOT WORK."

0,"Don't buy this Junk Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk."
0,"Out of Business These eMarker guys are out of business, so not sure if this thing even works any longer."
0,"Ruined by neutering the artwork I adored these books growing up and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for changing exactly what made them classics. I would have forgotten about them years ago if it weren't for the haunting illustrations. I took them camping, to slumber parties, they were fantastic and terrifying: which was the whole point. To be scared.I have nothing against the new artist and his work in general, but this is not the place for it. To change what made a book a classic for it's 30th anniversary is insane. I can't imagine what they were thinking.If parents are afraid their kids can't handle these books in their original form, they have simply to not buy them books that are meant to be scary or maybe, you know, flip through the book before you hand it to your child. Which is a sad thing anyway, I've seen nothing good come of raising children in a nerfed world, but still.There is no excuse whatsoever to censor such an eerie, memorable, and nostalgic children's book."
0,"Not the Nightmare-fuel from my childhood Don't waste your time or money. Buck up and spend the extra for an original Stephen Gammell illustrated version. If you're buying it for a kid who may in fact be a total wiener, then by all means get this one. But then, why are you buying the little wiener horror stories?Stephen Gammell's version will help develop a child's hippocampus and exercise their innate terror response. This one is lame."
0,"These are not the Stephen Gammel illustrations!! I was extremely disappointed when I found out about a reprinting of Scary Stories with a new illustrator. Like many adults I grew up reading these books by myself and with friends. The best part of reading these stories was turning the page to see what sick illustration was next. They creeped you out and I know I am not alone when I say that as an adult, they still creep me out. That's what is so fun about them to this day. I lament that this generation of readers will read a version of Scary Stories with watered down illustrations because uptight and squeamish parents have tried to ban these books from libraries. I have the originals and I will keep them for posterity."
0,"A watered down version of the original I'm sure the editors at HarperCollins thought by changing the powerful (and controversial) imagery of this book, they'd sell more copies. Nothing like compromising art and expression to sell out.1/5 stars for this homogenized shadow of the original book."
0,"Worthless Edition. Without Stephen Gammell's artwork, these are pretty close to worthless.Why would they EVER replace the original, incredible artwork? The reality is, Harper Collins, that Stephen Gammell's artwork MADE these classics.The artwork now is unoriginal, not the least bit frightening (or artful), and does nothing to complement the stories.Huge mistake. Someone should be fired. At least five people should be fired... and blacklisted.This is an atrocity.Prospective buyers: go buy the other versions! Oh, that's right, they're extremely expensive. I wonder why, Harper Collins? You fools.And again for good measure: you fools."
0,"How Dare They... How dare they censor the original?? The Stephen Gammel illustrations were incredible! The art was what made these books great! The writing is still good, but the new drawings are just nowhere near as good as the old ones! Skip this one and buy the old version(s)!!"
0,"Missing what made the original versions great: The art! Alvin Schwartz's stories always played second fiddle to Stephen Gammell's art. Without it, this book is not worth anyone's time or money. Avoid it and seek the originals."
0,"Also displeased with the new art. As another child who was scarred by the terrifying art style in the original books, I was extremely excited to hear about the re-release of these classic stories. The books arrived today; lo and behold the original art has been replaced with bland, uninteresting art that would be better suited in an R.L. Stine novel.A wasted purchase..."
0,Artwork??? Did the National Socialists require censorship here or something? The new artwork isn't even scary... WTF You've ruined a classic. No one buy this BS.
0,"The art is a joke This isn't the original art for these books. They hired a cheap hack to make the illustrations ""less scary"". The original had a better artist and better illustration. Dont waste your time on this pussified version."
0,"Scary Stories that are no longer scary. The original books contained haunting, even downright frightening illustrations that still disturb me to this day. They made these stories scary. They were original, artistic, beautiful and downright horrifying, and have been replaced by bland, boring, and shamefully dull. If you want something that will scare you, find a copy of this book with the original artwork by Stephen Gammel."
0,"These are not the books you grew up with... Many of us remember being on a wait list at school or at our community libraries to borrow these horrifying gems. Yes, the stories themselves were spooky. Seeing some of our local folklore in print just added to the eerieness. The most important contributor to the scare-factor was the incredibly grotesque pieces of art that accompanied each story. This reprint features a new, popular artist; however, the illustrations don't have that same terror-inducing quality as before.For me, I think the reason is that there was a lot of mystery in Gammell's work, while Helquist's just doesn't leave anything to the imagination. In Gammell's work the picture is set up so that it is happening TO YOU. In Helquist's work, the perspective is such that you can see it happening to the characters. Just doesn't do it for me. You can google the images or check blogs to see for yourself."
0,"Do Not Buy This Edition Please do not buy this new edition of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The publishers have completely replaced the original dark, beautiful and terrifying artwork for pictures that are clean, kid friendly and safe. They have destroyed what made this collection truly special."
0,"This was just a mistake. Re-releasing this series with a new illustrator was a terrible idea and, frankly, completely missing the point of the originals. The stories themselves are a collection of sleepover tales and urban legends which, when taken alone, aren't particularly frightening. For those of us who enjoy this series, it was the original illustrations from the twisted mind of Stephen Gammell that made these ""Scary Stories"" truly scary; without them, the book is laughable. Helquist may be a talented enough artist, but he can't hope to duplicate the underlying terror of Gammell's illustrations."
0,"Bring back Gammell The artwork is the only thing anyone ever remembered from this series. Congratulations on putting out an edition that looks exactly like every other scary stories for kids book, instead of the ONE that literally everyone remembers from their childhood.Great way to commemorate the anniversary."
0,"""I Can Read"" book has better illustrations While the stories in the ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" book remain the same, the Stephen Gammell illustrations that haunted my imagination have been scrapped for more candy-coated pictures.How candy-coated? Upon searching for the other tales of horror by Alvin Schwartz, ""In A Dark, Dark Room"", which was written for Level 2 of the ""I Can Read!"" children's collection, I found those water-colored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the re-release of ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark."""
0,"Buy the original. I remember reading these books as a first grader. First Grade! I loved them at the age of 7, and I love them now at 26. Yes, there were some sleepless nights, but that didn't stop me from picking up the book the next day! As others have said, what really stays with you is the art. To have taken the beautifully terrifying artwork and watered it down because some parents don't want to deal with their child having nightmares is a crime against children's literature. One star for this edition. The original gets five.I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I've read that the new artwork is for the thirty year anniversary of these books. Happy Thirtieth Birthday to Schwartz and Gammell's masterpiece. For your present, you get your teeth removed."
0,"The description said Stephen Gammell as artist and it was not... I was very disappointed to discover that the copies, (I ordered the ""scary"" trilogy)while described as being illustrated by Stephen Gammell, were actually the updated versions with watered-down artwork by another artist. I am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork. This is the first time I've been disappointed with an order from Amazon, but it's a big one. You need to change your description to include the correct illustrator."
0,"Racism and Sex This would have been a very short book if all of the racism and sexuality were to be removed. I read it for an Appalachian Literature class, and I felt this book was so racey that I couldn't enjoy reading it. The vulgarity in it is also not necessary, and I feel that it should not be called literature because of this."

0,Scary I have always wanted to bellydance and got this as my first video. It was not at all what I had imagined and quite frankly scared me. Bellydancers were always something mysterious and beautiful and graceful. Atea is awkward to watch and comes off quite bizarre. Not anything to want to imitate and strive to be like.
0,"Frail White Women Wriggle About While the basic instruction is passable, the technique of most of the dancers, including the instructor, is mediocre to poor. What's truly terrifying is how frail and anorexic most of these women look. There's an unfortunate sort of L.A. starved-skinny bleached-blonde airheadedness to this production. Belly dance can be a powerful, grounded and grounding ethnic dance form; however this tape presents more of a ""wrap yourself in sequins and wriggle for your husband"" sort of vibe. Culturally divorced and ugly-American scary. Made me want to shave my head and get tattoos."
0,"Unreliable Since I have ordered for this product and inspite of the company debiting the total amount for the product from my account, I have not recieved the product till date. The company promises to deliver the product in 12 hrs but its approx more than 3 weeks since the amount was debited but till now, the product hasnt reached me. The company doesnt respond to email queries and its toll free number (the only other point of contact mentioned from their end other than email address) always sounds busy and goes to voicemail."
0,"Bill Nichols should not be allowed to write Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like ""situatedness,"" ""hyperrationality,"" ""reconceptualization,"" ""polyvocality,"" ""relationality,"" ""talismanic""(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: ""juxtaposition."" Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge. Don't buy ""Representing Reality"" unless you want to know how confused Mr. Nichols's reality is."

0,"Cheaply made boot Had these boots for a while. First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying. The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay haven't done that before, had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear, even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They don't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price!"
0,not good 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
0,Cheap Boots Oversize and they pinch my legs. I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad. Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots.
0,"VERY NARROW This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump,i don't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit,they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast"
0,"Horrible Don't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots. They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money. First off the boots had spots around the lower edge(where the boot and the rubber bottom meet) where there were huge holes where there was missing glue. Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house. They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on. They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards. The ""insole"" they put in the shoe is a joke at best. It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite. Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear."

0,"Not Quite A Piano Book I was looking for a piano songbook for childern to play on a piano. I should have realized it was not just the songbook from the price. It comes with an electronic toy piano. The songbook is play by numbers and this did nothing for somebody that is learning to play piano. Very disappointing. Age level is pre-school, before able to read."

I've been using this product for several years now, and I knew just by looking at this one that it wasn't right. The texture was incredibly thin, and the color was much lighter -- something that could only leave me to believe that maybe water had been added to it.Lesson learned -- spend the extra money -- you're paying for quality!"
0,"Stopped working after 6 months Bought this item in July and it stopped working in December. Specficially, the playback function stopped working."
0,"Not worth it! This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!"
0,"Awkward controls, below-par reliability Like Korean cars, this Korean camcorder does what it says, but it's not something you'll be proud to own. The controls are awkward... even Sony's compact minidv camcorders have better buttons. The video quality is sub par, and my unit, which I received as a factory-sealed gift, broke after about 6 months, a first for all the Asian electronics I have owned. For a little bit more money, you can buy much better camcorders from Japanese manufacturers."
0,"Good print quality - bad mechanism I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one."
0,"Envelope Feeder Never Worked I have a small business and it was important that the envelope feeder work well. From day 1, this has been a nightmare. Components of the printer block the envelopes/labels and they don't feed properly. If you use internet postage, you lose money with the misfed labels/envelopes. I'm very disappointed and am shopping for a new printer now, only a short time after purchasing this one."
0,"Hate This Printer! Annoying messages to reset it !!! I had had two HP printers. Both broke in the same places - where the paper shoots out from the printer; the wings or the ""arms"" which guide the paper from the printer - both broke easily.Also I get an annoying message on my computer that the ""yellow box marked !"" is on and therefore I have to exit out of the printer mode and reset the yellow box so that the ! is deleted. Then go back into the printer mode. This is so annoying that I am never getting an HP Printer again.If you look on the instruction book, the annoying message can never to resolved - only by resetting the message yellow ! again, and again!!!!!!!!"
0,"Unfortunately Cannot Do ZERO stars This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the ""publisher's review"", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me."
0,"Can't Believe This Was Even Published Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book""."
0,"too small to read My rating of one *is not a reflection of the story or the gorgeous illustrations; but, on the unreadable digital version. Shame on the people who will profit from selling something with an unchageable font size that is too small to read. It was obviously scanned in and formatted on landscape view with two hard cover book pages per one narrow digital page. The font and the page size can't be enlarged. I'm really disappointed with Amazon for not only selling something of such inferior quality and even more disappointed with them for highlighting this product as a daily deal. :-("

A trip that could have been very interesting to read about is instead a tedious catalogue of ""then we went there and then we did this.""

This is, unfortunately, an unchallenging and uninformative book."
0,"Don't waste your time I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc. (I sent it back for a refund.) However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg. There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a ""print-at-home"" job. If this is a ""print-on-demand"" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description. For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate. This is not worth your time - or your money."

The rest are bad (except for ""good ship lifestyle,"" which is okay.) The good part about the Cd is if I turn it on, my sisters step out of my room almost instantly. So, if you're looking for a way to disturb the peace, this is it."
0,"uhm, why was this popular? Is there anything less than one star? This might be the worst CD I have ever listened to. One of my friends bought it used, shortly after it came out. Note that fact for future reference: if it just came out, and people are already selling it used, it SUCKED. The lyrics are positively nonsensical, and there is nothing creative or interesting in the instrumentation, melodies, etc. There's one song where all they say is ""drip drip drip goes the water."" What the heck is that supposed to mean? More like, drip, drip, drip melts the plastic, since I left this in the trunk of my car."
0,"Not a very good printer Lasted six months. Never worked exactly right since I purchased it. I think it had software driver problems. Would work sporadically, then lock up and paper have to be cleared manually. Final straw, no matter what type paper it was fed, it would catch in the feed path underneath the print head for no apparent reason. Of course the paper still keeps trying to feed, so the machine just wads it into a mess. In addition to the software driver problem, I think it has a significant design problem with the paper feed as it often trys to feed up to five or six sheets at once, even the HP desk jet paper designed for such printers. I will say that when it did work, it printed well."
0,NEVER BUY THIS PRINTER!! I spent over 2 1/2 hrs. (after 1 hr. myself) on the phone with HP trying to install this printer. It never would work right. The HP tech said there is a problem in the software program of this printer. This HP DESKJET 940C is everyone's worst installation nightmare!
0,"A poor use of my money I bought a new laptop and wanted a new printer. This wone came highly recommended from the story. It worked great for three months (of course, the length of the warranty). It now only states ""paper jam"" and after hours of time on the phone and with the hints on the web, I am going out to buy a new printer - I would certainly not buy this one, again."
0,"Bad printer Do not buy this printer. I have had nothing but trouble with it- it jams every other time I print, and most of the time, it grabs 3-4 papers at once, and prints on all of them. I certainly expected better quality from HP, and this did not deliver. The printing is decent when it works, which is not often. I will be looking for a different company next time."
0,"I will stick with the pink or blue packets... Found this on sale and excitedly tried it this morning in my coffee and a fresh fruit and yogurt smoothie. I wasn't pleased with results in the smoothie because it didn't seem to dissolve properly, probably because of the cold. This resulted in my smoothie having a ""sandy grit"" texture but the taste was okay. It did dissolve properly in the hot coffee and tasted just fine.Maybe an hour or so later my tummy started gurgling and shortly after was my first of MANY mad dashes to the bathroom today. This started with the smoothie at about 8 AM and has continued throughout the day (it is now 4:15 PM). The info about the product states that it does not cause gastrointestinal distress but other reviews support my experience that it certainly does too AND it continues for long after the product has surely been flushed (pun intended) from your body."

0,"B-O-R-I-N-G This has to be one of the worst books i EVER picked up. Within the fist 50 pages, iwas bored out of my mind. I don't know why everyone think this book is SOOOOO good, don't listen to them. If you like BAD books this is the one for you! I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!"
0,"Waste of time;Stick to Robot novels. This book is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There is very little in the way of plot and character development. There is no climax in this book. The book reads like a historical record, similar to Tolkiens Silmarillion, rather than an actual story. If you like reading historical records, you may like this book. If you are looking for an exciting novel.... better luck elsewhere."
0,"zzzzzz..... I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book."

0,"Didn't Believe a Word of It I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation."
0,"One of the worst things I've ever read This has to be one of the most over rated books (and series) of all time.The dialog and character development is horrible. The characters have about as much depth as paper dolls. The language is about as colorful as a newspaper.The ideas behind the novel may have been new and interesting 50 years ago, (although anyone familar with Wells, Huxley, or Verne would debate that), but now they are just tired and beaten like a dead horse."

0,"A very bad book ...To my surprise and disappointment, I found ""Foundation"" to be an exceptionally terrible ""book"", totally undeserving of the praise it has received here. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged ""novel"" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature. In fact, the only time I should ever like to mention it again is as an example of poor writing, atrocious story-telling, and science-fiction that is totally wanting for any kind of inspiration. ..."
0,"An Example of What is ""Classically"" Wrong with SciFi. I only recently read this so called masterpiece. I even went do far as to order the special complete edition from the Science Fiction Book Club. Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech."

Robert Altman maybe have been one of the world's greatest directors,but COLD DAY was a low in his career.Sandy Dennis was brilliant as always but the ultra slow and moody film seems to go on forever.Seeing it on video years later again did nothing for me.Sometimes you like films better the second time around but not so for me in this case.It was no wonder that the film was largly forgotten shortly after its original release."
0,"A huge disappointment This book is nearly worthless. Large parts of it are just lists of organisms and there are frequent grammatical errors, typos, misspellings. It's clear it was written in a rush. The blurb on the back says ""lavishly illustrated"" which is a lie. All the illustrations, of which there are few, are not even B&W photos but line drawings, and not even very good ones at that. For example, The very first two, meant to illustrate two different organisms, are hard to tell apart. Save your money and buy something else."

Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble. I couldn't figure out who was coming or going. I was baffled the entire movie! The lines were HORRIBLE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!

Any rookie cop could point out a dozen giant plot holes."

0,"Great idea - shoddy construction - waste of money I purchased this as a replacement for an old roll up tatami mat that I purhased at least twenty years ago. These are perfect for taking to the beach but couldn't find them local now. The tatami is woven tightly so that it keeps the sand off. Saw this and looked like a good idea.These are really three separate tatami mats, each about 11"" wide by about 6' in length, joined by a blue canvas strip that runs the full length (top to bottom). It is colorful and handy, folding up in to object about the size of a large book with handles.Problem I ran into was that the strip joining two of the panels ripped apart first time I took it to the beach, rendering it useless for its intended purpose. Perhaps mine was just a bad sample but at $10 a throw, I will be asking for a refund."

0,"Another nightmare about the remove cassette message I have had this camera for 18 months and about 2 months ago, it started beeping at me to eject the tape almost every time I used it. I went on-line and found that this is common with this camera for some reason. I was able to prevent major problems by removing the tape after each use, but that no longer works. Now I cannot record or watch any tape without it forcing me to remove the cassette. I was very fond of this camera until it stopped working. I am very disappointed that I will now have to buy a new camcorder (a local repairman estimated over $200 to fix it). I have a friend who has the exact same camera and he has yet to have a problem, but it isn't worth the risk."
0,"I liked it at first It was a pretty good camera until it stopped working. One day I turned it on and it started beeping and flasshing an eject tape message. But you couldn't eject the tape and the camera would not respond to anything. I had the camera just over two years when this happened. Luckily I purchased an extended warranty at Best Buy. Best Buy sent the camera to Canon for repair. Canon would not repair it because it would be too expensive so, Best Buy gave me a new camera. And I was allowed to get a different brand, so I went with a Sony Handycam."
0,"BEWARE of ZR45MC Tape loading mechanism!!!! I bought the ZR45MC camcorder in Sept '02. I have been using it quite regularly. then all of a sudden I cannot load new or old mini DV cassettes. The moment I load a cassette, a message flashes on the screen 'REMOVE TAPE' and beeping sound is generated together with a flashing 'EJECT' message. Next step, I ship this to the Canon Factory service in NJ. They replied with an estimate of $160(on top of the $654 I pad for this!!).Also most importantly when I shipped from the Fedex office in Boston, the Fedex person made a remark that she has been seeing quite a number of the Canon camcorders going to NJ for repairs.To sum, I think this is a racket Canon has devised to rip off customers.So beware when you buy a Canon camcorder, ask the retailer about the tape loading mechanism, and if they have any maintenance plans that will repair it."
0,"Horrible... I used this camera for a year untill during a period of a couple weeks of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one."
0,"Nice camera, when it works I love the features and optics of this camera. I love everything about it, except that it really doesn't work and their service is terrible. Many people posted about the humming sound -- I didn't have that problem. But the electrical system was intermittent from the time I got the camera. I've sent it to them three times, and each time they repair it, or claim to. Now it is out of warranty and the battery still doesn't work. So I'll have to buy a new camera and hope that you don't make the same mistake I did -- go with a different camera."
0,"She can't sing! This album received a fair amount of critical acclaim, so I thought I'd give it a listen. Well so much for critics! Gainsbourg can't sing a lick. She makes people like Britney Spears, Jessical Simpson & Janet Jackson sound like Beverly Sills or Marilyn Horne. The producers must recognize this too, because her voice is mixed very low on most of the tracks. On top of not being able to sing, she doesn't compose and doesn't play an instrument. So why is there a CD bearing her name? You got me. Maybe cashing in on daddy's renown? The botton line is don't waste your money. If you want to hear some good French CDs, check out ""Hors de Toute Doute"" or ""Le Silence des Roses"" by France D'Amour (from Quebec)."

0,Not as good as Counterfeit CD... To put it bluntly... I hate this CD. I thought I would like it because I fell head over heels in love with Cirrus' Counterfeit CD. I listened to that CD for a week straight I loved it so much... then I got this CD. It's like a tribute to bad... BAD... 80's music. Not to bash on the people who actually like this CD but if you listen to Counterfeit first and then go to this one... you will be very dissapointed. It's one of the few CDs of mine that I would love to just toss in the trash and I rarely get a CD that I hate. It was worth all of the 69 cents I paid for it on Amazon.

Even the photos are same outdated photos that appear to be taken in the late 70's used in the 2001 release. Please, Taunton, don't insult your readers by continuing to regurgitate the same information with a shiny new label in an attempt to sell more books.

Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book.

The wood is slightly bowed, and though it does not impede play, I was expecting a higher quality of toy (this is Brio after all). The most disappointing thing, though, was how small the turntable is.

A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars. It's convoluted, drug paranoia with a created mythology about time and space travel that's all about shocking images of sex and death. It's not a story."

0,"Save Your Money! As an incurable Beatle-maniac, I looked forward to hearing some of the cuts on this cd. BIG disappointment!! All of the songs are remakes of the original versions, and bad ones at that! None of the original Peter & Gordon or Billy J Kramer versions here. To make matters worse, the remakes are not even faithful to the originals, in some cases not even sticking to the original melody as written, but going off on interpretive ""tangents""!! Example: I hardly recognized ""Bad To Me"" as done here. Save your money, it's not even worth the curiosity value."
0,"Don't bother A huge Beatles fan who stumbled across this at the CD gift shop at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I actually think this is (was) a great idea for a CD......but this particular production is horrible. They should have tried to keep the songs in the contemporary period they were written. Instead, they take songs which were simple tracks written in the earlier years and try to combine elements from Beatles albums spanning their entire career. The result can best be described as an atrocious mix of taking songs that you may have found on ""Please Please Me"", and remixing them to fit the style of ""Revolver"" or ""Sgt Peppers"". Oh, and it doesn't help that the band they used sucked too. I can think of about a dozen Beatles tribute bands out there that maybe could have done this properly....these guys are BAD. Don't waste your money."

0,The poorest of all the versions to date. I borrowed a friend's copy and listened to this version. Madonna has a beautiful voice but it is too light for this role. Antonio Banderas is woefully inadequate in the singing department. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this recording. Buy the original Broadway cast C.D. with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin. It is by far the best version.

Patti LuPone is a far better Eva than Madonna, and at least you can understand Mandy Patinkin, unlike Antonio Banderos. Also, Hollywood turned the orchestrations into modern rock 'n' roll junk, when the 1979 Premiere American Recording is the way EVITA should be. So don't waste your money on the movie sountrack, and buy the Premiere American Recording instead"
0,"HORRIBLE This cd is horrible Madonnas verson of Eva is terrible she should not have been allowed to screw up such wonderful songs as ""Dont Cry"" and other...i dont suggest this cd to anyone who wants to hear how the songs are suppose to be sung...if you wanna hear them the right way get Elaine Paige's version or Patti LuPone...(forgive me if i spelled her name wrong)......"
0,"Have not received my item in a month. My order was placed on August 28, but I have not received the printer in a month."
0,Magenta This thing is awful. Prints magenta only. Drives me crazy. I am going to go find a high building to throw it from.
0,"limitations of color printing This printer works great for almost any application, but do not expect to print on special paper. On even the soft gloss paper, the ink blobs and gives poor quality printing. The color photos print better on regular paper than on photo or special finish paper. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING, you will be disappointed."
0,"Disappointment I ordered this bed for a visit by my 4 year old granddaughter. We had to add air to the bed every morning. I had this experience with another brand, but hoped this one would be better. Definitely NOT worth the money."
0,SEVERAL LEAK VERY SOON The price is great. The bed looks good. I have ordered several over the last few years. I've only had 2 last 6 months or longer_ The most recent one I ordered had a leak so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement started to leak 32 days after receiving---2 days after the return policy. All I can say is if you need it- order 2; because it's likely 1 will start leaking pretty soon. Unless you only use it occassionally. I use mine every day.
0,"Utter Garbage Dear potential sucker,My first airbed by intex sprung a leak in about a week, so I obtained a refund. I bought this model next, and it lasted almost twice as long!I am now on my third. I should have learned my lesson, but my current intex airbed has been around for about one year, and currently has 9, count 'em, NINE leaks. Everytime I patch one, another springs.Intex also makes inflateable boats. They must get sued for a lot of drownings. No wonder they have no email contact. If you buy ANY intex airbed, you are buying utter garbage.Sincerely,SidWa State"
0,"Seams Came Apart After 5th Use I bought this to sleep on while I moved it to my new place and used it about 6 times before the seams on top came apart. I never realized how important the seams were until that dreary night when at 3am they started to come apart. I turned to my side and another came apart. I turned to my other side and the rest came apart (I weigh 120 lbs if it matters)which turned the bed into one giant ball. Since the seams are gone there is no shape and if you lay on it the air is distributed to the opposite of your weight...I ended up in a hammock type pose. I let some air out in hopes it would bring the top down but nope, instead I sunk further.I called the manufacturer, emailed Amazon for the contact info to be sure, emailed the manufacturer again and finally got a response. Although some models come with a 90 day warranty, this one did not so I was SOL.Never again. Buy yourself a cheap mattress instead, at least it won't break and the comfort will be about the same."
0,"Would not inflate RETURNED I've bought several air beds from various manufacturers. I bought one identical to this one 1 1/2 years ago. It was comfortable but lost air after 3 months. I justified this as the user may have not taken care. However, I now believe its the brand. This one would not inflate at all. I will not buy this brand again. I've had great life from a better brands."
0,"Worst airbed ever - Don't buy If I could give a 0 star I would.So I bought this airbed while I had a friend visiting so she could use my bed. It seemed to work just fine the first night. However the second time I inflated this bed and slept on it, I got the worst night of sleep ever. During the night, the air slowly came out of the bed (I have checked all over for leaks or holes but could not find anything). I woke up several times to a half inflated bed and then had to re-inflate the bed again only to wake up an hour later to the same condition. Needless to say, I am extremely unhappy with the product. Hope Amazon will let me return this terrible thing."
0,"Huge disappointment I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now ""popped"" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away."
0,Didn't Last I bought this for my 8 year old to sleep on in temporary housing during a corporate move. This bed didn't last two days and it came apart in the seam where we couldn't patch it. I would not waste my money on this product again.
0,"huge LUMP after a few uses... i only used this bed about a dozen times. it was never really all that comfortable and the last time i inflated it, a huge lump developed right in the middle making it unusable. there is no way to get rid of the lump and it is rock hard solid. it raised up about 3 inches high and is about 15 inches in diameter. its too late to send it back now so its going in the dumpster. i have since read other reviews of intex doing the same thing. i will NEVER get another intex again...i am going back to aerobeds!"
0,on website it says twin but actual size is single. i dont know why these guys are trying to cheat. i paid full amount and i was expected to receive a twin size airbed but when i opened it it is actual size is single sized matress! so this company is baad! will never suggest it to someone.
0,"Only good for a couple of use I bought this Intex bed for my son. He is renting an apartment while waiting for a room assignment in a dorm.The bed, although still inflates, now has a bulge in the middle, so he falls off the bed. Even though we tried deflating and inflating the same, the problem is still there."
0,worthless I bought this for my daughter to sleep on when she was home from college. She actually liked sleeping on it but 3 weeks later it developed a slow leak which I could not find. Therefore I had to throw it away. A complete waste of money.
0,Not good It only lasted for less than 3 months then there was 2 holes that I fixed but still there was a leak somewhere and eventually I just threw it away. I don't recommend this air mattress.
0,3 weeks and heard a big boom! Heard a huge boom and I noticed the seam had given out and then this huge bubble formed in middle of the bed and then it ripped a few days later. I purchased the product on or around 10-6-2011 and before 11-1-11 it was deflated!
0,"Terrible product, I regret spending my money on this I bought this air mattress two months ago. I used a couple of days and it worked fine. Now a friend is planning to visit so I decided to use it again but something went wrong, instead of a flat surface, there is a huge bump in the middle that would make sleeping on it uncomfortable if not impossible.Since this is a product you will use only a couple of days before putting it away until you need it again, the amazon returning period will be over by the time you actually try it and find something wrong with it. And the company that makes this mattress says ""this product does not have any warranty or service program"". I hope I can put this in the recyclables bin!I wish I would've spend a little bit money on a real mattress that won`t fail after a while."
0,"A total dud Opened the box, unrolled the mattress, plugged in the motor and then... the motor made a few feeble noises and shut off in less than three seconds. Plugged it into several different outlets with the same results.Intex customer service told me that there are NO WARRANTIES on their air mattresses and the only option was to return it to Amazon for a refund. I will not be ordering any products from Intex in the future."
0,"Angry I bought this bed while I decided to purchase a normal bed. I was at first excited but as the week, past the seam popped and the bed now has a bubble and un-usable. for the money you pay for an air-bed I stick with a traditional bed over and air bed. Least to say thanks the quality is poor! I do not recommend."
0,Crappy Air bed Airbed doesn't keep air overnight. If you try to return it you will be charged a restocking fee to restock an airbed that doesn't work so you will get no refund.....exchange it for another crappy airbed...My recommendation is....don't buy this crappy airbed!!
0,"NEVER BUY THIS AIRBED!!!! All these airbeds look good on pics. But the common problem for all these even well known brands is deflating. The tightly inflated airbed almost completely deflates by the morning, even if u find the leakage and seal it, by next day other leakage will appear. it is horrible feeling like u are on the boat during the storm when it is flat. Eventually after buying 3 airbeds from well known brands i bought spring mattress for 100$ and feel very good without needing in inflating it every morning!"
0,"Low cost defective product This is really a bad product. I bought it in hope that I could have one extra bedding when required. I used it on first night for myself and after 3-4 it deflated, annoyingly i filled the air back in night and went to sleep. In morning i was awake again because it has deflated. I thought i am doing something wrong, read the manual and searched online, found nothing. Next night it was the same story. Returned to amazon.(note: this was not my first product either, earlier I tried their queen bedding and it was similar story too)STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT will be my advice."
0,"Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is ""save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on"", that's what we're doing now."
0,"not 80in in length I ordered it because I have a 6ft 8in relative who spends time with me. The description says this airbed is 40in wide and 80 inches in length. The box housing the bed clearly states the bed is 39 in wide and 75 inches long. I am really disappointed because I have been shopping for this for over 3 months and only recently decided this was the right bed. WRONG!The goal is to provide comfort. /his won't, his feet will be hanging off the edge of the bed. Its going back."
0,Went flat in the middle of the first night. This airbed does not stay inflated. It went flat half way through each of the five nights I used it. It is junk. Don't buy it. If I had bought it at a store it would have gone back the next day.
0,Garbage Only used a handful of times and the bed already leaks air. Waste of money. I know it shows a one star rating but the true rating is zero stars.
0,"Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed, deflating within 3 months I had another airbed that lasted about 2 years before there was a leak and needed to replace it. This one had pretty good reviews and it was taller when inflated and would be easier to get on and off it. I did like the airbed and it was comfortable. We used it less than 5 times over the last 4 months and it deflated slightly last time I used it. I should have investigated further at that time but just deflated it until next use. I used it this weekend and had to pump it up again in the middle of the night and I think my time for warranty is over with."
0,Wont hold air after 32 days since online purchase thru amazon Product was defective from day on and lasted a whole 32 days and now will inflate but by the middle of the night you sleeping on the carpet.
0,"Short Product Life This bed was cheap and the quality was consistent with the price. The seams deformed about 6 months after use began and bulges formed that eventually made the product unusable. Don't purchase for long term use. The seam design is flawed, which is probably why most of the other manufacturers offer a quilted pattern. The return shipping and 50% refund potential make recovering any money impossible. I got some use out of the bed, but definitely wouldn't buy anything else from this manufacturer."
0,"nice sleep, but bottom seam blew Just a great item. However there are approximately 5 length-wise seams on the bottom to create stability. After two months, one seam ""disappeared, and now the bed rocks, because there is one large air space.I can probably live with it, just have to put some towels, whatever to stabilize it."
0,"Leaked We were among the unlucky buyers who happened to receive a dud. The airbed had a gash at the bottom, which we patched. But it also leaked at the seams and our attempts to patch that did not work. We returned it, unslept-on -- no easy task, since we were required to return the manufacturer's box, and of course we could not get the deflated airbed back into it, so we had to find a box big enough to hold both the deflated airbed and the manufacturer's box."
0,"Not satisfied The air mattress was good only for one day, after one day it started deflating and I have to inflate it every night before sleep. By the time I wake up on it the next day it has become like a water bed since it has deflated. I cannot find the hole from where it deflates."
0,This bed will not retain air. It was a super deal... But there is something wrong with it. It will not retain the air level that I want.I will be returning this item
0,"Not available. I don't really hate it, because my order was cancelled for some unclear reason. The order was cancelled several days after I placed it, so I'm no fan of Intex."
0,customer service is dead every person i communicated with was not only rude but were clearly annoyed by my need for help and completely unwilling to assist me . I returned the product that i was charged $103.10 for and was refunded $40.70 . thanks
0,"Just like all the other airbeds I filled it with air when it arrived. It lost air by the morning. Since the bed was cold when filled, I gave it another chance. The first night is was actually used, it had to be refilled in the middle of the night."
0,"not reccomended Would not purchase this item again. Used in spare bedroom for guests. Hardly used, until now. Hoping top have Xmas guests use. First to lay on it, and center ring pooped.Still usable, but uncomfortable. The second night used bed hissing sound and a large leak appeared. They provide plastic to repair leaks, but do not provide any adhesive. I have to eat it now because I had until 11/12/12 to return.I can get partial credit, not including shipping if I just had just kept the box and shipping label for 3 months."
0,"Get Out Your Magnifying Glasses! Although this is a good collection of Poe's short stories, the pages crisp and the typeface clear, THE TYPE ITSELF IS VERY, VERY, VERY SMALL! I am getting older, but do not need glasses yet and I can hardly read a word or two before my eyes begin to cross! I don't understand book manufacturers anymore. Either the typeface is illegible, the paper so poor that all the letters blot together, or the print is teenie tiny. Aren't books supposed to be read? Also, something strange, the chapters arent seperated. One story runs into the next without starting a new page."
0,"Blah Blah Blah....... Good God, was this boring! I couldn't even finish watching it before I tossed it. I usually enjoy reading or hearing how artists create, it fascinates me. And I love The Band that used to be. But this was boring as heck. Sorry, Robbie. Sorry, Levon."
0,ridiculous I find it hard to believe there are women really using this product ........turns out it's about the same diameter as the cardboard tube inside paper-towels. Seriously ???~~~
0,"Help! Hello everybody! I ordered this product but the first one that i received didn't work, and now i have the second one and it still doesn't work. It might sound weird, but i put batteries in it and it doesn't start working. What should i do? Thanks!"
0,PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE WASTE OF MONEY. FIRST TIME BUYING SUCH AND IT NEVER WORKED. MOTOR NEVER TURNED WHEN BATTERY WAS PUT IN. SUCH BLATANT ROBBERY!
0,"Doesnt work First off I am currently deployed and my wifes fisrt viberator that we bought, to help with the lonely nights, was supposed to be waterproof got some water damage and no longer works. She asked me to order her another so I looked around and found this one, it had many decent reviews so I decided to order it. When it arrived and my wife opened the package only to find that the item I ordered had a much larger cirmcurference, the one she had before was about 5 inches or so. She decided to try to use it because of the fact that there is not a return policy. When she attempted to use the item it did not work, she tried replacing the batteries and that only made the rabbit portion come on. It would be extremely helpful if there were some sizes and lengths to determine what exactly you were buying. So all in all I am extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone."
0,"Painful, no pleasure, and doesn't work. Smells horrible! First of all, no matter how much I washed it, it still smelled HORRIBLE! The ""rabbit ears"" are too long. The part it is supposed to hit isn't that high up. The worst part of all...the head of the shaft doesn't turn. It barely moves, so how am I supposed to feel anything? It is loud, and has a machine sound because of the ""floating beads"" which do absolutely nothing. Look into something else...this Rabbit is a piece of junk. I looked at a lot of reviews to make sure I got the right one, and I was mistaken. I don't know how other people gave this more than 2 stars.The vibrate is descent, though."
0,doesnt work Put new batteries in - product wont turn on at all - very disappointed !!! Save your money - many others are better - should have read the other reviews and then i would have been warned
0,"So Disappointing! I was so excited to try this item when I ordered it, but when I got it I was so disappointed because it didn't work. It didn't even turn on! I didn't try to return it because I was under the impression it is a nonreturnable item. I won't order this product again but will try ordering from Amazon again."
0,Disappointed again Had a very toxic smell and probably will be toxic if used. No matter how much it was cleaned it still had a very strong smell. Scared to use it because of its smell. The ears and shaft are very hard and not flexible at all. It will be tossed in the trash. Another waste of money.
0,DISAPOINTED I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AS A GIFT. I PUT BATTERIES IN IT AND IT WORKED FOR THREE MINS AND QUIT. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IT TO WORK AGAIN AND ACCORDING TO AMAZON POLICY I CAN'T RETURN IT! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
0,"Great Transaction!!! Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. 110% satisfied with their service..,"
0,Not a good vibrator I bought this item 6 months ago and was immediately disappointed. Metallic beads are a almost painful on higher rotation speed. And the the metallic rod connecting the top with the bottom broke after 6 months.Do not recommend this item.
0,California Exotics jack rabbit Piece of crap. All functions did not work when opened and stopped working during first use... horrible product. California Exotics should be ashamed of selling this junk. do not waste your money or shipping..
0,"Not worth the money What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews, but when I tried it, it did nothing. First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that's the part that goes on you clit. I'm almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I've tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all. This is not worth the money."
0,Nothing Nothing to to say about it thank u didn't enjoy it so why say something why rate it a waste of money
0,"Awful! I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the ""bunny ears"" cause more pain than pleasure. I don't recommend this product."
0,"Yet another disappointed customer Add me to the list of folks who received a vibrator-shaped paperweight instead of an actual vibrator. I tried two sets of batteries just to make sure, but it was dead. Also, as others have mentioned, the toxic plastic smell was over-powering, so I was a little bit glad it didn't work or I might have been tempted to try it and I may never have gotten that smell out of me. :o)Amazon, understandably, doesn't allow returns on vibrators, but the paperwork for a refund was done in under an hour and I should get it in a few days, so at least that part was easily done."
0,"jams LOVE the size--no complaints there. Rabbit ears hit in just the right spot. But, the beads on mine jammed up after a single use."
0,Broken Item Recieved this item and it was broken. Tried to contact the seller but could not. As per amazon's return policy this is a non-returnable item. Which makes sense. Unless it is sold in a non-working condition. Was very displeased I could not speak directly with the seller and that amazon was of no help. Had to go through the manufacture to have the product replaced which is still a work in progress. Will not buy non-returnable items from this site again. Leaves too much room to get a defective product like I did and be stuck with it.
0,"Broken I received this product in the mail yesterday, Put in the batteries and the rotating beads do not work. Complete waste of money."
0,"Looked good, didn't work This was my first purchase of a vibrator and was very disappointed. It was shipped very discreetly from Amazon directly, but it didn't work. I put in fresh batteries and it wouldn't turn on. I even tested the batteries, they were good, but this rabbit wasn't. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't take returns on this type of personal product. I simple won't buy anything made by California Exotics again. I'll try one of the other brands next time."
0,"Works really well right up until it doesn't It was a little big for me, but it worked really well until about two weeks ago. And then it just died. Mind you, this is two months after I bought it. I switched the batteries, made sure the ones I put in were working, but I suppose the motor died. I never even used it in water. I don't know about most people, but for $30, you'd think you'd get more than two months out of a vibrator."
0,"Very disappointed I don't know why this has such good reviews. I purchased it because of the reviews but it's since gone in the trash. It has an awful smell that won't go away. Like a burned plastic smell. It is WAY too big. The rotating beads do nothing for me. Even if you put your hand on the shaft, you have to squeeze to feel the rotation. Don't buy it."
0,"Misleading. Clearly, the producers of this DVD meant to mislead. The cover of the DVD shows the original album cover suggesting that it is a visual equivalent of the album. Please read the cover carefully. It is a quickly put together documentary of the times surrounding the making of the album. Too much time is taken up showning closeups of the of photographic stills that are already on the original album cover and liners.Much time is spent describing the breakup of the relationships.Some of the new performances of the classic songs are again, quickly put together and doesn't provide additional insights.Hastily produced DVD with a misleading cover to cash in on unsuspecting fans."
0,"Zero Stars Rumours is one of my all-time favorite albums, so I was dying to see this video. The one on the making of Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon was a real treat, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it is just them saying over and over again that it was difficult being trapped in a small studio together, while they were breaking up. The only thing I did not already know, that I got from this video, is that Mick Fleetwood seems like a pretty nice guy, but the other three are self-absorbed jerks. Listen to the album again and again, but I recommend not wasting your time on this pointless and thoroughly uninteresting video."
0,"A WASTE OF VIEWING TIME AND MONEY! THIS IS A BLATANT CASE OF FALSE ADVERTISING THAT I'VE EVER SEEN! I'M EXPECTING TO SEE FLEETWOOD-MAC PERFORMING ALL THE SONGS FROM THEIR ALBUM 'RUMORS' (WHICH IS A GREAT PIECE OF WORK!). INSTEAD, ALL I SEE ARE THE RECORDING TECHNICIANS EXPLAINING HOW THEY MIXED THE VARIOUS SONGS, WHICH, BRINGS ME TO MY MAIN BEEF...ONLY BITS AND PIECES OF THE SONGS ARE PLAYED. NONE OF THE SONGS WERE PLAYED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ALSO, THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE BAND MEMBERS SEEMED TO FOCUS ON WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH WHOM AND WHY THE AFFAIR ENDED. WHO CARES? I WANTED TO SEE F-M PERFORM AND WAS VERRRRRRY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY DIDN'T. AT LEAST I HAVE MEMORIES OF TWO OF THEIR CONCERTS THAT I ATTENDED YEARS AGO."
0,"eBay, here I come! Well, I am among those who expected the basic performances along with the documentary, based on the packaging and the song titles listed in the text.I'm glad so many people like it because that means I will have no trouble selling my copy.The sound quality didn't impress me, and the ""specially recorded"" versions of some songs told me only that the members have lost their voices. (offstage: ""Sacrilege! Burn him!"")Even the navigation was annoying - click,click, click, click to get to any one song.Bah!"
0,"Fleetwood Mac Rumours If you want to hear music, don't purchase this video. Each song is quickly interrupted with current interviews of band members talking mostly of their failed romantic relationships during the recording of Rumours. This should be labeled a documentary, not a music video. The band members do talk about the music, and there are nice clips shot at Sausalito, California's Record Plant showing how particular tracks were mixed. However, I believe using the Rumours album cover on the video packaging deceptively implies that it is a music video."
0,"too frustrating for the price Just bought this at the garden center. Looked solid. However, instructions are completely inadequate. I've programmed these kind of things before. I know it's hard to be able to create all the functions needed with just three buttons, but that's why you need to research what the competition is doing."
0,"1. Something Good I wanted to buy this song but couldn't figure out how to do it from the webpage. I don't have any problem buying Apple products, or ATT products or anyone else's products. But I could not figure out how to buy a song from Amazon."
0,"Like the sprial binding, not much else The spiral binding on this book is it's only positive.I haven't found a single thing in this book I would like to stitch. The graphs are done with colored Xs which make it difficult to distinguish between similar colors, and to imagine what the finished product will look like. The colors are not given in Anchor or DMC format, but in other numbers that you then have to look up the DMC or Anchor numbers in the back. Finally there are very few designs for each category. For example, there are only about four or five small pages of Christmas designs. Christmas is a very large subject to design from. Did they run out of ideas? Rather than this book, buy the Better Homes and Gardens 2000 Cross Stitch Designs. There are so many more designs for many more topics, and stitched pictures are given so you know what you'll be working on."
0,"Garbage. Product came with no documentation whatsoever, no installation CD. Attempted to install this on 2 computers.

Threw it in the trash."
0,"My First Negative Review -- Ever Others may like this book but I did not.For me, ""The Pro: Lessons About Golf and Life from My Father, Claude Harmon, Sr."" was a huge disappointment and may be the worst book I have ever read.I kept trying to like this book, but the writing and the message kept getting in the way. Self-promotion is hard to pull off, and for me the author did not successfully pull it off. Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he ""got his life together."" From cover to cover it rings with false modesty, and rationalization of a self-righteous, bullying bravado.My brand new copy did not find its place on the bookshelf with Bobby Jones, Dave Pelz, Jack Nicklaus, and many others. Rather, it has been donated to the recycle bin because we do not want it in our house for any youngster to read."
0,"Talentless hack takes a whack at jazz singing... Patti Page ""The Tennessee Waltz Gal"" should never have attemted to record a jazz vocal album, for one she lacks the individuality that it takes to be a jazz singer, number two how can anyone take seriously a singer who sings ""How Much Is That Doggie In The Window."" And three when she sings, she sounds like she doesn't care about what she's singing about, Page is definately not a lyrical singer. Even though Pete Rugalo(the talented jazz vocalist June Christy's regular arranger), who arranged this album, tried to make Miss Page sound listenable, it just didn't work out. Stay away from this CD or any CD that has the name ""patti Page"" on it."

0,"Spare us I purchased this CD for my wife for Mother's Day. After listening to it, it became very clear that Babs is way out of her league when she sings with singers the caliber of Il Divo (whom she refers to as ""swell"" by the way. Swell???). The continual platitudes such as ""children are like sponges"" etc. are boring. At 65 years of age she can at least try to come up with something new to say. As for her political persuasion, who cares!"
0,"Stainless Steel Outside - All Plastic inside!! This is one very attractive coffee canister with just one problem. If you're chosing this because you no longer want your food and beverages exposed to plastic, you might want to stay away from this one. The inside area is made entirely of black plastic. However, if plastic isn't an issue for you, this could be your baby.I am disappointed that amazon's normally satisfactory product description process didn't work here. This listing misrepresents the item by failing to mention the non-stainless interior which is a significant fact to many consumers. I returned my canister with my explanation that the quality was not as represented. I don't believe that they should charge their customers for any shipping or restock fees when they don't describe items honestly. Amazon rocks but this listing needs help!"

The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter..."
0,"Poor quality and Customer Service- buyer beware Received this as a gift from my husband. He had it gift wrapped and held it for the occasion. When I opned the bracelet, we were both very disappointed. The quality was very poor and bracelet did hand nicely on the wrist. He contacted the seller through Amazon to request a refund. They refused to refund or exchange the item. Unfortunately he had not opened the item when it was received, since it was gift wrapped. He held it beyond their return window, as he was saving it to be gifted. I called the vendor myself to explain and seek a compromise. They were unyeilding, explaining that they could not return the bracelet to their vendor or restock it, so we were out of luck. Beware of the return policy with this vendor especially if it is a gift."
0,"Buy your children this toy if you want them to hate you. This is a huge disappointment for my family, and has forever left a stain on the memory of my son's recent birthday. This piece of garbage cannot, does not, and will not stand up. And it does not stay together. And the elevator breaks easily. And some of the figures don't fit in the elevator.So there it lies, in pieces, in the corner. And here I lie, curled in a ball in the other corner, wondering if I am an inadequate father because I can't make a $40 piece of crap stand up.I hope whoever designed this goes back to creating torture devices."
0,"Don't waste your money This watchtower was never used by the manufacturer because the unit itself comes with 3 legs that could likely hold one pound of weight and this weighs several. The ""legs"" don't even lock in place, they just sit in groves so the minute you place the weight on it they collapse over and over. If you manage to get it to stand the minute your child touches it it will fall over. Otherwise it would have been a wonderful toy. It looks like the show and the body is sturdy and well put together. Too well put together to be supported by the legs provided. Don't buy it, if your child is younger talk them into the Spiderman playset, much more sturdy."
0,"A PIECE OF JUNK! Do not buy this toy - it has been a source of frustration and disappointment for all 3 of my children. Difficult to put together (and I have assembled my share of kid's toys), it will not stay together at all. It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design. The noises are also weak as are the features (i.e. the trip wire, rockets, the plane). Just a complete waste of money - it is only a couple of weeks old, and it is headed to the trash."
0,"Not for children to PLAY with! This item is not meant for children to play with! Strange, since it has to do with action figures of Super Heroes! But honestly, if your child does more than set this on a shelf, you'll soon be hearing screams of frustration. The elevator won't work! (ours completely stopped working in 2 days); The guns on the top keep falling off!; The whole thing just falls apart. No, this item is for the collector and I think Mattel KNEW that. They figured the few that were opened and did not work offset all the ones that would remain MIB or NRFB for collectors.This item is just like Mattel's HOT WHEELS JUNKIE SETS. Another sore point with parents. Hot Wheels cars are fine, but those sets that Mattel makes NEVER work as promised. And what's with the instructions that have little to no writing on them??! Some of the drawings are impossible to figure out. In Mattel's case, a word is worth a thousand illustrations!"
0,"Garbage! My 5 year old son received this as a birthday present, and it is headed right back to the store. The legs do not stay on, it falls over when touched, with or without the legs, there is a missing door, the elevator gets repeatedly stuck. As much as my son loves the idea of this toy, he has given up and resigned to playing with his other toys because this one is garbage, and a pure waste of money."
0,"Frustrating piece of junk - do not recommend! I bought this for Xmas 2004 after all the clever marketing hype. The rocketship theme looked very cool and rugged in the pictures. However, when my son got it it - it turned out to be nothing but a frustrating, unplayable toy. It falls down constantly because of poor design: the legs can't support the weight of the whole rocket when touching it), the elevator doesn' work (gets jammed all the way up) and it didn't even come with any character figures -these are sold separately! I may have to glue the parts together just so he could play with it some more time before we dump it.Do not recommend!"
0,Another lame mattel product Please don't waste your money on this one. My four year old son loves the justice league and thinks this toy is pretty great. The problem is the elevator for one never worked and the tower is supposed to be supported by three crappily made narrow suction looking thingys. The minute my son goes to open one of the towers sides the whole damn thing collapses. This happens everytime. I finally just took the three support things off of it and put them away. The gun launcher thingys on top also continue to fall off. Luckily my sons was purchased on sale for only $14 but it's made so cheap and frustrated my son so much that I still feel completely ripped off.
0,Watchtower is total crap!! Avoid this toy at all cost. It falls apart when touched. The elevator stopped working almost immediately. Total rip off.
0,What a waste! After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.
0,"I am returning it today.... I bought this from frys and am returning it today. Maybe it's only me, but mine had really bad quality and distorted images. I had 17"" LCD monitor from viewsonic and was replacing it because it has similar problem. Now, 19"" has same problem and I am done with viewsonic. I am not going to use viewsonic monitors again. Instead, I am going to try samsung ones."
0,"Hated it so much I returned it I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham, too. This book, however, drove me nuts! I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money. This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through. Clearly, this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the ""plot"" is terrible. Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it! Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - ""Remember Me"" is hysterical and a great, easy read. ""Cocktails for 3"" is painful trash."
0,"Very poor condition BUT? Good read! I saw D. Ebby 35 years ago on the 700 Club, wanted this book for all those years. It was brought to my attention by another minister of the gospel just recently. Saw it on Amazon and decided to buy it, it was inexpensive. The pages fell apart as I read the book, it was extremely frustrating but? So enjoyable and encouraging, I was glad I bought it. I am going to look for the same book in better condition, just to reread or give to another to enjoy."
0,"Very Disappointed I bought this book based on the other reviews saying how useful having the interpretations on the opposite page was. In reality it starts and ends directly with the play. No prologue, introduction or anything else. The reviews don't correspond to the item being sold."
0,stupid student review by gabriel c Romeo and Juliet is a story about to lovers that meet at first sight. The biggest problem they have together is that both of the families have been fighting and hate each other since they both have been born. It all started when Romeo been depressed ever day moping around and feeling sad all of the time because he loved Rosaline and she did not love him back. So one day Romeos cousin told him about this party and that Rosaline would be there so they left and Romeo saw Juliet there and followed her to her house and both exchanged thoughts about each other and decided that they will get married but secretly. So they had to come up with a plan to pretend that Juliet was died so the can get married and the planned failed and they both ended up killing themselves. Play was very stupid it sucks no one should read it because there is no point of reading this because all this play is taking up your time.
0,"the movie was better i just read this book. everybody like always talks about how great it is and everything. but i don't think so. like, it's been done before, right?? soooo cliched. omg."
0,"Misrepresented The customer reviews for this edition of Romeo and Juliet indicated that it was dual language, i.e., the original Shakespeare on one side of the pages and a modern ""translation"" on the other. This edition was original text only -- fine for what it is, but not what we wanted."
0,"Gimmie A Break! Not that I don't like Shakespeare's works, but his tragedies are terrible, especially this one. I can't understand the language real well, so I have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it'll be easier to understand. I just can't understand this love tragedy at all! Here are some things that confuse me:*How did this feud really begin?*Why can't this story end in happily ever after?*Why does Lady Capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody?*Why couldn't Shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand?*Why does everybody have to jump to conclusions?I simply can't understand why people love this play so much. It's ridiculous! If you want a true love story, try reading ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". This one absolutely SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"Good book -- but not this edition This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It's great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version."
0,"copy shop edition The stars are for the edition, not the book.The April 30, 2011 edition from CreateSpace (which probably actually is a copy shop) does not look like a book. It looks like a leaflet from Jehova's witnesses. It's flimsy, in a weird large format, and with no information about publisher, date of publishing etc. If you have any aesthetic sensibility you should get a different edition of this classic book.This type of product should either come with a warning ""not a real book"" or not be sold on amazon at all."

0,"Protect a bed mattress cover I purchase a Protect-A-Bed mattress cover at a mattress store, salesman said to wash it twice prior to use. He did not say to dry it with towels and sheets. Its supposed to be waterproof, one of our cats proved its not, contacted company, they asked if dried on medium with towels and other bedding, I said no, no one told me and not anywhere on package does it state needs to be protected in the dryer. Company sent another cover,this time on low setting which is mostly air fluff with towels and other sheets and it was scorched in 3 places. Both were scorched on medium and low heat, dryer is electric which is not as hot as gas. I'm getting my $90 back that I was charged at a mattress company. Not worth the money if you can't dry it because it has cheap plastic backing."

0,Poor option Why would someone pay for what they cannot have? Let the customer choose the color of the product they want to purchase!
0,"What...? When I first bought this it was because of the song ""oh, Yeah"" granted I heard the rest of the album and there were a lot better songs and I loved the eclectic sound. ""Love Devine"" sung by the women who sang the James Bond theme song ""Goldfinger"" was ultra cool. So they remaster it with all these bonus tracks but no ""Oh Yeah""? That totally sucks. It's not the best song on it but it's not ""One Second"" without ""Oh,Yeah"""
0,"I did not give it a good review at first however, they promised but did not deliver my money back. I would have like to have seen this book before I bought it. I never would have bought it in the condition I found it."
0,"A bit disappointed While there were some nice pictures and helpful information I was abit disappointed with the book in general. It was short (92 pages of large text),with no color pictures and just didn't seem like that helpful of a book for a first time mother. The book was first published in 1962 with an update in 1982 and I'm sure there have been quite a few new discoveries that would be quite informative for a first time mother since then. I felt like I was reading a high school biology book. OK for what it was but I'd not recommend it."
0,"Harmful self esteem advice for 10% of the population Avoid this book on the basis a dated and harmful passage on page 144 that states that homosexuality is ""related to a failure in identification"" and that parents of homosexual children should ""seek professional help at the earliest possible moment"". Their view of the cause of homosexuality is out of mainstream thought, and it implies that something wrong happened. The main reason for need for any counseling would be if homosexuality is causing adjustment or self-acceptance problems. This is not what the author's have in mind. Following the author's advice fails to honor your childs true nature, and certainly would be detrimental to the development of his/her self esteem."

0,"Fabrication... Squeezing the cash out of MAC... I've communicated with Charlie on more than one occasion.The man does not write nor talk like this book reads.End of story.However, his written word is legible, unlike what someone wrote in their review, some of it is a little hard to read because he's about 71 years old now and I would imagine his hands tremble a bit...But about this book...Waste of money.The ReVeReNd"
0,"WHAT??? GIVE ME A BREAK!!!! Hell, I'm not even going to read this book before I tell you all what I think! No reason to waste my time reading ANYTHING written by an animal like Manson.I'm kind of in to learning more about infamous cases like Manson's...but I'd like to hear THE TRUTH about what happened. And the criminals themselves usually do NOT tell the truth. They usually do have a way of detaching themselves, if you will, from the identity they had when they committed or instigated whatever the heck the crime was. So if I read on one of the reviews, that it doesn't sound like Manson...Gosh, why on earth am I not surprised!Hey...for a good laugh, I guess this would be OK to read...just to see how a beast like Manson operates.But I give this one star...like I said, consider the sanity of the source of information in this book...and do your best to not believe it unless someone in their right mind can confirm it.Otherwise, enjoy!"
0,"Pretentious Drivel People often rave about how great this album is -- I really don't see the appeal. At the risk of sounding simplistic, this CD is full of pretensious songs for pretentious people. Bad melodies, not catchy at all, very little edge. Awful. There is so much good music out there, I can't fathom why one would listen to this."
0,"huh? Why would I choose to listen to this when I already own every Black Sabbath album, and every Blue Chear album? I mean-it sounds like a cover band pretty much. But they will fare well in a music industry that does not favor creativity over a fashionable rehash. Such is life."
0,"CURVED, NOT STRAIGHT I bought these Trim Toenail Clippers because of ""NJMOM's Review"" above. NJMOM stated these clippers are ""STRAIGHT"" not ""CURVED"", WRONG, these clippers are CURVED!

0,Pet Groomer I believe the pet groomer would be better if it were smaller as it is difficult to hold. The pin brush head bristles are too hard. The large head makes the suction too strong for my dogs comfort. (I have 8 dogs from 10# to 90#)

We thought it was probably during shipping that it happened so we sent away for a replacement. The second set came, and two were in tact, the other one had a crack down the side. I just let it go and continued to use them...well....4 months later, they were stained, they ALL had cracks in them, down the sides, on the bottom (which means that anytime I put liquid in them they leak). They are practically falling apart after 4 months of use. KitchenAid can do better than this...I was very dissappointed!"
0,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY My son is a HUGE bat man fan. This was a must last christmas.. well we never could get it to stand up right and then bat man wouldnt slide down with out him pushing him the rest of the way. It came apart no matter how easy he was with it. And he lost interest less than a week of tring to make it work. He still wants a bat cave so we bought the older version (that has great reviews)instead this christmas so hopefully this one will be the one to make him happy and my pocket book.
0,"What a waste! This toy is a disaster. Who ever heard of a toy that you had to tape to the wall to balance. Every time it moves, it falls over or falls apart. This is the last time I will ever buy this type of toy. The worst part is the look of disappointment on my son's face the first time he tried to play with this. You people should be ashamed, it's like stealing our money at our children's expense!!!"
0,"This toy is not worth the money I sure wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this item! This is really the only toy my 6 yr old son asked for this Christmas! I couldn't believe how flimsy this toy is. There is no way he could even play with it. Everytime we tried to move it, it fell apart! I am very disappointed and do not recommend."
0,"This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration."
0,"Catastrophe Cave! The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son's birthday. It was a complete waste of money! The toy design is terrible! The batcave falls over when played with. The elevator doesn't function properly either. Because of all the malfunctions and collapes, my son lost interest within five minutes of play. If you want your child to have a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas go with something other than this toy."
0,"BATCAVE NO RAVE Couldn't wait to give this to my 6 yr. old son last year for Christmas since it was all he kept asking for. When he got it, what a disappointment it turned out to be. Putting it together was a real project & it kept falling apart. The heavier part of the item is towards the top so it had no real durability. The background that supposedly holds it up is made out of cardboard so that was a complete flop so forget about screwing it to the wall. He played with it for like 5 minutes & now it just sits in his room collecting dust & falling over. This year, he asked for the Transforming Gotham City. Maybe we'll try that & see what happens."
0,"Very Disappointed ... Well - this was my son's #1 request from Santa Claus. Despite the reviews, he brought it to our house. As expected, it is quite flimsy. It is sad to watch my 5 yr old struggle with the elevator while trying to give batman a ride. It is so pathetic how these toy companies take advantage of children, and (their parents!) with such poor quality merchandise."
0,"Worst Toy Ever = Batman Animated Batcave Do not buy this toy. If you are given this toy as a gift, return it for store credit. This is a flimsly and poorly designed stack of platic and paper. The secret door doesn't work, the elevator doesn't slide and toys get stuck in there. The suggested 10"" batman doesn't work with the zip line, bungee or even the elevator. The add says ""Using new adhesive technology, you can set up the Batcave on just about any wall"" so they want us to glue this thing on to a wall.Please don't buy this toy."
0,JUNK MY SON SAW THE NEW TV SHOW AND WANTED THE NEW BATCAVE. HE HAD THE ORIGINAL ONE BUT BOTH HIM AND I WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE SIZE. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU. IT IS BUILT VERY FLIMSY. THE PARTS FALL APART EASILY. THE ELEVATOR CANNOT BE USED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER BATMAN DOLLS TO PUT IN THERE . THE CARDBOARD BACKING FALLS OFF. THE STICKERS ARE A PAIN TO PUT ON. I SPENT 2 HRS ON X-MAS EVE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CAVE. MY SON HAS IT STUCK IN A CORNER. HE HAS MORE FUN LINING UP HIS ACTION FIGURES ON THE COUCH AND USING HIS IMIGINATION THAN THIS TOY. DO NOT GET IT. THE ORIGINAL BATCAVE IS BETTER. SMALLER BUT BETTER.
0,"Wrong Bruce, you idiots! Bruce BANNER turns into THE HULK, not THE BATMAN, morons! It's BRUCE WAYNE who turns into Batman. Maybe this toy would get better reviews if product specialists spent a LITTLE more time researching the list of who transforms into whom.Hulk SMASH stupid Batcave!"
0,"Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing We bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas and I am very sorry we spent our money on it. Putting it together was not fun, but the real disappointment came when it was done and you see what it is. I think it is unrealistic to think that most people will want to or ever allow this toy to be STUCK to the wall with an adhesive (it says not to leave it stuck there for long periods of time - you must remove it from the wall after playing with it - which means this flimsy piece of plastic is now laying on the floor). After playing with it for 10 minutes, the elevator gets stuck. The top keeps falling off, everytime I turn around my son is whining that this came apart or that came apart. I assume I will be super gluing it before long. I feel ripped off as a consumer. Buyer Beware!"
0,"POOR QUALITY I have been buying toys for my kids as well as my niece and nephew for 14 years and this is the worst quality toy I've purchased! In fact, I had better quality toys when I was a child. My 3 year old son insisted on having this for Christmas and he loves it despite the fact that we have it leaned against the wall to hold it up. It comes with adhesive but I don't want to risk damaging our walls. It is very top-heavy (the 3-level batcave is help up by a couple light-weight plastic tubes)and, though the idea of all the parts snapping in place is nice, I actually had to glue one part in place so it wouldn't fall in the floor. Speaking of pieces, there are a million of them! The directions could be written better also. I read the other reviews here after my son had his heart set on this toy and wish I could have talked him out of this one. Fortunately, he has enjoyed playing with it despite all its flaws but he got better quality $10 toys for Christmas than this one!"
0,Don't Buy The Batcave My 4 year old son received the Batcave for Christmas. I know it is about $40. It took my hubby 1/2 hour to put together - is EXTREMELY flimsy & my son got batman stuck in the bat elevator within the first 2 minutes of using it. Soooooo not worth it. What a let down.
0,"Unacceptable The Eurorack was purchased as a portable mixer to tie mics into a camera. The inherent noise in my particular mixer is completely unacceptable. At a very reasonable level using balanced connections the mixer unmistakably colors the sound with a clear sounding ""HISS"". Even when running on batteries and far away from any electronic device the HISS is incredibly loud! Totally unacceptable for my purpose. The unit is now stashed away in a closet, a washed up waste of time!However for those on a budget who desire much greater quality with fewer inputs I HIGHLY recommend a Mackie 402-VLZ3 Four-Channel Compact Audio Mixer. However sometimes fewer inputs are unacceptable. Whatever the case steer clear from behringer!"

0,"Terrible Picture Quality Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT buy this DVD. I think ever since the UFC switched to a different DVD distributor, the quality of their DVD's has gone through the floor.

I bought this DVD to enjoy watching Silva/Franklin over and over and over again, but I started getting a headache two minutes into it. Stay away from this.

0,"A waste of time This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like ""Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are."" The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of ""What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores."" What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."

0,Very Frustrating Piece of Office Equipment I have had the displeasure of working with this machine for over 4 years. Its incompetent feeder is only matched by the uselessness of the software it comes with. Save yourself the frustration and buy another scanner.
0,"ripped-off by seller American Electronics Mart sold me a ""refurbished"" Xerox documate 510 scanner that did not work from the start. I spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot to find out whether the problem was on my end. Then, because I missed the return deadline, they would not take the scanner back. They would not agree to pay the costs to me to ship the scanner back to them. Now, I have wasted $250 on a worthless piece of junk sold to me by these crooks. Don't ever buy anything from these creeps."
0,"JUNK - don't waste your money or time! My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago. We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently. It does not see heavy use. From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer. I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so, which I should not have to do, it helps the jamming and misfeed issue. Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website. When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually, but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads. So what would have cost $40.00 - bad enough - now costs $100.00 !! As if we haven't spent enough money and frustration on this thing. I am going to do my best to get rid of this thing and buy one that works!"
0,"Good scanner - poor software Don't buy this scanner, if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document. The ""SCANDIRECT"" software that ships with this product WILL NOT scan multiple pages into one document. When you feed 5 pages into the ADF (automatic document feeder) thinking you'll get one document with 5 pages ---WRONG.. you get 5 documents with one page each.Just UPGRADE your paperport software for a minimum of $100, and then you can use the scanner as it was designed. When I called to complain to XEROX about this, I was told that they had ""mated"" this scanner and the software (Version 9) before the ADF was added as part of the base scanner. Seemed pretty crappy to me. IT GOING BACK to the store tomorrow."
0,"complete nuisance I set it up according to the directions, clicked the scan button, and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process. Uninstalled it, then re-installed it, and the same thing happened. Complete and utter waste of my time. I gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box."
0,"Compatible ONLY with their software Bad Scanner. Only with their software are you able to scan in paperwork. Paperport causes more problems with the computers I have it installed on than any other product I know of. If you have anything greater than Adobe Acrobat 5 installed, you can't use Acrobat to scan in software. Stay away from the Documate line of scanners!"
0,Decent player... while it lasts After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative's players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn't expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.
0,"Poor substitute for an iPod Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better, iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap."
0,"A Possible Discontinued Item? What's going on Creative Labs? Is it a coincidence that I no longer can get any of your Nomad Zen Xtras (worst name ever) at Best Buy and now the 60GB Nomad Xtra is ""sold out"" or more likely ""discontinued"" at the almighty Amazon.com? hmmmmm...."
0,"Buy it! I've had my Zen for over 4 years now (hard to believe I've had it that long). I still haven't filled up the memory on it, I've never had a day's trouble with it, and it's easy to use. I'm starting to find it a bit bulky now in comparison to some of the smaller, sleeker-looking players on the market, but I still have the attitude ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". The zen is superb, it's reliable, it's solid and easy to use, and I just don't see the point in changing to an ipod purely for aesthetics. I love my zen, and I wouldn't be without it."
0,What a junk What a junk. Every time NOMAD thinks the file is corrupt the OS freezes. The only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode. So if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen OS you can't use NOMAD until you get home. After OS froze twice on me in the subway I returned the jukebox.
0,"Why can't it be rated ZERO stars? DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT--I took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended. Nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke. The software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other SOUND BLASTER products, which is very dumb."
0,"Many Flaws in Mellor's 'Nursery Knits' This book's patterns are seriously flawed. My attempt to follow the ""outdoor snuggly"" for a 0-3 month old baby resulted in a 32 inch waistline snuggly with legs that were too long and arms that were too short. In addition, the photos of the snuggly did not match the pattern's instructions. My cousin used the baby poncho pattern and had a myriad of similar problems. Do NOT buy this book!"

0,"Tallant's ""creative"" talent Voodoo in New OrleansThis is an old classic which, if you are interested in either ""Voodoo"" or New Orleans, you probably should read. However, you can ignore the old adage of taking what Robert Tallant had to say with a grain of salt; you will need an entire salt lick to handle this slim volume. It is colorful, exciting, and alas, mostly the product of Robert Tallant's fevered imagination. What facts he didn't get wrong, he completely fabricated.Plenty of scholars have already weighed in on the problems presented and alas, also created by this small piece of creative fiction. It's very entertaining, although occasionally offensive. Mostly, it should not be taken seriously.Eoghan Ballard (Ph.D. Folklore. University of Pennsylvania 2005)"
0,"If you want to know about New Orleans Voodoo, avoid this rag If you are interested in reading a bunch of ignorant, bigoted stereo types, by all means buy this book.Robert Tallant was not a writer to bother with facts when spewing his hatred and racism.His depictions of New Orleans Voodoo and it's practitioners are dead wrong.If you want to read about New Orleans Voodoo, try Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau by Martha Ward."
0,"Wow I actually give this ZERO stars. But had to give it a star due to Amazon's rules.The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson's involvment with Manson. That's just a part of it. And warning, that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know. I know Brian Wilson is the brains behind the Beach Boys, but this documentary was predominantly about Brian. This should have been titled: ""Brian Wilson and the Satan (featuring the rest of them)"".I've seen other Beach Boys documentaries (even made for tv movies) that were better than this jumpy compilation. I felt like I was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had ADD."
0,"What a piece of junk! Recently, I went and bought this CD Player, i was going to geta ... Sony one but ended up with this one instead cuz' it was cheap u know? Well, this one I bought didn't even have antiskip protection at all! It skips whenever I go and it eat batteries like crazy! I had wasted over 10 batteries within a month. What a piece of junk! I don't think this product differs either so I recommend not buying it and get a better product. In fact, I just going to get a new CD Player from KOSS which I think will be better. This is not worth your time, and the cd players ugly too!"
0,"DON'T BUY THIS ONE! I purchased this product just a few months ago and it's broken already.

0,"THIS THING SUCKS Not only is the heat (btu)rating false, (in my oppinion), but to me it doesnt put out heat at all (relivently speeking) the tip over feature has prevented the unit from opperating several times in the 3 hours since i recieved it.. furthermore.. i will never purchace a heater made of plastic.. think about it.. plastic melts and metal doesnt (at the advertised tempurature) the fan speed i would equate to a gentle breeze if that. the heat output is far, far, below what i would have expected based on the advertisement.. basically in my oppinion this product is worthless to purchase unless you are trying to heat a refrogerator box sized space 5 degrese in a 70 degree enviroment.. look elsewhere for your heating needs."
0,"OUTDATED 1)The problems in the book are very outdated. (for grammar section buy Cliff's or Longman)2)The problems in the book are less difficult than those on a real exam.3)The problems in the book were arranged in very boring manner.4)The CD-Rom is only for Listening. (for more computer practice buy Delta's Key for Toefl Test with CD, which has 10 tests or Cambridge Preparation for Toefl Test, which has 7 tests. Both books have CD-Rom simulated CBT.)5) The Essay section is fair. (for the best essay section buy Cambridge Preparation for the Toefl Test)Generally, there is no one book for the preparation for the TOEFL. Most likely you will need some combination of them.For instance,a) Delta for practice and reading. Moreover, you may wish to buy just Delta CD Rom without book and cassets for practice only;b)Cliff's or Longman for grammar;c)Cambridge for essay and for practice.Good luck!"
0,CD Was missing I dont find any CD inside the book. It was really matter of disgrace that CD was missing after shifting. While I was going for the purchase it was mentioned that the CD will be available but it was missing
0,"Hardly worth reading This book, while fairly well written, was quite a dull story, and was very depressing to read. Sherwood seems to have researched her subject well, but the book seemed to be unnecessarily vulgar in a number of places, and this made the book all the more unpleasant to read."
0,"Case doesn't fit phone properly The case I had didn't fit properly - the window obstructed the rightmost side of the display. You could shift it over, but it would always shift back.

Nothing to restock at Discount Jungle, send the piece of junk back to Sandisk!!!Save some headaches and buy something different!

0,"cheap After about 3 months things started going down hill really fast. After leaving it in the car on a summer day something went wrong with the with the power saver. I'd charge it over night and the next morning it would be dead. I'd listen to it for 5 minutes, turn it off, then turn it back on and it would be at half power. Recently the screen broke. That just gave me a good reason to get rid of it.Trust me, keep looking."

0,"Wow the battery life is bad! If you have ever had an iPod you will kick yourself for buying this player. Replaced my iPod Nano because the battery life was fading. Unfortunately, there is no way to get the advertised 35 hours of advertised battery life. You should expect 6 to 8 hours.It is crashy. It occationally corrupts the tracks when it crashes. The screen is average. Getting podcsts to show up as podcasts has been frustrating. Forget about video podcasts. You will be spending a significant amount of time formatting them. Of course, you should expect even worse battery life.The reason the iPod Nano is $130; it works!"
0,"Think twice about buying this player ! I purchased this player last August and it worked fine for 4 months, even though I didn't play it much. My intent was to use it primarily on plane flights. Suddenly and for no reason, I was unable to easily insert the earphones into the player. With a little effort, I was finally able to insert the earphone, but could not get any sound.I contacted Sandisk and was very disappointed with their response. The player has a 1-year warranty but it's very apparent that Sandisk is attempting to discourage replacing defective products by making purchasers jump through hoops to test the product and prove it is defective rather than immediately fixing or replacing it. If the player won't work as advertised, why should I be inconvenienced as a result.In addition, a senior service person was supposed to contact me about the problem, but has not done so. I would never purchase a Sandisk product in the future -- too difficult to deal with if there's a warranty problem !"
0,"Sansa View 8 GB This item is one of the worse I have seen in the Sansa family. I have had all the Sansa E200 series mp3 players and those froze at times when viewing video. Good sound when you use better headphones. The only thing that is good about this mp3 player is the large view screen. The conversion software always freezes after the video file has been converted meaning that you have to Ctrl<Alt<Delete to shut down the program. As a 'techie', I recommend that you don't buy this item. Oh! one more thing! Do not order via the free shipping that Amazon offers. It's just 'standard' meaning you could have you item delivered to you way past the scheduled mailing time or not at all. It's been a month now and I still haven't recieved my original order alhough Amazon was gracious to resend the item, but I had to get it sent to my job which amazingly got there much faster through the same type shipping.

0,"SECOND and LAST time around for Sandisk e series This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player. The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months. I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280. I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of ""reading"" and then back to the Sandisk logo screen. It will do that for hours and hours on end. My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off. The only Sansa product I've ever loved was the discontinued M series players -they're few and far between and highly sought after."
0,"Returned the View twice in one week I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles, so I decided to buy a View for my boyfriend. Right out of the box, the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck. We tried everything but nothing would happen. The customer service people could not turn it on also, so we exchanged that one. The next one we received at least turned on. We went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on. Thats where trouble came. For video and pictures, you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter. I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player. We tried different files, different computers, and different people and nothing. My boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck. I have transferred music, video, and photos to my sansa e280 with no problems, but this player has many problems."
0,"Did not work out of the box I got the View for Christmas for my daughter after her Sansa Fuze died after several years of heavy use. It would never charge right out the box using both the USB or the electric charger I have for my own Fuse. I went online and tried everything the sandisk site said-nothing worked. Got the online chat who informed me that I had to use e-mail to resolve the issue since the View is a ""Legacy"" item. Sent an e-mail and never got a response. Their customer service department needs a lot... of help. On the plus side, sent it back to Amazon who gave A+++ refund service. Thanks Amazon!"
0,"Worst mp3 player on the market.

This is about the worst mp3 player on the market. Sound quality is so-so. I cannot create or save any playlists. The worst aspect of this player is the battery life.

I for one will never buy anythign that has the SanDisk name on it."

They also told me the battery is not replaceable and after warranty you throw these units away.

0,"Poor Qiality Control Despite the many reviews from folks who had to return one or more Sansa Views before getting a functional one, I figured the manufacturer must have cleared up their quality problems to stay in the market. Wrong!!!!My brand new Sansa View 8 totally stopped functioning about 20 minutes into its first use. I'm very disappointed to have waited for my order to be filled and now must wait again for a replacement. I'm more than a month into my purchase and I have nothing to show for it but a paid bill.Amazon has not stepped up at all, either. The order was filled by a vendor whom I've never heard of before. Amazon refers buyers to that vendor's customer service and takes no part in satisfying the purchaser.Lots of room for improvement on the part of all three providers."
0,"Has one important major flaw Had no luck, even with latest firmware, getting the unit to resume any of my audio books. I tried changing the tags on the mp3 files but it did not work. The unit would go into auto shut off and then force you to start your audio book file from the start every time."

This woman adds fat, additives, and perservatives when there is not need at all. For example, she adds mayonnaise to store bought salad dressing, basically for no reason. But most of all, she is advocating that packaged foods are the way to go. That is simply not good. The human body is meant meant to take in the amounts of chemicals that are contained in her recipes.

Otherwise there are 5 other sample structures wwhich have no building instructions and that is it.I put this completely in the category of good idea but bad reality.

0,"didn't fit my ears Complete waste of money. All three sizes pushed my Jawbone ICON out too far from my face to make contact with my jawbone.I know my ears stick out ... I am not dumbo though. This was a waste of money for me, thankfully they were only 10 bucks.I went back to the ear pads that came with the ICON... Is stays in for a while as long as i don't move... Not quite battlefield worthy as JB claims..."
0,Terrible design I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear. They seem to be made of a very thick silicone that has a slightly slippery feel to them. I was really disappointed with these. Stay away if you have small ear canals.
0,Worthless None of the gels came close to fitting in my ear - I ended up using the little rubber ring in the kit on my Jabra bluetooth to keep it from slipping out. Highly not recommended...
0,"They do not honer their return policy and the product was not what I ordered. DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sent me Jabra EarGels claiming they fit the Jawbone Prime 2. They did not. Because I had them for 28 days, they would not take them back. Their return policy stated that you can return up to 30 days.DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,Waste of money This product ended up being a waste of money for me. They didn't fit too well so I ended up just using the original Jawbone ear piece with the these.
0,don't buy these were advertised to fit the habra stone. they did not. i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it. not even one piece fit. threw them away
0,"Not well suited for the Jawbone II When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic. They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it. Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset. The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear. I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so. I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all."
0,"Stick it in your ear! I own one of the Jawbone torture devices. I had an old Jabra with the mini ear gels and just for giggles swapped out the hard plastic stock Jawbone things with them. It was an amazing difference. The Minis fit very well and direct the sound into your ear channel. Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]"
0,"Thanks for nothing, Jabra Jabra directed me to these as a replacement for the lost pieces for my Wave. THESE ARE NOT what I need. Meh. Gonna be two more weeks before I get home to return them.I don't blame the merchant, blame Jabra for directing me to waste weeks buying, waiting for, and returning the wrong stuff. Swedish morons"
0,"useless For some reason the makers of this item thought it would be wise to make each size ear piece fit a different bluetooth. The small fits my Jawbone, but does not fit my ear. The large fits my ear just fine, but does not fit my Jawbone. Save your money and find a different product."
0,"Old and yellowed Ordered the EarGels, but they had been exposed to time and heat. They were yellowed and sticky. I threw them away - wasn't worth it to return it. Won't order from here again."
0,"Great effects...NO HEART NO PASSION The special effects of this film were wonderful--no debate there--but Armand Assante seems like he's sleep-walking through this movie. It LOOSELY follows the poem at parts and suffers from a severe lack of passion! Compare this film with the 1950's ""Ulysses"", which despite poor effects, had MUCH more passionate and inspired portrayals of the characters by Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn among others. Even the classic scene involving Argos the dog was ommitted from this modern creation. Ugh!On the flip side, Athena's portrayal by Isabella Rossellini and the actor playing the god Mercury are very fun to watch in ""The Odyssesy"". Still...not enough to do the story justice."
0,"absolutely HORRIBLE I have never been so disgusted (or sickenly entertained) by a movie before. I am one of the few who have ACTUALLY read the ODYSSEY. I did like the poem. After reading it, I decided to watch the movie. There were almost NO accurate allusions at all to the poem. The characters' acting skills were that of an elementary school kids, and the scenes were obviously fake. I feel bad for Homer, he must be spinning in his grave. The fact that got 4 out of 5 stars is most appalling. I feel sorry for humanity as it is, believing such [nonsense] is the work of Homer."
0,"WOW Watching this movie after having read the book is pretty much hell. The fact that they changed the whole plot from the book makes it seem like a joke. Then the ""special effects"" just made it even worse. Even if you haven't read the book and you don't know the real story, the movie was still horribly directed and filmed. There are no transitions, and the actors don't seem to realize they are all in one movie together. They all have their own accents and the only thing they have in common with the characters they are playing from the book is their names. The only reason anyone should ever watch this movie is out of complete boredom and a need to make fun of something."
0,"Uhh..... Were they stoned? This was the biggest piece of drunken hoopla in the WORLD! I can't believe people would actually take time out of their daily schedule to watch this! If you actually read The Odyssey, the movie is NOTHING like the real thing. I STRONGLY suggest that you read the book first. Well, anyways, no one is going to read this review thus rendering this review useless and something to clutter the internet even more than it already is. I AM THE ANTICRHIST!"
0,"Uggh Yes, yes the movie was bad, really bad, so bad that if Homer was still alive to see it, he would be doing something similar to the TV that Mr. N does when he watches Boston Public. But how bad it was is beside the point. Who really cares if some of the people in our class are writing Mr. N's ideas on here. If I were him, I would be flattered to know that people beleived strongly enough in my ideas to take the time to write about it on amazon.com. To everyone who wrote a review on this horrific movie, and didnt criticize other people's reviews, good for you. I hope in the future we can all express our disgust with this movie without having our competency as an honors student questioned by someone who won't even tell us who they are. But until then, Lizzie Mcguire is on (hehehe) so I must be going. I'll see you all periods 1/2. - Andrew"
0,"More like a NEGATIVE 3 This comes close to being the worse piece of garbage it has ever been my privilege to view. The acting...HORRENDOUS!!! CGI...poorly done. Do yourself a favor and watch the Roman version of the Odyssey...Ulysses with Kirk Douglas. It may be an oldie, but it's definitely an absolute goodie!!"
0,"I agree I totally agree with andrew...and by the way, people who dont know any of us and dont really know whats going on...please dont waste your time with this movie...you're better off watching old reruns of whos the boss...even though im deprived of cable and wouldnt know...most of you probably know who this is"
0,"Blech This movie was the epitome of, well, everything wrong with movies. It took the premise of adapting Homer's literary classic and completely butchered it into this...osbstrocity. With acting that would pale in comparison to an elementary school play, a script that would make Ed Wood blush, and some of the words special effects ever, it truly makes me sad for humanity.The one good point is that it makes for some great ""in"" jokes. Telemakhos's double spear throw has become a running gag at my school."
0,"THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER! As a Detroit Red Wings fan, I must say that I loved this version of the Odyssey! This special effects were absolutly wonderful, and I must say I love the acting, some of the best i've ever seen in my life, almost better than sergey federov acting to get hit to draw a high sticking call! There was more action than Chelios misses checks! Oh, and there were more holes in this movie than Curtis Joseph leaves in his net. This movie was wodderful"
0,"Yeah, watching it felt like 10 years, too. NBC miniseries tells the tale of the Greek hero Odysseus, played flatly by Armand Assante. Boring adventure film features unlikeable characters, routine action scenes, and a lack of spirit and passion. This all builds up to a surprisingly very bloody conclusion (Given its TV roots).* 1/2 out of *****"
0,"Ouch! This movie was so bad, it was funny Everything about this movie was baaadddd....From the everchanging accents, the fake special effects(the cyclops looked so fake that it took away from the movie), the movie was so flawed that it became more entertaining to look for the flawed parts than actually watch the movie. Yeah, this movie sucked."
0,"Hallmark Entertainment needs to join us in the 21st Century It is extremely sad that Hallmark Entertainment has not realized that hard of hearing and deaf people need closed captioning to understand the product they are marketing. If they have realized this, then they obviously could care less about disabled people of any kind."
0,"Awful, just awful Armand Assante is one of the worst actors I have ever had the misfortune to watch. He could not act dead if you put a bullet in his brain. The odyssey is a great story and it deserves a great actor. I would rate this movie zero stars if I had the option."
0,"Who be dissin on our noteboom? Ok, first of all Mr.Cmndrnineveh from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA I find it very hard to believe that you even read the full book version of THE ODYSSEY. God knows if you did you wouldnt be madly in love with this made-for-TV movie THE ODYSSEY. Personally i think the only ppl this movie does good too are druggies and wanna-be drop outs who dont want to read the book or buy the cliff notes so they watch the movie. its absolutley horrible. Mr. Noteboom is a very bright and brillant honors teacher in Washington state. I must say i agree with every honor student's last year review of this book. To the point where Telemachous was whiny and horrible; Athena had blue eyes; and Menelaos' hair is black. All i gotta say is what a waste of film! Ppl out there- spare yourself."
0,Can't get worse This book is bad (period). It is very incoherent and ill-organized. The examples are vague and serve anything but support the material. Very theoritical with hardly any real life applications. Lacking in modern AI topics/game design.
0,"Nauseating In a phrase: as nauseating as the ""artwork"" which besmirches its cover. This book is definitely not worth the price. Donate the money instead to your city's homeless instead! You will learn as much about AI by doing so and will actually contribute something to the world. Of course, the cover makes a great prank at cocktail parties. Place it under someone's drink and it will look like the beverage has been spilled.Winston's book is not only disorganized, but pretentious. He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer. Winston and his books will go down in history with the works of others, such as Doug Lenat, who made their fame primarily by doing something very easy before anyone else got around to doing it.Real AI is yet to come."
0,"RE: Wipeout originally by Surfaris Google the instrumental Wipeout , and you will read the real story. I love the Surfari's version which got to #2 on the Billboard charts in a matter of weeks."
0,"A pitiful excuse for a movie If you want to see a movie of Moby Dick, see the John Huston directed version, with screenplay by Ray Bradbury. This pitiful excuse for a movie was made by people who had no knowledge of New England, whaling, whales, or Herman Melville's epic novel. The grand poetry, the vivid imagery, the theological symbolism which fill ""Moby Dick"" are all missing in this shell of a film. Even Stewart's performance is a disappointment--Khan in Star Trek II does a better job of spouting Ahab's venom than Stewart's anemic portrayal.The additions to the story are meaningless (Chinese harpooners, Queequeg's ""BLAH!"" noises,Ahab's family)...and the omissions are puzzling (Elijah).And the rubber whale--who is unscarred, unmarked by corkscrew harpoons, ungrizzled, unbarnacled, with no flight of gulls--well, he looks like a rubber whale."
0,"TERRIBLE MOVIE What a waste of 2 hours. Nothing gets accomplished at all! You watch some terrible graphics, watch everyone die, and they didn't even kill the freaking WHALE!That made me mad.This film accomplishes nothing.There is no point at all to this movie.Don't waste your time, money, and energy.Leave, quickly!"
0,"DRASTIC EDITS RUIN THE VHS VERSION It seems that there are several different versions of this TV movie available. Rumor has it that the movie that was originally broadcast on USA came in at 3 hours, there is a laser disc version of the movie that is 145 minutes long, and the VHS version is 120 minutes long. Unfortunately, the edits made to the VHS version are so extreme, abrupt, and awkward that it makes the movie virtually unwatchable. You can't help but feel that you're missing something."
0,"Ordered this item 3 weeks ago still waiting.... The description said usually ships in 1-2 business days, well it's been 1 month and I have another month to go until I recieve this item. Don't believe the descriptions! I ordered this 3 weeks ago now the delivery estimate is the end of November. If you are cold and need this item this year don't buy it from Amazon. It probably won't arrive until February! It's going to take 2 months for delivery! Just a warning!"
0,"Dreadful. Ms. Perry's depiction of post-traumatic head injury is completely irresponsible. She apparently did no research at all. Amnesia of the type she describes here does not exist. Thus, the underlying premise of this book unbelievable, even infuriating, to anyone with the most basic knowledge of brain injury. In addition to this, Monk's investigative skills are virtually nonexistent. His interviews with informants and suspects are fragmentary and incomplete. Suspense is not built, action is nearly absent, and the eventual solution is anticlimactic. Laden with turgid prose, this book is absolutely dreadful."
0,"This was the slowest and most non-action, action movie ever. To start off, this movie lacks any direction, also there is no build up of excitment, no rising interest, and little or no action till the very end. I love Van-Damme movies and especially actioners of all types but I found myself desperately trying to stay awake through this. Watch this movie if you have alot of time to hopelessly squander."
0,"Van Damme gives the best performance, which does not bode well for the movie. The other actors are just so horrible and the story so flat. Don't get me wrong, I like Jean-Claude, movies like Timecop and Bloodsport were pretty good for what they were. The fighting scenes in Black Eagle just don't make up for a lame movie though."
0,"worst action movie ever Totally fake, unrealistic, plotless. I love action movies, but this one just didn't have any action in it. You could see the missed punches and fake reactions--I can't believe that anyone would pay money for this movie"
0,Seems every time Van Damme plays a bad guy he does his mute method acting Black Eagle was released a few months after Van Damme became a star with Bloodsport. The film could have made Van Damme a wash up but luckily it didn't. The martial arts chorography in the film is very sloppy and the fight scene between Sho Khogusi and Van Damme is weak. Skip this one
0,"I wish I could give 0 stars I must admit that I'm not a big Van Damme fan. Still, I try to keep an open mind. Not only was the sound terrible, but it was so obvious that the punches were checked, that it would have made a comedy if the plot weren't so boring. I think that Woody Allen could make a better action picture than this attempt."
0,"Didn't work...I have to start again My (indoor) cat contracted fleas about a month ago and I used the Zodiac spray on the carpet, upholstery, curtains, and mattresses as I went about treating the apartment. I also used the Zodiac sponge bath (2 treatments/bottle, used both) and one course of the Frontline topical medicine. Today I was brushing my cat and found more fleas. My vet informed me that they have heard nothing but complaints from pet owners who've used the Zodiac products.The label claims that: ""One treatment gives continuous protection against pre-adult fleas for 7 months."" I used the spray generously but here I am 1 month later right back where I started.Just treating my 2-bedroom apartment for fleas is a costly and tedious task. If you're going to go through this, make sure you use the BEST products available. Talk to your vet and explore ALL your options. GOOD LUCK!"
0,"A charismatic Lutheran who's more charismatic than Lutheran This work is an enthusiastic encouragement and guidebook for charismatic renewal among Lutherans. However, it offers some dangerous theology. For example, it suggests that it's okay to make mistakes when first trying to prophesy--that everybody needs practice. However, this is contrary to Scripture. God takes false prophecy very seriously, but unfortunately Mr. Christenson does not."
0,"Sad Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite Authors. This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up. Some of the characters you never figure out why they are in the novel at all.It's too bad that I spent money on this book when I could have purchased a Mercedes Lackey Novel without help."
0,"Mercedes wrote this? I've been a longtime fan of Mercedes and own most of her Valdemar series. So, of course, I picked this book up at my local store. After wrestling through 50 pages, I gave up! I plan to sell it back to my local store ASAP- this is nothing better than a paperweight in my bookshelves. The worst part is, my boyfriend picked it up and tried reading it. Now he thinks that this is a good example of her work!"
0,"This book has already been written Mercedes Lackey contributed to a series I'll refer to as the Merovingian Nights Series, set in a universe invented by C.J. Cherryh. Mercedes's ORIGINAL contribution to the Merovingian Nights series is a far better read. The Shadow of the Lion was a major disappointment to me, not to mention I could have spent my money more wisely on another book. There should have been a warning posted on the cover or flap that if the reader has read the Merovingian Nights series, this book will offer very few surprises. Shame on you Ms. Lackey!"
0,"CHEESY! And I don't mean Parmigiano-Reggiano! As a previous reviewer said, it pulled out every single American cliche about Italy in the book, which is pretty much what I had expected. But oh my GAWD was this awful! I was laughing hysterically at this. As bad as a low budget miniseries."
0,"A great idea! Hey gang, let's pool our resources and get the rights so Mystery Science Theater can talk us through this one!I'm telling you it would surpass even Manos, Hands of Fate for sheer yuks. The cheese, the schmatz, the dishonesty, the cluelessness, the pretention of this flick just begs, begs to be put out of its misery."
0,"very much disappointed It was just terrible for me, living in Italy for many years now. I hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of Italian men. it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View."
0,"The Book is WAY Better..and That's all You Really Need to Know! Don't waste your money on a DVD unless: 1) You just want to see beautiful Italian scenery (and it is gorgeous!) or 2) You actually enjoy watching a whiny, sniveling, pathetic female character waiting for a man to fulfill her life. Doubt if the author was thrilled with this version of her story. BUY THE BOOK!!! It's a great read."
0,"Boring, Drawn Out Movie I watched the movie before reading the book. The movie was so bad that I felt compelled to read the book to see if it could redeem itself. The characters as depicted in the movie were very one dimensional and I just didn't care about them or what happened to them. The book tells a totally different story than is depicted in the movie and is SO MUCH BETTER."
0,"Terrible movie I rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things I had heard talked about it, like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery. What a disappointing story!The story had no sense of direction. It seemed badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were saying, ""we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the real estate man."" All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character."
0,"under the Tuscany Sun Was Very Very disappointed!! Movie though brand new, just out of the box it was stopping all the time during the latter part of the movie."
0,"not worthy to be a chick flick First, this movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the book except for the title. That said, once again Diane Lane plays someone who is supposed to be sympathetic as if she's a sociopath. Really - when she looks serious, you think she's about to kill someone. When she's happy she looks like she just did. Then you have the fact that nothing that happens in the movie is realistic at all -- except, if someone like Cameron Diaz were in the title role, we'd probably not care and even enjoy it. I feel used and cheap after being duped into watching this movie and I'm no longer going to waste my time on DL's films. She doesn't deliver. If she plays a Black Widow, I'll watch. If she plays another sensitive caring woman, I'll hurl first."
0,"Good Fun? This is a fun movie if you like the romantic comedy.Why 1 star?? There is a scene where an old woman calls ayoung German couple ""facists"". The irony is, the old lady is Italian. Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."
0,"Make Sure the Format is in Your Region I'm such a goof! I automatically assumed that the format of this DVD was for North America Region. I was so excited when it came in, I opend the package and went straight to my player to watch. Opps! I discovered that the PAL format is not readable on my player. Though, I am aware of the many video formats out there, I still assumed that this DVD was just like any other DVD or Blue Ray that I have pruchased.The PAL is for countries like Japan and Europe, I confirmed my findings when I red the back information of the DVD package.Good thing that I have an adopted daughter in France, she will like this DVD. It's just her format! :-)Please be carefule when purchaseing video's on amazon...read carefuly that the format is for your country or else you may end up disapointed."
0,"For MEN only maybe they are clever enough to figure out why these actresses,directors, producers, etc. are still in circulation.This film is not only BORING BORING BORING but also an INSULT to everyone ... except perhaps the Far Eastern looking ""actress"" who gets to play the ""friend"" of the protagonist, and who fairly deliberately ruins what was supposed to be a one night-stand (one-night lay to be more precise) anyway, on the part of the slow, but dark-looking Italian HOD (hunk of the day, my abbreviation, he-he). Don't worry, a bearded, rugged looking American is going to fill the Italian's rubber shoes ... Sorry for italianizing and americanizing but there is more than enough of that going on in the film, at least on the DVD version.The film forgot to elaborate on the potential dangers of adult owls snatching kittens though, as it's a romantic, and not a realistic view of the world, and it was definitely not meant to be a horror flick. Then again, some of the scenes are pure horror."
0,Boooring..... This was the most boring movie and the most wretched performance I have ever seen from Diane Lane. All she did was sigh through the first 45 minutes.
0,wrong formAt I may have read the description wong but the DVD won't play. States wrong source. In small letters on the box it says it's the UK version. Can't fiind by receipt so I can't return it. I was really looking forward to sharing it with someone special. :(
0,"Dismal I hated this dismal movie. Not completely, of course. Diane Lane, the villa, Italy and the builders are lovely, but the story is dismally surreal. First you have the divorce, then the lesbian couple, then a gay tour bus, then some promiscuous italians, then more breakups, then a nice pormiscuous fellow writer. Yuck. There is no romance in this movie - this is not romantic, it's a biological and twisted tale of some womens pre-menopausal angst and bedroom problems. And as if her bedroom problems weren't enough, we get everbody else's too. What happened to nice normal romantic comedys in the Audrey Hepburn style?"
0,"Non vero Italia! This not a window into Italy, but rather an American contrivance of Italy. Cliches abound. Comedy forced. I have disowned all who claim to even mildly enjoy this movie. Questa film e' merda."
0,"If you liked this movie, you might have a brain damage Easily, the worst film of the year.Manipulative, ham-fisted, sloppy, insulting mess of a movie.Imagine some chick-flick parody in ""The Simpsons"" and you'll get pretty close (add some strange PC garbage for a good measure).Close to a bad soap opera episode.BTW I like both Diane Lane and Tuscany , but nothing can redeem this gross and pathetic caricature.I've learnt my lesson though - Audrey Wells work is to be avoided at all costs."
0,"Italian-American Fairy Tale set in the 21 st Century? I should have read the reviews before wasting $10 bucks at BB for this used dvd. I bought it for my wife. She wanted to see it but as I write this review I am watching it with her and we both think this movie is a fairy tale. Please, please...if this movie had any sense of reality I would be the first one to move to Italy. Enough! Read what others have said before me for more specific. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
0,"Terrible movie, Great scenery From the onset, this movie was stilted and poorly developed. While Diane Lane is wonderful in some other films, she was(or her character was) irritating at best in this one. The plot is trite, Hollywood drivel. Some of the costuming and lightingwere well-done. I'd like my two hours back. This one is definitely going to be donated to the library where people canbe tortured by it for free -- but not me (again)!"
0,"BORING!!! I rented this movie while my husband was out of town, looking forward to a good chick flick. By the middle of my movie, I couldn't believe I was still sitting there, and by the end, I wanted my $4.00 back from Blockbuster. The story did not keep my attention and the pregnant friend has got to be the worst actress ever. I do not recommend this at all!"
0,"Just not the same Quality as Canon Batteries. After about a year of using this generic battery from China, the battery is quickly fading away. It will not hold charges and seems to make my camera actually reject the battery. When using this replacement battery, my camera will sometimes shut off or will not even turn on. I will not ever buy a cheap replacement battery for my expensive cameras. China is producing some really bad products lately, using cheap materials and cheap labor. Those products seem inferior to factories from other countries, especial USA, Japan, Germany. You have been warned."

0,THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER! SEEN I saw this movie in theaters with a friend and my brother. I was expecting a exciting movie but it was exactly NOT that! The movie doesn't make sense and there really isn't a plot. Don't waste your time or your money on this movie!
0,"A Confusing Waste of Plastic The movie has a vague plot, meaningless items, (like the facial tattoo), and a loud, annoying soundtrack which frequently overwhelms the dialog. The additional injection of non-english conversations, which it only translated occasionally, simply adds to the confusion. No real resemblence to either the novel or the original movie. I'd find 90 minutes of the Shopping Channel more entertaining."
0,"Why, oh why, oh why! Im begging you now do NOT watch this film at any cost. It is an awful thing (cant bring myself to call it a film) with shoddy acting horrendous set design and one of the most fake, boring scripts ever. If you really want to buy it I suggest purchasing it for the pure pleasure of watching it burn!"
0,"Why? Oh Why? This is just an outrage. The temptation to re-make movies is evidence of the fact that there is little creativity in Hollywood. This movie is evidence that there are people in Hollywood who should not be allowed to go to movies let alone make them.The original is not all that great, but it was in fact original and had some very interesting photography and stunts. This version is insipid to the point of stupidity; the photography stinks, and the stunts are mostly cut-and-paste special effects.The people who made this should be banned from any association to movie making for life! So why did I buy it? By mistake! I had a copy of the original and thought a comparison would be interesting. I was wrong. Learn from my error and avoid this like the very plague."

0,"Great movie, if you have the mind of a 10 year-old The setting for this movie is not in the future!!!! It is current day, and takes place in a poor European country. The arena they skate in looks like a very cheap prop from American Gladiators. There is VERY LITTLE SPECIAL EFFECTS and no high tech equipment.15 minuets of the movie is done with a night vision camera, so everything you see is either dark green or picth black.Most of the action happens within the rollerball arena. There are only a few action sceens on the streets of the city."
0,"Rollerball ROCKED In Theatres,... ""Rollerball"" in theatres was an awesome, bone-crunching, action-packed movie! But once it got on video & DVD...they added in nudity & took out scenes.

WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TRANFERED THE FILM?"
0,"Horrible stupid movie Nothing more to say, this is one of the worst movies ever. Bad script, stupid story, terrible shooting, boring acting. I highly don't recommend this title."
0,"R? What the heck? This movie is rated R! The theatrical version was rated PG-13! Now I'm not allowed to get or see this movie, which was only mediocre to begin with. Great job!"
0,Appalling This is a grotesque despoliation of a classic film. Essential elements of the background storyline are not properly established. There are scenes whose purpose within the overall structure simply defies understanding. The nighttime 'escape attempt' sequence is shot in a bizarre green blur and was extremely unpleasant to watch. Hideous music plays frequently but the nail in the coffin of this film is the poverty of the in-game action sequences. These are generally nothing more than a confusing melange of images. The transitions from one camera shot to another seem very poorly done and it is really impossible to follow the internal dynamics of each game.
0,"TERRIBLE MOVIE! DO NOT BUY! This movie was one of the worst films I've seen in years. The script is horrible, the movie had little glitches on it, and a big scene of the movie is shot in night vision (GREEN!) If you are thinking of buying this movie, read this review. I'd give this movie 0 stars, but the minimum is 1 star."
0,"The Worst Movie Ever! This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen! The plot was impossible to follow, the action confusing and flashy, and the film editing awful. For example, there is one sequence in which a motorcycle crashes through a chain link fence and the sound effect boingongong is heard, like a spring snapping. Ridiculous! Concept - Terrible, Acting - Worse, Execution - Rollerball looks like it was made in 2 weeks using 2 computers that didnt work. I reccommend that you see this movie, just so you can tell your friends you've seen the worst movie ever made!"
0,"Top Ten Worst Movies I ever Saw This is somewhere up there as one of the worst movies I ever saw. Its not hard to find faults in this movie because its full of them.I was horrified by how poorly the first rollerball game scene was shot. It was so uninteresting and almost impossible to follow what was going on that it was PATHETIC. There was no doubt in my mind after the first fifteen minutes that this was the worst intro to a film I had ever seen.It got somewhat better as the weak plot developed and there was less action shots of them playing this ridiculous game.I normally end with something positive, but there was none. NONE at all.I must admit to watching the whole thing... a sucker for punishment. I would never watch it again, and could never recommend this film to anyone.A real letdown"
0,"Little to say about this embarrassing film... Not many films make me feel stupid for actually watching them, but this movie did. Despite starring LL Cool J (who generally happens to at least make stupid films entertaining) this film falls so far flat that it almost bows under and creates a ditch. Chris Klein is a horrendous actor and he manages to muddle up nearly everything he comes in contact with, and no matter how hot Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is (just Romijn now), she doesn't bring anything to this film outside of her body, and that just can't cut it. The violence is cheap, the script is preposterous and the action sequences feel third rate. This is one of those films that offer us absolutely nothing.I have nothing else to say about this."
0,"Umm, I don't know what they were trying to do This movie is just plain sad. In addition to mediocre acting, the special effects were just as bad. In one scene you could plainly see the safety wire connected to the motorcycle. Bad diologue and senseless nudity made the film even worse. The plot drug and the resolution could have been solved a little sooner than it did. They came up with a lame chase scene with an airplane cruising on the ground after a motorcycle. Maybe that was a last ditch effort to make the movie a little bit more exciting. The only slightly interesting character was played by LL Cool J. His on camera presence is always rather captivating to me. It also carried him through a poorly written character. Since most of the movie took place on the track, there was more of the game than I could really put up with. Avoid it."
0,"The pits A complete waste of film start to finish.Don't waste your money.If you must see it for yourself, rent it.This movie didn't need a remake, the original starring James Caan was just fine.One star is generous."
0,"What the???? It is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on. What will this do for you. All it does is make noises. Have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing, but make a noise and just sits there after one day of being played with? This has no education value. For Yu-Gi-Oh fans, you should try buying Yu-Gi-Oh tins instead of this CRAP!"
0,"Hassles galore! We bought this last December (2005). It worked well enough for the first few months (some resetting of the TV Guide and blanking for days at a time, but OK). Was great to backup our Digital 8 video tapes to DVD.THEN...two weeks ago the TV Guide went dark (could not use it at all). I left it alone thinking it would reset and be fine.Machine then went into an endless loop the other day when I tried to turn it on. Would not come on. Gave a ""LOADING"" message when powered on - then went off to EPG function - then fired up again to ""LOADING"" then to EPG - etc. It seems to be frying.Read elsewhere on the web that the TV Guide function has been a disaster for almost all users. New version does not include it!Pioneer asked us to ship it to them and they will repair it under the 1 year warranty. Frankly, I feel it is a lemon and should be replaced with the new version under a lemon law for bad electronics!Buyer beware!"
0,"A Note about Charles Taze Russell It is curious that one one the more significant achievements of ""Pastor"" Charles Taze Russell is omitted above. That fact is that he was the primary founder of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and the religion now known as ""Jehovah's Witnesses."" No small amount of his theology is controversial in the body of the Church as a whole, as it would be (for different reasons, perhaps) amongst Jehovah's Witnesses."
0,"I used to eat it till I found out how it was made diseased yellow pile of tortured meat, that's what it is. I used to eat it... but than I found out how it's made, that's just gross. people are disgusting and will eat raccoon's a* on a stick if it's called a delicacy."
0,"Who eats Fois Gras? So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods? What gives? Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is? And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line. So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal). People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding."
0,DISAPPOINTED I was extremely disappointed with the fabric and color when it came. It is obvious that it is of poor quality but I guess you get what you paid for 10 bucks.The zipper of the plastic cover of one set was broken.I bought 2 queen sheets and I wanted to return both purchases if only I did not have to pay for shipping.Do not buy this!!!! You will regret it.
0,"i got it cheap and it is Cheap !!! I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . This is not a quality product , avoid at higher prices"
0,"Not really a bargain--terrible sheets Dollar store quality. Lovely dark pattern, but it is printed on thin white flannel, not over-printed on blue yarn-dyed fabric, and the stitching on these fairly dark sheets is white."
0,"This toy is the WORST! This toy is the worst! You can't even get past the Password screen to play anything. I got tricked that it was a good toy, but it's not. And I don't want you to get tricked, either. I thought it was a good toy by looking at it in the wrapper, but it wasn't."
0,"I hate useless products You have to buy most of the battle chips seperatly which leeches your cash in no time, don't bother. Get a Game Boy or a Nintendo DS if you want handheld fun."
0,"junk junk junk it has terrible graphics i mean it is just black and white.also it moves very slow on the screen.that is what little of a screen it has.(...)i say get av gameboygame instead.at least that has decent graphics and isn,t a cheap piece of plastic.overall it is a piece of junk."
0,Not a good toy This toy isn't well made or designed with kids in mind. You have to shake it forever before it will even do anything. I thought it was broken at first but then I found out that you can shake it for 10 min and nothing will happen but that's normal. If you like Megaman then I'd get the GBA game instead of the PET toy.
0,Not appropriate for 9 yr olds My very athletic 9 yr old absolutely could not use this - much too hard - returned it.
0,"Good for downhill only I can't believe this rates higher than 2 Stars. Don't be fooled, this only good for down hill. While it is well built, you can't propel this trike as advertized. Save your money, don't buy this!"
0,"Why do people like this garbage? Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking. My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious. I, however, am left wondering: why?I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors. The characters are boring and flat. His humor is downright stupid. This book is not clever in the least. If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel. But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand."
0,"The worst mess ever DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Once out of the box, the three layers were cut with what looked like pinking shears and were horribly uneven. This was NEVER a mattress that sold for 999.00 ... When I tried to return it All Sleep was helpful at first but I could not package the layers to send. While trying to come up with a solution to the shipping problem, the UPS labels they sent to me expired and now they will not return any emails or calls. WORST SERVICE AND PRODUCT EVER!"
0,Spend your money better This book is a total waste of money; it is only useful for lighting up the BBQ. The only one to make (plenty?)of money out of this book is the writer. Do not be discouraged by the title!. This is not a serious book.
0,tbone thought this was a cd by the group pieces of a dream. you put it with their cds. not what i wanted.
0,"Terrible! My sister was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and there is a strong chance that I may have it as well. I wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start. Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly written and with the most bizarre suggestions; how to write your family a Christmas letter, informing them of the diagnosis. Come on! There are other instances that I felt it was just a little over the top and was not realistic to everyday life.Since finishing this book, I began reading Elizabeth Hasselbeck's book, The G-Free diet and have found it to be much more informative and much better written. Ms. Hasselbeck's book gets right to the point giving you the information that you really need to understand this disease."
0,Poor Information for Celiacs I found areas of this book that contained information that would make individuals needing to lead a gluten free life style ill. There were several poor suggestions in this book and also poor information regarding some of the products mentioned as NOT being gluten free that are!There are great books out there to help Celiacs! This is certainly *not* one of them.
0,"Where's the storyline This is beautifully written but this does not make up for the total absence of a story. Three characters in war and how their lives, interact. Reads like a series of notes rather than a completed work. If it is trying to convey the horror of war it fails. Deeply deeply disappointing - I feel I have wasted my time and been cheated."

0,"NOT GOOD Who does she think she is? Amy Grant has been singing for years and years and still no one sees what she's doing? First she gets everyone thinking she's a Christian singer so she doesn't get as much opposition and more positive attention. Then she gets secular and fools those who are too blind to see. If you think ANY of her music will draw you closer to God it won't, and NO MATTER WHAT don't get this CD!"
0,"Beware: this is a bootlegged/pirated video If you paid for this product, you overpaid. Granted, the original, out-of-print dvd of The Bikini Carwash Company sells for exorbitant prices, so my suggestion is to just download it for free through torrents and cut the video pirates and video scalpers down to size. If anything, buy the European PAL version, which is also uncut and uncensored, and available on the North American Amazon as well."
0,"don't even bother this is by far one of the worst step 2 prep materials ever! the questions on this CD ROM were random, poorly written, and testing very obscure material, certainly material inappropriate for the step 2 level. as an example, drug X effects which part of the electron transport chain? oh my, that's going way back into first year med, which in not what step 2 is about. we all know step 2 is for clinical applications of what we've learned as third year meds, and i can honestly say that this CD does not test these types of things. it was extremely frustrating trying to go thru the CD and ""give it a chance"" but i just couldn't take it anymore! try the NMS series or the A&L ERT if you want some computer practice, this exam master stuff doesn't cut it."
0,"Exam Master. for the USMLE Step 2 I hate this CD , it was waste of money and I wish I could refund my money ( 89 USD + S&H, I bough it directly from the publisher) I am absolutly agree with the rest of the reviewers. questions are not even close to USMLE step 2 format. whoever wrote those questions I am sure that had no idea about USMLE at all since the questions are about any thing but USMLE step 2. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS CD 7 insted try to read NMS REVIEW multiple Q ( it is bible of USMLE step 2 )."
0,"save your money, dont let the price fool you second hand quality. i have ordered this before from sleep warehouse. now their memory foam seems to be second hand quality. i recommend trying another site that has true grade quality. don't let the low price fool you, like i did. when i press my hand in the foam, it comes back to shape in 2 seconds. the foam i got 2 years ago, same brand, it would take 5 seconds to come back to shape. that was great foam. try someone else"
0,"Devoid of depth or even much substance The only type of person to whom I could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a ""forest"" level view of them from one source. There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. ""Raising Your Spirited Child"" is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child. I am saddened and more than a bit annoyed (I purchased the book on the basis of the organization's recommendation) that the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight."
0,"Less than one star. Didn't like this book at all. For several reasons: 1. the hero Ben seemed weak especially when he allowed his mother to slap him, come on he is like 37-39 years old!!! Unbelievable! 2. the heroine was way too dependent upon daddy; did she not have any type of backbone? 3. The biggest, Ben knew the truth and yet he had to create all this angst on both their parts!!! YUCK!!"
0,"I dont feel it Im not feelin this album. I always liked Bad Azz along with all the other LBC and DPG rappers,,, I thought his ""word on the streetz"" album was good,,,, but I just dont feel this album. In my opinion the best song is ""wrong idea"" which as you know is also on the last meal album from snoop dogg, and it isnt a real great track..... so that doesnt say a lot for this album"
0,"Save your money This is a 6 x 4.5 x 0.5 inch book that is basically the federal rules with SOME objections. So far the description doesnt sound so bad right? But then throw in that this tiny little booklet is $35.00 bucks. If you buy this, and some of you will, you will be shocked at how tiny this book is with large print running you 35 bucks. I got a required book on the federal rules and a book on objections that total $70.00 and both on their own are worth more than this. Get something else if you can. The books I purchased instead of this are below.[...]"
0,"don't buy I got this for my 8 year old son because he loves hand held games. He played it the 1st day he got it, but it was difficult, involved alot of shaking. I also had to take it apart because he pressed the reset button & it stopped working at all. We put it away for awhile & the next time he tried to use it, no battles, no matter how much we shake, it is useless now. How can they make such junk?"
0,"Parents - Don't waste your money! Buy the GBA game I purchased the Red and Blue PETs for my son who loves the show. These toys don't work properly. My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6-10 to understand. If your child wants a PET, but the GBA game Red Sun / Blue Moon. There is a build it PET that works. Kids can battle each other."

0,ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!! i ordered this item for support being that i have a rather large chest. the item had MUCH more coverage than the picture lets on and came in the size i ordered according to the tag but once i had it on i realised it was 3 sizes too SMALL. when i returned it to the sender the refunded only HALF my money. this item was ordered with one more bra like it and out of my $40 order i got just over $20 back. i plan on disputing this with amazon and the seller.
0,"I did not like it. Messy I did not really care for this book. I found the plot messy and muddled, with many clumsy devices and scenes that felt forced (the climax, in particular, seemed very rushed, cinematically speaking). The characters, for the most part, were thin - and perhaps the author reached too far in casting the reference-net. I wanted to like it (I very much enjoyed Alan Moore's tales of the Extraordinary Gentlemen's League)... A very intriguing idea though (I give the acorn a golden prize but the oak grew sickly)... Maybe it is your thing; it was not mine."
0,"Too many names, too little interest. This book needs a grammar check. It is incomprehensible. I am trying to return it. It sucks, to coin a pun."
0,"This item is a total scam This ""book"" is only a pamphlet that is available online for FREE! I recently bought this for the length of the book (claims 264 pages) but it is not. I have recently had to deal with a close family friend suddenly dealing with schizophrenia and it has had a traumatic effect on his family and his friends. This is a serious illness that not only affects the person diagnosed but everyone surrounding them. The last thing anyone would want at this time is a book that claims to be something it is not!!"
0,"Cannot Recommend It This product has only one thing going for it. It's nice looking. Besides that, it's totally worthless. Cheaply made. Almost impossible to remove without either dropping it or having your fingers slip off of it which usually results in your fingernails scraping across the surface of your lens or lens filter. After 10 drops and 4 fingernail scrapes, I ordered the following product.Mennon Pro Center Pinch 67mm Snap-On Lens Cap with Leash. It's much better. Sturdily made, snaps off and on very easily, same price as the Canon. Only drawback - no nice Canon logo."
0,"NOT what I ordered! I would have liked to know that the cord in the picture was NOT the cord that I was ordering. Not only are the connectors NOT nickel-plated, like in the picture, even the shape of the connector is wrong and looks to be smaller than the one pictured as well.My rating is more for the distrust I'm feeling from this company rather than the product itself, as it does work... For now...My recommendation: Don't buy this product, at least not from this company. You never know what you're going to get."
0,I imagine if you get a working one this would be very useful. I had to rate this low because the one I received was broken or had some sort of short in the wire and didn't work. I'm pretty sure a working one would be very useful.
0,"cheap, but not worth the money This product does not fit tightly. It tends to fall out of the plugs it is attached to, both at the computer (the male end) and at the cable (female end). Complaint to the provider went unanswered. We will have to buy a replacement."
0,"Defective and more? I had 2 problems with the product. First the sound would cut out of one ear unless I played with the connection and second, using the extension caused the sound in my left and right headset piece to reverse (right sound came out of the left ear and vice versa). I have requested a refund and will not reorder if this is normal."
0,Stopped working after 2 months Ok while it lasted. However this cord stopped working after two months. Save your money -- this is junk.
0,"Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC), all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM.---Out of the box, if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension (fully connected in the female end) I only get sound out of the right ear bud. Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well. I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first ""click"" (not fully inserted), sound comes from both ear buds. There is tension with it connected in this fashion, so it works but could be better. Others may have better luck with other headphones."
0,"A New Translation This is a new translation (2006) of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. I hope someone qualified might soon comment on the merits or significance of this new translation. Meanwhile, the Editorial Review information offered for this book comes from an earlier edition of a different translation of Freud's work, FWIW. And the second paragraph in the editorial review prelim is entirely inappropriate--it's for another book altogether.I give Freud's book (not the translation) a low rating because it is misleading. It's not about the interpretation of dreams in general, but more specifically it's, covertly of course, about Freud's own dreams. More basically, it's about ""infantile memories"" he claimed dreams concealed. (For more explanation of this point, one could consult ""If Freud's Theory Be True..."" in Psychological Reports (1992, 70, 611-620), which would explain how Freud himself tells us his book is not about what it appears to be about."

0,"No Table of Contents Please be aware before you purchase this Kindle edition that it DOES NOT HAVE A TABLE OF CONTENTS. If you are reading this book for pleasure, starting at the beginning and proceeding directly, this may not be a problem. If, however, like me, you are using it for a course and/or in conjunction with a hard copy edition, this makes it virtually impossible to locate anything in the book or to navigate from chapter to chapter. You have to use successive approximations of the location number every time you want/need to change locations. Consequently, this Kindle edition is useless to me."
0,"translator confusion I have downloaded a sample of the penguin kindle edition, and while all the reviews refer to a new, and it would seem generally well regarded new translation by Joyce Crick, the actual listed translator of the ebook is J.A. Underwood.While this may be OK for the casual reader, this is not OK for someone approaching these texts in any kind of rigorous fashion.Whatever carelessness accounts for this error, it is enough to make me opt for a good old fashioned paperback instead.Fix it!"

Anyway, I found this camera at Walmart thinking it should be good for the $20 price tag they were asking. When I first opened this wannabe camera I noticed the buttons were very cheap. More than half the pictures taken were either blurry and/or yellowed. Don't bother trying to create a video with this thing unless you like a still frame video. I brought it back after I did some research and found the Logitech C310 Webcam for several dollars more here on Amazon(which has HD!). This is the worst camera i have EVER used. Live and learn, and never buy anything made by Vivitar. Shop around and spend a few extra dollars for a better camera. If not, you get what you pay for."

0,The Black Art of Xbox mods Good basic book on modding. The pictures are of good enough quality to make the verbage much clearer.

0,"Racist and stereotyped I got about halfway through this idiotic (and extremely poorly written) tripe. Whine, whine, whine. Take some responsibility for yourself. Bigoted, empty, hateful nonsense from a vacuous, race-baiting hack suffering a dearth of originality, an abundance of misguided vitriol, and an excess of hand-wringing and pouting disguised as legitimate literature."

0,"No Disrespect You talk about bigots! We have adopted 3 black children, 'tho we already have 5 biological. We are so darn happy that we have saved our 3 from the horable, unetical, imoral life that is epicted in this book. If that is how Sister has lived her life, we see absolutely no reason why she would brag about it. Also, while white students are worrying about their student loans, and wondering how in the world they will ever be able to pay them back, little or nothing was said about the African-American students concerns about their pay-back. Oh, yes, I forgot ""We Owe You""(?) Great that Sister Souljah is trying to help her ""brothers"" and ""sisters"", but maybe she should start with teaching them some morals, and maybe cleaning up her act while she is at it. Sister is a talanted writer. We hope that someday she will find something more uplifting to write about."
0,"Further proof that stupidity comes in all colors. Firstly, I find it startling that Vintage would deign to publish something so poorly written. The semi-literacy of this prose (I'm being generous) does, if nothing else, suggest that Miss Souljah didn't use a ghost writer. The words, in all their ghettofied glory, are hers. Booker T. Washington would have wept. While I can appreciate to some extent this woman's pathological disgust of whites, I cannot understand the roots of her homophobia or anti-Semitism. Her easy-way-out philosophy (Everybody's to Blame Except Me) is the very thing that keeps her where she is."
0,"Not the real deal We received our comforter, and it was not the dimensions advertised. We contacted the seller(Egyptian Cotton Factory Outlet Store) and the claimed manufacturer (Warm Things). The manufacturer responded quickly to tell us that this seller does not have access to their products. The seller has copied the language from the manufacturer's website and is selling fraudulent products in their name. If you care about the quality or dimensions of the comforter you're buying, don't buy from them."
0,"Sci-Fi Natural Law Here is a recent example of this author's online reasoning, which he proposes others should be governed by in a free republic:""Let us assume that two planets which have not yet been inhabited by humans are to be colonized by them; on Planet Alpha, heterosexual couples only are assigned; on Planet Beta, only homosexual couples. In one hundred years, will both islands be populated assuming that reproductive technologies are not available to either group? I suggest that Planet Alpha will be; but Planet Beta will not. Why? The basic answer is to be found in the biological complementarity of the heterosexual couple necessary for procreation that is absent in same-sex couple. This is a scientific argument...""As I suspected, Natural Law theorists are about as serious as Trekkies"
0,"Long winded. This video was dull and did not provide any information that I didn't already read in the books that I checked out from the public library for free. I'm fairly disappointed with my purchase and I feel that my money could have been better spent. I find the video rather pricey, but gave it a try because of a very enthusiastic recommendation from a friend. Needless to say, if you are the type of person who must have audio and visual to learn, steer clear of this and find an instructional video that's more concise. If you can learn through just reading, I highly suggest you just check out some books for free and save yourself some money. If you like long winded stories and have too much free time on your hands, this might be the video for you."

And, she really must hate women in labor, judging by the way she makes fun of them and mimics them with a whiney, high-pitched baby voice. Throughout the whole ""pushing"" section she talks about how much you will whine, and if you don't, just wait because you must not really be in labor yet. She goes on and on about how horrific the pain will be, but them she tries to talk you out of an epidural!! If she was my L&D nurse, I would cross my legs until the next shift change."

Do not buy this dvd! if you are curious check it out at the library.... she spends the 1st half an hour talking about how big babies and small pelvis are to blame for most of the problems in labor...... SO UNTRUE!!! I am a trained Doula and we should never blame babies or women's bodies for unexpected outcomes in labor. Birth is Normal.... Birth is Natural.....

0,The Worst Quality Blu-ray ever! I couldn't get through the first ten minutes because the quality was as if it was a DVD from the dollar store. The quality of this Blu-ray makes VHS look fabulous. I even wrote a letter to the company and got no response. I buy lots of Blu-rays and DVD's and I will NEVER buy one from this company again.
0,"Why an EP release of this film? While Troma treated this well regarded latter day Argento film reasonably well with its DVD release, and its initial $14.98 VHS release, anyone who is a fan of this talented director's visual virtuosity and deft use of color, camerawork, and scene composition should be aware that this new, reduced-price VHS version of The Stendhal Syndrome is in the inferior *EP* speed mode. I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality. Since the original, more expensive SP version of the tape appears to be in the process of being phased out by the less than artistic-oriented Troma, this is very unfortunate.Please, Troma, give us VHS buyers back a decent quality SP version of this film.And please, Amazon, do include a note in the technical information section when you do carry a VHS tape in EP mode."
0,"The blu-ray image is TERRIBLE! I wish I had read the negative and accurate reviews of the terrible quality of the blu-ray before I bought a copy. Apart from the Dirty Dozen blu-ray, this is the worst I have seen. I have not seen the DVD, but I can't imagine it is any worse than this blu-ray."

There are a few vendors that list this part number, but I also suspect this is a single-sourced inventory item. A lot of speculations, but what else are we supposed to do?[...]After one review that states the inaccuracy, AMAZON should have this rectified.There is not a valid excuse to keep a listing that is know to be inaccurate.That being said, the i410 is an excellent instrument.AMAZON is usually fair about inaccuracies when it comes to returns.

Yeah, if you're travelling you need this, but more importantly why can't Apple just sell the different adapaters individually? Apple must assume that a lot of people have more than one of their products - perhaps a macbook and an ipod, so wouldn't it make more sense to sell the adapters individually, that way one could buy for example two European adapaters, one for ipod and one for macbook? Another apple rip-off if you ask me."

You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE! That should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere. Not Recommended."

I am not a writer, but if I had the writing skills of Jean Auel, my review of Clan of the Cave Bear might look like this:""I eagerly awaited the rare opportunity to read the famous book by Jean Auel. As I anxiously read the exciting words on the white pages, I was constantly distracted by the desparate use of poorly-chosen adjectives. After reading two large paragraphs, I could easily tell that the large book was poorly written by a hopelessly unskilled amature.""Jean Auel had some great ideas for a story, but does not have the skills to tell it. The story might be interesting and well researched, but it is difficult to get past her awful prose which does nothing to paint a picture of a prehistoric time, and her amature use of adjectives is forever distracting from the story she's trying to tell.Please read the sample pages before buying this book. This is not a book for anyone who enjoys good writing."
0,"No plot, No Characters One of the worst novels I have ever read. Well researched - maybe, poorly written - definately. The plot simply goes nowhere, and the characters are so unrealistic and banal that it is impossible to feel sympathetic toward them.

0,"I Know I'm in the Minority Here, But... I'm so sorry to be such a spoilsport, but I found this is a terrible book and a worse series. Leaving aside all the wild inaccuracies - one of the main ones being Auel's portrayal of Neandertals as doltish brutes -the heroine is constantly making one earthshaking discovery after another - shampoo, domestication of animals, law of genetics, sex=pregnancy, and, last but not least, tampax. No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock. It became really maddening."

0,"Horrid! I really wanted to like this book. After a good friend suggested it I decided to give it a go. Big mistake. This book put me to sleep, literally. The description of the land and plant life goes on forever. Takes way to long to get to the plot and it's just not worth the time."

0,"poor quality backpack, don't buy... I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop. I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one, so I chose JanSport again. It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials, and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings, and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless, the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook. So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport. And the quality of my new bag is Much Much Much BETTER than this one.Don't buy this backpack!"

0,"Worst game I have ever played Wow. Fire Emblem is one horribly designed game. 75% of it is listening to the characters talk. And by talk I mean you see pictures of them on your screen with nothing but their mouths moving and eyes blinking and written below are what they have to say. It gets boring very quickly. On top of that the fighting is almost like playing chess, you move your characters around through squares on a board and you never get to actually attack any enemies. All you do is initiate the attack command and they show a little video of your targeted character hitting the enemy and maybe them hitting you back once. It's monotonous, cheap-looking, and not very fun at all. My advice to anyone considering buying this game is to rent it first. Then you can see for yourself how bad it is before wasting your money on, in my opinion, the worst gamecube game ever."

0,"pretty awful I'm an aviation buff and I'll accept a mediocre screenplay and poor character development if the flying is worthwhile. Sorry to say that this film falls short on all fronts (pun intended). The CGI flying scenes are very contrived, and are sadly inaccurate. The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as ""We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates"" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't. Don't waste your time with this one."
0,"completely disappointing I do enjoy historical war movies when they're done right. This clichÃ©-ridden story is pain to watch and I fell asleep several times during the second half. The movie is ridiculously predictable, although in a few scenes the writers still managed to surprise me - the private airlift flown by the main character in order to rescue French girlfriend with kids from advancing German troops, or taking out the villainous German ace pilot during the final dogfight with revolver (after machine gun jammed/broke) are few examples of the worst writing taste. To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars. Do yourself a favor, ignore this movie and watch Blue Max again instead."
0,"Terrible - I walked out of this movie When I heard Larry Ellison the world's second richest man was involved, I had to go see this movie. Expecting great things. ORACLE sized greatness. Instead don't be fooled by the 4,5 star ratings people give this movie. What a load of rubbish! I expected an action movie - great fights - true war. Not a romance set in a very serious war. The lead actor is terrible. Sorry they cast too young an actor. It wasn't interesting. The only interesting actor was the guy with the lion. The rest I can't even remember. All I will remember from this movie was the zepplin exploding and the funeral where they mention that the guy with the lion was an atheist and that he didn't care much about religion anyway. So that is it - a true waste of money. And these second rate actors and kiddie script writers are getting rich from hype."

By the time The Black Baron (whatever... ) got himself shot, a la ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the group was overcome by hysterical - albeit quite rude - comments and laughter.Haven't had that much fun since that stupid movie about the F16 pilot shot down over Bosnia.To think that such bravery, such envelope-pushing, such absolute horror has devolved into a depiction such as this.Jeez-Oh-Man, what'r they gonna do to the Battle of Britain?!?!?!?"
0,"Thank God for fast forward I asked the clerk at the video store how they determine the number of videos to buy for rentals. She told me it is based on the box office record of the film. She had 2 Flyboys. One would have been plenty.The story was sappy. The acting just so so. The aerial sequences were much like a video game. Try ""Flight Simulator"". WWI biplanes hanging on their props??? Climbing 90 degrees?? Landing a biplane in shell cratered ""no man's land"" in the heat of battle to save a buddy who has his hand (not his arm, his legs, his torso, but just his hand) trapped under the wing of his crashed plane?? That's realism??There wasn't much believable about this film. A third of the way through the movie I fast forwarded through all scenes except the dogfights. I was hoping for something on the order of ""The Blue Max"". ""Flyboys"" stalled on climb out, went into a flat spin, and augured deep into the depths of movie flops!"
0,"Flyboys Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong. The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right. Nevertheless, the film makers got a few details correct, but then added improbable special effects, far too many triplanes, annoying social lesson stereotypes, and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage. Conceptually, the movie should have been a winner. In execution, it is a disappointment. They ruined a potentially good story. Instead of buying this movie, I would suggest the Blue Max as the aerial scenes are far better, or just propose that the would-be viewer read a history book.As a parting comment, however, I always have liked Jean Reno. He is the good part of this film."
0,"Flyboys! Don't think so Aircraft physics [ cgi] are horrible. Planes don't fly that way. And the German guy is of course dressed in black and he's really bad. The hero becomes obsessed with getting even, and of course does. Most video games are superior to this sillyness. Total waste...."
0,"Predictable, cliched, mediocre acting.... Having been excited at the prospect of a gripping, historically accurate, realistic WWI film about the ""Lafayette Escadrille,"" Flyboys is a big letdown. Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous: aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film. More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister ""Black Falcon."" (!) Come on!Recommended: ""The Blue Max"""
0,"A $1 rental The plot of the movie ruins any thing they try to over come with the computer animation, and even that isn't as good as I expected."
0,"Painfully fake For a fan of the old wood and fabric fighters of WWI, this film causes nothing but heartburn. The CGI effects are painfully bad, so obviously fake that it hurts to watch. And the scenes where they use actual airplanes, or recreations, are just as bad. What really bugged me was the fighters with fixed radial engines, rather than the rotaries they should have had. Forget about this film, and just read ""Winged Victory"" for the story by somebody who lived it. If you want to see the real airplanes fly, go to Rhinebeck, NY."
0,A truly bad movie Considering the richness of the subject matter and the real life stories of those who lived it this was a truly bad movie. The makers tried to tell everything and as a result told nothing. The characters were unbelieveably superficial and too many of the flying scenes were historically inaccurate and unreal. If a few special effects are good too many are not necessarly better. The Blue Max and Battle of Britain are far far superior. For those who are willing to put up with a mess just to look at recreations of old airplanes its probably worth buying but be prepared for alot of dissapointment if you are looking for a good movie.
0,"Be Forwarned!!! I usually do not review films, but in this case I feel it neccessary. I have been a World War I aviation buff for many years. When I first heard that someone was making a film about this subject I knew that I had to see it. My disappointment when I finally saw the film can hardly be imagined. It's not just that they drag in every movie cliche thats ever been used in this type of story; there is literally not a single authentic detail or presentation of such detail in this film. The airplanes are wrong, the airplane paint jobs, markings. armaments are wrong. The clothes and uniforms are wrong, even the airfield that these guys are flying out of is wrong. It appears that the film makers, instead of researching information on life as a volunteer in the french air service of that period, opted for looking at old hollywood movies on this subject. Watch this film for whatever entertainment value it may have , but not to get an idea of what World War I aerial combat was like."

0,"Great movie, horrible DVD! Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced.

Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?!

0,"BORING SELF-INDULGENT DRIVEL As another woman who has actually reached the summit of Mt. Everest, I found this book to be nothing more than self-indulgent ""New Age"" drivel. Gammelgaard offers no insight into why the disaster happened and virtualy ignores the other climbers who were on Everest that day. The book has none of the gripping suspense of Into Thin Air and none of the factual reporting of The Climb. I'm happy Gammelgaard survived but she should turn her attentions to things other than writing. One of the worst books I've yet to read!"
0,"Don't bother! This book is a total waste of time to read. I couldn't wait to read it when I saw it on Amazon.com. But lucky for me I happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it. Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick. To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest, and the 1996 tragedy, and this is by far the worst. It will never compare with ""Into Thin Air"" or ""The Climb"". Also she has a style of writing that I have never seen before. She jumps from one thing to another, but I can guarantee you it will always be about herself, and how strong and great she is."
0,"Hey Lene, did you ever pay Mountain Madness? I haven't read this book but I've read Krakauer & Boukreev at least 7 times each. It is public knowledge that Lene G. did not pay Mountain Madness the full fee to be guided up the mountain. Ask Karen Dickenson. Maybe that's why Fischer's expedition had few (and inferior) radios. Hopefully LG paid Mountain Madness (after the fact) with the profits from her book. Otherwise she's just a user who used Fischer's good nature to sleaze her way into his expedition. Even if she paid, it's too late. I have zero respect for her. I would like to read her book but I won't buy it."
0,"Self aggrandizing psycho-babble, The book is poorly written with a lot of name dropping and gossipy insinuations. Into Thin Air, Climb, High Exposure are all better written and far more interesting. I think she figures if she refers to the ""mother goddess"" enough times she can pass the book off as feminist treatise. Lucky for Gammelgaard, she's a better climber than writer, or she'd be just be another fossil on the mountain. Don't waste your money."
0,"A Major disappointment Like several others who have reviewed this book, I found it a total waste of time. I was able to read the entire book in one day and I kept thinking, ""it's got to get better,"" but it never did. There is no sense of what drives this woman, no personal history in which to ""get to know her"" and certainly nothing is added to the Everest story, either historically or in the context of the '96 tragedy. I found it shallow and filled with exclamation points that made no point. While I certainly understand and accept the intuitive mind and its differences from a more analytical perspective, this book did little in the way of informing me about the mountain or the author. Instead it seems trite and superficial and filled with pithy statements and insinuations which discredit her perspective. I am, however, thrilled that she made the summit and returned safely and that it fulfilled a personal quest she had. I only wish she hadn't written so poorly about it."
0,"Self-indulgent drivel I purchased this book looking for a new perspective on the tragic Everest climb of May 1996. I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps in Denmark people were interested in how she, a female Dane, attempted and summitted Mt. Everest. However, the novelty, for any climber and for most everyone else, of a woman climbing Everest on a guided expedition is nonexistent. After hundreds of ascents of Everest, it approaches absurdity to have the author repeatedly mention that she will be the first Danish woman to summit.Those who like to read self-help books may enjoy her spin on the ""inner game"" of preparing for Everest, but I didn't."

They actually show him shaking and in a lot of fear, something that should not be shown to young toddlers. They don't understand why Elmo, their hero, is so afraid and it really upsets them. Why they had to take such a great idea and ruin it is beyond me. There are ways to teach safety without scaring someone to the point where they cannot hear what you are saying out of fear, which is what happens to Elmo in this video. Save your money - this one doesn't do the job."

The kill scenes were cheaply done CGI which looked terrible for the most part. It's a spoiler, but in the last attack scene of the movie the 'dream girl' literally bursts through a tree and a burned body to attack Simon/Stanley. My biggest problem with this movie is that I know Cripin Glover can do so much better. I'm sure he did the best with the script he was given, which wasn't much, but I'd have passed on this role. After seeing him in Rivers Edge and Willard it was almost painful to watch him play this character. I'm just glad I got this used for six bucks and not the twenty-five amazon is asking for it"

It's that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?"

Even the topics that I have a very good knowledge of (e.g. Duration, Convexity etc.) are written in such a disjointed fashion that I could not recognise them. The author uses symbols without describing them, the passages have no relevance to the examples which in turn cannot be connected to the solutions. It was a great disappointment. I wonder if anybody at GARP ever reviewed it before recommending it as a text for the FRM exam."
0,"Hope this book is not representative of GARP's credibility Is there anything less than 1 star? For the errors, this book is not a good value for your moneyI agree with other readers. Book is full of errors and irony is most of these errors are not corrected in the downloadable supplement - available on GARP web-site. Agreed the book covers everything within the Body of Knowledge for FRM exam, but many important issues / theories are mentioned / covered in the Handbook because they are part of syllabus but sufficient justice is not done to them. One definately gets this strong feeling that continuity is missing in certain parts of the book and they seem to be just product of simple copy / paste action.I strongly recommend GARP, Wiley Finance to correct the errors and replace current book with an error free version. Why should the readers pay for the errors? And please let the readers know what actions you are taking and when?"
0,"Do you rely on it for FRM exam preparation? As comparing with some other exam-oriented books for CFA and AICPA exam., it would be the most poor book I have read up to now. The book is poorly prepared and organized. While it is organized in according with the exam. structure, it is still difficult for the reader to follow. Most concepts have insufficient explanation. While some notations have not been clearly explained, some topics are explained (or jumped) very fast without proper elaboration. Some examples are even not supported by adequate reading before the examples and the explanation can only be found in the answers. Thus, it has made a chapter in pieces and then becomes difficult for the reader to memorize. I doubt why GARP recommend it to the candidates since 2000 and whether it is suitable and sufficient for exam. preparation purposes. I suggest some serious candidates may be required to refer to other textbooks and even myself has such planning."
0,"I Wish I Hadn't This book cost me the FRM last year. I made it the center of my study program.

When I finally realized my mistake, it was too late to rescue my study program, and I failed the exam. I am very disillusioned with Jorion and GARP. This shoddy, overpriced paperback makes me think they are in it just for the money. This year, I have signed up for the CFA exam instead. So far, I have been very impressed with their study materials."
0,"Redundant and Too Expensive This book is not on the FRM reading list. The author already has one book for the GARP exam, and this one covers all the same material in much the same manner.

No matter how many lives you have left, how many items you have collected no matter how far into the level you have gotten, they all get erased to zero and you get the distinct pleasure of having wasted your time.

0,"Not as good as Harry Potter, says I While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax. This book isn't as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion, and no one can refute me. Tastes are relative!"

0,"this is the worst book i have ever read!!!!*- 1984 is the worst book I have ever read. I would advise anyone who is thinking about reading this book to reconcider! George Orwell is not a bad writer, however, this book he does not do evry well on, as some of his others. Prehaps he was getting old and lost his touch. Animal Farm was okay, but 1984 was horrible. It took him forever, it seemed like, to get into the accual book. If someone were to take out all of the useless part of 1984, it would be half as long. Why would he wirte so much about nothing? I havent ever meet someone who could wirte such a boring book about the goverment. I have meet many people who have loved this book, but i dispised it. I am not at all intrested in the goverment. This may be part of the reason that I didnt like it. I would advise you not to read this book."

0,"1984 1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member or the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere he goes he is video taped by cameras of the so called ""Big Brother"" party. This books talks about Winston on how he thinks what the ""Big Brother"" does is unfair. I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Wiston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction. Overall it was a good book, but I don't think Iam ever going to want to read this book again."
0,"monotony Attempting to read this book is worse than watching the grass grow. At least the grass will become something you enjoy. The title and plotline of the story intrigued me to read it. Don't get me wrong, if well-written, this storyline could be very interesting. But even after just ten pages, the only thought going through my mind was ""When will this guy shut up and tell the story???"" The plot comes in a distant second to the narrator's monotone, seemingly unending monologue. If I could withstand this, I believe I would have enjoyed it. But forgive me for not having that kind of patience for hundreds of pages."
0,I think this book is horrible I have never read a bigger piece of garbage in my entire life. For the people who read and enjoyed this book...GET A LIFE!
0,"Big Brother is Watching! George Orwell's book 1984 is a wonderful book set in England's future if WW II never stopped. The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party. In the end it doesn't turn out how he expects it to be but was inevitable.The book was a great read and a good use of time. I personally think big brother is the man. Even though it was a school assignment to read it was great."
0,"George had a good idea but the book really stunk. At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. And please for the love of God don't read that ""Brave New World"" book by Hoxley. It is twice as worse as 1984. To put it bluntly, DON'T READ ANY GEORGE ORWELL. Your just waisting your time."
0,BORING This book had a good warning about futur totalitarian government but it was way too wordy. I had too much description and was really boring at the beginging that it took me a while to get through it. The love affair was discusting and the torture and Winston's viens were discusting and horrifying..Thats it

0,What to do to get Seaon 5 and 6 The rating is not for the show but for the delay. Why is it taking so long to get these seasons of one of the best TV shows of all time to DVD? What do we have to do? We want to all go about this in a legal way but it seems that we are being pushed to illegal means in order to obtain these shows. I'm sure I could get them from numerous vendors throughout Thailand. It would not surprise me if these two seasons are already available for download off the internet. But some of us want to spend our money legally. And thanks to Fox it seems like we may never be able to.
0,"A Real Disappointment This fan is a colossal waste of money - it's not worth the shipping cost, much less the purchase price. When the tent got hot, the poor performance of this fan was a real disappointment."

0,"Pointless Movie!! I was sold when I saw how many ratings this proclaimed 5 star movie it had received but to my disappointment, it was just a waste of time and money. If you really want to see a good movie about a piano or pianist with a good story to it then I recommend ""The Piano"".This movie was somewhat sickening and pointless. There was no real good story behind the movie. Just 2 puzzling demented sicko's who's only purpose was to make you vomit and throw that movie away. I'd like to give a synopsis about the movie but the truth is, is that there's really no good plot to talk about a synopsis.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You'll save time and money. Not all 5 star movies have earned their stars."
0,Movie sucks This movie was crap. It boasts of a journey of submission and tale of D/s. It is boring and merely a poorly filmed interpretation of the lustful quest for dominantion.
0,"Save your money. I am a big fan of foreign movies. When I read read the reviews listed here, I decided to see this movie before buying the DVD. Thank goodness. The storyline was terrible."
0,"one of the worst Cannes winners That movie was soooo boring. An old teacher living together with her mum, whom she hates, very blunt loud dialogues between them, why does an independent self supporting lady stay there at all, ridiculous..I was very, very disappointed of actress Huppert's role, it was not her fault, that she had so little to do or say, eg in that scene on the public toilet.E. Jelinek's story was either not transported or is it really so far away from real life, or sex, or even perverse perversion?I did not even try to find out, too much time spent on that already. Sorry."
0,"The Worst Movie Of All Time This is the number one worst movie I have ever seen. I usually love French films and enjoy the unprudish and free attitude in most of them, but this one went too far. I wanted to leave the theatre, but I was too transfixed in horror to move. I gagged, I winced, I covered my eyes, but still I couldn't move. After the torture was finally over I felt shellshocked and needed to go home and watch The Lion King to recover. It was a glimpse into the world of a sad, demented, and twisted character that I did not need to see. There was no point to this movie and I felt that it existed purely for shock value with no lesson, point or true plot. If you value your time do not watch this movie."
0,"Pretentious bore Ok. So Isabelle Huppert was brave in doing some of the things she does in this. So what?The movie is a pretentious bore which never grabs the viewer. It's just a series of nasty and kinky scenes which ultimately go nowhere. The Isabelle Huppert character is a psychopath, but incredibly she is an uninteresting one.A truly disappointing movie."
0,"Beware DVD-R copies This is the second time I have ordered a movie manufactured ""on demand"" in a DVD-R format from Amazon.com. My Sony DVD recorder/player is less than two years old. When I attempted to play each movie on the Sony, this message was displayed: ""Error. This disk cannot be played"". I have never had problems with movies that are manufactured directly by the studio so I assume that the middleman responsible for making these DVD-R copies is unreliable. Anyway, I am very disappointed."
0,"A Majority of One DVD-R movie If this was a professional DVD, it would not be made on a DVD-R disk. Instead it should be made on a dual layer DVD disk because it is over two hours. This DVD-R disk must therefore be less quality than standard play playback. Not good for High Definition flat screens, especially the larger size screens. By the way, this movie was broadcasted by Turner Classic Movies in letterboxed form. The TCM broadcast movie differed from the movie I had on prerecorded VHS tape. The TCM movie plot was better than what was on the VHS version. Also the TCM version was in widescreen and more sharp than the VHS version. The source of where this DVD version came from which you are selling is NOT provided and that is one more reason why I won't buy it. Sincerely, Rick Gershon.A Majority of One"
0,Delightful Short Animates Stories for Young Children This is a delightful set of four short stories about the magic of Christmas.Each short is animated in either vivid color or black and white. 30 min. total playing time. Each has its own personality and charm. The stories can be used for discussion about Christmas between parents or teachers and young children. There is freshness in each. Few opportunities exist to share a Christmas story classic that is very short and talk about it with young folks. Makes them excitingly aware of the famed comic figure Howdy Doody and animation in fun terms.I watched it from the viewpoint of both a young child and parent. Four **** for delight and colorful fun that often brings out the smiles in young silent children otherwise prone to remain quiet. At a low price too. Not worth the new VHS price.Four Stars.

0,"More like ""Tower of Feces""!!! This was a pretty damn boring movie. Thank god I did not buy it, for I would be rather angry at myself. Boring plot, boring actors, you can probably see where I'm going with this. They couldn't even throw any gore into the movie for at least something to watch. I guess that would have put them over budget. I will say that I thought the cover art looked pretty cool, which is why I rented it in the first place. So overall, I would not recommend this to anyone."
0,"Doesn't warm bottles Ever been in a car on a long distance trip with a cold bottle and a hungry baby? Let me tell you how obnoxious it is to have a bottle warmer that, even after 20 minutes, still has not heated that cold bottle. Don't buy this product."
0,"it is a joke this bottle warmer is just a joke. It takes forever to warm a cold bottle up. I say "" forever"", it is forever. When I checked the power, it is only 13W. If you do the math, you know the energy the warmer produces may take forever to reach the heat to warm a bottle up."
0,"NOT RECOMENDED DO NOT BUY THIS WARMER hi i bought this warmer for a vacation trip, i was really dissapointed, it wasnt even 3 minutes that i had it on for the first time and it started to get ON FIRE!!!! melted plastic all over the place smoke like crazy all around the car it is VERY UNSAFE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY DONT PUT YOUR BABY IN DANGER IF YOU HAVE THIS PLUGGED IN YOUR CAR, CUS THE WARMER MIGHT GET ON FIRE, MINE DID!!!! i hope this review helps you, i wont EVER buy this product EVER again."
0,"I'd pass on this one This bottle warmer seemed like a great idea--it was great to take the chill of a cold bottle. But the fact that it can start smoking and melt the bottle, like it did for me today, makes it not worth the convenience and dangerous. I'd seriously pass on this one!"
0,Cannot be used with Playtex Nurser Bottles I was very disappointed to get this product and find out that it cannot be used with Playtex Nurser bottles.
0,So HOT it caught on FIRE!!! Purchased this item and it caught on fire during its first use. I had it plugged in for about 3 minutes when my sons bottle and product caught on fire. I do not recommend this item. When I called the company they requested that I spend my own money to return the item and if they found that it was a mechanical failure they would replace the item only after I paid shipping. When I asked about my bottle they said their was nothing they could do about my loss. (Fire had caused the bottle lid to fuse to the bottom)This product is not worth a penny.
0,"Don't waste your money I purchased this in hopes of (like everyone else) having something that would warm a cold bottle in the car fairly quickly. This is NOT the product for the job! It takes forever, and actually makes the bottle too hot to handle without warming the milk much at all. The outside of the warmer gets way hot, too. Definitely a danger to you and children to touch. Luckily I have not had the problem some others have had with it melting my bottle, but I am not going to use it again to risk that!! In fact, I think the company needs to be notified so they will recall this product before someone gets hurt!!"
0,"Waste of money I bought this for our first long trip with the baby. It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk, so we couldn't just grab some hot water from a drive thru. It would have taken hours for her milk to get warm enough, and she is not that patient (neither are most babies, for that matter)."
0,"Cali iz inactive Dont get it twisted. I used to love Dogg Pound when they dropped their best work DOGG FOOD. But ever since then Kurupt changed his style around and Daz has been slacking on the production. The only standout tracks are CALI IZ ACTIVE and KEEP IT GANGSTA(featuring Lady Of Rage) where Lady of Rage delivers a verse that makes these female rappers we have out now sound like pigeons cooing. Its all hood(featuring Ice Cube) might have been a standout track if it wasnt for the weak beat and the even weaker rhymes coming from the Dogg Pound. Filler: Its craccin all night(who the f*** in their right mind makes a song with PeeDoody?)Heavyweights(more like lightweights), Slow your roll, Make that p***y pop, She likes that and the rest of this album. Bottom Line: One of the lowlights of 2006 without question. Bland production and sophomoric lyrics and pathetic guest appearances describe this album in a nutshell. Pick up the classic Dogg Food and stay away from this tragedy of an album."

0,"Pathetically bad! This is some of the worst trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. The language is overwrought, the plot far-fetched and shallow, and even the readers sounded embarrassed to be involved in the project. However, it did make me laugh out loud quite often. Maybe the book was better. For a good S&M story, try Alasdair Gray's ""Something Leather"""
0,"One of the worst books I've ever read.... I read the first two chapters of this book, and I have to say that the writing was horrible. I can't believe that I wasted my time reading that much of the book."
0,"What the heck is up with this cover? 'Herland' is hardly a cracking read, but it's interesting as a feminist-historical text. It's worth reading, but for the love of Mike get a different edition. This cover is utterly hideous and completely at odds with the ethos of the story. Why would a female-only society, where dress is utilitarian and reproduction asexual, tart themselves up in pink eyeshadow and mascara that would make even an overly-flamboyant drag queen quail?"
0,"The worst book ever written. Herland, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, tries to take the view of a world without man. The notion that the world would be one peaceful little place without man is absurd. Women as well as men, have competed against each other for centuries. It is ridiculous to assert that women would not fight amongst themselves. If it was at all possible to give this book zero stars, I would."
0,fahrenheit 451 the book has a good theme but it just dragged on. i did not like this book. montag is stupid to revolt in the first place he knows its the law and he knows what will happen to him if he does. Why did clarisse die there was no point to that just one day mildred said she was dead and montag was like oh ok it was lame and boring. i recomend this book to no one.
0,I HATE THIS BOOK I thought this was the worst book I ever read. There was no point and way to confusing. he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot! i hated reading this! stay away from this book!
0,"In My Opinion.... Fahrenheit 451 lists in my top 5 of worst books ever. my english class had to read it. i didnt even read the lastsection. by the time the first test rolled around, i hadnt even read 10 pages. i evenually forced myself to read it but stopped when i got to last section cause i thought if i read anymore, i might die. i felt no connection to the characters, no emotion towards them. Everything is drawed out way to much. when he could easly say something in a couple pages, he takes like 50 to tell one little minor thing. For me, its really boring and stupid. For u, many ur will like it. Maybe not. Cant no until u attempt to read it(NOTE: i said attempt)"
0,"The usual dreck I had to read this when I was in high school. So did my children. Now my GRANDCHILDREN have to read it! None of us has been able to discover WHY! Of all of the superb books I have read in my life, not ONE has ever been selected for required summer reading!"
0,this book was awful This book makes absolutely no sense at all. I read the first page and I didn't like it. I have to read it for school and I have fallen asleep 4 times reading it. All of my friends hate it to. We have a test on the 2nd day of 8th grade. Even using the Cliffs Notes didn't help at all. I don't recommend this book to anyone.
0,"Re: Is 451 degrees really the temp books burn at? If it is, then I will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces. The book proves one point to me: burning books and their society is much better than ours where Farenheit 451 can be published"
0,This book was really odd.......... This book was a hard read because I didn't find it interesting. It was really strange to me. I was required to read it for my English class. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because I personally did not enjoy it. I was confused as to what went on the entire way through.
0,"The Worst Book Ever! Fahrenheit 451 is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life. I was forced to read it in school, and I disguised the book starting at the first page. There is absolutely nothing good in the book. It makes no sense, and I personally don't think the world will become to be, as predicted in this book. I also find this book very offensive to my religious beliefs. How can a book that takes the name of the Lord in vain, in almost every page, be used as a class novel. Everyone knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is breaking one of God's commandments, and is a sin. I have never read a book that was as bad as Fahrenheit 451 in language. I don't understand how the school boards can justify such a book, and use it for classes. Anyone who hasn't read this book, don't waste your time!"
0,"Didn't Like it!! Confusing, disturbing, and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book. Firemen who start fires?? Come on. Burning every book that exists, this isn't a look into the future. It's a look into Bradbury's twisted little mind. Bottom Line.... Don't waste your time."
0,"CD Fahrenheit 451 I marked one star only because I cannot give it anything lower. I placed this order on Jan. 10. Time to get the order came and went. Here it is Feb. 7, and I still do not have the CD of Fahrenheit 451. Is this company located on the moon? Why is it taking SO long for my order to get here? I am MOST displeased. I will never order anything from this company CheapBks4U again. This service is atrocious."
0,"Not worth reading This book has been raved about as a classic SF story for many years now, so I decided it had to be worth reading. How wrong I was! As with many so called ""brilliant classics"" the author gets a novel idea and then tries to run with it. Unfortunately, the story fizzles out completely towards the end and the full impact of the original message dies with it. I was very disappointed with this book and wonder how people rate books like this so highly. Don't bother reading it!"
0,"Fahrenheit 451....It sets a new record in boredom. After reading it for a school project I would avise anyone reading these reviews to stay clear of it unless your eighty and you want waste your last few months of your life. Pointless, which school teachers of little old scotland make you read. If we have to burn books I put this one up to get burned straight away."
0,"It Deserves Negative Stars! Last year we had to read this as a class. There were two books our teacher made us read that I hate with a passion this is one of them. I could not stand the way Bradbury writes most authors would say the pit pat of rain he would say the pit pat pit pat pit pat and so on for half a page it was royally annoying and as far as what the guy said about it being about individuality and conformity if you want to read about that read Ayn Rand's Anthem. It is much better, and deserves its status as a classic unlike this one."
0,"Hardly even deserves 1 star This is definitely one of the WORST books I have ever come across. In the modern version, there is a forword and an introduction. Both of them have nothing to do with the story, and Ray Bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that NO ONE CARES ABOUT! I almost fell asleep during the forword, I dont know how I survived the book. The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace. As for Ray Bradbury himself, he states in the introduction that in his eyes, Hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book. I think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity. Great guy, eh?"
0,"Horrible execution of an addressable topic... This book is quite possibly the worst piece of science fiction I have read... It is dramatically boring and far too contrived to be interesting... The world Bradbury creates is thoroughly dry and I simply hated his look at the future... Nothing was at all interesting or thought-provoking, except for the books examination into the issues of censorship as a whole. I like fantastically created worlds and futures, but when they're dry and brittle like this, you simply long for the pages of the book itself to burn bitterly...."
0,"How else would you like to WASTE MY TIME? To put it simply: this book sucked. Although this is a very juvenile way of putting it, it fits perfectly. This book was so boring, that all the description Bradbury puts in couldn't possibly describe how slowly it moves. If Bradbury wanted us to realize the importance of books, the LEAST he could do was make this book SEMI-interesting! Essentially: Don't waste your time."
0,"Not worth it I had to read this book for school. I, personally, don't care for any type of science fiction, so that could play a part in my rating, but it was very confusing and not worth my time. The book is about Guy Montag who is a fireman from three or four hundred years in the future where firemen cause fires instead of putting them out. The book mentions people Montag meets and is friends with and about his failing relationship with his wife. There are many 'futuristic' objects in this book which keeps you thinking and confused. The book ends in a chase which was by far the best part. If you don't enjoy science fiction, I do not recommend this book for you. I only read it because it was required of me."
0,"HATED IT! I really did not like this book! Now, don't get me wrong the idea was good, but the writing was horrible. I normally like Ray Bradbury's work, too. The writing style was very repetitive and boring. I think that this is one of those books that could have been great if written differently."
0,Confusing who ever wrote this dumb confusing book is in a mental state of mind! Fahrenheit 451 is a overworded description of a fireman who lives on rebellion! It is a bad influence on the young people of the world. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNED!
0,"A good idea gone horribly wrong! At first I thought that Fahrenheit 451 sounded very interesting, and I was glad to see that my 10th grade teachers had assigned the reading of it. By page 3 of the novel, however, I knew this was not a book I would enjoy. While it's a frightening, though thought-provoking look at the way society could become, it was extremely badly written. Bradbury goes on and on for pages of nonsense, and his words leave you with no more enlightenment than you had 50 pages ago. He uses redundant adjectives, and pointless sentences. I was especially annoyed when he would go ""inside"" Mr. Montag's thoughts and repeat the same meaningless phrases over and over again. I wouldn't recommend this book to a single person, and my condolances to any other student forced to waste their time on this. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the few books I would gladly toss in the fire."
0,"How ironic - text to speech (tts) not enabled How ironic that a book about limiting access to books is NOT text-to-speech enabled.

He will not buy audio books so the publisher makes no sale at all. He bought his Kindle for the express purpose of being able to read books through the text-to-speech function. Unfortunately, too many books have this feature disabled - often through Simon & Schuster. It is especially ironic that the publisher would limit the blind community's access through Kindle TTS when this book centers around removing access to books. Everyone loses."
0,"huge disappointment at 180 pages i realized that i was one-quarter through the story and not even slightly interested in continuing. so i visited amazon ans clicked on the one-star reviews to see if their frustration was my frustration. if i finish it, it will be because i force myself. just before this book, i finished ""on writing"" by stephen king who points out [i almost wrote emphatically]: don't use adverbs ever. and if sparingly. Fahrenheit 451 is crammed full of ""he said softly"" and ""she said slowly."" my review: timewaster."
0,"Too bad Amazon can't help out students I am admitting this review does not relate to the actual book but to Amazon so with apologies to Ray Bradbury...Ten bucks? Really? Come on Amazon, you know this book is on a lot of school reading lists. My kid loves her Kindle but when I can buy her school reading book lists for $2 at the used book store, you lost. In fact, it is a weird circle of irony - we used to buy books, they got too expensive, bought the kindle, it was great, then you made the books expensive again and... now we buy the books. You lost an opportunity here, Amazon. For the record, she hasnt picked up her Kindle in a month.Too bad for you."

0,"Painful listening Ray Bradbury was a fantastic WRITER. I wish he would have stuck to his strengths. Choosing to read this book himself for the audio recording was a tremendous mistake. His speech is, at times, nearly unintelligable (He was over 80 years old at its recording). What should have been a wonderful audio book ended up being a complete chore to listen to. Writers of films know enough to cast proffesionals to act-out their visions. Writers should be no different. Do yourself a favor, read the book yourself."
0,The Worst book I have ever read!!!! This book was horribly written!! It confused more than it enlightened!!! I did not enjoy it at all and I never plan to read it again.
0,Wrong book sent! I ordered a book for my grandson's school summer reading program. The book was supposed to be Fahrenheit 451 and I received a totally different book. I returned the book and by the time another book could be sent would be too late.I probably will not order from this site again.
0,"Terrible, Terrible Book! Bradbury is a good writer (I'll give him that), but I HATE his writing style. He starts making huge long mini-stories within the main story that has no point and is useless. He could have written this book in 50 less pages, and it might've gotten 2 stars. I think this is a terrible book, no offense to anyone who likes it."
0,Painful to listen to Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read but deadly to listen to on the CD. Ray Bradbury reads in expressionless monotony. I tried to listen to the first CD five times and finally gave up. Stick with the book where you can supply your own voices.
0,"BURN THIS BOOK! Hey A reader from MISSOURI, I hear you. This book makes no sense what so ever and i had to read it for school. I have no idesa just how in the world a book this horrible could have stayed around for 40 years!!! I have talked to everyone I know and they all read the first 5 pages and immeadiatly hated it. THey rented the movie and watched some of it so they won't have to read it, and it was verbatum, and guess what...it was even worse than the book! I do reccomend this book to all of you...well only if you want to find out how terrible books can get or you want to find out what type of flammable liquid burns better on books!"

0,"Burn it! I'm no advocate of book burning, but burn this book! It was terribly disappointing--lots of hype over a cheesy science-fiction novel. There are two major problems with it. One is poor language usage--lousy descriptive word choices, lousy metaphors and similes that make inappropriate comparisons--and two, not enough attention paid to societal problems that give rise to things like book burning in the first place: the threat of the individual to the group; government control over the sheep-like masses; the modern epidemic of people's lack of interest in anything intellectual; the timeless epidemic of a fear of anything that goes against group mentality or upsets the status quo, and so on. Bradbury touches on some of these issues, but leaves them largely undeveloped."

If this is reality--the reality of L.A. or anywhere, I want no part of it. In my experience, people from most classes have some kind of spark or charm. This is a film that mistakes vileness and vapid, blank suffering for profundity or realism.Watch them suffer! On second thought, don't! The most unappealing group of people I've ever fast-forwarded through in recent memory--even worse than The Hawk is Dying.I like dark films--but this is just rub yer nose in it vile and stupid.Avoid at all costs!

0,"advertised as OEM?? I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Clearly all 3 products are china knockoffs according to the counterfit guide that one finds on other motorola product pages, but conveniently left off this one. I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for. The battery however (also clearly a knockoff) held less of a charge than the one it was replacing. I asked for a replacement(OEM as advertised this time Please!) and another knockoff was sent. Im disappointed in AMAZON for this. I was told to return anything I was unhappy with. Ill lose out on shipping both ways.one star because it worked, and they lied.Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook: Motorola, Inc."

0,"Boring As a longtime deer-lover, years ago I found a copy of this DVD at my local supermarket and bought it, thinking that I would probably love it. However, I was wrong. This is just another one of those boring movies featuring adorable animals that serve as the highlight of the entire film, but eventually over time their endearing qualities gradually start to recede in your opinion, leaving you to mindlessly sit through the remainder of the film. Not only that, but the fawn barely appears in the second episode on this DVD (only two cartoons are featured), and the cartoons are so old that you can hardly understand a word that anybody is saying."
0,"way to make the worst game of all time Thanks to the people at Vivendi Universal for making quite possibly one of the most horribly boring/glitchy/... games of my life. How could you take such a good story, and turn it into the most rotten expierence of my life. Was this game test played EVER before its release? Obviously not.... Let me list the pros and cons:pros:*now cons:-combat is few and far between and when it comes about it usually takes 45 minutes for the enemy to run at you, attack, then run back to its spot (awesome)-not only can your character go of the screen and get stuck, other NPC can do the same! (real sick)-equipping and sharing items only takes about 400 years of your life, forget about all your goals and dreams. This is way better.-the dialouge (like the game itself) seems to be written by children-the games ends in the mines because of a horrible bug in this awfuly designed game.I hope this review sways you from even playing this game..."
0,Horrific ATTENTION!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I REAPEAT!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS BUGGY AND NO FUN WHAT-SO-EVER.THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
0,"Slow, buggy, and awful I had high hopes for this game since I'm a big Tolkien fan and really like good GBA RPGs. Boy, was I disappointed! First off the game is horribly slow. Combat takes forever, and is boring since your character miss all the time. You'll spend hours walking around looking for mundane items like flowers or Pippen.Add to that fact that the game is horribly buggy. Gimli turns invisible in one quest, sometimes the elves don't give you items you need, and I've yet to meet anyone online who found a way out of Moria without the game crashing.Don't buy this waste of a game. Save your money and either wait for one of the other Lord of the Rings games coming out this Christmas (The Two Towers) or buy Golden Sun or Castlevania instead. This is a prime example of a great license going to waste."
0,"A Slow Game with Terrible Glitches This game is more based on the book then any other lotr game. But the battles are terribly slow, some items don't work, things that the game promised are taken out, the graphics are awful, and there are some terrible glitches in the game, especially the Moria Glitch which made me go out buy another one (I thought the first one was a defect) and go through the same glitch again. Even if you are a huge lotr fan you should probably stay away from this game."
0,"disappointed I am a huge fan of Tolkein books and lord of the rings especially. This was actually a pretty fun game for a while, I can't complain, I bought it in a bargain bin for $5 bucks, and I was thinking ""What am I going to lose?"" I lost 5 bucks and I want it back. I liked how it had aspects of the books instead of the movies in them, like Tom Bombadil and such. I would have more stars for it (1, mayyybe 2) if I didn't get stuck in Rivendell. I think I got Gimili's axe a step ahead of when I was supposed to and when I talk to him he says he needs it. Game over. There is nothing I can do to progress. And what really sucks is that I saved it before I knew that I was stuck. So its either spend another 3-5 hours replaying it and getting back to that part to progress, or quitting. I think I'll just quit and maybe sell it for a buck on Amazon."
0,"Might be okay, but glitches are doozies. I could have made it through this game several x by now, but the glitches stuck me in trees in caves over drop-offs, etc., numerous times. I'm done... didn't even bother to finish and I was well past Morea. Someone said the ending sucks, so what am I missing anyhoo? I'll try the other two, heard they were better. I'm glad I logged on here to see the reviews (that perfectly match mine) or I might have gone out to buy another copy... thought this cartridge had been flushed and just stamped on the grahics glitches were so bad! But no they say, this game just stinks. Don't waste your money, borrow this one from a friend at the most and see what everyone means. Does not deserve the one point I had to give it."

0,"Horrible Game This game is boring. You can't follow the story line, and if I hadn't read the books I would not understand it at all. The fight scenes take too long and they are also boring. In the mines of Moria there is this one place where you have to go but you get stuck because the game has a bug. The controls are extremely weird and take a long time to get used to. I have bought this game and I do not like it. I would suggest not buying it."
0,"The Buggiest Game I've ever seen Is this the same GBA ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings"" that was produced by Vivendi? Now it is said to be by ""Jack of All Games"". If this is the same cartrige, and it looks identical, this is the buggiest game I've ever seen. I have never even been able to get out of Rivendell, because Bilbo won't drop Sting, the Elves won't drop Gimli's Axe, and Gimli doesn't show up at the exit to get his axe. Unless these things happen you cannot leave Rivendel. I have played through to Rivendell twice, and it just gets stuck there. There are numerous other bugs as well, the game freezes in the house where you fight spiders, and when you enter the mines of Moria, although I have never even gotten that far. This would be a good game, if it worked. But it does not."
0,"AVOID THIS GAME!!! I was shocked to find so many glitches in this game! Give me a break; shouldn't products like this be tested and retested? I am not even talking about the silly and useless actions I was forced to take to make certain events happen, I am talking about outright glitches! I totally gave up when I got stuck in Rivendell. I can't leave the place; the elves won't give me an item I need and there is nothing I can do except start over from the beginning. Forget that! I started Two Towers; it's much less boring and inane, and so far, no glitches."
0,"Sorry, try again This ""book"" (40 pages, including the back cover as a page!) is very close to completely useless. Poorly organized, it does give some useful information, but it rarely puts it in a useful context. The very few drawings are of poor quality and tiny to boot!

At $14.95 it is not worth the money."

0,"Big let down from ATI - All in Wonder Radeon 8500DV Been in the computer industry for many years. Trusted ATI in the past, but this card is the worst thing I have ever had to try and install. I spent over 12 hours trying to install this card and make it work. Currently I have been able to get my system back to where it was prior to attempting this installation. If I could only get it to keep from locking up I would be there. To the writers of the latest code for this card, you shoud be hung from the highest tree. I had had high hopes for the functionality of this card, but with this recent adventure, I will never buy anything from ATI again. In summary, I think a perfect acronym for this card is POS, use your imagination!"
0,"DON'T GET THIS! OK, amazon.com is completely wrong. It says this card is worth [$$$] give or take five cents. The new one, supposedly comming out in August or September, is much better, and is going to be at a retail price of [$$$]. Itis MUCH better, and definately worth the wait. HOWEVER, if you must buy a new graphics card now, you should get the NVIDIA ti 4600 by VISION TREK. Not, by PNY, their customer service is very bad, even though they give a very good warranty. (Even read other reviews about PNY consumers). The NVidia 4600 is much better than the ATI 8500, however again, when the ATI 9700 comes out, that will take the crown. Until than, the NVidia 4600 is proudly wearing it."
0,"Be aware of ATI products I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great. I have quite extensive experience with PCs (I have put together over 100 of them) and it took me 6 hours to make this card work. I would give it more stars but..... First of all, when I bought it, it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included. Well it wasn't, instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I wasn't able make it work. Secondly, when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers. I would call them but they charge you over [X] a minute for support. So the bottom line don't count on any support from ATI."
0,"Bad product. Horrible drivers I purchased this product to upgrade my old all-in-wonder card. I love ATI for their wonderfully multi-functional cards but they really need to do a better job of writing software for them. I tried to install this card on Windows 2000 with all the latest drivers and with the exact instructions (after reading another review here) for each driver. The end result was video with vertical lines on both the DVD player and the TV software. Spent 4 more days trying to fix the problem but just gave up in the end and went back to my old ATI card. I might try the Radeon 7500 in the near future (since I suspect that the ""DV"" output of the card had something to do with my problems)."

Dont waste money for the worst game I've ever played."
0,"12 games for 9 bucks Yep thats right 12 games for 9 Bucks. No kidding. Yeah. But the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is the fact that yeah you get all of those games but you get 2 repeats (galaga, gal Im not saying i dont like the game (considering that i bought it solely for the galaga & ms pac man) but it should be more of a selection than just having all the galaga's Some might disagree with me but oh well. The fact that it has all these old original arcade titles loves it. It would be better with a regular tv rather than a wide screen, as all the games are narrow. Funplay its like being in the arcade all over again, difficulity- that digout game is the only one that i am having trouble with! and graphics (who cares) Your playing your favorite titles which is why you bought it so dont cry for mommy if its not in HD!For the money you cant go wrong"

0,"an unusual writing technique Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus, ""Ulysses,"" did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in 1922.Thus it was that the artist, while composing his next work, ""Finnegan's Wake,"" got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys, a poignant expression, obviously, of the searing torment boiling within him.Happily for us, the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume."
0,"Gibberish! ""Out door, keel cooling vorsnevou."" You could add this sentence to this mass of drivel and no one would know it wasn't written by Joyce. If the point of this book is the utter incomprehensibility of mankind, Joyce greatly contributes to it with this rambling waste of paper. A monkey and a typewriter could have written this ""experimental"" trash. I cannot see any way in which this ""work"" is a classic. It is stream of conscience gibberish. Anyone could have done it."
0,"Ridiculously Bad I am a fan of Joyce's writing especially Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, but this is pure garbage. Thank goodness for the look inside features at amazon, so that people will be able to know what to expect when ordering Finnegans Wake. The novel has no plot and lacks the vivid descriptions of seemingly meaningless things that made Joyce's other novels so great. Here, he picks random foreign words and places them wherever he please just to make his book seem original and artistic. The result is an incomprehensible piece of garbage that is not only plotless but devoid of any writing ability and talent.Use the look inside features to see what I'm talking about."
0,"An Udder Disaster The cow who dried up was an udder disaster....like this gibberish novel. Even JJ's best friends and critics called it drivel (his brother included). I guess after writing Ulysses, JJ felt somehow had to create something more mystic. Well, he certainly succeeded. I have a standing $1,000 bet with anyone and the challenge is that I will open 3 random pages of FW and have the reader explain, in detail, who the parties are, what the sentences are about and mean. I am quite confident than there is no one out there who can do that. Period. So much for a memorable reading experience."

0,"this is bad This book is bad, and I think it was intended to be so. Probably upset with the over analysis of Ulysses, Joyce must have set out to play a trick on the literary world.

0,"WTF is this?! Real words, unlike what you'd find in this book, cannot describe what you find in here. This book is the bane of my existence. James Joyce must have self-inflicted mercury poisoning in order to write this. The only other plausible explanation is that he became severely mentally retarded from a lack of flow of oxygen to the brain. If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY ""sentence"". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of. If the author came back to life, became unretarded, and then read his own book again, he would instantly want to drown himself in Lake Michigan.

0,"I do not like Finnegans Wake I think it's rather dumb to write a book for the purpose of making it difficult to read.

Installation was easy in my Dell 8100 system, but there is only one vga plug on the card, the other is DVI. Great if you have a LCD, but otherwise you must use an expensive adapter...

0,"A Disservice to Martial This is a very poor translation. Martial is a lively, urbane poet with a razor-sharp wit; his language is precise and powerful. James Michie's translation is insipid as poetry, and often unrecognizable when set next to the Latin. A single example: Mr. Michie has a penchant for translating simple Latin words like ""terra"" into configurations like ""turf and dew,"" rather than the obvious and elegantly simple ""earth."" In Michie's translation, Martial's more beautiful elegiac lyrics are made gaudy and his urban bullets of observation become flaccid. Get the Loeb Martial and a good dictionary and work through the epigrams yourself. You will be better served by Loeb's literal translation than something that sounds as if it were written by a mediocre pre-Raphaelite poet."

My dog obviously didn't like it and tried to paw it off but as long as I kept moving he only occasionally pawed it and didn't pull. He usually pulls nearly constantly despite my efforts. However half way through my second walk my 23 pound dog stopped to sniff something. I kept going and the strap that goes around his nose broke. Don't waste your money.
0,Sizing instructions are off The Halti must be correctly sized - and unfortunately the sizing info to determine the correct size is poor. The Holt sizing chart is based on breeds - and didn't work for my mutt. Way too big. Why don't they provide the sizing info based on the circumference of the muzzle and neck?
0,"Not good for small dogs like lhasas This is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware! Because of their flatter facial structures, the collar slips off and won't hold as it should. And speaking from experience, the size is not the issue i.e. even a small size won't work."

The producers of this franchise know they have a great fan base, but now after several years of making an intelligent and entertaining sci-fi series I think they've given in to intellectual laziness. If ""Continuum"" is the new standard of what we (the fans) can expect to see in the future from this franchise, then they should just stop making these films now. The plot to ""Continuum"" is silly, the narrative (the story and how it is told) is completely bland and devoid of life. It was as though all these characters we have come to know, suddenly had their souls written out of the script."
0,Not satisfied I purchased Stargate continium and when I received it they sent me Steel magnolias instead I have contacted the company 3 times anf=d after 3 weeks I have heard nothing I will not purchasing anything through Amazon again or its partners
0,"Not Good Too Expensive. 5- 1/2 cups are not true, you can barely make 3.5 cups. Every time you cook, you need to clean outlet also, that sucks. I don't recommend this product. You can do better with 1/3 rd of money what you spend on this product."
0,You cannot make sushi with rice made from this rice cooker. The quality of rice is inadequate to satisfy anyone who likes sushi. I am really surprised that Sanyo makes such bad quality product. I returned the product.
0,one time cooker This rice cooker is good for one time cooking. The rice does not last more than 12 hours. I usually leave my rice for 4 days so that I do not have to keep cooking it (lazy). I returned it and bought Cukoo rice cooker (made in Korea). The rice lasts for 4 days without changing color or get old. Cukoo is more expensive but it will last for years.
0,"Don't like this at all... I bought this because it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated and I've had excellent results from most of their recommendations. Not so with this one. I have major issues with the unit's cleanability. The lid is hinged and is not removable for easy cleaning. The inside of the lid had a scale on it after cooking and I was hesitant to clean it thoroughly because it seemed to be something of a mystery substance and I was afraid that I would scratch it. There is a trough that catches condensation and is also difficult to clean. Likewise with the extremely flimsy gasket. The unit took longer to clean properly than it did to make the rice, and I prefer the old Aroma rice cooker that I bought this to replace."
0,"non-stick coating peel off after 6 month I don't like this rice cooker because the inner pot's non-stick coating peel off after 6 month, and there's no way to replace it. My last Panasonic rice cooker's non-stick coating lasted 5 years."
0,"ok, while it lasted.... It was ok, unless I left it on warm and the rice caked onto the bottom terribly. However, it stopped working after 4 months of use. Not sure what happened...."
0,"Broke! This worked well for about 4 months and then broke. Its mechanism turns to ""warm"" now way before the rice is done. When I called the company to ask about service or an exchange, I got someone one time. I had to call back with more information from the receipt and I have never been able to get a hold of someone since then. I have called about 8 other times. It is not worth my time to keep trying to get a hold of someone, pay to send it to a service person, etc. Since this item is well reviewed in Cook's Illustrated, I am debating buying another and crossing my fingers..."
0,"Three words: empty, repetitive and boring I know all opinions are subjective but I do not undertsand what you could find interesting in this movie. The love story is stereotyped. The boyfriend is an idiot (which makes the girl an even more idiot), the soundtrack is exhausting and the plot is non existing. In this type of movie there is MUCH better which has been done. Please....."
0,"What a waste! ""What a waste of money! "" These words demonstrate my exact reaction after watching this movie which I have regrettably purchased on DVD. Excited to have a new DVD player, I bought this DVD after reading the many great reviews about the movie. Now I'm extremely puzzled. Why so much praise for this flick? It is anything but interesting: the story is childish and shallow and the much talked about cinematography and the music are nothing more than cheap attempts to decorate the silly plot. For those of you who want to buy the movie, rent it first! If you are not a fad-driven kid who actually thinks MTV is a music television and Jewel a poet, then you'll surely dislike it. There are no philosophical ideas here. The mere fact that this movie is considered to be ""thought provoking"" may be a testament to the reality that perhaps we are not thinking much."
0,"Run Lola, Run Lola, run Lola and again run Lola I did not get it. She is just running and running and again running. No philosophical idea. No point. The movie is telling us the same story in three different versions. Why? Boring..."
0,"she never stops running ok, so u want to know what a bad film is like. yea well dnt watch this one cause u will just fall asleep and still not know the film is about her running and runninga and running and running and u get the picture"
0,"Run Money Run! This is one movie where the title makes as much sense as the content. I gave it one star, although Franka deserves five stars for fitness."
0,"One word: TRIPE I see a lot of glowing reviews for this movie and I just don't get it. It's not ""deep"", ingenious, brilliant, or anything else that I've heard it called. Anyone who thinks this movie is thought provoking probably thinks Barney the dinosaur is a great philospher (seriously, get an education). This is a gimmicky, kitchy film that is a combination of concepts that have all been used before. The funny part is that they weren't great concepts the first time I saw them in other films. But hey, nothing suceeds like excess...so lets bring it all together and make a really really bad movie!"
0,"HORRIBLE This movie doesn't even deserve one star. The script was horribly written, and they kept on playing the SAME thing over and over and over again. Little parts changed while they replayed it, but I knew I couldn't stand to watch ANOTHER rerun again. I had to watch this movie for German and I'm certainly not watching it again."
0,"""I don't get it"" ""Nothing thought provoking"" ""Nothing Philosophical"" I give this film 5 stars. This and The Princess and the Warrior are in my top 10 all time favorites.This is less a review than advice to those that may be influenced by the 1 star reviews. The reviewers all tried really hard to sound intelligent while at the same time admitting that they ""don't get it"" and claim that there was nothing thought provoking.They say that it was just the same thing three times showing three possible results. These reviewers said it themselves- they didn't get it.During the movie the song What a Difference a Day Makes is played both to create atmosphere and to send a message. One of the main points of the movie is to show what a difference precious seconds can make..Cheers.P.S.Hopefully this sheds some light for the 1 star reviewers as well, but I doubt it."
0,"This single is bad Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Deeper Underground (Chillington Mix) tries to have a more darker sort of industrial sound which sounds pretty mushy and terrible, as the vocals do not fit in one bit with the music.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
0,"IS NOT CAPABLE WITH WINDOWS XP. You probably read towards the bottom of the description that it works with XP, and you'll even read it on the BACK OF THE PACKAGE, but it's not true. compaq still has no drivers for XP to recognize the PA-2, so if you have XP you'd better get a different mp3 player."
0,no blow I bought this because 2 other 12 volt ocilating fans I've had did not ocilate. This one seems to reliably ocilate but even though it spins the blade it does not seem to move the air. jUNK DON'T BUY
0,"THIS ITEM DESCRIPTION IS VERY MISLEADING !!!! This calendar begins with August 2005 and ends with July 2006! My son bought this for me for Christmas and was very dissapointed when I opened it and found out it was 'halfway used up' already. He felt very cheated and I felt very sorry for him. I think it is absolutely terrible that the item is not described truthfully. Shame, shame, shame on you! I wish I could give this item a negative number of stars!!!"
0,"waste of money This book is a complete waste of money. It contains no information that a reasonably intelligent man (or woman) couldn't easily figure out on his or her own, or discover on internet dating sites for free. The authors are believers in astrology, and devote a substantial chunk of the book to providing astrological information. As you can probably tell, I do not believe in astrology, but despite that, the astrological information in the book would also be very quickly available at no cost to any minimally proficient Google user."
0,"AWFUL, the Worst, cut and paste crap...with horoscopes? This brief 100 pages book wastes 25 pages on horoscopes, zodiac signs, what your sign says about you, what signs mean in women, what signs you should date. What do ancient superstitions have to do with the Internet and why does it consume 1/4 of the book? The remainder of the book dispenses fairly obvious advice like woman types: ""some women are after money"" and ""if you marry a women with children, you will be a step father"" duh! Also a chapter on how to date when you are already Married, nice. This book mentions NOTHING AT ALL about the Internet. They just slapped Internet on the title to peddle an existing book on dating, except that it is useless as a general dating book as well! I got this at the library so I didn't pay for it, but I still feel like I was CHEATED, out of the hour of my life I wasted reading this garbage. The worst, avoid at all costs, even for free at the library. Horoscopes! Gawd."
0,"Not reader worthy I bought this to review it for content and usability, I can't believer what I read. This book has nothing useful in it! It don't tell you anything about what to say or even how to figure out what type of woman you want let alone how to get her to respond to you. It's just full of useless information like horoscopes I culdn't believe it, it even had the chinese horoscope taken off of some menu in a restaurant! This book doesn't do anything buy take your money and waste a tree."
0,"Just another excuse to make money I am sorry but after reading this book, I have to admit that the feminists are right. Men are pigs and the only reason this book was written was for the authors to make money.The book tries to justify its existance by saying it is designed to help you find the love of your life on the internet. It actually only helps you find the love of your night. If I had actually used any of the tips in the book, I would have had alot of sex but I doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible. In fact I doubt anyone using this tips would find their ultimate mate, it would be inspite of the tips not because of them.An entire chapter is devoted to sterotyping women, though the authors do try to explain most women do not meet these types, then the list over 10 to watch out for.I am glad I did not actually pay for this, I would have demanded my money back."
0,Gossip Girl Season 3... What happened to the gossip girl that I came to know & love? Guess thats gone for good now. Season 3 of this show took a major dive. It's not the same as it used to be & prob will never be again. Unless if they come up with something drastic next season to put this show back in the game. It's really ashame this was a great show with amazing potential. Now it's just a bunch of college kids that whine because they don't want to grow up & are stuck in their hs days. Gossip girl needs a major makeover if it's gonna last because this show is going downhill fast!
0,Did not get whole season Ordered this on Amazon and sent me 2 (CD #3) and no (cd #4)My daughter's Christmans present turned out to be terrible. Make sure you check your cd's if you order these. They don't send you the whole season but want whole season $$$$. Bought it from Sold by: Amazon.com LLC. Of course I can't return it either.....
0,"Scratched disk Disk 4 was scratched and so I couldn't watch 2 episodes, I tried cleaning the disk but that didn't work. All episodes were on the disks but there was also a disk 6 that had episodes from a different season, so I believe that these are fake."

0,"The title disproves its claim I graduated from one of the schools described in this book, and I was horrified to see it listed on the cover. Throughout my time there, I was surrounded by people who couldn't care less about the name on their diploma, and couldn't care more about the quality of their education. Anyone who would be interested in a book titled ""Hidden Ivies"" does not have the sort of personality suited to my school - the name is nothing, the labels are nothing. The professors and fellow students are everything. These are excellent schools, but they should be considered in spite of what the Greenes title them, not because of it."
0,"Not Worth the Trouble You just want to use your computer as a digital VCR right? It's unlikely you'll be doing so anytime soon with this video card. The TV feature wouldn't work until I uninstalled my NIC and USB. TV and DVD work fine now, but the capture (record) feature doesn't record any audio. Yes, yours may be ok, but here's one more thing: the software that comes with this card is version 7.5, but the current version is 8.5. Owners of the 7500 have to PAY $$$ for this upgrade, whereas owners of higher-end ATI cards get it for free. You want to do business with a company like this, be my guest."
0,"This card is terrible I bought this card for a new custom built system and problems from the start. This card caused my computer to crash so often that I had to save games every 5 minutes to make any progress. I wrote an email to ATI and received an automated reply advising me to update the driver. After downloading 5 files and spending over an hour with DSL I updated the drivers. Still the system crashed all the time. Finally the card totally failed with a boot to black screen and I sent it back to ATI for repairs. I purchased a PNY Geoforce Ti 420 to keep my computer going and suddenly NO CRASHING, NONE! It was so wonderful. I dug up the games that were too frustrating because of the crashes and they were perfect. ATI sent the card back and said that they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Well I can't find anything right with it."

0,"Horrible game! Hard to understand and follow, bad graphics We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games. This is the worst game we have ever purchased. It is hard to figure out...hard to play...and hard to see what you are doing. It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also...many levels that my daughter would want to play are 'locked' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it."

0,"Cheesy, boring, move on...... I'll make this short. Terrible script with very forgettable acting. How'd they con Liam Nieson into this one? Extremely cheesy, not to mention lame, visual effects. It seemed they skimped on the screen writer to waste more money on worthless effects. Very boring sound effects, there's only so many times I can here a creaky door in 5.1 before I put the mute on. At least it was only a rental, however, it was late so it cost me 6 bucks, what a waste. I'm glad I didn't blindly pay 20 for this dog."

0,"A Truley Horrible Horror Film A truly horrible horror film. Over use of not so special ""special effects"" attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum, and that the characters were never developed or interesting. The only thing that's scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after 30 years. The other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that I actually paid to see it."
0,"Wow, What a Disappointment It's really difficult to make a good movie with bad material. But making a bad movie with good material must be easy---Jan DeBont proves it with this turkey. Shirley Jackson's story was a spooky classic. Robert Wise's B & W version was excellent and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. And HE did it without special effects; just sound, shadows, and camera angles. This movie could have been so much better by relying on the original premise and forgetting all the comic book special effects. Mr. DeBont is proving that he's better as a technician than a director. Liam Neeson must have lost a bet to go along with this."
0,"NEGATIVE 100 STARS. WORST FILM OF THE DECADE. This is a travesty, not only of Shirley Jackson's creepy, intelligent, incomparable ""The Haunting of Hill House"", but of the original ""The Haunting"". It's a ghost story for video-game-addicted morons. I've lost all respect I may have had for Neeson, Zeta-Jones and Taylor. This will be a permanent blotch on their resumes. If they were smart (ha ha) they might want to consider just whiting this one out! I won't apologize for sounding spiteful, either; when one of this century's best 'ghost' stories was turned into an excuse for lots of gimmicky, asinine computer graphics, instead of being crafted into the eerie filmed masterpiece it deserved to be, I was angered and even more disgusted with Hollywood, its crummy formulas and lowest-common-denominator scriptwriting than I ever was before."
0,"Too awful to be funny I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad, SO corny, SO awfully un-scary that I couldn't even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through (and I, a lover of all things spooky!). I do recall however three things about this movie: the directing was awful, the script was terrible and Cathy Jones (I didn't know who she was - she hadn't married the old man yet which really launched her career) gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie. No! I speak in haste - there were a number of 'worst' things about this movie.If you want to be creeped-out, read the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson). If you must see the story in movie form, watch the old black and white original from 1963 starring Julie Harris. It's dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo.Happy Hauntingness,Wind in Hare"
0,"Just skip it. 1. This is one of those rare movies where it's so lame, that I didn't / couldn't finish it.2. This movie is so lame, that spending more time writing a detailed review is a waste of time."
0,"This movie insulted my intelligence... along with the new Starwars. It is one of those movies that you want your 8 bucks and 2 hours of your life back afterwards. The plot is lame. The psycho-thriller classic turns a flop & dumb special effects-fest. I recommend ""the Matrix"" ""Taxi Driver (remastered)"" etc. for your holiday viewing."
0,"Must I even give it one star? Crass, vulgar, ridiculous farce of a film that regrettably retains none of the keen psychological portraits in Jackson's novel. Believe me, I am no stickler for slavish literary adaptations. When changes need to be made for cinematic purposes, I utterly support a director's choice to do so. Here, however, Jackson's work is not even on display in spirit; instead, this juvenile, special effects laden mess is marred by a juvenile screenplay and lousy performances from good actors. Even Liam Neeson publicly declared his utter disgust with this production. If only the filmmakers had taken the Robert Wise film version as inspiration; it is by no means faultless but is a masterpiece compared to this dreck. Only those folks who adore CGI will appreciate this film, and to them I say ""enjoy."" To those looking for characters or true chills, try ""The Innocents,"" ""The Changeling,"" ""The Legend of Hell House,"" or the original ""The Haunting"" instead."
0,"The house out-performs Catherine Zeta-Jones I honestly can't understand why Zeta-Jones' badly-scripted part is stealing the show with these reviewers; her cliched ""liberated woman with just a hint of vulnerability"" part is no more of a highlight than the rest of this awful movie. Bitter, am I? When the '60s version of a movie has more scares than the '90s version, be very afraid."

0,"Just terrible No, it's not as good as the original. But let's rate it on it's own merit - hmmm, it has none! This movie sucks whether you compare it to the original or let it try and stand alone! One of the worst movies of recent years, it has ridiculous acting (except for Liam Neeson, but it's not like he's good, I don't know why he did this) and one of the stupidest plots I have ever seen in my life. This is such a waste, don't buy it, don't rent it. This is a terrible movie. Period."
0,"Absolutely horrible Movies don't get much worse than this one, folks. The plot was poor and the acting was terrible. The scene near the beginning with the two ladies prancing around the house was incredibly lame. The filmmakers tried to overcome the shoddy storyline by tossing in some mediocre special effects. If they were intended to be a distraction, they didn't work.I have to admit, my review is based only on the first 30 or so minutes of the movie. That was all I could take before I got up off the couch, rewound the film, and promptly returned to the video store."
0,"I'm Haunted - I Will NEVER Get Those 2 Hours of My Life Back If you want a movie with a poor script, poor acting, and poor scares this movie is for you. We were hoping for a scary movie, but instead we came across this comedy. Lili Taylor is horrible as Eleanor, a woman driven to save everyone else who deserved to die for deciding to be in this attempt at a production. Liam Neeson, what were you thinking?"
0,"Very sorry indeed. Not scary, not original, bad computer fx, bad acting and no suspense! What a waste of money..."
0,"Dismal I guess the part I liked best was where Eleanor discovered that she was related to the ghost haunting the house. It was really believable. Tears came to my eyes it was so touching. Then, when the cherubs on the wall came to life, I was even more moved as there little souls finally were freed to go to heaven. That was really touching. I am just amazed at the screenwriter's brilliance. And all those special effects! He was so clever to add those. It must of taken a great deal of intelligence to have everything--even the ceilings come alive. I feel richer as a human for investing my time in this masterpiece."
0,"what a joke this movie is so stupid. waste of anybody's money or time. Not even Catherine Zeta Jones can make it seem worth watching. no parts in the movie were scary at all. In fact, was this a comedy by mistake?"
0,"TRITE, BORING, DISAPPOINTING It just didn't work. Astounding sets alone can't create on-screen chemistry. The story line and performances were weak, and, even worse, I didn't think it was scary...and wasn't that the whole idea? I left the theatre feeling cheated. This movie was just plain DUMB!"
0,"Catherine Zeta-Hipboots A fan of both Jackson's novel and the 1963 Robert Wise adadptation, I went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming. It was worse. In fact, it was so bad, I laughed my way through it (along with the two friends who accompanied me). There are so many digital effects that the house seems alive, indeed, but computer geeks set free with a big budget don't creep me out. They're just annoying. So is the movie. The house shape-shifts, sighs, moans--hell, even the door-knocker gets a reaction shot. Zeta-Jones's leather hipboots manage to out-act her, and Lili Taylor is hilariously bad as Eleanor. (""I've got the save the children!"" Wha?) Liam Neeson is even less interesting than he was in THE PHANTOM MENACE, if that's possible. Let's just put it this way: I just sacrificed 10 minutes of my time to write this review so that you won't waste 1 hour and 40 minutes of yours on this film."
0,"ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE How any sane, intelligent person(perhaps that explains it!) could recommend this overblown crap-fest is beyond me. Quite posibbly the worst horror movie ever made.

0,"Hollywood has run out of ideas...... I'm sorry, but I just couldn't stay awake to see this complete video. Whenever a cliche' scare comes up, I fall asleep....and this was often. I saw the original 60's version and, sorry, but that one was a snoozer too. I think this story could be phenomenally scary, but the right party has yet to make it.The only really scary thing about this movie is looking like Lily Taylor and having to share the screen with Catherine Zeta-Jones. She's a Goddess!!"
0,"Typical Hollywood pulp Third grade mentality, third-rate dialog. Not for adults. Egads, I actually bought the DVD. Shame on me."
0,"A waste of time and money Good cast, high budget movie. The movie was supposed to concentrate on a group of 4 people (all insomniacs) who were going to stay in an isolated house, to test their reactions to pressure situations.Was it the lack of direction, the lack of story line, or the lack of interest from the actors that led this movie to become a flop ?Watching this movie was a chore. It was about as exciting as ""The Avengers"".There's not a lot that can be said, apart from save your money and get a better movie (The Sixth Sense was made on a cheaper budget & was far more exciting)."
0,"TERRIBLE ATTEMPT AT GOTHIC HORROR ""The Haunting"" is certainly one of the worst films I've seen. While it starts off promisingly, the sets and special effects become so mind numbingly overdone that the thread of the original story is lost completely. It is replaced by a story that is not only derivitive and banal, but laugably contrived as well. This movie proves that even with a classic novel and a classic movie, a remake can totally botch its rendering beyond all recognition. Recommended for the film audience that prefers style far above substance."
0,"99.9 FAILURE! The only thing in this ""horror"" film that made it was the house and Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, looking good!, but the story was so forced, it never caught any horror, the special effects were cartoon like, not one bit frighting, the original movie and the short story will scare the pants off you, and why?, because your mind can conger up all the horror you want, your minds eye will take you to all those dark corners you fear, oh, and another thing that ruined the movie for me is, Owen Wilson, can't stand him!, how he ever got in movies is beyond me!, ignore this cluttered up movie and go to the original black and white one and get set to be terrified!"
0,"Some movies are just born bad... To say I was disappointed in this movie would be an understatement. To classify this as a horror film would be just plain wrong. While it achieves its goal to tell a good story, the chills and thrills just aren't there. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone with a serious yen to be scared out of their wits. If you want a real frightening tale, I recomend Rose Red. That's how a haunted house story should be told."
0,"Worst Film Ever Made, ever! It's just bad. I've already written one review but I feel its my duty to make everyone avoid this hideous and vile mess at all costs. Rent the original!"
0,"Come on! This has to be the stupidist movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible besides Catherine Zeta Jones( she is excellent). But I mean the other girl in there was so dull, 1 word comes to mind when I think about this movie LIFELESS. Cant these producers waste 10 million on a movie that will be eerie or scary, because in my opinion this was just horrible."
0,"Boredom personified! This movie, supposedly a journey into terror, lulls one off to sleep most of the time. The pace is so slow that I thought the exposition would never end. There wasn't one fear producing moment in the entire movie. I believe ""Bambi"" was scarier.This movie is dreadful, especially when one remembers the 1963 version with Julie Harris. I wonder how much money was spent making this dud!"
0,Terrible To sum up this movie takes one word and one word only...Terrible. If this is your first foray into The Haunting stop now and go back 36 years to the original.
0,"Wish I could give it 0 stars This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was absolutly stupid, boring, and a time-waster. The movie seemed to take forever and I couldn't wait for it to end. Plus, the ending was absolutely terrible and stupid. The main character in the story was such a bizzare character you really couldn't relate to her at all. The other characters were pretty weird too, but they were just funny. The special effects were OK, but it really annoyed me that those stupid statues kept coming to life to make the movie go on and on. There were so many many comedy aspects of this movie that it was hard to tell sometimes whether it was a comedy or a horror movie(such as the fact that all the characters had problems that were very obvious). I don't know about the old version of this movie, but the new one really sucks."
0,"A waste of valuable money! I saw a commercial for this movie. The special effects looked great. I was expecting to see a great action-packed movie. A friend and I anxiously stepped into the theater. The movie started with a little action, but then it was gone. Nothing. That was it. I actually fell asleep during it, something I never did before! This was one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen in my life. It doesn't even deserve one star, but I've got to give it something. If you think that this looks like a good deal, think again. Your money is worth something much better for the same price."
0,"Please! This was a horride movie. It had some creepy sceans, but the story was flater than paper. This proves that a movie doesn't need special effects to be scary. I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" and that was much better (And more scary) than this movie. Don't waste your money."
0,"horribly......stupid Liam Neeson is pathetic. Catherine Zeta-Jones is sham. The young boy is boring, though i gave him a pity because he's killed for no reason. The only thing i was moved by is the girl and her story, her family story; in fact, the story itself is pretty interesting, so there's huge disappointment's waiting for you. Except computer effect there's almost nothing."
0,"PCKJC Review by Kelvin Lam This novel shows the struggle of a young boy troubled by his own faith, with problems within his own family from his father's death, to his uncle's fighting against his faith. It shows his struggle to find out what Catholicism is, the flaws of it, and which religion he should follow. It shows the heresies against Catholicism, along with its strengths. It has a sheer lacking in the amount of entertainment in the book, yet it can either strengthen or weaken your faith. It is tends to be utterly dull at times. Not a good book."

0,"FULL OF MISTAKES!!!! This book is great for people whom already have well developed, basic math skills and are just looking for a refresher to familiarize them with what they might run across on the ASVAB. You need to already have good math skills because the math, science, electronics, and physics portions of this book are FILLED with basic, arithmetic errors (elementary school level addition and subtraction and middle school level factoring). Don't expect to learn anything from this book. If you need to brush up on math for the ASVAB, I would suggest a different publisher."
0,"aim low Although there are good poems in here, and good authors, Astley is intent on dumbing down poetry - this book aims for the lowest common denominator possible, and then digs deeper. Astley's commentary and rants are opinionated and condescending. Poetry is far more alive and interesting than than this anthology suggests."
0,Yoga for surfers taught by a Poser I have never bother to write one of these review but I agree that the video is too advance for beginners and I find it difficult to get over the fact of what a poser she is. She seems to be cashing in on surfing and going after a niche market in yoga DVDs. I have watched and done all three DVDs and I have seen much better yoga DVDs. I sold these DVDs because they aren't the best out there. Check out the Living Art series of DVDs. I found these much better then the whole series of yoga for surfer. Go mindfully and slowly. Peace

0,"Nope, nope I cannot believe there are no negative reviews for this. No matter any point of view (feminists are gonna be mad) or theory this book is positing, the basis of the book is not understanding female anatomy. I have no idea if the psychological ideas have been debunked. This book was given to me as a joke a few birthdays ago. You can say ""the reason your sex is bad is because you've lost your feminine role"" and hell, that could be 100% correct, but a big chunk of this book ignores where the nerve endings are located. In the 40 years since this was published, I think someone went ahead and talked to some women, maybe even did some science-y stuff and decided 80+% of women weren't just orgasming wrong. But its good that this is still out there, to make people feel ashamed of the way their body works. In other news, no one poops but you: cause you're gross."
0,Do Not Buy I know because I bought it. The gyroscope spins out of control and the string snaps on the first pull. The gyroscope is UGLY and DULL. I am Verry Disappointed and so will you if you get this. Do Not Buy it. It is made of lead and stains your finger when you toutch it. This Toy is Very Low Quality and it stinks. As I said Before Do not Buy.
0,doesn't wash off that easily We bought this thinking our kids would love it. They did love painting. But the problem came when we tried to wash it off. We cleaned it about 30 minutes after the kids started and we had to get out the pressure washer. It took about an hour to clean up. It was by far the worst clean up. It does not come off that easily. the regular hose did nothing to get it off.

My brand new Simpletech card has gone mysteriously crazy, within 10 minutes of popping it in my Canon S230. I don't care what the explanation is, frankly-- card error is a scary thing to see. Magically, replacing my trusty (if allegedly slower) SanDisk cards rectifies all problems. I swear, I did nothing wrong-- it's idiot proof. This card is just wacky."

0,Dragon Fire I just could not read it; it was too violent and ugly. Perhaps it was just me but I couldn't get past the first chapter.
0,"Huh? What is the point of this book? It doesn't have one, in my opinion. The author himself said that the reason for writing it was that he wanted to write a book about incest! I really do not enjoy graphic descriptions of this incest, either. I would not reccommend it to anyone, in fact, I tell others NOT to read it. I wouldn't have read past the tenth page if I hadn't been required to for my English class."
0,"I hated this book This book was a total waste of time. I kept thinking that it was going to lead somewhere or reveal something, but it never did- it just kept repeating names until I had no idea and no longer cared who was who and rambled on to an unfulfilling end."
0,"Disappointment I read this book after it was recommended by Oprah as being considered ""perhaps the best book ever written""! What a disappointment... I slogged my way through it, thinking ""it must get better if it's the best book ever written""... but alas, no, it didn't.I am a voracious reader, and read fro 2-5 books a week. I noticed Amazon recommended ""if you like this, you'll like Catch 22"". I loved Catch 22! I HATED this book! What am I missing here?"
0,"Magical, mystical piece of tripe I read (well, not really...I got to page 100 and felt like I'd read it three times already) this book over ten years ago and I still rank it as the worse piece of tripe that I ever had the misfortune to come across. But I'm biased. Like most Latins, I think the whole ""magical and mysterious"" cloak with which Latin literature is viewed abroad is unfortunate, but ultimately it's that kind of rubbish that sells."
0,"Not for everyone I will not critize this book too heavily, as apparently it is a classic and many people find it delightful. However, I found the book extremely hard to follow, and without any identifyable plot line. Yes, it is interesting to see how a city can develop over 100 years of time, but all the characters kept dying off, and I found myself not being bothered by it, as nothing made me connect with them through the book. I really just did not find the book enjoyable enough to continue past 2/3rds the way in to it ."
0,"Glad to be done with this one I pride myself on finishing every book I begin reading, but this novel severely tested my perseverance. I kept waiting for the story to generate even a spark of interest but it just never happened for me. Admittedly Marquez is a gifted writer and for this reason I was tempted to award the book 2 stars, but if I had to sum up the book in one word it would be PAINFUL, thus the single star. I've read a number of 'classics' which were difficult reads, but there were usually rewards for the effort. I can't say the same for this book."
0,"The author put one over on us... 10,000 ideas thrown up in the air and landed randomly on pages.Characters not even likeable except for Ursula. Too muchridiculous stuff making story unbelievable. The author reallyhas put one over on the public; I could have written a betterbook!"
0,"500 pages of boredom The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores."
0,"Classic? I'll come clean first. I stopped reading after 100 pages. A lot happens in this book, with deaths and spirits and insomnia and marriages, and it's all fairly easy enough to figure out what's going on. Yet, nothing happens. So much plot takes place that the characterization suffers. I simply didn't care what happened to the characters, or anyone in the town. If a bomb had levelled Macondo, I would have simply flipped to the next page to see what happened next, not to read on about the characters. If you're interested in a classic worthy of its praise, where characterization is king, do yourself a favor and pick up Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. You'll work to read, but your mind and soul will be enriched. Faulkner's novels are like movies you watch in slow motion to get every nuance. Marquez, on the other hand, is like a movie you watch in fast forward. You get the plot and action, but when all is said and done, nothing sticks in your mind that is worthy of the space it occupies."
0,"big disappointment I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can't believe all the ""5 star"" reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection. The characters are meaningless, the text is scattered and awkward. Perhaps something was lost in translation, who knows. I've never been one to give up on a book but I considered it many times with this one."
0,"100 years of boreitude I can count on one hand the number of books in my life that I have been unable to finish. I am oftimes mocked for my reading, the rate at which I devour books being astronomical, but I could not drag my weary brain kicking and screaming through more than a few dozen pages of this book.I love a good fantasy novel, or anything that gives you a sense of the magical, but I could not find anything interesting in the random and inexplicable bizarre occurrences in this book. Mix that with the dry, long winded prose and I find myself doing something I have NEVER done; sitting with a book in my hands, looking around the room for something else to do."
0,"Disappointed I expected much more from this book. It started out interesting enough but, seemed to drag on and on. In the end it was depressing and a little confusing. I like a fiction book to be entertaining and thought provoking; with a point, I did not at all enjoy this book."
0,You must read this book! This was my first encounter with the magical realism style and I love it! The Buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing I have encountered in any book. A must read.
0,Nobel Prize? So if the Nobel Prize is for the author's body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that's in capital letters). If this is his best work and most famous work and it is a labor to read then his other works must be capital punishment!!!Much like the best book of the century by James Joyce - Ulysses.Again another book to be placed in Solitary Confinement!!!
0,pointless This is one of the hardest to read most pointless books I have ever had the misfortune of trying to read.
0,"Emporer's new clothes. I'm one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so I plugged away hoping I'd experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found...but I just didn't get it. Maybe it lost something in the translation, but I prefer a little dialog in my fiction...even in my heavy, pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction. I don't mind the magic realism, but I do get bored with sentences that run on for two-plus pages without a period. Oh, well, chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck who's educated beyond his intelligence. But I was underwhelmed."
0,"Oh, my. I recognize that lots of people think this book is wonderful. However, as an extremely well-read English major, I think Marquez must be laughing. Without repeating the comments of the other one-star reviewers, I'll just say that I was more than underwhelmed. It's nonsenical, and (am I the only one who noticed?) misogynistic."
0,"Struggling I agree with the other reviewers that say this book is tedious and much overrated. I read quite a bit, and I usually enjoy everything I read. However, I just cannot get in to this book. Yes, it is rambling, confusing, and all those other adjectives someone else used. But I don't want rambling and confusing. I don't want to be spoon fed, but it would be nice if there were an identifiable path for the book. I wonder how much is lost in the English translation, and if it would be a much better read in its native language.I am a few hundred pages into the book. I'll keep reading -- and keep hoping that it improves."
0,"Appalling. . . I checked this book out of the library after reading rave review after rave review.I wanted to like it, I really did, but I honestly cannot understand all the high marks. To me the book reads as if it were written by a 6th-grader. Characterization and storyline aside, the language itself is what turned me off. It seemed stilted, contrived, lacking in fluidity, and devoid of any real color; an amateurish effort at best.Perhaps this reads better in its native tongue, but the translation I read was atrocious. I promptly returned it to the library, shooting it soundly down the return bin with a force that it so richly deserved."

0,"An Oprah Classic (in other words Boring, a Non-Sense Story, It was a required reading in college in 1990. It was boring then as it is now. No wonder it was selected as an Oprah Book Selection. Most Oprah's book are boring but with HYPE.The story does not follow any logic even within the story itself. You will get confuse with the repeated combination of names that are used througout the story. I believe there are only 5 (Jose, Aurelio,Miguel, etc) Fiction does not follow logic I know but usually a story (even a work of fiction) sets boundaries within the story itself and are bounded by this limit. This story is a waste of paper on which it was written. Marquez is one of those overhyped writers with nothing to show for. I guess this is the result of some literary critic needing to sell some books to get a comission from the publishing house.Sorry if I was mean but I was forced to read it college and felt that it was a waste of time and money."
0,"Bad, bad, bad What a horrible book; hard to read; too many characters; I never did figure out what the whole thing was about. I can't believe this won a Nobel Prize. Definitely a waste of time reading."
0,"Can I give it -9999 Stars instead? Yawn. 400 some pages of nothing but incest and death. Characters with the same name throughout the book. Non-linear time, too, it's very hard to follow. How could this ""book"" change your life? I have come to fear love, it's like your emotions are being dragged through the mud and everything you hold dear and ethical are just pushed away like its nothing. It was about incest, personally, maybe something was lost in the translation. It was so depressing and disturbing. I could not sleep without lights on after I finished reading it. I would never suggest this book to anybody who has a weak constitution or is easily emotionally disturbed. NOT good reading for a highschool student. Even Faulkner's The Bear was not about incest (it was bad too)."
0,"Book This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all."
0,"Don't waste your time if you don't absolutely have to. I read this for a college course. If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn."
0,"Drawn Out 100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. Most of the characters have the same name - either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano for the boys and Amaranta or Remedios for the girls. The chapters are long and have large amounts of action. Most of the chapters are very similar: incest occurs, a child is born, named Jose Arcadio, he studies Melquiades, fights with some people, has a mistress, several children, and then dies. I do not recommend this book for anyone that wants a quick/easy/interesting read. It is well written and conveys many themes and such, but is purely painful to read."
0,"I DON'T GET IT I don't understand why Gabriel Garcia Marquez will get such great reviews on 100 years of solitude, I thought it was one of the worst piece of Magical Realism that I have ever read.Don't waste your time or money on this terrible piece of literature, Sincerely, it is a pointless, mediocre and most definitely not Nobel Prize material."
0,"The Emperor's New Clothes After a couple of chapters into the book I went online to check why so many people felt that this was one great work of literature. The words I found repeatedly were magical and enchanting....When a grown man has the desire to take a nine year old girl to be his ""wife"" and gets her pregnant, than I don't feel enchanted but repulsed. Fiction or not. Actually to make that up, speaks for it self as far as I am concerned. And Oprah of all people to recommend that in her book club. I clearly missed the point about a lot of things and that male characters shared names did not make it any easier. My husband read it as well and we felt the same about most passages. I was glad when I finally finished it, as I really wanted to know the whole story before making up my mind."
0,"more stars than the firmament.... I wish I could have given this book ""no stars:"" it's a book that deserves every star that man, god or science has created, and nothing we can put here on the internet (or in any review in any medium) would do it the eternal justice it deserves. A dream of a book: I would pick it up the day after having read forty pages, start the next chapter, and wonder where it was I had left off the night before. A book that gives off narcotic fumes, that gives off disembowling violence, love, and indifference. A book that deserves more awards than humankind can bestow."
0,A fad which no one will remember in 100 years so mr marquez is supposed to have invented this whole new genre of writing with this book and other annoying ones like In Evil Hour. But no one seems to stop and say that the events of the story are ridiculous and embarrasing. who wants to read about an old lady who makes candy for her family for generations? no one. and the romance portrayed is nothing short of farcical. it's a wonder he's a star in the literary universe.

I'll have to admit that the unit appears extremely sturdy and well built but it does come with one minor flaw- if a part is missing there is no way to get a replacement part. My specific issue was the bracket at the end of the arm that connects to the plate securing the display. The part was not in the box so I called Omni Mount to get a replacement part. They assured me the piece was part of the assembly when it left the factory and there was no way to get me a replacement part. I now have a $250 mount that is useless. Gotta think that if they are correct, I wound up with a used or salvaged unit."

0,"Warning! This is a warning to other Pratchett-lovers out there looking for audiobooks. This is an abridgment of the original book, and a bad one. A lot of the best word jokes and philosophical humor is missing, many scenes are in pieces, and the whole thing simply does not convey the sense of fun and insight of the original novel. As well, in my opinion, Tony Robinson is a horribly bad voice actor, but that may simply be a personal preference. [...]"
0,"Only because I can't give it 1/2 a star There aren't enough words in the English language to express my utter loathing and contempt for this book. I had heard that Pratchett was ""satirical"", ""devious"", ""irreverent"", ""magical"", ""entertaining"" and ""above all funny"".Sadly ""Men at Arms"" is none of the above. Pratchett is trying to be Douglas Adams and fails at it miserably. This story in particular was trite, condisending, and supremly unfunny. His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of ""ho ho ho see how clever I am!"" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame. It wasn't. It was just lame."

Bantam Classics normally does a great jobs on books, but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all, left it unstructured and the translation all over the place, intermingled with the lines, translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the place.Practically, I am reading four lines middle-english, five lines modern, three lines middle-english, 2 lines modern, 6 lines middle-english, and so forth. There is no connection between the middle-English and its translation.That was a wasted 5.99 USD for kindle version and a HUGE disappointment :( ..."
0,"bad version to read The annotation style if this edition ruins it. Putting the definitions of words in line with the text, rather than as footnotes or end notes, disrupts the flow of reading. It quickly gets confusing as to what is original text and what is editorial comment. I'm off to find another edition only partway into the first poem."
0,"Don't buy the Kindle edition This is not easy to read in Kindle format. In paperback, it has two translations: one in Middle English, the other in Modern English. These are displayed side by side, with the earlier English on the left, Modern on the right. When it comes to the Kindle edition, there are no breaks between these translations. It switches back and forth without any notice, making it really difficult to follow. It would be alright if we could view it page by page (in it's original format), but without that option it's harder to understand. (Yes, it's obvious which part is which, but finding where it stops and starts takes away from the reading experience. It's too choppy.)In short, buy the paperback or perhaps a different Kindle edition. The format makes this a challenge to read."
0,"Looking for a great book on Titanic? Don't look here! I study Titanic and try to get every book possible on Titanic,( I've been studying Titanc, way before the movie was made). But when I bought this book and read it, I regreted it. It's a good book, for... how shall I say it, Beginner readers for Titanic. I give this book, in my opinion, 1 STAR because of it's lack of thought. The book seemed like it was made for new Titanic fans. Since I've been interested in Titanic for a long while, this book wasn't at all great."
0,"Tedious and Self-Inflating I'm always up for another look at the Titanic, especially if new light is shed on the story. Unfortunately, Pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person, or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of Ballard's expeditions. On top of that, it's not interesting. The retelling of the events on the ship are fine, but they can't carry the deadweight of Pelligrino's attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story. It's the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting. PASS."

Coyote Ugly is just repeating this, with a particularly annoying character who suffers from one of the most demented looking cases of stage fright I've ever seen.Jerry Bruckheimer usually does good films, but this is a case in which I would love to ask him what he was thinking. The only attraction to this film is a bunch of girls dancing on top of the bar, and the singing of LeAnn Rimes. He could easily have just made a few music videos and dispensed with the vehicle for presenting them. It would have done us all a favour."

0,Dumb movie This was the biggest waste of time I have ever seen. The only person that would be interested in this movie is a thirteen-year old boy. Tyra Banks should stick to her day job. She is much better as a model for Victoria's Secret because she never has to open her mouth & speak. I want the wasted hour & a half of my life back. This movie was very predictable & lame. Don't waste your time.
0,A nightmare! I rented this poor excuse for a movie and couldn't help falling asleep the whole time. It's pretty predictable and not very entertaining. It's not really worth buying.
0,"Special effects?! Coyote Ugly has the worst cgi and special effects I have never seen before in all my years of movie bashing. Actually, I just started watching movies last week. Due to Coyote Ugly, I'll never watch another bad movie again."
0,"Good intentions... Horrible execution. Piper Perabo is a great new face in Hollywood and I look forward to seeing what she does next. That said, I believe the director and editor (more on that later) should be taken to a public place and caned with a bamboo pole.What starts as a cute girl-coming-of-age-in-the-big-city movie begins to fall apart the moment the girl who's too shy to sing in front of anyone starts working in a bar that requires her to dance on the bar while getting buckets of water dumped on her. ""Oh I'm too shy to sing one of my songs in front of my new date, but I'll strip for him!"" What???There is a spasmatic sequence with a phone call, a trip to a club, a family reunion and a performance that had to have been spliced together by an MTV editor that drank way too much Mountain Dew while eating pixie sticks. One character even repays a debt that was cut out so she couldn't have even known that she owed it!Hopefully Piper will have better luck with ""Slap Her, She's French"" this year."
0,"Another tax-loss movie? You know you're watching a bad movie when your partner leans over to you and, without ever having seen the movie before, outlines the plot in detail, including accurate descriptions of most of the scenes to follow minutes after the opening credits have run.What on earth was Bruckheimer thinkning when he made this? I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie. Utter dross; Hollywood really needs a fresh injection of writing talent."
0,"Howlingly Horrible This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I've seen in recent memory.I watched this because there is a 14 year old in the house who is understandably amused by girls in their early twenties dancing on top of a bar....and is willing to watch a non-plot for a half-hour between those scenes. Short of a pubescent male, I have to think that anyone who enjoyed this movie is either miguided (hopefully) or an idiot.If this is really what a person looks for in a film, let me recommend saving your money and watching nearly any television sit-com....they're just as bad and it won't cost you four bucks a pop. Take that extra four bucks and donate it to the library. That way, people who are dragging the human race intellectually down to such a depth can at least offset the damage they do by hopefully lifting someone else up."
0,really weak Film nothing really happening with this Film.the Girls were Looking Good but as far as the Film Goes not much Happening.it's one of those films you watch when you are in Pure T&A type of Mood.it's fairly a Air-Head Film.
0,"Weak... Garbage is an alright band. I'd heard them live BEFORE they became huge. Still, this album fails to match their true potential... this is really weak."
0,"Not PCI Port I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI. My son pointed it out to me after I ordered the card. When I contacted Tiger Direct, they did not know that it needed an AGI slot. They told me to call the Distributor - Diamond, who after a 35 minute wait on hold, said it was not his product (it was). When the card arrived and I confirmed that it was not PCI, I was able to return it and get a full refund. It was a hassle taking the box to be returned. I would have preferred to know about this before I ordered it."
0,"Amazon duped. Me too. This game can NOT be played on the Xbox system that is sold in the stores today!! Maybe I should have known that, but I didn't. I feel as thought sellers should have pointed this out in their ad.My son has an older Xbox, and I am currently waiting for him to get that out of storage to see if the game will play there. Until then, my rating of the transaction is that it was the worst for me ever on Amazon.com, but that may change to an OK."
0,I don't understand all the hype over this Another case of when I side with the minority. I didn't get through it. Decided I had much better ways to spend my time. The only thing I really enjoyed was Meryl Streep's bit. I don't whether she resurfaced later in the film but I guess I'll never know now.
0,"Glich Heaven I bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell, But I was sadly mistaken when I got halfway through it and I kept hitting glich after glich. I thought it was my Xbox, but I took it to a friend's and glich after glich. I guess I got the worst game in history, but that's what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one"
0,"I like the idea, BUT... As both a surfer and yoga enthusiast i was excited to see this program created, however, upon watching the video it became clear that it's not all that great. It's hard to follow the poses when you can't see the instructors feet b/c they're buried in the sand and unless you have a decent knowledge of yoga there are a lot of important details about many of the poses that are left out. I'd recommend a non-surfing specified yoga dvd over this. You'll get more out of it."
0,yoga for surfers don't waste your money .lots of wasted time talking about how great yoga is.content is good but alot of fast fowarding.not useful as a work out video.
0,Dont buy This video is not good. Peggy seems like a regular soccer mom who decided that she could make a yoga video. Her instructions arent good and her form is not good enough to be teaching others. The editing is pretty bad. And worst of all theres awesome surfing clips on when your head is bent over in your lap. How are you supposed to watch the sweet barrels?Maybe the other two Yoga for Surfers are better but I'm over it.
0,"Don't buy the dvd, and don't buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed. It has nice surf footage, but the yoga instruction is really bad. The time would have been better spent slowing going through each yoga pose, versus racing through a large number of poses. Skip this DVD, take a lesson at your local yoga place."
0,WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS STORE AGAIN! This book arrived 2 months after I ordered it. I had already went to my trip to Greece. I was so pissed off!
0,"If you love the songs on Noddy, DON'T BUY!! My son was very excited as we put the CD in the player! But when the music started, he was very unhappy!! The songs don't sound anything like the ones on the show. The melody and pace are different- and the performers aren't interesting. DON'T BUY if you are familiar with the 'REAL' songs."
0,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. A total rip off. This 52 minute video is nothing more than 8-10 minutes of bad content on a loop. It is a video of one woman doing sing-along style songs. Any claims that this is a ""Sign Language"" video are dubious at best. There are very few real American Sign Language signs, so few as to be pointless. An episode of Blues Clues has more signs. I feel ripped off, and I didn't even pay any money of out my own pocket (I was using $15 in free Amazon Unbox credit from a promotion). Stay away from this video at all costs. I highly recommend Signing Time, which isn't yet available from Amazon Unbox. I hope it will be soon; I'm going to send the makers of Signing Time an email asking them to get their content online."

0,"Where's ""The Myth of Working Fathers""? The author's message, in essence, is that working mothers are not ""real"" mothers. I can only assume that in the sequel to this sexist, essentialist rant, she will reveal how working fathers are not ""real"" fathers, and how they should build *their* careers around parenthood, and how they are sadly mistaken to think they could possibly be successful both in the labor force and at home."
0,What a stupid book! Don't waste your money on this book unless you want to be insulted. Just because women work does not mean they can't be great moms. Finding quality daycare is key! My children loved their daycare providers and they loved playing with other kids. I like working and being a mom! I think I'm pretty good at it too!

Typical low budget mistakes, trying to do a horror with no money and using non actors. I paid 99 cents for this movie and I think I overpaid by about 98 cents."
0,"This edition is full of errors, mistakes, and typos DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!! It is full of typos, missing information in problems, mislabeled diagrams, and wrong answers! I spoke with PR and they said that, yes, indeed that is correct, but the 2002 edition has been corrected. Can you imagine what I went through while studying? I was second guessing myself left and right. I finally realized that, no, I do what I'm doing, it's the book that was wrong.Please don't buy this 2000 edition, it is a waste of your time and money. The 2002 edition ought to be much better, and probably quite a good study guide. I, however, have not seen it and do not know for sure, but PR should be a fairly respectable test prep. company.Happy GREs...hahaha"
0,"Most horrendous test prep book in press... Amazon should offer negative star ratings, because one star is far too glamorous a prize for this untrustworthy and erroneous book. I am shocked at the simple lack in proofreading the text, question, and answers. Students of Chem should never buy this book, and those that have should write the publisher and demand a refund. The only good use for this text would be as camp fire fuel."
0,"This book is a Travesty With just four years of chemistry background, I could write a better book than this in my sleep. What did the authro get her Ph.D in anyway? Was it sociology, or perhaps basket weaving? I am quite bitter, becuase I am trying to use this miserable excuse for toilet paper to prep for an exam two days from now. It at least reassures me of how much I do know because all the errors are so glaring. I think that perhaps this author should also advertise that they got their Ph.D. out of a cracker jack box. I will be writing to Princeton Review to demand my money back, and I urge University Chemistry departments everywhere to warn students about this book. Honestly, a retarded monkey with no limbs could write a better book. I wonder what Laberge got on the Chem GRE?"
0,"sloppy The topics covered are generally clear, but there are numerous errors and typos. There are bonds missing in the organic chemistry section and at least one error that is of a seriously confusing sort."
0,"Not so good I had three books to help study for this exam including this one. This book has many errors and it also doesn't explain things very well. I don't even know if there is a good study guide out there because the one from ETS doesn't even tell you how to do the problems, it just tells you the answers."
0,"Cheaply made I bought this for my son after remembering when I played it when I was younger. I looked at tons of different ones to see which one I should get. I bought this one and it came broken. I tried to fix it but even after it should've worked again, it would still let you put all the teeth down without the crocodile biting. This one is also very small. I went to Toys R Us and bought the one they sell, which I was nervous to do since you couldn't see what's inside the box, but that one is perfect and exactly what I was looking for, plus it doesn't actually ""bite"" so my little ones won't be too afraid to play it."
0,"do not waste your money i purchased this thinking it was the ORIGINAL crocodile dentist. this one is FAR FROM IT. first of all, it is about the size of my hand. yes, very very very small. it does not take batteries. you simply ""push"" the teeth down with your finger one at a time and when you press a certain tooth, it trigger the jaw to close on your finger. but, the jaw is held open with just a spring attachement which often malfunctions. and when the jaw closed on my sons little finger (only 3), the top part of the crocodile just fell off. it is CHEAPLY MADE! the picture is also misleading - this one has braces. i do not remember the original crocodile dentist having braces on its top teeth. completely bored my son."
0,"crap This toy came in poor shape - the plastic was broken and it was dirty - suppose to be ""new"" - It has not even been one month and the toy is brok"
0,"very small and lasted about 1 hour I was really excited about this toy. Unfortunately, it was very small and lasted maybe 2 hours before breaking. Excessively cheap construction. Worth it only if you find it in the dollar store (toy was maybe 6-8 in nose to tail)"
0,"Travel Sized --- Not what I expected So disappointed - this is a travel version. It should be advertised as such. It won't last through Christmas morning if it's even looked at! I have contacted the seller as to my disappointment in hopes to obtain the real game or a full refund, I will post the result."
0,"WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY I bought this toy to give my grandson for his birthday. It was ordered in October for his December birthday. I decided to open it before I mailed it to see how it worked. Well, it did not work at all. I opened the mouth and some of the time the teeth all pop up but most of the time 6 to 8 stay down. When they all popped up, then I thought it should work as described. It did not. I have never gotten the mouth to close when I pushed a tooth down. It is a piece of junk! Since I did not check it out until after Thanksgiving, I can not return it for the full price. By the time I pay for postage I would loose even more so I'll just trash it! What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!"
0,"May not appeal to toddler My 3-year old toddler loved playing ""snatch-the-toast"" from her toy toaster so I bought her the crocodile dentist. However, she is scared stiff of the clamping action and refused to play with it. She started removing the sticker-eyes and -nostrils instead. Toy is durable per se but stickers can be easily removed. I had to glue them back with superglue, which is better lasting. I came to a conclusion that she is still too young to play with the crocodile dentist and I intend to keep it for her later on."
0,Cheap Plastic This toy did not last 1 day. The spring mechanism inside broke after about the 5th game we played. I wouldn't waste my money on it again. We were pretty careful with since it felt cheap right out of the box. After the 5th game the mouth would not stay open anymore.
0,"Instantly broke We had a larger ""Crocodile dentist"" toy that my 2 and 4 year old really loved playing with. After a month or two the toy broke so you couldn't play the game. I bought this as replacement. It is very small and the game never worked - you push all of the teeth and the mouth never shuts. It's a shame because the concept of this game is great. But don't buy this one"
0,disappointed We played with this gift three tiems and it broke. Very poorly made. Would buy if I could find a better quality product becasue the game itself is quite funny.
0,"doesn't live up to expectations Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it's size. From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again. All in all, a disappointment and not worth the money it would cost to send it back."
0,piece of junk We played this game twice and it broke. The teeth won't come back up and the mouth won't stay open. Save your money.
0,"Crocodile Dentist It started out being fun, but was too hurtful to little fingers. It's not being played with as much as I thought it would, but it was what they asked for. Another toy for the garage sale."
0,"Broke after a week A tooth fell out but could still play it. Then another tooth fell out (can't replace) so made the game even less playable. Also, it was really tiny and more like a travel size which I did not expect for the money."
0,"unhappy don't buy this, broke out of the box,poor quality item, dissapointed child,worst present ever,stay away from this game not worth the time or money"
0,"broken when I opened the box When I opened the box, I pushed down the teeth to see how hard it would clamp shut and it didn't clamp shut. I returned the toy to the company and will not be purchasing another one. I was originally excited about this purchase as I have seen the toy before and the kids really liked it."
0,"Beautiful music, lousy packaging I was glad to see this disc reissued, even as a CD-R, but despite the beautiful music, I cannot recommend this disc because of the lack of any information other than the track listing. There are no liner notes, no timings and no indication of which composer wrote which piece. As these rarities will be mostly of interest to the more serious collector/listener, this is a major failing."

0,"Worthless I bought this book when it was first printed hoping for some insight into how Tomcat worked, design decisions, architecture etc. etc.What I got was nothing more than a rehash of the online documentation.A complete waste of money then and utterly worthless now. If you have a copy hang it on a nail."
0,too expensive The price for these 22 packets was several times more expensive than buying it in the 4 count package in a grocery store. The only reason I agreed to it was because the store had stopped carrying the item (but is now)
0,"Cinematic satire is dead Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se, it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best, but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps, like the American Presidency, lobby money can buy anything."
0,"ridiculously overrated campy trash Only actor worth a hoot in this thing was B. Fraser -- McKellen and Redgrave's performances were pitiful. Redgrave acted like she was a skit character on SNL; I've seen McKellen's effeminate, snobby British character a zillion times. If you want to be bored out of your gourd, watch this claptrap."
0,"POOR SUPPORT I purchased this game and it would not work. I contacted the manufacturer(Oxygen) and they asked to send them a diagnostc. I sent this information and never received a response(it has been one week). I contacted them at least ten times, I also called them and left a message without a reply.Subsequenty I learned from my computer manufacturer that this game requires a T & L accelerator card which is not included in laptops and the game will not work on laptop. This information could easily have been suplied by them instead of ignoring my request for support.I will never know if this game is any good or if it will work and I am stuck with it.Buyer Beware!In addition I would like to add that the phone support did eventually get back to me several days later and they tried to assist me but unfortunately the game is not designed for the current laptop but I never received a reply from the on line support"
0,"don't bother As opposed to the listing and photo, this product has no provisions for headrests.There are no seatbelt slots. You can cut them in, but you can do that on a flat piece of cloth too. In fact this is actually not much more than a flat piece of cloth. Save the $$ and use an old blanket."
0,Disappointed I should have listened to the first reviewer. It truly was nothing more than a blanket- with no provisions for seat belts or headrests. You could cut them in yourself but you can do that with a blanket and probably have a much easier time of it (cutting into this material and not having it fray would be near impossible). Can't believe it is being sold as a bench seat cover. I sent it back and got the Elegant brand instead from a local parts store. Elegant had the provisions for the seat belts and the head rests. So much happier with that purchase.
0,I did not receive the item I did not receive this item. I filed the claim but I did not hear from the seller at all.
0,"quite bad I did not like this book at all - the author promises to tell all the secret truth about Caruso (the stuff that has never been told before, you know...) - in the end he just tells what everybody already knew, only that he criticizes as much as he can - without any foundation just to reveal the promissed secret. If you're looking for a good book about Caruso take ""My father and my family"" in the unabridged version by Caruso jr. (the best ever written about Caruso) or the book by Michael Scott."
0,"HORRIBLE I would acttualy give it 0 stars.

0,"Boring,Boring,Boring,,, How an author can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. Ho hum, I can't believe she's dead, let's pour ourself another drink. I can't believe her mother showed up, ho-hum let's pour another drink and watch her clean the house. One big secret does surface, but it is rather mundane in it's telling. At the end everyone gets better, while the Mom who is easily the most exciting of the group, realizes life does go on after the loss of a child. Even if'ts is a miserable and shallow existence. Color this whole novel as grey and bland as a grief stricken day in the Hamptons. I was disappointed because I really looked forward to this book, and intead could barely muster the energy to finish it."
0,"If I could rate it 0 stars, I would have! I looked forward to reading yet another Meg Wolitzer novel, and I was very disappointed--in fact, I lost interest early on and never finished it.

0,"Would not buy were I you The book's horrendous, a waste of money. I could have focused on other books, but sadly, did not. The worst book I have ever read, with poor characters, poor writing.

0,Disappointed I read this book and hoped against hope for something new in vampire lore but it's basically the same old stuff not very interestingly written.
0,"Not up to expectations. I thought the author would actually REVIEW the outlet malls, not just tell us where they are (you can get that for free on the Internet!)

0,"Incredibly slow, boring thriller based on a fascinating true story I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes. It's that bad. I ordered it after reading Operation Mincemeat. The film is a sort anti-Ken Follet film--not the eye of the needle but the eye of a tunnel. No suspense, just boring dialogue between cardboard actors. Clifton Webb and the glorious Gloria Graham (in a bit part) couldn't save this belatedly patriotic and badly produced, low-budget film. (It was made in 1955). No wonder its out of print."
0,"Wrong item! After receiving the cd in the mail, I opened it up and played it, and swore they shipped the wrong cd. This cd is Live, and they don't tell that in the details. It is also a poor version, even if you like Live music, I don't think you will like this."
0,"A few good, a lot bad There are maybe 3 good movies in the bunch and seperately they are inexpensive movies. The rest are bad writing, directing, acting, etc. Several are ""foreign"" films I guess because the accents are so thick that the dialogue cannot be understood. I will usually sit through any movie at least once, some of these were so bad I shut them off before I finished watching them. If there are any you recognize that you don't own and are building a library, worth the price; but if you think you are getting 8 great movies at a low price, think again.DLP"
0,"Way too many ads In the February 2013 mag there are 40 full page adds for some kind of dietary suplaments and 18 other full page ads of a total of 120 pages. There are also a few 1/3 & 1/2 page ads. So all togather about half of the mag is advertisements. The mag is alsofull of graphics and full page pics. There are only a few articles and they are generally not presenting original, thought provoking material.I canceled my subscription after three issues. Maybe this mag is geared more toward body builders that can't read."
0,"Pretty sad, fake pictures and nearly all adds. Fake airbushed pictures, ie Andy Roddick. That guys arms turned out bigger than his waist. This magazine used to be okay. I think they spend more time with tanning, lights, make-up and Photoshop that they do with real athletes. If they cut out the ""4-page advertisements"" every 6 pages along with all the adds at back of the magazine it would consist of the cover and a 1/2 page article. They should pay people to accept it in the mail, hard to charge for a brochure. I just wish it was more ""real"" and less about selling us on smelling like roses and wearing $350 desinger shoes, cater to the average Joe who just wants to get good info and work-out ideas. I could watch QVC and MTV to cover any lack of B.S. I may be experiencing. Your best bet is to just surf the net, buy books, save your money."
0,Review of Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer I'm sorry to say this but this book is absolutely horrible. This is my third year in college and this has to be the worst text book I've ever had. The text is not very informative and the examples are unclear. The book doesn't go into detail on most of the basic material. This is NOT a good book for an introductory level circuit analysis course.
0,"Don't waste your time I'm a second year EE engineering student with 20 years of electronics background in repairing, circuit analysis, and troubleshooting. This book is absolutly worthless. The auther jumps to great leaps of understanding with littel or no background to show the student how they got to those conclusions. The examples are non excistant. They use ""conventional current"" which is really backward to reality. It used to be called ""hole theory"" back in the day. Go with Boylstead or somone who has a clue about teaching. If your a beginning electronics student, forget this book, you'll be lost by the 1st chapter. There are countless problems too lengthy to go into detail here. If your school is using it, spend the extra money and get somthing to actually learn from, just to pass the course."
0,"Really bad! This text book is absolutely horrible. I'm a third-year Mech Eng student. I've taken plenty of classes on hard subjects, so I know when a text book just plain sucks. This book does a pathetic job of explaining examples and basic concepts. I've spent hours trying to figure out assumptions that they should have just mentioned in the first place. And the poorly explained examples don't prepare you for the actual chapter problems. Because of the ""wordy"" writing style of the authors, basic concepts sound more complicated than they actually are; getting through the reading is a slow and tedious process.The book is utterly sterile. The only colors you'll see inside it are black and a little blue; there isn't even a picture of an actual circuit in this book. It's like it's writen for a machine."
0,"Required for course This book was required for a course, and the previous reviewers are correct...this book sucks. Also, I ordered the hardcover edition of this book, yet amazon in it's infinite wisdom (or is that total stupidity) sent me the softcover edition. Three weeks into the course and the binding is failing. Can't return the book because I need to have it in class, and I refuse to spend more money with a company that is unable to fulfill a simple order. Amazon, you suck at least as much as this book does! Perhaps Barnes and Noble will know the difference between hardcover and softcover."
0,"False Intimacy has false determinations about God & sex This book was a complete turnoff. Instead of relating to scientific, psycological explanations of sexual addiction, the author blames everything on lack of closeness with God and not being saved by Jesus Christ. This author could use a good shrink. Take respondsibilty for your actions. Is God or the absense of him respondsible for everything. What a crank. Buy this book and go to seminary school. What a waste of time and money. Pure garbage. Now I need to buy another book to find out about my sexual addiction (psycologically) not spiritually."
0,"An abomination I'm a Stanford-trained MD and practicing psychiatrist and I have to say that this book is worse than terrible. It is the most dangerous kind of religious propaganda mixed in with a hefty dose of hateful, spurious, ignorant ideas."

0,"Character sheets with different pictures Well, I expected this to contain a bunch of character sheets customized for the different occupations. Instead all it is is a few character sheets that have the picture from the main book of the different drawings of the different occupations and then a bunch of blank character sheets that you can download from the website for free. Also they are bound in the book so you can't take them out to photo copy them without tearing them out, or you just leave them in there but there is no customization at all. They're all the same. Really not worth buying. Just go to www.sengoku.com and download the character sheet for free and if you really want a picture in the blank space just photocopy it from the main book and paste it in."
0,SUTURE SELF Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Also the obnoxious Renie sounds like a real jerk with all her screaming and whatever in a hospital. One sure can not wash their hair and take a shower after shoulder surgery either. This it the first book of the series I've read and don't know if I want to read another silly one of hers. Mary Daheim should do more research on her books and quit putting them out so fast!!!!
0,"Needs a lot of doctoring An anemic effort from someone who is touted on the cover as a best-selling author. I'd go back and check out the titles that gave her that status instead of reading this book.Very weak characters, an obvious mystery, too-convenient plot devices every other page, cheap shocks that make you feel stupid when you find out what they are, characters that literally fall into the hospital room so they can spill their guts -- or confessions -- to our bed-ridden mystery solver... And someone has the gall to compare her to Miss Marple. (She blushes modestly when they do so.)Search a little farther on Amazon and I'm sure you'll find something that is worth your time. Try Janet Evanovich or Katy Munger. Their stuff will treat you as if you're an adult reader and not a child."
0,"Requires too much strength for toddlers The springs on this toy are extremely tight, making it very difficult for babies and toddlers to operate.

0,"""eh"" What was I thinking? Ok I loath britney and Christina.And though I'm more of a Rock Music kinda guy myself, even I sometimes get pulled in by alot of catchy tunes from the secular pop music world. And sometimes I hate myself for singing that shallow filth. Stacie is SO GREAT! I've heard all the songs from her album. They're all so good, and the quality is far beyond Britney or Christina. Cause the only good songs on any of there albums are typically the singles. Stacie's lyrics are uplifting, but never cheesy. The beats are too hot! She sounds nothing like a 14yr old. I am now an official Fan and will buy anything she comes out with! I think she's way better then Rachael Lampa, but thats only cause her music has faster beats."

0,"Was Larry alive when he made this? Terrible! 1. Yes--> I am a Larry Carlton fan--> I've seen him numerous times over the years. As a baseline, my favorite albums are his earlier efforts etc... My favorite song (s) are strikes twice and mulberry street.2. Which makes this all the more frustrating--> how can such a great musician turn out such... completely boring music? I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album."

I can't bring up one specific dance routine to learn off of the menu, I can only hit""play all"" then fast forward to the routine I want to work on.Plus on the first dance he starts out doing the dance for like 3-4 minutes, then he teaches you the steps, then another minute of dance time... shouldn't he begin with teaching the steps, then go into an extended dance time?"
0,"Rip Off First, the DVD was produced in Germany, and you have your choice of the instructor speaking in his native German or dubbed into English. Second, the German-language menu works, but the English-language menu does not. The only way to navigate through the English version is to either fast forward or keep jumping to the next chapter. Third, this is not for beginners. I'm a beginner and I should know."

0,Not Worth It This product constantly connects and disconnects every two seconds. I have an HP and the connector plates don't line up either. Every two seconds the included program refreshes the network list and connects and disconnects. It does not work.
0,Doesn't work This product will come up with the networks in the area. If you put in the network pass key it will connect then immediately disconnect.

0,"crc receive errors Installation was relatively simple, but the receiver seemed not sensitive enough for the location.After successfully connecting a mac mini with airport at the same location, I was convinced that the problem was the adapter. I installed another adapter , linksys, that worked immediately. Perhaps the super G will work in locations with clear line of site access, but it was not strong enough for my environment. I had to spend the extra money to get a working solution."
0,"Waste of money This program does have some good hiking information but it is not very user friendly at all. The maps are the worst part of it, you can either look at a small general state map or zoom to a trail map NOTHING in-between. If you want to find trails (and don't know the trail name) you have to guess on the state which only lists major cities. All you can do is click on the small state map and hope it is near the town you are looking for. If you know the trail name then it is OK. My advice is save your money and use the internet because there are many hiking web sites that have the same or more trail information and are a lot easier to use."
0,"Lacks depth. This book does not treat any topic in detail. If you just want to skim through Java concepts at 10,000 feet this is the correct book for you. The print is very sparse with lots of not very useful (rather large) images.I got mis-guided by all those 5-Star reviewes."
0,"Not Practical This book leaves much to be desired. Take the chapter called ""All About Applets"" for example. It briefly covers how browser and applets interact, parameter passing, key applet methods, and jar files, but it does not put together a cohesive, clear, practical example in the whole chapter. The best example they have is displaying a jpeg file extracted from a jar file. When am I ever going use that? Try putting together an useful applet for your web page from reading that chapter -- I know I couldn't. Fragmentation and lack of good examples occur through much of the book.Don't be fooled. This book had a 4 1/2 star rating this book had when I ordered it (with many reviews), and it's definitely not deserving of the 4 star rating it has now."
0,"Don't buy this book unless you already know JAVA The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money. Thanks to the deceiving reviews, I now need to spend more money to get a real beginner JAVA book."

0,"Mising Information/Incomplete This is one of my all time favorite books but;This Kindle version is missing very important parts to the story. Every time a letter or newspaper is read it is left blank. The whole story is based on the information in the letter and newspaper clippings. They are missing in this edition, even as a previous fan of the story I am having some difficulty in following along. If you are not familiar with the story you will be completely lost."
0,"Missing Critical Text! This version is missing text. As others have noted, whenever there is a quote from a newspaper article in the story, the text is missing. The entire legend of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" which does much to set the supernatural tone of the story, is missing! I'm only in Chapter 4 and have counted 3 missing passages already."
0,"Don't bother downloading this copy As mentioned by the previous reviewer, this version is missing quite a bit of key content. Whether it's a formatting issue with the Kindle or the transcriber forgot to include the passages is unclear. But the story is unreadable without the missing text."

0,"Don't waste your money on this one! While this DVD will, in fact, be playable on a computer or a Region 1 player, the image quality is very poor. Scenes shot outdoors will be washed out and overexposed, and any rapid on-screen motion will cause the image to blur perceptibly. This gets worse as the film progresses. I got suckered into buying this clinker before warnings about the difference in regions were posted prominently. However, I don't believe incompatibility entirely accounts for the poor performance of this product: it looks and behaves like a poorly-executed copy of a copy made by a company that is not equipped (or doesn't care enough) to produce a high-quality DVD."
0,"Stick with SimCity or Capitalism 2 I was thinking ""SimCity helped me learn about real estate and land use in a fun way, so maybe this game might help me learn something."" This game has no educational value. But more importantly, it wasn't even fun.Okay, maybe it was fun for about an hour as I learned my way around the game. But that was mostly anticipation. I then realized that I'd seen all there was to see. Don't waste your time. This game is simplistic and has no depth whatsoever. SimCity is still the best real estate game around, even if it is only in a roundabout sort of way. If you want a good, educational business game, try Capitalism 2. Good tutorials and an actual understanding of how businesses run. If you want a fun business game, there are plenty of other tycoon games that have to be better than this."
0,Not so great. DISAPPOINTING!!! This album was a complete let down. It is watered down. As bland as a piece of toast with no butter. Plain rock. Nothing Ducky Boys about it. I hate this album. I really do. I hope that they realize this and never attempt this type of sound again.

0,"Great collection - horrible quality As much as I love The Untouchables and was dying for someone to put all their classics to CD, this is not what I thought I'd be typing here. Cherry Red's remastering has terrible sound quality. Compared to the original vinyls, it sounds like you're listeing to these songs through giant ear muffs. None of the edge and liveliness, neither the great guitar kicks nor the low beaty thumps, that IS the distinct Untouchable sound gets conveyed here."
0,"Bleh! Honestly, I'm shocked that this production has received such high praise. I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed. She just creeped me out.Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it."

0,"Don't buy it! I never saw the movie when it first came out in film, so I thought I would buy it. It is the worst movie I ever saw in my life and I am a movie buff.

0,"Horrible, wretched, totally overrated Unless you are one of those men who thinks any film with lots of female nudity is ""art,"" skip this.

I try to give LTIP another chance every severalyears or so, hoping that something in me has changed or maturedso that I ""get it"" a bit better. Well, I haven't or can't. It still seems like an indulgent, boring mess. Yes, Brando can act.Yes, Maria Schneider has a fantastic 20-year old body. What does it all add up to? Nothing! A 2 hour waste of time. A movie with a totally emoty story and emotional core. I like a lot of stufffrom the late '60s and early '70s, but if sitting through tedium like this in the name of art was indicative of the era - thankGod we've moved on. Oh, and congratulations to the otherwise usually excellent Bertolucci and Starraro for accomplishing the impossible and making Paris look ugly."
0,"trash masquerading as art Don't waste your precicous time on this pretentious tripe. The acting is self-conciously artsy and overwrought. Brando's character is an abusive jerk, while Schneider's character just can't get enough of it. Spare me the nonsense please! If nudity is your bag, rent a Playboy video instead; you'll thank me for keeping you from losing 2 hours with this mess."
0,"Horrible! Brando is my favorite actor and he's known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job. He did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one. I am an admirer of ""off the edge"" movies and themes that are hard to take....However, this film leaves the viewerwith only one thought ""Bertolucci is a filthy, lecherous old man"". I rarely HATE a movie but this bankrupt, purely perverted film is just AWFUL. Hope Brando made a lot of money at least."
0,"Couldn't wait for it to be over! I don't understand how anyone can like this trash. It was long, plotless (besides the whole wife commiting suicide thing-I would've too if I were married to Paul), random and most of the time I was asking myself 'what the f---?'I can understand that it was shocking for the time, especially that butter scene but otherwise, it was a huge waste of time. Its amazing how many people say how great this film is and Brando, but to me he was just a mumbling psycho that terrized a young woman. They had absolutely NO chemistry and most of the time, I had no idea what they were going on about. Overrated, overrated, overrated.2+ hours of your life you'll never get back."

Yes, oh, so erotic. Marlon Brando uses a stick of BUTTER to prepare his girlfriend for... well, let your imagination soar. Its clear to me that every single reviewer who gave a good review must've been paid off handsomely. To me, words like ""vacant"", ""nihilistic"", ""empty"", instantly and effortlessly leap to mind. Quite possibly, the most over-damn-hyped, contentless, worthless film in cinematic history. I'm appalled beyond words."

0,"Beware - Product is not as pictured While the text of the item's description is for 0.5ml of Loctite 222MS threadlocker, what is pictured is, as far as I can tell, a 50ml bottle (based on a later google image search). I purchased because I wanted that bottle that was pictured that would stand upright and not leak all over. Instead, I got a tiny tube with significantly less threadlocker than was anticipated. Toolfetch doesn't charge much for the tube, but quite a bit (almost 3x) for shipping, so you won't return it if, like me, you weren't paying close enough attention and relied on their picture to be an accurate representation of what they were shipping. Based on the fact you can't blow the picture up enough to read the printing on the bottle to confirm its volume, the marked-up then marked-down pricing and the disproportionate shipping charge, I can only conclude that this was intentional on the part of toolfetch."

Yeah, these creatures are supposed to be BLIND, but yet they seem to be able to see just fine, and these dumb bimbos don't shut up. I love how ""horror"" movies like this contradict themselves at every turn. The ending is nothing but laughable. It's hard to draw the line between horror and comedy here. Just a pure joke, nothing more, unless you're another little MTV airhead who finds this kind of crap scary or entertaining."

These movies make you want something to happen so bad that u almost turn the movie off. Finally when it did get to the good parts they were pretty good. I wish the story line could have figured out a different way to find these creatures instead of showing flashbacks of people cheating with other women's husbands before he died and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. Different storyline, same characters. Might have then been awesome!"

0,"Slllloooowwwwwww and slower I made it through about an hour of this horrible picture, I kept hoping something would happen. When a monster? finally appeared, it was like watching a silly kiddie horror film, after this I said I've had enough, everyone else watching it with me felt the same way. This was the british version, uncut."
0,"Horrible film. This film is utterly horrible. Gore shoots from the creatures and women as if propelled from a pressure washer, the creatures somehow rip several of the women to shreds without their teeth coming into contact with flesh, their movements look ridiculous as they are not actually moving more quickly but the film rate is, the ""monsters"" are on camera far too much and end up looking silly rather than scary, a woman accidentally kills a companion in the heat of battle and is judged, crippled and left for dead by another of the group, a dream/gotcha ending, and a nonexistent plot.I am a fan or horror movies, but this one is just not good. It starts off with a compelling story and then ends up being a slasher flick with characters so annoying, protagonist included, that you cannot wait for them to die. Although a lot of time and money was spent on special effects, it is not a redeeming factor. As an obscure military leadership saying goes, ""You can't polish a turd."""
0,"overated and robbed Taking the classic James Cameron ALIENS premise, except going underground, this really got nowhere, despite all the great reviews--I got nowhere!

Though the book started a bit slow, it took up speed and turned into one of the best reads ever, to me. I was wondering how they would turn something so interesting and complex, and psychological into a video. They didn't. This does not, at all, represent that book. If it pretended to and I were the author, I would sue. What a travesty. Boring, schlock, Hollywood representation, turning every interesting story into the outlike of a horror movie that once sold well. Please, if you like the idea of this story, buy the book.

0,"Dummy Scared the Be-Jesus Out of Me Oh, God, do I remember seeing the dummy's face in the ads. That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn't. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I've seen the ad, I've nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!"
0,"Mauled again - killing bears to enrich himself Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that man is not a advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself."
0,"Sorry Jim As a former realtor, Mr. Cole owes the natural world a large debt, and believes he is doing good work. My opinion, based upon a life lived in the northern rockies, is that bears NEVER benefit from interactions with humans. The natural world is not there for us to enjoy, or understand, or study - it is simply there. If you are looking for a better understanding of bears, read Steve Herreros book and if you like pretty pictures, check out any of the other authors online who do not routinely place bears at risk by forcing encounters."
0,"harassing bears? Cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons: ""Photographer, bear advocate cited for getting too close to bruins,"" by Scott McMillion, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, 3/25/05. Cole has been cited for harassing bear in Yellowstone National Park. He hasn't had his day in court yet, but you've got to wonder. It's easy to get close-up photos of grizzly/brown bears at designated (and well-managed) bear viewing areas in Alaska and Canada. To get publishable photos of grizzly bears in Yellowstone or Glacier, you've got to get so close you put yourself in danger and run the risk of driving the bears away from food they need or a place they want to be. Grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states. Why bother them when you can get photographs of grizzlies in Alaska without stressing the bears? What kind of bear advocate would do that?"

0,"Author has no creditability I have read ""In My Soul I Am Free"" that the author, Brad Steiger, wrote on the life of Paul Twitchell. The book on Twitchell was pure fiction and Steiger played the role of publicist. Twitchell fed Steiger fictional information that was never verified or researched by Steiger, and Steiger basically entered into a conspiracy with Twitchell to defraud the public. It would seem that Steiger writes a book every-other month or so. Once again, this author has no creditability what-so-ever with me. He has distorted the truth so much in the past that I don't see why the general public can trust anything or any subject coming from this author of fiction passing itself off as truth! There is a difference! Not everything is illusion! This is what the discerning mind is for... to discover your own Truth over the deceptions of others that would prevent you from discovering ITS value and worth."

0,"How dare you speak of Jarvis Christian College that way.. I was shocked and when I read this book. I went out and purchased it because I support black authors. When I found out she was my sorority sister, I was sick to my stomach. How dare she put down Jarvis Christian College, an historically black college that you she has never attended. You made my alma mater look as if the degree i received from there is worthless. I have a very successful life as do other JCC alumnus. It is up to our black authors to protray us in a positve light not degrade us. Before she writes another book she needs to get her informations researched thoroughly.

0,"Poorly written and insulting Let me first say that I read the reviews of this work and rushed out and bought it. I wish I had slowed down and read a few pages in the store, because I would have left it there. I found this book insulting on more levels then one, to the point that I was unable to finish it. All of the characters were simple and single minded with no signs of intelligent life anywhere to be found! I am at a lose of words to describe how bad this book is. I would recommend, despite what you have read here, don't buy it. For the record, I am an avid reader who enjoys the likes of Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Anne Rice, Terry McMillan, Valerie Wilson Wesley, and many others. If you want a good, easy read about African American life, I would suggest Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made. It is a much better read!"

0,Pretty Toney Unfortunately or on Purpose!!! this album was released 2 weeks ago on the Net...and I had a chance to preview it - there a handful of solid tracks but as a referral the better album is Pretty Toney - The B-Sides...every track is a hit...I dont know why Def Jam did not want to buy those songs the lyrics and production are amazing...peace.
0,"Warning The music on this CD is great. My comments have to do with the way in which Amazon describes the product. This is a CDR, without any liner notes and the track listing basically copied from the web site. But you will not learn this by looking at the Product Details. You will find this information under Editorial Reviews, where it says: This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.While this information would have been better placed under Product Details no where does it tell you that you will not receive the liner notes.Amazon is misrepresenting the product. I hope my short review will help others who are considering purchasing the CD."
0,"Design flaw prevents easy installation For a 1/2"" slip-mount installation, this diverter spout is not worth the trouble.You must unscrew the diverter's plastic nipple, remove a plastic adapter, slide it on the copper pipe, screw the plastic nipple back on, tighten the screw so as to punch a hole in the plastic, slide the plastic nipple back toward the wall, tighten the screw, and then screw the spout on after applying thread tape. That seems straightforward, but in practice it's very difficult.The problem is that the plastic nipple is too small to fit 1/2"" copper pipes longer than about 1"" from the wall. The instructions say that the pipe can be up to 2-3/4"" long, but actually this is wrong. At first I struggled with trying to install it, then broke the plastic when I could not force it to go all the way in.I elected instead to go withMoen 3808BN Kingsley Slip Fit Tub Diverter Spout, Brushed Nickel, which simply slips in and then tightens with a screw, with almost no effort."

0,"Warning: Clip Job - Search out the Original The other user comments are technically correct. The film is great... in its original version. ""Deadly China Hero,"" however, is a clipped version of the film ""Last Hero of China."" I highly recommend the original film instead of this one, which cuts out several crucial scenes and important subplots. There's no reason to settle for this hacked-up version."
0,"You don't want this version! When I first put this DVD in I noticed that they cut away the opening, then the movie starts and I can't believe my eyes as the quality of the DVD is even lower than my VCD version, this is just frustrating to watch. The subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie, the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time, the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can't even be read. Another thing is the audio, you can't switch between Cantonese and Mandarin like on my VCD, yes this too was fixed to cantonese only. There is no extra features, you might as well buy a VHS tape, which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality. It does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused VHS tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting ""customers""(read victims)."
0,"Last Hero in China - 5 stars / Deadly China Hero - no stars! Deadly China Hero is a poorly edited version of the original Last Hero in China. I'm glad so many people like it but it lacks about 15 minutes of the original movie and they are the minutes that make it a cohesive movie instead of a jumble of martial arts fights. This taking of a classic martial arts movie, chopping it up, and then releasing it under a different name has got to stop! People deserve the chance to see the original movies!"

0,"waste of money Fast deleivery as usual from Amazon, but don't waste your money. This coffee warmer doesn't keep coffee more thann lukewarm at best. Spend more on the Norpro and you'll be very satisfied. I gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it less."
0,"Shame on you, Mr Coffee! Jeez, I figured you guys KNEW about coffee! This is a terrible excuse for a warmer. It keeps your coffee slightly above body temperature, not nearly warm enough to be pleasant. I bought two of them and am tossing them out. Anyone considering this item? DON'T buy one!!!"
0,"not warm enough The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer will only keep your coffee, or whatever, a little warmer than room temperature. Bought three of these pieces of junk for the office. They're going back to the store for a refund. Coffe has to be up to a certain degree of temperature to taste right. This junker does not reach that temperature."
0,Lots to be desired Very disappointing. Barely keeps the coffee warm. 17 watts not enough. Have another brand at 25 watts and is much better. Didnt realize there was so much difference. At $10 cant expect too much. Not worth that much. Not worth returning. Dont buy if you like your coffee hot.
0,"Luke-warmish is more like it. Barely applies any heat to the cup. Fresh-off-the-stove water was luke-warm within 15 minutes. Very poor, and highly disappointing, performance. Would never buy another ""Mr. Coffee"" cup warmer."
0,"Didn't do the trick I wanted this to use for tea when I'm away from home and it doesn't get hot enough, not even tepid."
0,"Name I know but.... This thing was a waste of my money.Thought that this item would be a good buy because of the brand since I have a coffee pot that is over 10 years old and has been with me longer than anything I own,but I was wrong.It won't even keep a cup of coffee warm not to even mention hot.Save your money wait till around Christmas time and get one at the dollar stores or someplace."
0,"This coffee warmer absolutely does not work! I bought the thing, then read the reviews. I tried everything including using a flat bottom cup for maximum contact, pre-heating the cup and making sure the coffee was hot when put on the device. I left the warmer on for 5 minutes so it was ""hot"" before putting the coffee on it. When one does this, the coffee COOLS OFF(!) when on the warmer. Gets cooler! It simply does not run hot enough to work. It does work if you only put an inch of pre-heated coffee in a pre-heated cup. Then it keeps it semi hot. I took mine back to BB&B."
0,"DO NOT BUY!!! THIS DOESN'T EVEN KEEP COFFEE LUKEWARM!!! MY OLD THAT I HAD FOR OVER 20 YRS. WAS STILL WORKING, BUT THE PLASTIC WAS CRACKED UNDERNEATH,SO IT WASN'T SAFE TO USE ANYMORE. I CAN'T EVEN FIND THE BRAND ANYMORE...(IT WAS SOME LITTLE KNOWN BRAND, BUT IT SURE WORKED GREAT FOR $9.99) OH WELL, I JUST GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GULP MY COFFEE AND GET UP OFF MY REAR END AND HEAT IT IN THE MICROWAVE WHEN IT GETS LUKEWARM...UGH!!!"
0,"Didn't Work, Period I read several of the reviews before buying and kept in mind several of the recommendations. I actually ordered 2 thinking to give one as a stocking stuffer and keep one for myself. I tried the first one and it basically didn't work from the get go (broken I guess). So didn't give the other one as a gift, kept it (didn't want to give a bad gift). Finally got around to trying the second one out... put a steaming cup of hot tea on it, probably drank half the cup pretty quickly but the second half sat there for quite a while and when I went to drink it, COLD. I hate to say it but I would not recommend it."
0,Arrived defective Bought three of them for use around the house to replace one that I have had for years.All three produced a strong odor of burning plastics and electronics.
0,"Doesn't really keep the coffee hot, just luke warm. Not like the first one I had but wasn't Mr. Coffee This product does NOT keep the liquids in your cup hot, just luke warm and I would not have purchased it if I knew this. I had a different brand before and it was wonderful but after 3 years just stopped working. It kept my coffee warmer than when I first got if out of the coffee maker, so that shows you it really worked, but this Mr Coffee doesn't do that, its lukewarm at best."
0,"Enough cup thermal insulation was not possible The rating watt of this product was 17 watts. It was place, 53-55 degrees centigrade that measured surface temperature. Because wattage was low, cups enough for the surface temperature were not temperature to keep it warm, and there were not enough effects for cup thermal insulation. I expect a product with constant thermal effect (surface temperature 78-80 degrees centigrade)."
0,"Where the hey does one find a flat bottomed mug? I ordered two of this item, so certain was I that this would do the trick for my coffee staying hot. It makes complete sense to me that it needs a flat bottomed mug in order to work efficiently and I never gave a thought when ordering that a flat bottomed mug would be so elusive!I have looked high and low. If anyone reading this review knows where I can locate such an animal, please let me know before I send this purchase back. Without the aforementioned flat bottomed mug, the product does a very poor job - so poor as to be useless!"
0,The WORST!!! DO NOT BUY!!! Ok.....I threw away the one I was using in my office before this because it was no longer getting my cups of coffee hot...only tepid and therefore wasting energy. Silly me. I was SURE ( since I read all reviews) that this mug warmer by Mr. Coffee would be so great that I just tossed my old one before receiving this. HUGE mistake! This has got to be the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon! I tried for days with several different shaped mugs of tea or coffee ...nothing..none of them got more than BARELY tepid! It is very hot to the touch.....but for some ridiculous reason it WILL NOT HEAT YOUR CUP OF LIQUID....and I'm speaking of a hot cup of coffee to start with! I was so surprised that I kept trying different mugs...thinking maybe it's the shape or...??? Nothing worked. Nothing.Please do not waste your time. Do not purchase this product!!
0,"Don't waste your money I purchased the Mr. Coffee mug warmer because it was economical and I believed Mr. Coffee to be a reputable brand.Don't waste your money on this mug warmer, even if it's economical. There are good points -- nice length to the cord; convenient on/off switch. But the reason for purchasing a mug warmer is to keep the contents warm, even somewhat heated. This warmer does not do that. It barely keeps the coffee lukewarm. I previously had a warmer by Continental Electric which kept the coffee at a very nice temperature and it was never cooled to the ""tepid"" point.This model is not worth the money or effort. Check out the Continental Electric instead, even if it's more expensive."
0,"Caution: It does what it claims it will do. I have two other cup warmers, but this was to be my third. It does EXACTLY what it claims to do: it is a cup WARMER. So, if you enjoy picking up a cup of WARM coffee -- you know -- like SPIT, 99 degress in your 98.6 degree mouth, well, good news, boppers, this is the cup warmer for you!"
0,"Did not heat up enough I purchased this item for my husband, who likes very hot coffee and tea, but it does not keep beverages warm as advertised. We tried it a few times and even when his mug went straight from the coffee pot to the warmer, it didn't keep it warm. Too bad, so sad. I returned it."
0,"lukewarm I do not like my coffee HOT, but the coffee cup warmer I had for almost 30 years kept it at a very nice warm temperature. This one is barely lukewarm, and I do not have a very thick mug, which I am sure the heat would not penetrate at all. Don't waste your money."
0,You Get What You Pay For This warmer doesn't even begin to keep coffee warm. Don't waste your time or money. Very disappointed given the Mr. Coffee brand...
0,"Oversize Coaster Like other 1-star reviews, this warmer barely kept the coffee warm. And like most other cheap electronic products, the cord was too short; just enough to reach the floor with about two inches to move around. Also, don't waste your time trying to actually warm coffee, as it took about an hour and a half to go from room temperature to warm."
0,"Warmer Just to start off, warmer is just what this thing does. I like my coffee just a bit hotter. This is my second warmer and it is not any better than the first one. I bought my second warmer at Wal Mart for around $5.00. Target on line list at $9.99. The major reason I use Amozon for most of my purchases is I can find things quickly and don't have to go store to store trying to find something. As I get older it is harder to get out and shop. Most of the time I get good deals but to be careful, you can get ripped off too."
0,"Does Not Keep My Coffee Hot I decided to replace my warmer I've had for years which was not keeping my coffee as hot as it used to. After reading the reviews, I purchased this warmer and was disappointed that it didn't keep my coffee hot. My old warmer kept my coffee hotter than this one. I used the same cup on both warmers so it's not the cup I'm using. I'm sadly returning this."
0,"not worth the money This a a huge waste of money. I am so disappointed in Mr. Coffee, I've liked their other products but this does NOT keep your cup of coffee even lukewarm."
0,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer / Disappointed It does not keep coffee very warm.I can lay my hand on the warming plate with no discomfort.Hope that paints the picture you need.
0,"Doesn't keep the coffee hot, don't bother trying this one. I've read the reviews and disagree with most of them. The coffee will not stay hot, luke warm at best."
0,"NOT HOT! I know it's called a beverage warmer, but it barely does that. I wouldn't recommend this at all. I had a cup warmer by Dazey (can't find it now) and it kept my drink HOT, as it should. I mean who wants a warm beverage, which this warmer barely does."
0,Doesn't Keep Coffee Hot If you like your coffee or tea luke warm (which I don't) than maybe this is fine. I threw mine out.
0,"Safe? I recently purchased this mug warmer to keep my coffee warm while working at my desk. I plugged it in, turned it on and there was a *pop* sound, a spark, and then a little smoke. Nice idea and all but I'll take the trek to my microwave over a fire hazard."
0,"Lukewarm coffee If you like your coffee at perfect drinking temperature -- DON'T BUY THIS. It's got a cord on it long enough to reach from one room to the next, but barely warms the cup at all. The base is also too small for most mugs."
0,"Stopped working after one week. This desktop warmer worked great for one week. It kept my coffee at a nice temperature. However, after one week of use, it quit working completely."
0,"Waste of money I agree with the others who have said this does little or nothing to keep a drink warm. Lukewarm is at best, and you still have to continue to reheat a beverage if you want it to be anything close to warm or hot."
0,"1 time use only After the first use, unplugging the cable. while it was cooling down cracked voice raised then it's not heating again."
0,"Does not work as described in reviews I bought this over the lower priced version, based on reviews of people who were very happy with it. I was disappointed from day 1. It actually arrived in the mail and looked as though it was a return from someone else, as the plastic was lightly scratched on the surface.I turned it on and used it with a cup of fresh HOT coffee and it only stayed at a WARM temperature. This only kept my coffee slightly warm, right about the temperature you would go refill your coffee because it's getting cold.I will be returning this product."
0,Ugh I read four chapters and put the book up for sale without finishing it. Why do some of these romance writers think it endears us to their heroes and heroines for them to be dumber than dirt? And why do they think it's funny to repeat the same thing over and over and over?Ugh. I got rid of Bradley...and Cruisie as an author I'll pick up and read.

0,"Dangerously flawed Galbraith is an economist who could only operate in academia--in any other setting he would be a joke. In his many books, which are widely cited, he attempts to provide an economic justification to socialism. The principle flaw in this book, from which all the others radiate out, is that all spending is equal. That government spending is just as productive to the economy as personal or corporate spending. He uses this assumption to justify confiscation of wealth by the government through the tax code. Of course, we know now that most of the taxes collected by the government is at best wasted money, and at worst counterproductive to society (welfare, subsidies, foreign aid to countries that hate us, etc.)All that being said, I highly recommend reading this book. It's important to know the enemy."

0,smallville season 9-amazon (beware of DVD wrong region number) Please beware that this DVD that I purchased for use in the UK is the wrong region number. It was sold to me who live currently in the UK but it only works in region 1 DVD players which made me really unhappy to know that to watch it I need to change settings of my DVD player but it has to be watched at once because I won't be able to change settings again and again as the appliance can malfunction after that. The return policy should cover this type of problem and refund 100% in those cases. It was not advertised that it would be a problem to play it in the UK which was really not a good sign. All customers have the right to know exactly what they are paying for.I am disapointed with amazon and this company for letting that happen.
0,upset NEVER even got my order now they are telling me it is no longer available yeah season 9 of smallville dont think I will be ordering from amazon again!!!!

0,"Yep it's a Zombie episode Spoiler alert there are zombies everywhere. This was a lame attempt at a scary story, but yes Clark and Lois have a moment... again. Don't worry though this moment will be forgotten in the next episode like it always is. Oh and Green Arrow is on drugs, which is kinda interesting because he went through a drug phase in the comics after he started killing people. Though Ollie in Smallville mostly just very angsty and self-centered right now. Smallville once and awhile has some good writers get to do some very interesting plot lines but this isn't one of them."
0,The Other review was wrong I am sorry Smallville but all those touching moments don't make up for you having some terrible writers most of the time. So yeah this episode has a moment in the end but yeah its also not worth watching. Just move on to the next.
0,"Misrepresented Product As advertised, the unit is portrayed as an APC OEM replacement cartridge with OEM APC parts. When the unit arrived it was clearly a remanufactured item using batteries from ""ABC"" (manufactured in Vietnam). The advertisement as presented does not mention that the item is a remanufactured part using non-OEM parts. This is my first experience with UnbeatableSale and it will certainly be my last."
0,"Who did shoot down the Red Baron? The other side of the coin - in fairness. To be perfectly fair about it, NOVA's documentary disputes the claim made by Keri Bailey ""Kilby"" in the review regarding the death of Manfred von Richtoven - so while Bailey cites undenialble proof - NOVA's documentary shows another side of the story claiming that RAF Flier Roy Brown did not and could not have shot down the ""Red Baron."" It includes autopsy reports and photos which neither showed nor described a head wound as cited by Bailey's claim.This review is made by author of Blood of Scotland, M.E. Grant."
0,"Von Richtofen & brown This movie was not very good. It seemed like a low budget made for 3rd world TV production. The planes were hoaky and most were the wrong type for the time periods portrayed in the story. The story of the Red Baron was incorrect as well, and the ending was totally wrong. For a movie about history it was way off base."
0,"Amethyst sterling bracelet This is made OK. The stones are washed out, no color. Purchased for gifts but will not give them as it will embarrass me. I would have returned them but I was traveling and missed the deadline."
0,Viewer from NY I am in complete agreement with the viewer from MN as to the unfortunate full screen format this DVD version was produced in. What a blunder! What a loss of visual information so important to the script! I have had to make a VHS recording off of TCM when THEY presented the movie in its' Letterbox format. I hope someone smartens-up and rereleases Moonstruck on DVD that delivers all the great cinematography.
0,"Where's the letterbox? Like other reviewers, I'm baffled as to why this is not in letterbox. I can live without super-duper extras, but I have no reason to upgrade from my VHS until a widescreen version is published. The rating is reflective of my dislike of the fullscreen formatting. The movie itself is one of the great romantic comedies-a love letter to love itself, and NYC."
0,DVD Quality The first disc was defective. Returned it for replacement. The replacement is very slightly out of sync of video and audio at the end of movie. Shows poor quality control.
0,"To call this widescreen is fraud I just bought this widescreen edition and feel totally ripped off!!! I own the standard format edition, and because I love this movie so much, it was worth buying again in the widescreen format. This ""widescreen"" edition is nothing more than the standard format edition with the top and bottom chopped off! This is one time you are actually better off with the standard format edition. I watched both editions side by side, and the widescreen edition was not much wider, and missing the top and bottom of the picture! There was actually more to see in the standard format edition."
0,it would have been good if cher wasn't in it her fake italian accent ruined everything! They should have gotten a real talented italian actress to be in this movie instead.
0,"This cd doesn't hold my interest, sorry I think that it is wise to review this cd seperately, far removed from the movie that featured it.This being said, let's look at the merits of this cd. First off, it featured classical music. The classical music used here was not your regular run of the mill hits that we have come to cherish, but Italian classics. This could be good or it could be bad, it just depends on your taste for C music. In my case this music never struck a postitive nerve. I guess my taste for classical music is to love the big hits of the masters. You know the million seller tunes.I really felt like this music was a waste, as far as my individual needs are concerned. The only song I really got any kind of charge from was the non-classical piece ""Moonglow"". It really stole the show in my opinion!In all fairness, I can not ask anyone to buy this cd."
0,"moonstuck When this dvd was released, somebody struck out on the idea what a dvd concept was about. The commentary's are helpful and informative. But help me understand why this academy award winning movie is not shown in widescreen? Or not having the input of nicholas cage and his viewpoint of the making of the film? Did I mention widescreen?This film must adamantly be rereleased as a special addition in widescreen with full attention to detail then it will deserve five stars. Until then stick to video and save your money."
0,Warning - This Movie is Pan & Scan totally unacceptable. I would not buy this movie until they come out with a version with the Original Aspect Ratio.
0,"Why not a widescreen format? I absolutely agree with all previous reviews: great movie, but it should be in widescreen version on DVD. Otherwise I can watch it on tv. I hope that someday I'll be able to buy the widescreen version."
0,"Disapointed I can't believe this Great Film Has not been giventhe widescreen treatment it ,and we, deserve.Some extraswould be nice too."
0,Are you kidding me? Why on EARTH has this been released in pan and scan? I've watched my VHS copy countless times and was looking forward to replacing it with a nice widescreen DVD. But this? Fuggitaboudit!
0,"Why Is This Not Letterboxed? I have rated the ""DVD"" the lowest possible rating, although I would give the movie the highest rating. Who makes these decisions regarding full screen versus letterbox? With the advent of DVD's, there is no excuse for us to miss the incredible cinematography in all it's New York glory. I absolutely refuse to buy my own copy of this movie until it is reissued, remastered and includes some serious extras. This is one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time."
0,PRETTY GRAPHICS BUT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY BAD. NOT A GOOD BAD . JUST PLAIN BAD.PEOPLE RUN BACKWARDS AND WEAPONS FLOAT IN THE AIR.THERE IS NO THINKING TO DO ON A MISSION AS LONG AS YOU KNOW HOW TO PULL A TRIGGER.MISSIONS ARE TOO SHORT. A LOT OF EFFORT PROBABLY WENT INTO THE GAME BUT IT'S STILL JUST PLAIN AND UGLY BAD.
0,"NOT for introductory food The AAP says not to make your own green beans, spinach, squash etc. due to the higher levels of nitrates so I thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my 6 month old. The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job."
0,"Contains Tuna Oil from tuna from the ocean. NOT ALL THAT COMPLETELY ORGANIC!!! Okay were do I start, how about this may not be a wise source of DHA for your child. Watch a movie called Autism: Made In The USA, so you will know why. The movie is free on YouTube. This baby food product contains the FDA approved amount of mercury, which is in the tuna oil ingredient, in this baby food product. You may not be aware, BUT, mercury never leaves the body, unless you remove it by means of medical treatment removal; look that method up as well. Mercury is not good for your child, no matter the amount, I am a mother and involved in science. Take my advice and try something a lot more organic and mercury free. It will benefit you and your child in the long run."
0,RASH CITY Left my baby with a diaper rash after 2 days of use. I didn't suspect it was from the diapers at first until a couple weeks later I went to finish using up the package and her rash appeared again. I'll never use pampers again.
0,"Swadlers are MUCH better - these are anything but dry My son is 4 months old and we've been using Pampers swaddlers pretty much since birth. We bought the Baby Dry size two when they were on sale and it's been a horror show ever since. 120 diapers and there has hardly been a day since when we haven't had to clean up an explosive diaper. My son is breast fed and he's not on solid food so a diaper labeled ""baby dry"" SHOULD have done the trick but instead it is un-absorbant and thus very leaky. Even if the diaper hasn't shot the poo up my baby's backside while he was playing then when I place him on the changing table, it is sure to do just that, creating a mess. My husband wants to throw the diapers out, I want to give them away but it almost seems cruel to give them to someone."
0,"Not recommended. I was a Pampers lover,but not anymore. I used Pampers diaper more than three years for my first one and again for second one. But, it looks like the company makes thin diaper recently. As another mom says,""if the diaper gets too full, they just burst and the absorbant material goes everywhere."" I absolutely agree with her. Therefore, I cancelled subscription and changed to another brand."
0,"Stick to swaddlers I'm a new mom and was first I introduced to pampers swaddlers at the hospital...nice fit, wetness indicator stripe, no leaks, good absorption. Well I ordered a case of babydry by mistake thinking they were all the same. I was wrong. The baby dry are ill fitting, poorly constructed diapers that don't even need a wetness indicator because you'll see it all around your baby's sheets!!! You have to always make sure to fasten them up high and tight if not they'll leak. Also if your baby has runny stools good luck. Sometimes they'll catch it other times they won't. I also don't like how they have a plastic bag feel to them. Maybe it's just me, but my rating stays a one star."
0,"Leaks at the kid's belly Leaks at my kid's belly (especially during his sleep or nap), which is totally unacceptable.Pampers Swaddlers, Huggies, and even Costco's Kirkland Signature don't have this issue. This diaper is good for daytime only. We bought Huggies for night time or naps.Very disappointing."
0,"Expensive and not so good Until I moved to the us I used only pampers, but I have to say that the us pampers are less good and more expensive then the israeli version.My children wake up in the middle of the night due to wet diaper, with the Israeli version of pampers it never happend"
0,"HORRIBLE! These diapers are the worst. I bought them thinking that I wouldn't have any nighttime accidents & my son would wake up dry.Boy was I wrong! Carson wakes up almost every morning with spoiled sheets.I use the Pampers Sensitive during the day, & thought that the Dry Max would make him feel more dry - but he wets his diaper almost every night!They are also not as soft as the Pampers Sensitive - which was a downside to the Dry Max diapers, too.I wish I would have gotten a smaller amount, not a box of 200+. It was such a waste of my money. For a diaper that makes big promises, I am greatly disappointed."
0,"They burst when full I bought these as a ""night time"" diaper. Most of the time, they work great. However, if the diaper gets too full, they just burst and the absorbant material goes everywhere (about the consistency of little bits of tapioca). It is very difficult to get all of it off of my daughter without giving her a bath, and I worry about what chemicals it might contain. This has probably happened three times in the last two months (only putting the diapers on at night). I am going to stop using them now. As a note, my daughter weighs about 24 pounds, so we are on the low end of the weight range."
0,"hate them! Hubby brought home these diapers because we were running really low and he couldn't find the swaddlers that we normally use. I really wanted to give the diapers a chance and used them for a while, even after the first few blow-outs. There was leaking every single time. It just didn't seem to absorb anything at all. We're back to using pampers Swaddlers again and I make sure we NEVER run low!!"
0,"""Dry"" is such an exageration I only used Swaddlers and Crusers since my baby was born. Recently I wanted to try the BabyDry because they were a little cheaper. This was a BIG mistake. The babydry don't stay dry at all, especially not as long as 12 hours as advertised. It would stay dry for 4 hours maybe. These things leak (not overflow); that is it I sit my baby on my lap, after a while my pants will be wet. Moreover 90% of the time the bed will be wet in the morning, unless the baby cries in the middle of the night and I use that occasion to change her.In the end these babydry diapers are MORE EXPENSIVE than the Cruisers due to the fact that I have to change my baby a lot more often. I will NOT buy these babydry diapers again."
0,"Baby Dry - Rip Off Good deal for the price? NNOOOOO, they are the worst diapers and they rip off (Literally the velcro Rips off every other time) and the diapers are so flimsy and can not hold anywhere near the cruisers. this is the first time I ever bought them thinking they should be ok as my son is old enough to go to some economical diapers. big mistake, from last two days we had 3 leaks and two diapers velcro ripped off while trying to put the diaper. Save your self some trouble and stay away from this diaper. still do ot understand how it got such high ratings, may be people may not have tried the cruisers."
0,"Horrendous Smell! The Huggies Supreme diapers are the only diapers my wife and I will ever use! They are quality diapers that never leak for our 2 kids under 2.Plus, they don't have any disgusting scent at all! We have tried Pampers and Luvs, and not only do they leak, but they have the most horrendous scent - we had to throw them away!Trust me - Huggies diapers are worth the small amount of money more you will pay!Highly unrecommended 1 star review."
0,"Would not buy again I have been using Pampers cruisers with both of my kids, and never had any problems. But recently decided to try baby-dry diapers, and now very dissapointed that I even decided to try. For the last few nights my little girl woke up crying, because she was wet from head to toes. Baby-dry diapers are fine for daycares where the child is changed every hour, but they are horrible for the night time. I would never buy them again!"
0,"Big Disappointment ! I have been using Pampers Cruisers for the longest. One night I ran out and I had to run to the store to buy some more. They did not have the Cruisers but instead had these. I purchased them thinking if I had as much success with the Cruisers then these should not be much different from those. W R O N G !! I couldn't wait to get rid of these !! EVERY Morning my son would be soaked through the diaper, sheets all wet, and very smelly ! These hardly hold anything through the night ! The name is not fitting what so ever ! I actually can't believe that Pampers would even put their name on something like this ! The diaper is thin, cheap, and honestly a headache! If you want something that is guaranteed to hold through the night, without any of these problems, go with the Pampers Cruisers ! Because these right here are a total waste of money, manufacturing, and time ! Major Fail !!!"
0,"So sad :-( We have LOVED Pampers - have used them exclusively for all 3 of our children until now. I just upped my almost two year old from Baby Dry 4's to size 5's, expecting no big change, just help with her volume increase. Something has definitely changed! I first noticed a new chemical-like smell I never smelled with any previous Pampers Baby Dry. Then my daughter quickly developed a diaper rash. This child has never had a diaper rash a day in her life before this. I was still hesitant to believe it really could be the Pampers (they're so great! no leaks! so cheap on Amazon! I've ALWAYS used them!), but finally bought some Seventh Generation diapers to try, and the diaper rash vanished. MAJOR BUMMER!!! Why ruin such a great product, P&G? So sad to cancel my Subscribe & Save sub for these... :-("
0,Waste of money I have used pampers for a lot of years but have always used cruisers. I tried the baby dry version and couldn't be more disappointed. Just two diapersin and both were soiled through. Now I don't know what to do with the other 190!
0,"Does not justify its name!! I bought pampers baby dry for my new born. An absolute waste of money. Used only a few and i already hate them. Leaks, and becomes a wet cottony ball,and does not fit right will not suggest this to a friend! And will not use then ever!!! I have the entire box just sitting and collecting dust!"
0,"Pampers Swaddlers are MUCH MUCH BETTER! Same story here! I have been using Pampers Swaddlers for a while before buying this after reading through the reviews. What a huge mistake! It never keeps my 4 month old baby dry, I have to keep changing it as soon as he pees. I'll never buy it again!!!"
0,"Not something I would buy ever again The overall quality of Pampers has gone down so much and babydry is worse of all. after just two hours of putting it on, it breaks and actually all the inside material comes out. I had to vacuum so many times after having such incidents. no more babydry for us."
0,"Oh, how I hate these diapers!!! When I had my son 8 years ago, I swore by Pampers. They were the only brand I used. I recently tried them for my one year old daughter after using another brand and in just one week I cannot believe the amount of leaks we have had!! She is constantly soaking right through them. They sag in the back with only a small amount of liquid in them. My husband is begging me to go back to our old brand, which I am promptly going to do. I don't know if these diapers work better on boys than on girls or if they have just changed them. I HATE them! Terrible."
0,"Will Never Buy Pampers Again I have to believe we got a defective lot, but the right hand side adhesive tab tears itself free on about 2 out of 3 diapers that we put on our newborn--after the diaper is on the baby and her clothes are buttoned up. We have resorted to medical tape to hold the diapers together. This is our 3rd child, so we're pretty sure we aren't trying to put them on too tight."
0,"A big design defect My son has been using Pamper Cruiser and never had problem. So I think Baby-dry may be the same good. So I ordered some online, but am very disappointed with its design. The first time my 21-month-old wore it, it left a red mark in his thighs. One big design problem with it is the strip that adheres to the front side is not elastic, so it makes it impossible to auto-adjust itself, and is not suitable for an active toddler as it may cut into the skin. I have to return the product as I just can't use it on my son!"
0,Poor quality Quality of these diapers is NOT same as other Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers (same size 5) that I have bought before. These diapers come with very small fasteners and so they don't stick well. Diaper comes off easily. This pack is economy in quality too. I can not believe this kind of product is made by Pampers!!! Will NOT buy this 144 pack again.
0,"Weren't So Great. We didn't like these AT ALL. I am a big fan of swaddlers, and these are nothing like the soft, meshy swaddlers. These are crunchy and thin like store-brand diapers. With swaddlers I could easily let my 3 month old go overnight without a diaper change, but these leaked all over the front of me when I picked him up in the morning. Hated them."
0,"New and Improved with Sagging Technology It takes a lot for me to dislike a product, but these are terrible! After a half hour the diaper would sag and look like it was extremely wet, when in reality there was hardly anything in it. They don't seem to hold much before leaking, even doubling the diapers for overnight still doesn't prevent leakage. Definitely, not something I will ever purchase again no matter how good the price is."
0,"strong smells, no longer the old baby dry any more I have been using baby dry for a year with the subscribe of Amazon. All the past papers from size 3 to 5 are so good that I found the baby dry diaper is the best on market and Amazon did give great price for it.Lately, I got a box of diapers those are very different from what I used to have. The box size is 172 diapers instead of 156, for which I guess it is the new packing, but should be the same product. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The diaper is very different. All the diapers give out so strong smells that gave me headache. The smell is like the bad play mat or some foam you could find in the cheap way. I then ordered a replacement, and the same thing happened. I have to return. And I guess I would not buy diapers on Amazon anymore."
0,"Stick with the Pampers Swaddlers! My almost-5-month-old has never had any diaper other than a Pampers diaper on his body! I swear by Pampers!But, even though they are less expensive, the Baby Dry type are not worth it! I found them cheap looking and feeling (they could have been mistaken for a store brand.) The absorbancy in the seat of the diaper was so bad, my son would wake up from a short nap and the seat of his outfit would be wet (there was not a fit issue, he was the correct weight for the size I bought, and the leakage was not from the top of the back or sides of the diaper, but literally from the seat.) From now on, I will definitely stick with the Pampers Swaddlers type."
0,Quality declined I have bought four boxes of this product in the past year and had been very happy with it till this latest box. We had to throw away a number of the diapers because the elastic is loose and doesn't conform to the baby's thighs at all. The waistband also tears if the baby moves a lot. Very disappointed in the poor quality.
0,"""Baby Dry""?!@ These leak all over the place! I purchased these for my 7-month-old. They are supposed to keep your baby ""dry"" for up to 12 hours (box states). I'd put these on our baby at 9 p.m. By 4 a.m. they'd be full to the point that they had wet his sleeper (so we'd have to change his clothes at 4 a.m. which did not help our sleeping routine.) I would buy something else and not spend the money on Pampers again. I am now using Parent's Choice diapers from Walmart and these work better for us."
0,"A raw deal I decided to try the Pampers Dry instead of our usual Pampers Swaddlers in hopes of keeping my son more comfortable overnight, because he sleeps 8-10 hours. Huge mistake! These diapers made him more uncomfortable. He has huge sores on his bottom from these diapers. The sores developed in a little more that 24 hours of use. It started as redness and then turned into sores. At 6 months old, he has never had an issue with redness or even had diaper rash. I feel so bad for switching. Beware."
0,"Horrible Diapers I bought these diapers after using the pampers swaddlers and these are the worst diapers ever! The smell of urine seeps through the diapers. Also, they do not absorb at all...not worth the savings!"
0,"one mess after another I have been pleased with the regular pampers size 1, but I'm very disappointed with the Baby Dry Size 1. They are significantly smaller than the regular size 1 diapers and do not cover the back of my baby, so it's been one mess and clothing change after another."
0,"poor quality This is the worst diaper I have used out of all the different brand of pampers. Just because it is more in quantity doesn't mean it is a good quality. I am not ready to more on yet, so I am giving the pampers cruiser a try before I make a final decision to move to another brand of diapers. I am hoping we can still continue to do business, since I have being using this brand for 8 years for all my children."
0,"SLOW SHIPPING- WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO DRIVE TO GET THESE I PURCHASED THESE 5 DAYS AGO AND HAD FREE ""2-DAY SHIPPING"" AND HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT. WE HAVE TWO BABIES AT HOME THAT ARE BOTH IN DIAPERS SO I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD BE CONVENIENT AND I PURCHASED THESE BECAUSE WE DON'T LIVE CLOSE TO A CITY SO I WAS TRYING TO SAVE US A TRIP... WHAT A MISTAKE!!!! VERY DISATISFIED WITH AMAZON!!"
0,"Looks like old product!! I useally buying dipers from amazon.com. However, the dipers on this box are looks like old. Also, I can see the brown spots on the surface. I really want to return it, but I already opened and used some. Check your diper all the time!!"
0,"They changed the smell: yuck! Well, I don't see why people can't just leave a good product alone! This WAS a good product but this box of diapers has a bad smell. It's like Pampers has added a perfume or fragrance and now the diapers smell really bad! My son had bad diaper rash & I feel the perfume/fragrance delayed the healing of and maybe even inhibited the healing process.Not good! Will be looking for a new brand of diapers! Will never buy Pampers baby dry again and am very disappointed!"
0,"Quality dropped in the last 6 months I have 4 boys and have always alternated (for price) between Pampers and Huggies. Both diapers have gone downhill in the last 6 months. They have less absorbency, the top of the diaper in the front constantly explodes and overnight is out of the option. The strip is not as wide to catch urine, it's been cut down. Constantly waking up with both my twins soaking wet, the diaper has exploded and the more generic absorbing material sticks to everything. We've had to change out the sheets, clothes and anything else everyday. Several times, the diapers have ripped apart so bad, they needed immediate baths from all the gel coming out. I've grown more concerned, that since it's coming out so bad, it's coming out of the buttons of their clothes and them eating it. Is this a ploy to get people into buying the almost 3 times more expensive overnights? I don't know, but they certainly aren't what they have been for the last 8 years."
0,"Leaked after 4 hours We accidentally bought pampers dry instead of cruisers diapers, so we decided to try them. I immediately noticed the odor of urine. When out with gramma, they leaked after 4 hours of wear. We normally use cruisers and they have provided us consistent coverage and have never failed. Cruisers seem to cover more surface area and last for 12 hours through the night. I also do not notice the urine smell as soon as the diaper becomes wet with cruisers. We will be using cruisers from now on."
0,"Do not buy These diapers are terrible. I have been using the Pampers Cruisers and those work well. I thought I would try the Baby Dry for overnight. Every night my baby wets right through these. I have to change his entire outfit during the night, which really wakes him up and makes it difficult for him to go back to sleep. Sometimes I have to change him twice. I will not be buying these again."
0,"New design- Bad change I have used the baby dry diapers for months now. The last two boxes I have recieved do not have as much of the blue absorbant material and the diapers are overall totally different (almost flat). Although the diapers worked well for awhile, the new design leaves much to be desired."
0,"Leaking all the time I have a boy and this diapers are really bad for him and for me :-/.They are leaking all the time, even if it is a new not over wet diaper.Buy something else if you don't want to wash the clothes many times a day !!!"
0,"Too Small even when compared with other level 1 diapers I wanted to try this product for my baby girl. To my surprise, it was too small for her when compared with other brand level 1 diapers. I had to reorder my diapers again."
0,"Diaper leaked after 7 hours on the first night I bought these because my 6 month old started leaking with her Pamper Swaddlers. These said that they were for overnight protection and would last 12 hours. When I opened the package I was surprised to see that these are thinner than Swaddlers and plastic feeling. I can handle that as long as I don't have to clean urine off of my daughter, her pajamas, and her bed every morning. She sleeps 12 or so hours some nights, but still wakes up for a feeding on most nights. When she woke up after 7 hours for a feeding, her clothes were soaked. Very disappointing. Pick up a small package before you buy the value size to see if they work for you. These diapers did not work for my daughter."
0,"The Worst! I am a longtime Amazon buyer and a first time reviewer. I am also a Pampers Swaddlers devotee and so I thought, a fan of Pampers in general. I have since found that all Pampers are not created equal. I typically use Pampers Swaddlers in the day and Huggies Overnights at night for my 8 month old son - who is not by any means a ""super soaker"". I bought the Pampers Baby Dry because they had a good deal going, so I thought I would give them a try. With ""12 hours of overnight protection"", what's not to like? The first night I used these, I found my son's entire frontside wet in the morning. Okay, so it's hard to find a really good overnight disposable. Maybe I should have bought one size up from his usual. I thought, ""I'll just use them during the day..."". Well, after just 1 nap and about 3 hours in the diaper, again soaked. What a waste!"
0,They always leak. We always bought members mark diapers (we were very happy with them) until we found out about amazon mom. So I thought pampers would be the best. Not so much. They're flimsy diapers. They were always showing his booty and always leaking.
0,"Avoid these diapers unless your baby does not move Terrible diapers. We normally buy the cruisers and I accidentally purchased the baby dry diapers. The diapers continually leak! Even when they have been worn for short periods of time, they really can only hold a small amount of urine if your child is at all mobile."
0,Not a dry baby It says they are 12 hour diapers but not so much. We use them as day only diapers and change frequently. I like the dry max much better.
0,"Getting worse and worse.... I use Pampers for my kids for more than 3 years.. I always liked them, until few months ago.. I thought maybe a packages wasn't good, and then I see it again and again...1 out of 10 diapers is falling apart... ""wings"" are come off, when you try to put diaper on!!!I don't want to buy Pampers again.... :("
0,"Stinky smell in a clean diaper? No thanks! Previously we had used Earth's Best since size 1, 2.5 years ago. I recently decided to save money on his size 5s and go non-ecological with the mainstream ""best"" which are apparently Pampers. Not only do they smell like pungent baby powder out of the package, they just don't work. Our son isn't overly wet, due to regular diaper changes, but these diapers couldn't even contain pee for a 2 hour span. In addition, when he wakes up his pajamas smell like he had an accident, due to the thinness of the Pampers. And yes, more often than not he was wet through to the pajamas, sheets, etc., and if he pooped overnight, he was rewarded with a sopping wet diaper, a wedgie, and poop leaking out. We have four kids, and trust me, use Earth's Best.

0,Pampers Baby Wet These diapers absorb MUCH less than Swaddlers. They don't have a prayer of lasting through the night despite the claim they last twelve hours. Really disappointing product.
0,Horrible thin diaper leaving my 14 month SOAKED THROUGH We have been purchasing Pampers Baby Dry through Amazon Prime Subscribe and Save. This last shipment of diapers were horrible. Pampers has lost our business. The diapers were paper thin and my 14 month old boy kept waking up soaked through. Leaving the bed soaking wet. Something is horribly wrong with these diapers. We will be changing to another brand ASAP.
0,TERRIBLE! Leaks! This is the worst nighttime diaper we have used. They leak 100% of the time leaving our baby drenched in her own urine! Awful. :( I highly recommend Huggies Overnites-zero problem with leaks and a great fit.We will not attempt to use these again.
0,"Buy swaddlers not BABY DRY We got a big box of ""baby dry"" from amazon. Our experience is that my son's clothes are soaked with just a small amount of liquid. On the other hand, the ""swaddlers"" take on a ton of liquid and my son stays dry as a bone and so do his clothes. We are sending these back as defective and ordering more swaddlers."
0,"Leaky... Leaky... These are THE worst diapers I have ever used. I have never had soooo many leaks, soaked through diapers, messes all over my son, in his 28 months of life, than I have with this pack of Pampers Diapers. I will never buy Pampers again & will share my opinion to others."
0,"chemical can cause a reaction We usually put our baby in cloth diapers, but we do keep a stash of disposables on hand for trips and emergencies. I really wish pampers would go back to offering their usual 'cruiser' style diapers without the baby-dry. Our child has had a bad reaction to them-- she gets diaper rash almost immediately."
0,"I hate these diapers I like Pampers but the baby dry has got to go, it has no give to the sides and DD leaked through every one of them."
0,pampers fell apart I was very dissapointed in the quality of the last batch of pampers that I bought. 1/4 of the diapers fell apart as I was putting them on my daughter. I switched to Huggies because of this and have not bought any more pampers.
0,"Worst diapers ever These diapers are terrible. They leak in the front, through the diaper! How does that even happen? My 6 month old needed a new one every two hours, otherwise it would leak and soak his clothes. Putting him in one for bedtime was a joke. 12 hours? No way. We had to buy a case of Swaddlers for nighttime so he wouldn't soak his PJ's at night. Don't waste your money- get the Swaddlers, they're fantastic!"
0,"Deducted fundings even if I hadn't finalized the order! Started an order, which I never completed. Looked at my card and they had withheld the amount for the order, which I never completed! Called them, and they confirm that I haven't placed an order, but they are unable to credit my account in another 10 days! This was on a gift card!The customer service agent promised to take care of it first thing and he even stated that he was going to email me immediately the next morning. Two days later, after no email, I called and they have no idea of my issue, and we start over again with the talk about the 10 days. Noone seems to know why they've taken over $200 from the card."
0,"12 hour relief?! We started off with the Pampers Swaddlers, and I bought these ones by mistake. Since I had them, and the reviews were quite good, I decided to keep them. They claim to have an 'ultra absorb core for outstanding leakage protection', but my baby is 10 lbs (size 1 is for 8-14lbs), and after about 5 hours, she had actually leaked through and out onto her outfit! Not just a bit, but palpably and visibly wet! I would pay the extra money and buy the Swaddlers, which is what I have done."
0,"They leak when regular swaddler diapers don't I originally bought these diapers for my daughter to wear at night. They leaked so badly that I couldn't use them. My daughter would be soaked from her chest clear down to her socks. Of course she would wake up early. I had to wash all of her bedding and her jammies every night. You can imagine what the scene looked like when she pooped! To get rid of this box of diapers, I used them during day use, but, again, the swaddlers worked better and seemed more comfortable for my daughter. The Baby Dry seemed very thin and very uncomfortable....almost papery. Not good."
0,"New Design Leaks Loved the old design - my baby stayed dry through the night. Now, every morning he is soaked. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I didn't mind paying a premium price for the old design - it was phenomenal. The new design does not compare. I have switched to Luvs."
0,"Hate it!!! At first, I thought it was just one or two diapers that have sand like in them but it's actually the whole box of diapers that have sand in EVERY DIAPER. But I willing to give it another try. Unfortunately, the 2rd and 3rd boxes were still the same (still have tons of sand like in every diaper). The changing table and crib were filled with tiny sand like everytime I changed my baby diaper. It's freaking me out cause my baby is super active and she's at the stage where she puts everything in her mouth. So, no more Pamper Baby Dry for me."
0,"Horrible diapers I did not like these diapers at all! They leaked at night and even during the day. As soon as my 10 month old daughter peed in them, these diapers hung to the knees."
0,"HORRIBLE!!! I CHANGED FROM HUGGIES TO PAMPERS BECAUSE OF THE PRICE BUT NOW I SEE THAT HUGGIES IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE. MY SON USED PAMPERS WHEN HE WAS BORN JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE BRAND THE HOSPITAL WAS USING, BUT I QUICKLY CHANGES TO HUGGIES AND WAS VERY PLEASED. THEN I DECIDED TO GIVE PAMPERS BABY DRY A TRY SINCE THE PRICE WAS CHEAPER AND I GOT MORE DIAPERS FOR MY MONEY. THEY RAVE ABOUT A BABY DRY SYSTEM THAT LAST 12HOURS.....NOT AT ALL. MY BABY LEAKS AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS. THE DIAPERS ARE EXTREMELY THIN. I STILL HAVE SOME HUGGIES LEFT OVER AND I HAVE TO USE THOSE FOR NIGHTIME BECAUSE IF I USE THE PAMPERS MY BABY WAKES UP CRYING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NITE ALL WET THROUGH HIS ONESIE, PJ'S AND CRIB SHEET!!! HORRIBLE DIAPER...NOW I'M STUCK WITH OVER 200 DIAPERS. I'M GOING BACK TO HUGGIES AS SOON AS I FINISH THIS PACK, UNFORTUNATELY WILL HAVE TO BUY HUGGIES OVERNITES MEANWHILE I FINISH THE PAMPERS."
0,I wish there was a no star rating! These are awful! They gave our son an angry red raw rash all around his pelvic area! We even took him to the doctor thinking it may have been some time of Thrush from antibiotics! Do not purchase these if your child has sensitive skin or may be allergic to the filler!
0,"Huggies Snug and dry Is much better, and are almost same price I made a huge mistake by buying the baby dry after reading through the reviews. I thought that for the price, why not try them. What a huge mistake! I should have just bought a smaller amount to try them first. Instead we have been using these for over a month now and I have had to clean up a poop spill at least every other day. My baby was 4 months old when we started using these and since he is not eating solids yet, the poop is pretty runny. The baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on. It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the HuggiesSnug & dry from now on, The Snug and dry from huggies absorb much better that those lousy ones, Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Snug and dry or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SNUG AND DRY!!"
0,Most likely your order will not ship - do not order Do not buy diapers from Amazon. Your order will likely not ship unti lafter a couple of months or one fine day you will discover that your order has been cancelled because they ran out of stock. Not only that if your original order had multiple items on it and had qualified for free shipping they will charge you the shipping amount even though they are unable to fulfil this part of your order. I have voiced this concern strongly to CS and believe this is a false business practice they are following. If I were you I'd stay away from diaper shopping at Amazon.
0,"Surprisingly Poor Quality We use a lot of diapers and frequently go back and forth between Pampers and Huggies as our child grows. Our 18 month-old son definitely wears size 4 but this version of Pampers seems slightly too small. Worse, the stick-on flaps are much less sticky than most diapers we use. Several times his diaper has actually come loose because the flap unsticks during the night resulting in a wet boy. Not sure if this was just a bad batch or there is something different with this particular model. We have not had problems with other Pampers in the past."
0,"Terrible product, leaks over half the time We ran out of Earths Best and so I got some of these at Walgreens to hold us over. I am simply shocked that these diapers leak very badly over half the time. I was expecting these to perform better than Earths Best simply because they've been in business for so much longer and can use all the fancy chemicals. That was not the case at all. I can't believe these diapers are still on the market. It's like they have holes in them. Our son does like the Elmo image, though."
0,"Worst diaper This is a worst diaper I ever used for my kids. I bought this just to try , because of its price. This diaper is like a tissue paper. easily tear"
0,"Terrible! We went from Swaddlers Sensitive to Baby Dry and were so disappointed after less than a week that we gave them away and went back to the Swaddlers. First of all not only did they leak urine (EVERY night woke up soaked) but even during the day when I changed my four month old's diaper after only a couple of hours his skin was very damp. Now he's never had a diaper rash, and all Ive ever used to keep him dry were the swaddler and baby powder but with these diapers I started using desitin just to keep the urine off his skin. They also couldnt hold in his poops. EVERY time he pooped (not exaggerating) it was a complete blow out, down his legs, up the back of his clothes. We NEVER had this problem with the Swaddlers. I also have to agree with the post about them being too thin, feeling recycled and rough against babys skin. The Swaddlers are MUCH better."
0,"poor I was not happy with pampers diapers. I was using huggies before and after I switched to pamper, there were more leakage accidents. Plus the side wings broke couple of time while putting on diapers. So overall I was not happy with the pampers this product. I had used pampers with my first child few years ago and they were fine."
0,"Terrible diapers This baby dry diaper is supposed to be used for longer duration at nights. Out of the 5 diapers I have used, the gel balls from 2 of them burst and spread all over the house. I have been using the pampers swaddlers and the pampers cruisers but never had issues with them. I will never buy the pampers "" baby dry"" diapers again."
0,Poop leaks out the back As soon as I got these diapers I was surprised at how light and thin they were and I was also worried about the absorbent pad not running all the way to the back. The next day my fears were realized and I got poop all over my shorts. It leaked right out the back. These diapers have a cheap look to them and they perform that way too. I still have about 240 of these left so it will be a long month! My wife thought it was pretty funny though.

0,"Pampers Baby Dry Size 2 I bought these for my 5 month old because I thought they would be as good as the Swaddlers since Pampers are the best diapers, but I was sadly mistaken. The Baby Dry diapers would leak after only 1 hour of being used. It seemed like the urine would be collected in the front by the turqoise lining, but once it was full, it would bubble up & leak. One night I had to change the crib sheets twice....these diapers were a nightmare!!! Never again would I buy these."
0,No waistband! These diapers do not have a stretchy wastband. Poop frequently runs up my childs back!!! I will never use these diapers again because of all the extra laundry and mess they created for me.
0,Very bad product from Pampers its very bad diaper from Pampers.. It wont keep dry more than 2 hours.. during night i have to change my kids diaper 3 times.. thats being very worst thing.i bought new diaper for my kid.. i stop using this diaper.. i am totally unhappy with this pamper product.
0,"What a disappointment After reading the baby dry reviews, I bought a pack of 228--BIG MISTAKE! They feel ultra soggy after 2 hours (the other brands do not) and I can't even go without changing her after her early morning feeding. When we do change her, it seems like the diaper isn't wicking the moisture away properly as she seems a little damp (yes, even after just 2 hours). I'm dissatisfied that the box says 12 hour protection, when it really maxes out at about 4 hours. Even my husband asked me why I bought the crappy brand :( We absolutely love the swaddlers and swaddlers sensitive--they both make it through the night (anywhere from 8-12 hours) for my 3 month old daughter. I'm a little disappointed in Pampers right now because we have loved all their other products, but now I feel like I'm stuck with 200+ diapers that I paid for and probably won't use."
0,Diaper rash galore My baby was extremely sore after using one of these diapers for just one day. I am sending my order back because of this. No wonder it was such a great price!
0,Most of the diapers strap are useless Most of the diapers' strap are glued to diaper itself such a way that you cannot use those diapers. I am just throwing away lots of diapers without using it...
0,Pampers chemicals=rash I tried all the different diapers before converting to cloth pocket diapers. We used these Pampers for a few months before swearing off disposables completely. Pampers don't hold leaks and are filled with so many chemicals that they gave my baby a rash. I felt horrible about using something that filled up the trash so fast!
0,"Terrible for #2 Terrible poop control. Spills right out the sides and back. Absorbent for urine only, would not recommend this product. Swaddlers are much softer, and much more absorbent,I have not had any spillage events with swaddlers."
0,Does NOT stay DRY! Every single night my 11 month old daughter would wet through these diapers and get her sheets completely wet! HORRIBLE buy in my opinion!
0,"Exploding diapers Our daughter is 6 months old and 19 lbs. She has been wearing these size 3 Pampers, and we wake up to exploded diapers many mornings, with little gel beads all over DD. I'm switching to Huggies overnight, based on a co-worker's recommendation."
0,"Huggies are better . . . I, like many other reviewers, fell into the trap of buying these because they were going for a great price. My son had been wearing Huggies size 3, but I thought these might be worth a try. My husband and I now have a joke that our son has been crawling in the cobwebs again. These diapers fall apart and the fibers look like little spiderwebs hanging off his little bum. Sometimes we find our son plucking the ""webs"" off his diaper like someone plucking a chicken. I would not recommend these diapers, especially for active babies."
0,Baby Dry Runs Very Small I moved my daughter up from a size 1 Pampers Sensitive to the size 2 Baby Dry. The diapers are the exact same size. We have a blow-out every BM. I am so mad right now. How can the sizing be so off? I am stuck with two big boxes now of diapers I cannot use.
0,"Awful-chemical smell I have solely been a pampers mom but after buying these I'm thinking of trying something new.The diapers reeked of chemicals, very unhappy and very upset that I had 246 to go through. I will not buy diapers online again, at least not these."
0,"They leak, stink, and cause rashes People kept telling me to try Pampers because they hold a lot of pee. We primarily use cloth diapers and our cloth diapers work well for nighttime (11 hours) but sometimes I just hate waking up to that ammonia stink. I decided to try some different kinds of disposables to see if I could find a brand that would work all night without a change. We tried Seventh Generation and Nurtured by Nature, and they work off and on. I thought I would finally give some Pampers a try and see if the package was right. It says these are good for 12 hours. Not for us! They leak worse than the chlorine-free disposables and stink like powder. My son's closet (where these are stored) now has a stinky powdery smell. Some people might like this smell, but to me it smells bad. I decided to use them up by using them during the day and they gave my son a horrible rash.Never. Again."
0,"LEAKS !!! I AM SO DISSAPOINTED WITH THE NEW BABY DRY DIAPERS .I have been using Pampers cruisers for my son and have rarely had any leakage ..Maybe an occassional leak which is not bad.I was happy with Pampers.I decided to give ""Baby Dry"" a try bcos it claimed to have a more absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I am sooo disappointed. The core seems to be WAAAAAYYY inferior to the Cruisers core and leaks !! I started using them a few days back and my son has woken up atleast 5 nights crying bcos he was soaking wet !! :(This morning I was holding him and my shirt felt wet. The diaper was leaking and it went thru his clothes onto mine !! So its not just about night time leaks. So much for absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I was better off with my tried and trusted Cruisers.NEVER HAD SUCH A BAD CASE OF LEAKS WITH CRUISERS .......WILL NEVER USE BABY DRY DIAPERS AGAIN.I hope Pampers is not dropping its quality :("
0,"Not so Baby Dry At first we tried Pampers swaddlers, and they were great except that my baby developed a diaper rash when using them. We switched to Baby Dry, and the rash went away. However, they consistantly leaked whenever he was on his side while nursing. About 10 times I have ended up with a wet lap.Also, they do not fit very well, as they have no stretch around the waist. We switched to Huggies and they are wonderful. They haven't ever leaked and they stretch around the legs and waist."
0,"The diapers actually FALL APART. Every night we put our 1 year old in one of these diapers, and most mornings he wakes up not just leaky, but with the seams of the diaper opened up and the absorbent material all over his clothes and skin! But since we bought so many we have had to keep using them and dealing with this disgusting problem day after day.They are fine during the day, when we change him fairly often. But during the 12 hour night time they are useless. Huggies leak too, but at least they don't explode."
0,"Horrible! I won't use these again! They kept falling apart and the gel crystals went everywhere! They got all over my toddlers bed!!! I change his diaper every couple of hours, there is no way these could be used for 12 hours to keep your baby dry. I'm never buying pampers again, horrible experience with these."
0,"Amazon is very very slow in Shipping/Delivery for Diapers Amazon says the delivery is within 24 hours for diapers when you look at the item.After placing the order, it always gives the shipping date atleast 2 to 3 weeks after palcing order. You child may go the next size by the time you receive the box.Please order the next size if you ever order diapers from Amazon."
0,"I do NOT like pampers AT ALL I use these for my son, at night since he is potty trained during the day! He has woken up wet, WAY too many times, which means he is wet AND his bed! This has NEVER happened with Luvs...they are SOO much better of a diaper and cheaper too! All pamper has going for them is their name!"
0,"Never Again I decided to try these diapers instead of the swaddlers to save a few dollars. Needless to say that was a mistake. They claim to keep baby dry for up to 12 hours. My little one can't use these to sleep through the night (6 hours). I don't recommend these at all. Spend a few extra dollars on the swaddlers, you'll make your money back on the $ saved on extra laundry they cause because they leak."
0,"Leaky diaper...cheap - use Cruisers instead! I decided to buy this over the cruisers since i'd save a few dollars and get a few extra diapers at the same time. Unfortunately, this diaper would fall apart in my hands as I opened it to put it on my son. In addition, my son would leak. So i decided to go back to the cruisers and have been happy since. No more leaky diapers."
0,"good price, bad quality I buy these diapers through subscribe and save, so they come out at reasonable price. BUT the quality is not good enough. My daughter is a pretty good pooper and these diapers spil all the time! I have to change her clothes or wash sheets and mattress cover every day! The money I save on diapers i spend on detergent, energy and water.Huggies are so much better!"
0,"AWFUL These have to be the worst diapers I have ever bought! Waste of money, useless at night, they leak and smell after being worn for just a short period of time. Seventh Generation are by far the best I've used and will continue to do so, don't know what I was thinking buy these"
0,"Zero Stars - These leak! These are terrible for night use. We used them at night for a week, and they leaked at least half of the nights. Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive are much better."
0,"Diapers arrived pre-used It seems virtually impossible to just contact Amazon and tell them there was a problem with my order without writing a review or packing up the diapers in the huge box, printing out a mailing label and returning them. The diapers I've been ordering monthly (Subscribe and Save) for a long time came and when I opened the plastic packing, they appeared to have been pre-wet. They had that crunchy, beady texture that diapers get when they are exposed to water. Of course, the whole reason I have them on order monthly is because I need them regularly and these came just in time-- I had run out of diapers. I have 3 kids, 3 and under and I can't easily get to the store to get more diapers so I had to use these gross diapers on my daughters AND now I have to return them to get a refund?? Something is broken with this system."
0,"Worst diapers EVER!!!!!!!! These diapers literally FALL APART at night. Even with my son who has a pretty servere case of urine reflux (not all his urine fliters out) and these diapers decingrate(sp) This morning I spend almost 30 minutes trying to clean off the little gel balls of the diaper material off my son and changing table!! So if you have a baby that can sleep through the night and you don't want to spend 30 minutes at the changing station, spend a couple extra dollars and buy the pampers extra protection, or HUGGIES!!!"
0,Please be carefull when subscribing amazon account I am a amazon customer since Aug2010 but i never had this kind of experience that my account is charged several times in a month and same product is dumped into my home.When check with the customer care they are saying i might hit the button several times so my subscription duplicated and hence i am receiving the same product multiple time.I don't know how it is possible.Finally i am able to cancel my account.So be care full when you are subscribing and check you account(credit/debit) attached to the subscription frequently.
0,"So frustrated using Baby Bry!!! Now it is 6:00 am, Saturday. I'm so mad and just find this page to write this review. Yesterday was the second day we use Pamper Baby Dry and we yielded 4 dirty clothes and 2 dirty sheets in last 24 hours. Baby Dry leak terribly!!! It is soooo frustrated to change sheet and cloth at 5am in the weekend.Our baby is 15 days old and 9 and a half pounds today. Never got any problems using other NB or Size1 diapers.I bought a large pack of Baby Dry (252 counts, size 1). There are still about 240 left. For the last ~10 pieces Baby Dry we used, Half of them leaked. Need to figure out of a way to get rid of them."

0,pampers baby dry It gets soggy in no time and leaks out big time . The product has lost its quality .I will never buy it again .
0,"Long time user with new problem I have been using Baby Drys (via Amazon Mom) on my now 11 mo old for several months with no problems. There has been either an unannounced product change or a problem with this batch of diapers, as my child developed a severe diaper rash. The doctor confirmed it was a contact rash and the only recent change is this new box of diapers. Unfortunately, we'll be switching brands for at least the time being.Despite this problem, Amazon's customer service was great and promptly issued a refund for this product. I was pleased with the service."
0,Baby DRY? I am very unhappy with these diapers. I usually purchase Pampers Cruisers but this was such a good deal and being named BABY DRY! They leak everynight!!
0,I loved the price The price was great for my twin grandsons. After a month both babies developed a severe rash from the baby dry diapers. Other Mom's have said the same thing. Now they have switched to Huggies.
0,"leaked! These pampers leaked, one out of five times.Makes changing them much harder.I do not recomend this product to anyone."
0,"Don't buy this it should be called 2 hours dry not 12 This is the worst diaper I ever tried. I used the fisher price brand or luvs, I saw this on sale and was mislead by the 12 hour overnight protection advertisement which turns out to be more like2 hours. Maybe that was a typo LOL. Seriously this is not worth a dime and don't waste your money you will be wiping poop and peep of the floor in no time. They are no match for my 20 months old daughter"
0,Not a good product Pampers changed their diapers and added a new material (or substance) that I can only guess is suppossed to absorb moisture. It is TERRIBLE!!! It has given my littlt guy the worst diaper rash. The first box of diapers I received was great. The fit was perfect and they were identical to the ones in the hospital. The next box was totally different with that new strip and they are just awful. Do not buy them unless they are without the strip (will be white in color and just have Sesame characters). The ones with the strip are blue with sesame characters.
0,"Every poo is a blow-out I began using these diapers for my newborn, but was sorely disappointed to find that the diaper offered little protection for anyone holding my baby when she had a poo. Perhaps she is oddly shaped causing the diaper to fit poorly; however, she seems perfectly normal to me, so I am guessing it is the fault of the diaper. Every poo was a blow-out!"
0,"Worst diapers- Ever. I ordered these before our son was born. At the time, I didn't know the difference between the swaddlers and the baby dry. Well, I learned the hard way as these leak like CRAZY. I cannot convey how truly awful these are. Please spare yourself the pain and don't get these diapers. Baby dry is awful."
0,"weird fit, majorly leaks overnight These diapers have a weird high-cut fit, and our 2 1/2 year old has peed through them ENORMOUSLY both of the first two nights he wore them. Wet down to his feet. They just don't seem to have enough absorbency for the job."
0,"Welts and red rashes I have been using these diapers for both of my girls for years. My last Subscribe and Save box landed on my doorstep last week and my 15 month old daughter has had welts and red hot rashes on her diaper area ever since. I hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else and that whatever has changed is fixed quickly. For now I will switch to Seventh Generation.Last week I received my box on my doorstep and due to the new frustration free packaging, couldn't open the box with my hands anymore due to all the tape on top of the box. This makes it a bit of a frustration, instead of less."
0,"CHEAP! DO NOT BUY!! I bought this product because it was less expensive than the Pampers Cruisers and I thought it might a comparable product. WRONG!! Simply picking up the product, you can tell it isn't made as well and has a more plastic feel to it. I only gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it a ""0"". By the next day, my son had a diaper rash like none I have ever seen. My husband and I have practically had to hog-tie him to put ointment on his bottom or even bathe him. He even cried when he was sitting. We switched back to Cruisers and he is healing, thankfully, but still has marks two weeks later. We will NEVER buy this product again. Do not walk, RUN from this product."
0,Wet every morning We used Pampers swadlers and loved them. When we switched to size 4 we decided on Pampers Baby Dry. What a mistake! Every morning we woke up to our son completely wet. These diapers do not hold enough water!
0,"Feels like duct tape The baby dry diapers are terrible! I'm so glad I didn't buy them. I received them as a shower gift. They have a plastic duct tape feel to the top portion and they left my son's skin very moist. He literally had urine sitting on his skin when I opened his diaper. NOT my idea of a good diaper. I stick to Pampers Swaddlers or Pampers Cruisers, depending on which size you are using."
0,These are the worst diapers ever!!!! I bought these diapers not realizing that they were the baby dry. I usually use the swaddlers and I love them. So when I noticed these ones were different I thought it would be okay. No way!!! I used about 5 diapers and my 2 month old son blew out of every single one...keep in mind we have never had any blow outs before. So I definately would never recommend these diapers to anyone. Now I am stuck with 270 diapers I will never use...ugh
0,Pampers leak I don't often write reviews but I feel I need to. I have twin girls and have found that everytime I use Pampers they leak. The sizing is correct based on the label but they do not absorb enough through the night. I have had to change sheets many times. I do not find this happens with other diapers and Pampers are expensive.
0,Lack of quality and capacity The quality of these diapers just doesn't compare to Huggies. They don't hold up overnight for my 18 month old. I'm just sorry I bought 192 of these diapers!
0,"Not a good diaper for us Decided to try these as a cheaper alternative to Earths Best diapers. Since I read they don't have Drymax, I thought it would be okay to use. Within the first day of use, my child started getting a reddish rash. It went away as soon as we stopped using these. My feeling is that it is due to the blue colored absorbent material and/or the scent. I did not realize the diapers had a scent, since I was used to the EB diapers."
0,Do not buy this!!! We bought this baby dry I think this is great mistake done by me. Its getting wet so soon. Before we were using cruisers but we thought why don't we try this once. Never ever buy this pampers baby dry.
0,"WORST Diapers I have ever used!!! Do not waste your money They leak, they do NOT hold my daughter over through the night, they do not hold in the poop, they are thin and useless, and are loose around the leg after only an hour of wear. I opted for these instead of Huggies because I got a great deal on them... I'll never make that mistake again!"
0,"Love Pampers hate these diapers I love Pampers products and bought these with complete confidience but I was extremely disappointed.These diapers are awful, they do not hold anything and they caused my daughter to have a rash. I only wish I had bought Cruisers."
0,"Very disappointed My kids both wore Pampers. The last few times I've bought Pampers for my youngest they fall apart so easily. He doesn't even wear them that long before he has stringy diaper hanging off. I tried to chalk the first box off as maybe its a defective box or that he is so active. But after 3 boxes I know longer believe it. It doesn't leak, but just seems to fall apart (hard to describe) no matter if he's worn them for 5 min or longer. I can't wait until he is fully potty trained so he won't need them anymore. I am very disappointed"
0,"Buy Swaddlers or Cruisers Instead I tried these diapers b/c my daughter's diaper was leaking at night, and these were the worst of all of the diapers I tried. They even leaked during the day.If you have nighttime diaper leaks, try going up a size and buying Pampers Swaddlers or Cruisers instead!Pampers Swaddlers, Size 2-3 (14-22 Lbs), Economy Plus Pack, 152 SwaddlersPampers Cruisers, Size 4 (22-37 Lbs), Economy Plus Pack, 140 Cruisers"
0,"Awful... We tried a bunch of different diapers for our 2 month old. Huggies Natural, Pampers Swaddlers and Baby Dry, other Huggies and by far the most leaky diapers were Baby Dry. #1 and #2 never stayed in the diaper! Right out the sides and back and all over me...almost every time. Also, the absorbent core stuff would come out and stick to our baby's skin. Swaddlers are absolutely fabulous and we'll stick with those."
0,"These leak bad!! I have been loyal to Pampers diapers since my 13 month old was in Newborn Swaddlers. I tried these diapers because of the positive ratings and I am VERY disappointed. The diapers are rectangular and not good for a cruising baby. The front of the tabs turn under so they sometimes leak out the side. Also, they say they are suppose to last 12 hours. My daughter usually sleeps 10 hours straight at night and by morning the diaper has ""sweated"" pee through the diaper and through her pajamas and I've even had to change her sheets. I go through a lot more diapers with these because i have to change her very frequently. For some reason the Pampers Cruisers with dry max gave my daughter diaper rash so I guess I'm buying Huggies next time."
0,Leak with breastfeed poop up the back! These diapers leek up the back when my baby poops! Then got to waste time and change her shirt with poop and whatever else the poop got on! Annoying!!
0,"Terrible rash! Going back to Hughies We switch to pampers for the savings but my son developed a terrible rash. After a week (treating him in the meantime with lotions, skin barriers and other topical creams), we got back to Hughies and his rask got clearly better in a couple of days. We used pampers swadllers before wihtout any problems. I found in the internet other people with similar issues:[...]If your kid has allergies or delicate skin, I will say to do not use this diapers."
0,Terrible diapers! I will never buy again I purchased these diapers thinking that Pampers is a good brand. These were terrible! A tiny amount of pee would fill these and make them very tight. I will never buy again!
0,"Horrible - how does anyone use these??? I assumed since these are a well-known brand, that they would work well. They are the worst diapers I have ever used - pee leaks stright through them, ie if you don't change the baby pretty often, their clothes will be soaked more than once a day. How am I going to use up these 200+ diapers? Ugh."
0,"Used to be our favorite until recently when the quality dropped. We had been using Pampers Baby Dry for our daughter right after she outgrew newborn size of Pampers Swaddlers. Now my daughter is almost 20 months old at size 4. We couldn't be happier with Pamper Baby Dry until the last shipment we received from Amazon. The diapers are thinner than before and leak frequently. I thought it may be a bad batch and bought a smaller size of the same product from a department store. They were exactly the same and also caused leaks. The leaks happen both at morning and night times. I'm too disappointed in the product to give it a 3rd try. We are switching to Huggies Snug & Dry. Hopefully, they will work better."
0,"Worst diaper we ever tried This is the worst diaper we ever tried. After my 20 months old daughter go to bad (changing diaper at 9pm) we have to change it at around 4am, otherwise she (her outfit, bad and comforter) will be totally wet by the morning. We had no other diaper with such an experience. During daytime it is even worse, sometimes it start letting thru everything after few hours. We use 5-7 diapers a day whereas we needed only 3-4 from cruisers. This simply have not enough absorbent to stay dry for 12 hours (as advertised)"
0,AWFUL!!! THESE DIAPERS ARE HORRIBLE. I ALWAYS BUY THE PAMPERS CRUISERS BUT SINCE THE STORE WAS OUT OF STOCK I THOUGHT PAMPERS MAKES THESE AS WELL SO THEY MUST BE GOOD AS WELL. WELL I WAS WRONG MY DAUGHTER WEARS THEM FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HER PEE PASSES THROUGH THE DIAPER. THEY SHOULD MAKE IT TO AN HOUR AT LEAST. ONE PEE AND I HAVE TO CHANGE HER DIAPER. HORRIBLE I CAN'T BELIEVE PAMPERS MAKES THESE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE DIAPERS!!!
0,"My husband even complains about these!! These diapers are junk! I recently tried some Pampers again and they were terrible! The tabs would rip off half the time and this would really make my husband disgruntled! I told him Pampers are supposed to be the ""best"" in the diaper area! He told me to stick with the Huggies! Boys and girls, quality, price, Huggies are the way to go in our household! I would not recommend these diapers for anyone, unless you like throwing unused daipers into the garbage can!"
0,"HATED these pampers! Don't buy I purchased these Pampers from Amazon for my 7 month old. These pampers have the ability to burst open in the night while your baby is sleeping. When my daughter woke up the next morning, the pamper burst open on her belly. The padding inside the pamper was released on her belly on several other occasions. I didn't have this problem with Huggies. I will NOT purchase Pampers ever again. This is a hazard and they should be recalled."
0,"I don't do novels and this is why. . . This author knew very little about ancient Egypt, it's people and it's history - and didn't bother to learn.A wast of time."
0,A looser I bought this and returned it. There must be someone out there with the right voice and reading skills to bring us Whitman's words and rhythms. Ms. Gibson's soprano sing-song doesn't make it.
0,"Whitman Glorified? Whitman Glorified?Whitman's descriptions of nature are inspired and his style exudes with the same passion as his subject. Yet, his self-absorption overshadows his talent. Whitman's poem, ""Song of Myself"" takes up a significant portion of the book, Leaves of Grass. Here, Whitman keeps no points in reserve, but spends 52 sections ""celebrating"" himself. He feels he, as man, is the great panacea. He suckles at its mercy until it fills not only his subject matter, but influences his technique and his structure as well. His intriguing mind leads the reader along, until disappointment is found in another laborious passage expounding god status and the call to ascend to his level of distorted thinking. Whitman's momentary descriptive nuggets are lost in a sea of narcissism."
0,"Do not buy this edition I compared this to many other editions and this edition is completely wrong, the structure of the poems is all messed up.It's such a pity considering Whitman's poetry that the people of Simon and Brown were not even able to print an edition that manages to respect something as simple as the spacing and lines of the poems.Here is an example of the Simon and Brown edition, exactly as it was printed by them:As I ponder'd in silence, Returning upon my poems, considering,lingering long, A Phantom arouse before me with distrustful aspect,Terrible in beauty, age, and powerIt is painfully obvious that it should be, as I have seen in all other editions I consulted:As I ponder'd in silence,Returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,Terrible in beauty, age, and power,The whole book was edited in this way, which makes it unreadable"
0,"The uninitiated... I wasn't exposed to Whitman in my education so I gave this try. I ploddingly and tediously read the introduction and the first 40 pages of this book before I threw it down.I failed and I am sorry. Certainly I am a philistine who deserves to be excoriated by the community who loves his work. Here's my attempt to make peace:If you're wondering if Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"" is a good place to start your enjoyment of poetry, go ahead and give it a whirl! You can get it used for a penny."
0,"Rip Off This edition DOES NOT contain a table of contents, which makes it impossible to navigate and totally useless overall.Save your dollar and look elsewhere."
0,"A Mistake A co-worker gave this book to me. He was more of a fan than I, but Whitman grew on me, and over the next several months, I learned to appreciate his work.However, I left this book above my toilet and was disturbed that a relative of mine snooped through it while taking a dump, discovering secrets that this co-worker and I had together. I now regret ever having read this silly book and am planning on burning it."
0,Line break hell It is frustrating that the Kindle cannot accommodate this. It was not fun to read with awkward line breaks.
0,"This book does not contain the 1855 edition! While I adore the first edition of Leaves of Grass, this book is not as advertised. I definitely encourage you to buy it in another edition. I returned mine with a note, so hopefully Amazon will change the description soon."
1,"Inspiring I hope a lot of people hear this cd. We need more strong and positive vibes like this. Great vocals, fresh tunes, cross-cultural happiness. Her blues is from the gut. The pop sounds are catchy and mature."
1,"The best soundtrack ever to anything. I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny."
1,Too good to be true Probably the greatest soundtrack in history! Usually it's better to have played the game first but this is so enjoyable anyway! I worked so hard getting this soundtrack and after spending [money] to get it it was really worth every penny!! Get this OST! it's amazing! The first few tracks will have you dancing around with delight (especially Scars Left by Time)!! BUY IT NOW!!
1,"There's a reason for the price There's a reason this CD is so expensive, even the version that's not an import.Some of the best music ever. I could listen to every track every minute of every day. That's about all i can say."
1,"Lower leg comfort for 12 hours + Excellent stockings for long shifts on your feet - not too tight, not too loose...garment integrity is longer than package states (with proper care)."
1,CHECK OUT THE K6000 CHARGER! Greetings. Kodak also has a K6000 charger which comes with 4 NiMH 2100 mAh batteries. Two batteries charge is 64 minutes and 4 batteries charge in 140 minutes. The problem is that Amazon doesn't carry them YET. Good bye.
1,"ahhh These will more than pay for themselves, they are perfect for my GPS which will drain a cheap battery in less than an hour.btw the charger did come with 1850 batteries."
1,Excellent Product This is an excellent product. I bought this for my digital camera. It has a great battery life per charge. Charger is handy to carry.
1,"To ""Disappointed"" in Miami You said ""...but the charge only lasts a very short time.""Did you know that new Ni-MH batteries must be cycled 3 to 5 times before they hold a full charge? This does not mean that they should be charged 3 to 5 times in a row but rather that for the first 3 to 5 charge/discharge cycles, the batteries reach a higher charge level each time until they are recharged until they finally reach their rated capacity. This may be your problem. Try doing this and you might be pleasantly surprised."
1,"Awesome - wanna use dramatica? You definitely need this book It's just awesome, even better than what you can read online about using dramatica of Armando. If you want to use Dramatica - and don't want to get lost eventually - you really, really, really need this guide to get to some point you can call your plot really a plot. This book just makes you very, very happy. For it will boost your efforts to really WORK with dramatica. I only wish we had had that book ten years before. So I do highly recommend it. Even if you aren't a native speaker like me, having german as my mother tongue. I would never have made it with the DRAMATICA SOFTWARE if I haven't had this book. Believe me. It's worth every Cent (I payed in Euro). Though I tried very hard for roundabout 2 years I was coming to fail with Dramatica 4.0. This book saved my ass. Let it save yours too. It's making me happy. Thank you so much, Armando. Greetings from Germany, Cologne"
1,"Very Happy - Has ""Random"" capability for MP3s I got this machine primarily for the DVD with MP3 playback. It turns out, that most DVD players with MP3 capability don't allow you to select ""random"" playing of the tracks!??? I replaced my 12 year-old CD player and my sub-par VCR with this one machine. I'm very happy with it so far, although I wish it had another component input in the back. The DVD playback is awesome. The VCR playback seems fine as well, although since getting TiVo, I don't really use it that much. I recommend this to anyone who wants a versatile player of good quality."
1,"This is a very good book for students and engineers. Many useful concepts of digital compression can be found in this book. It is easy to read and understand, especially for students and engineers in EE."
1,"Great reference book for its topic It seems somebody was complaining for the printing quality. This is not a calculus book. If you take most theoretical books, and certainly most Springer's book, they don't have nice full color Barney images. This is technical (mostly theoretical) stuff. There is, in my opinion, no problem with the printing at all, clear, quality monochromatic printing.With respect to the contents of the book, it has almost everything you may want to know about Vector (and even Scalar) quantization and Signal compression. It was a great help while I was writing my doctoral thesis. Gray is probably one of the most respected authorities in the field."
1,"Here is a little secret. After you watch a few episodes, it will be fairly clear to you who the two central characters are. If you enjoy a fitting but bleak ending, stop at Season 3, Episode 5. But if you prefer romantic comedies, view through 3/5 then skip to Season 4, Episode 3, as the final act."
1,"Rochelle explains It All for You Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. A great book"
1,"Spreading a Passion for God Piper has a passion for the glory of Christ that is contagious. I've watched these videos multiple times and glean something from it every time. Amazing that he presents this MEATY material to a youth group and they are transfixed the entire time.I don't really care for the youth interviews, but I understand given the format of the original presentation. I've used this in a men's group and all enjoyed the material and we had some great discussions.I'd recommend to anybody. The humility and genuine concern of Piper toward his audience is refreshing against some of the other more famous ""christian leaders"" today."

1,"Dk Travel guides The Dk Travel guides are the best travel guides produced, each one a high quality illustrated encyclopedia on the country or city it represents. They are invaluable guides. The only disadvantage is that they are a bit on the heavy side, but the quality of printing and extensive range of color photos offsets that."

1,"Wonderful Game Got the game for my daughter when she was four and she LOVES it. She finished it rather quickly and the games are not particularly difficult or educational, but she still occasionally likes to play it. It's a beautiful game. I wrote this review because the game froze on us as well. I had to update our video card driver and it has worked perfectly since. Hope this helps."
1,"NYTimes Likes IT BARBIE AS RAPUNZEL: A CREATIVE ADVENTURE. I don't like Barbie, yet even with my negative attitude I appreciated the Barbie as Rapunzel adventure. This is a creative game in which the player must help Barbie free Prince Stefan from an evil spell by restoring a cursed and very run-down castle. The player takes Barbie around the castle and selects colors and patterns to decorate with magic paintbrushes and wands. Once each room is redecorated, Barbie retrieves a gem that will eventually be placed in the prince's crown to break the spell on him. The Barbie and Prince get to live in their renovated home - happily ever after, of course."
1,"Hamelin does it again I confess to being a Hamelin fanatic! To me, Marc-Andre Hamelin is the best pianist performing today and I anxiously await new recordings by him. The Brahms is one of the greatest concertos ever written and it's one of my favorites. Hamelin plays it supperbly and the orchestra, under Litton's leadership, provides exceptional support. This is a ""must have"" CD for anyone who loves great piano playing. The Hyperion sound is fabulous, as usual too."
1,super I just love this album. Soulwax is great but this house/rave mix is even better. Can't stop moving while you listen to it.
1,"A Beautiful Map This map is clear and informative, but more than that, it is beautiful to look at.Ordering it from the UK, I would have liked a quicker delivery option. But it arrived more or less when they promised -- if anything, a week sooner than I expected.Thoroughly satisfied with this purchase."
1,"Karen Cummings, comes through. Wonderful! Karen Cummings writes a book that tells you all thebasics of cat care and tailors it to the Birman breed. The excellentphotographs enable the reader to see what a Birman really looks like. The history of the Birman, (Sacred cat of Burma), it's mythic legend is beautifully illustrated in the artworks that appear on page three and seven; ""Mandela Cat"" and ""Temple of the Sacred Cat"". I am the artist of these artworks and I am very impressed with the excellent reproductions produced by the publisher. In addition, as a Birman breeder for over 15 years I can and do highly recommend this book."
1,"Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too."
1,"We Love This Game! I bought this game to bring down to my vacation home, a new game that the kids do not have at home. Every time we go to the house, the kids want to play Gobblet first! It is just like tic-tac-toe, but you can eat up your opponent's pieces with your own larger pieces. It is a game of strategy. My 7 year old enjoys beating her 17 year old cousins in this game, before they figure out how to do it. My 5 year old can beat his cousins as well. I would recommend it."
1,"Fabulous!!! After doing alot of researching and reading reviews I purchased Kelly's Pet Parade and it is fabulous.My four year old daughter has has no problems playing it without any supervision. Ability to use the mouse is important.She can keep the different activities as simple or as elaborate as she wants to.When you want to do a new parade you have to use a different name (susie2 etc.) or erase the saved parade.The whole thing is just darling and fun to play. My daughter has to do 30 minutes of a math or alphabet game before she can play Kelly's Pet Parade. So, she likes it so much that using it as a reward has worked."
1,"Cool Music This cd is soooo cool. Especially the non-stop megamix the transitions are perfect, but you could be annoyed by the constant voice of the announcer. Some of what he says is very corny but you should be able to live with it (Especially when you're playing the actual game). All in all it's a great CD and a great buy."

1,Fabulous! This book has been completely instrumental in guiding my husband in his timberframing pursuits. He has read it so much the cover and binding have fallen off and broken! But he holds on to it because it's the BEST reference for a DIYer to look to when starting your structure.
1,"Great Classic Sega Arcade Racing Action! If you've played this game in the arcade and liked it, then you'll definitely like this version to play at home whenever you like. You don't need a supercomputer to run it and the graphics and controls are amazing and faithful to the incredibly fun and fast arcade experience. This version also has plenty of unlockables, which you get by playing and earning miles, as well as mini-games that are a fun diversion from the classic arcade game. It has the European-themed levels of Outrun2 and the America-themed levels of Outrun2 SP, for a total of 30 stages to race through in the classic Outrun-branching style, or sequentially, or with challenges such as beating rival racers. This game is affordable, fun, and has plenty of replay value. You may not want to play it for hours and hours, but you'll keep coming back to it if you like to get a speedy arcade fix every now and then."
1,Pyrography Desings Love this book. Lots of patterns and instructions. Can't wait to start woodburning projects. Borders and patterns are just lovely!!!
1,"Excellent - as good as it gets! Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about!"
1,"Picture Quality Still Holds Up I bought this Handycam 10 years ago. I stopped using it for whatever reason. But I recently set out to convert the video I had taken with this to digital. Not only was it easy, but the quality of the picture was amazing...even playing it on my 40 inch screen. The image is so much better than my phone new camcorder."
1,"Fun selection of blocks! Great alternative to the traditional alphabet blocks I love the Peek-a-blocks sets that are out there and I was excited to see the alphabet set available. Every child should have a set of alphabet blocks and these are so much more fun than the basic wood ones. A few people have said that the letter obstructs what is inside, but I don't really agree. While they do have the letter on the one side, you get three other sides to view the inside object just fine. And isn't the point of the alphabet block the letter anyway? It is nice that it comes in a reusable case with a handle too. Just make sure and do your research before you bought. I did some digging around online and got this set for only $25!"
1,"These are great! Love These! However, do not buy these with the big block activity center, they don't work! A bit dissapointing. But the blocks are really cute and I do like them a lot!"
1,Telling it like it is! The book came within 5 days Yeah!!! It was in perfect condition. This is a great read!
1,"Pretty Nifty! I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!"
1,"Toned If you do this video regularly, you will see results. I've used it before on weight-loss plans and I have always been able to see my body change. Because of the warm up and cool down, I never got sore. And even when I was 150 pounds overweight, I could still do the video. It's my all time favorite."
1,"This must be a must-read I surft on this book out of mild curiosity. But reviews like the three posted here convince me that the book must be well worth reading. So I'm buying it. Thanks, team! (I apologize for the 5 stars, since I haven't read it yet. But the program wouldn't let me post this comment without a rating. I'll get back to y'all when I'm finisht reading the book.)"
1,"The greenest grass imaginable I bought this book for my husband. He follows it faithfully, and you can see the results in our yard. We have the most beautiful, lush grass in the neighborhood - which seems to be a miracle, since our yard was an overgrown field just two years ago. Jerry Baker provides simple ways to establish and maintain your lawn. I also appreciate the fact that we do not have to go to a gardening store to find the items recommended in his book."
1,"Best game ever This games makes even amazing games like starcraft and warcraft redundant. Warhammer has it all and does it better than anyone else. Truly great game, total fun, great combat, graphics, races, units, a pleasure to play."
1,barbie games havnt been better!!!! this is a rockin game its fun and you can even skate in the sky. i love choosing from like 30 outfits. i ordered from online(well my mom did it for me)and it took 3 weeks to get here and when it came i was sad because people said its a bad game but it wsant dont listen t anyone its soooooooo much fun!!!!!
1,"Great gadget I bought a couple of the singles and one of the triples and they all work perfectly. I'm disappointed the triple is not available and may not be. Use them in my office where the triple handles the three lamps, and in the house where three singles are with three different lamps in the bedroom, home office and basement. Makes it nice to turn all the lights on from one place (my desk in the office) or from the door so you don't have to walk into a dark room and grope for the lamp switch. Used daily for about 6 weeks and going strong. I've had others in the past and they have lasted years and years. These are nicely made and seem durable. Mounting is a good idea so you don't end up groping for the remote in the dark!"
1,"BEST BOOK EVER!! This is 1 of da bst books dat i have EVER read! @ my school, we are doing a play on this & im playin Mary-Lynette. i cant wait 2 get to the last chapters when they finally give in 2 each other! Gr8 books!"
1,THE BEST OF THE BEST BOOKS Hey every one how did you like this book. It was the best book I have ever read of the L.J Smith.
1,"The best of the ""Night World"" series I loved this book very much!It was excellent.I absoloutly fell in love with Jeremy.He was such a sweet,nice guy.I thought it was unfair that he died.The last few times I read this book I had tears streaming down my face.I really don't think he was crazy just misunderstood.This is a must read book. Once you pick it up you can't put it down."
1,The BEST book of the Night World series!!!!! This book was great and I just loved Ash. It should have 5 stars from everyone. And you have to read it. It was great. I did not like what happened to Jeremy but it was still the best book in the Night World series! It keeps you reading to the end. You will not put it down. I hope you read it for your sake. So read it!!
1,"Daughters of Darkness-THE BEST I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK"
1,"The best book in the ""Night World"" Series Daughters of Darkness is quite possibly the best book in the new NIGHT WORLD series by L. J. Smith. It does not just revolve around one supernatural being or one singular person, it has interesting information on the werewolves of the NIGHT WORLD and the plot line is out of sight. I own all of the books in the series (Up untill Soulmate that is) and so far Daughters of Darkness is the best one. I only hope the following books in this wonderful series are as great as this one!!"
1,"It is the best book in the series. This book was the best out of the whole series. The book was pretty much about Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel, three girl vampires that just had enough of the Night World. Mary-Lynnette is a small town girl who loves to look at the stars, but has nobody to look at the stars with her. Ash is a tall, lanky, and elegant vampire that has to find his sisters and bing them back home. But of course his sisters had told Mary-Lynnette and her brother, Mark, bout the Night World. Another twist in the story is that Ash and Mary-Lynnette are soulmates. If this story couldn't get anymore exciting there is a vampire killer running around town. All six of them has to figure out who this vampire killer is and stop him. Meanwhile Ash and Mary-Lynnette has to figure out what to do about each other. If you like or are obsess with vampires (Like me!)you should read this book."
1,"If you're into vampire and romance you should read this book You might have read a lot of vampire-romance novels but this one certainly rates a 10. The story itself has a good plot and amazing characters to suit their purposes. The three sisters, Rowan, Kestrel and Jade, uncannily beatiful, are actually fugitives from Night World and their brother Ash is sent to take them home. Both male and female lead role are superb. Their roles fit them perfectly. Ash, a vampire whose whole life changed after finding his soulmate is a human and Mary-Lynette a girl with a strong character who wasn't really willing to accept the fact that Ash is her soulmate. And of course...the way the authour tells her story and the words she uses..it's absolutely incredible."
1,"READ IT READ IT READ IT! This book is incredible. It had me hooked from the very beginning. Why does everyone always say that they're in love with Ash? He's a great character, but not perfect in any way. Okay, ehough chit-chat. Read this book, I am serious. Rowan (my favorite!), Kestral, Jade, and Mary-Lynnette are just about the strongest female characters I have read in some time. I can find no flaw in any part of this book, and if you haven't already, READ IT!"
1,"the best! This book is my favorite one. I've read it eight times. All of L.J. Smith's books are fantastic; she's my absolute favorite writer. Her writing style is very natural and realistic and her characters are so real, you start looking for them in real life. I fell in love with Ash, especially in how, even though he's a fierce vampire, he's completely helpless when it comes to Mary Lynette. Smith writes the most wonderful characters. I never liked fantasy or romance novels, but her books are a notable exception. My friends think I'm crazy because I'm in college and I'm still reading YA books, but, I'm telling you, her books are ageless!!! If you haven't read this, you're definitely missing out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Vampires and Witches, oh yes! I have been a fan of L.J. Smith ever since book one of _The Vampire Diaries_. With each of her books you can honestly BELIEVE that what she is writing about is the truth, even if the characters are ficticious. Dughters of Darkness (as well as any Night World book or the Vampire Diaries trilogy) should be required reading for anyone who believes in Vampires (or thinks they are one *grin*). Happy reading"
1,great Bought it for my 2.5 year old niece and she loved it. Dinner got easier with this disc.I think it should work fine for just any kid that age.

1,Insurance policy! This protector is an excellent value. Rated very highly in consumer publications. Great price from Amazon. I bought this to protect my new 55 inch LG flat screen.
1,"Great Pants These are great pants. They are really comfortable and easy to care for. I'm saving money too because I don't have to take these to the dry cleaners. I love the ""Individual Fit"" waste band. Who wouldn't like pants that fit a larger waste size without making you admit the weight gain by buying the larger size."
1,"Satisfied Product arrive well ahead of schedule, met expectations, and price was better than local retail."
1,Favorite Characters and Lots of FUN This is a great leap pad book. My 4 yr old son loved it instantly. The familiar characters from the Bob the Builder show make this book lots more fun than the ones featuring the Frog. I especially liked the fact that this book helps to teach that teasing is not a nice thing to do. There are at least 2 games on every page and it has the music from the show also. It is definitely worth the price and I hope they make more Bob the Builder books for the Leap Pad.
1,"helpful for decision makers This is an extraordinary compilation of texts of environment and economics that constitutes a very helpful book to decision makers. I work for environment and always check this book to take the best decision, because its contents are wide enough for diferent topics of environmental problems."
1,Delicious! I loved this book! Dating a chef now who is as passionate about his food and life as Bruno makes this book a complete treat. I was hungry with every page. The descriptions of the food and emotions are insipring and delicious.So worth the read! Have to go eat now!
1,"Why arent there more like this one!!?? why dont more rappers do what cash money does? no matter whos album it is, they showcase the best mcs and production they can pull off. there is nothing wrong with other rappers but cash money does this well, while setting asside tracks for the individuals, the group is what really shines, without the bling bling. i promised myself to never to buy the bling bling bull, but after hearing this cd, i had to get it. especially songs like i need a hot girl, and we on fire. get this cd!!!"

1,"IT'S HOT LIKE DA HOT BOYZ. THIS ALBUM HAS SOME OF THE TIGHTEST TRACKS I'VE HEARD IN A MINUTE. MY FAVORITE SONG IS I NEED A HOT GIRL. SICK UNCLE IS A VERY FUNNY SKIT. THE HOT BOYZ ALBUM COMES IN WITH A BOMB INTRO AND GOES OUT WITH A BANGING TRACK. I LOVE DA HOT BOYZ, ESPECAILY LIL' WAYNE, AND THEIR NEW CD."
1,"Another Cash Money Classic This album is just more proof that Cash Money is one of the best record labels out there. It has the same kind of beats as the Juvenile and B.G. LP's. The Hot Boys combines those 2 artists with 2 newer talented artists, Lil Wayne and Turk. If Cash money keeps making albums like this, they will be as famous as No Limit, an 10 times better soon."
1,A Classic CD: A must get This a classic cd. The best cash money cd ever. Every song is off tha hook. Don't nobody want to see the HOT BOY$. All I have to say is can't wait till LET EM' BURN.
1,"GET THIS ALBUM!! The Hot Boys tore it up on this one. They had hot tracks wit b.g., juvenile, lil wayne and others from cash money. Cash Money is gonna take over the music business baby!!!!!!!!"
1,"It Works!! I have been struggling to have my children be more obedient and to stop arguing with and each other. They were unhappy, my husband was unhappy, and I was unhappy. This book gave us not only some general strategies but also some suggestions on what to say in various situations. We are making great progress and the children are using it at school. We are becoming a more happy family!!"
1,"Book review This is a book for all parents or parents to be, all people thinking of having children. Love and Logic is a program to help you be a more effect parent, raising responsible children. It can also be used on co workers and the rest."
1,"WeiB FOREVER! This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop, but at night they are the White Hunters (or Byce as in the anime) they are assasins that ""hunt the tomorrow"" of Bad guys, the bad guys the police cant get . Like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason... from a strange gas substance that w/ instant contact ingulfs any object... but i couldnt resist. Its also an emotional anime at times! I think this is a Cd and Anime any anime fan should see..."
1,"The Title Says it all I should just leave it at that, but I won't. When I got this book I was completly blind to the world of HTML, but now I have mastered it. This book starts off teaching the basics, like how to start your HTML document with the HEAD and BODY tags, and goes all the way into using HTML tables to design your website and using HTML forms. By the end of the book, I knew everything, and was able to move onto more advanced subjects such as PHP or CGI-scripting. This book is the perfect way to get started if you're interested in pursuing a career in web development or application programming. However, if you are not interested in learning HTML, this book is not for you. It is a complete reference and you need to read the entire book to take advantage of it. If you really want to learn HTML then buy this book, because it will be the first and the last you will ever need."
1,"Most complete book about HTML i've ever seen. This is just the best HTML book I've got my hands on. Just about everything about HTML techniques you could think about is covered in this book. StyleSheets, DHTML, forms, frames .. it's all covered. a MUST have for the HTML-creator The 99 edition is even better than the 98 edition, because the overviews are now sorted by browser, instead of alphabethically."
1,"Could Not Put the Book Down For such a fat book, I never dreamed I would read it from cover to cover. Everything you ever wanted to know about HTML is in this book. I am a beginner and this book has given me a great start."
1,"Simply awesome This book is just spectacular!I have been a web developer for several years now, and I have read many books about HTML and related subjects. This book covers it all. But not only does the author cover HTML extensively, but he also covers XML, XHTML, CSS (extensively), CSS2, JavaScript, CGI, SSI, ASP, Coldfusion, and fonts.Many examples are given in both code and URL, discussion, and the thoroughness of the author's coverage, makes this a first-rate book, in my opinion.Most remarkably, the author discusses this subject matter very simply and in a way that anyone can understand (probably). I've honestly never read a technical book as lucid as this one. I highly recommend it!If that was not enough, the book contains about 500 pages of appendices, covering extensively every topic related to web development that one might need. I'm not saying you won't need any other books to make fabulous web pages, but this book is amazingly comprehensive. The author's web site is nice too."
1,"A very useful tool Very good product. Got my as a gift a few years ago, and it works fine. While mine has mercury thermometers, it shouldn't make a difference from red spirit filled one. I keep it in the shop drawer, dig it out when I wonder abt the temp here in NW Fla, dampen the wick, give it a twirl for a couple of minutes, then read it. I spray a lot of lacquer, shellac, and varnish, and usually have to crank up the dehumidifier in the shop, especially in the summer months. All in all, Bacharach makes a very good and reliable tool."
1,"One of the best classical music CD I have the original soundtrack for FF6 But I still love this CD. Well, since it's not OST so don't expect to hear the original music you heard while playing game. All pieces are played by symphony orchestra and, as a classical music lover myself, I enjoy this CD as much as Vivaldi's Four Season!! Every song was well rearranged and perfectly presented in symphonic style...Warning!! if you're only gamers and don't think any classical music is worth listening, don't buy this CD.. But if you're classical music lovers as well, buy it..!! Whether or not you've ever played the game, the beauty of the music will make you not to regret every penny you spend..!!"
1,Perfect glider It was easy to put together and works nice. Love sitting in it with my grandson and enjoying our time.
1,"Even a Blonde...... Speaking as a blonde I can say that this is EASY to put together.Some of the very best instructions I have seen anywhere. Great Buy and a beautiful product. It holds up to 550 pounds, so it will even hold most Americans!"
1,"We love Mercer Mayer! My kids love the little critter books, and this is no exception. Great for my 3 year old, and even my 7 year old isnt bored too much by it. He enjoys reading it to his little brother at bedtime."
1,The Scarletti curse This is a one to keep. Wonderfull story and plot. Full of dialogue between main characters with a sizzling romance. The plot keeps you turning the pages wanting more. Once again an excellent author.
1,"the scarletti curse this book was great.Like all of christine feehan's books,it holds your interest at every turn until the bitter end. you did not know who the perpetrator was until the bitter end.it held you on the edge of your seat to see if nicoletta was going to be seriously hurt or killed as were the scarletti brides."
1,WOW! My favorite of all time....Giovanni intrigued me soo much...i felt his love for nicoletta soo much i envied her..well written. GOOD WORK CHRISTINE
1,Great Cam! I love it! it is a great quality camera and does alot of stuff. It even hooks up to my computer and lets me do alot of stuff. I can edit videos or copy them off and even stream video like a web cam its great! Works well with WinXP. I bought from Amazon and they got it to me quickly even with the super saver shipping and the lowest price I could find with a free bag who can ask for more!
1,"Great primer on Bar Coding This is a great book for anybody who wants to understand what bar codes are, how they work, how to prepare a cost/benefit analysis and how to implement bar codes. Even if it is called Using Bar Codes in Distribution, it is as relevant for other applications.There are a some redundancies in this book that would need to be fixed in a reeddition. Also it would be nice if a reedition was done since it dates from 2000 and technology has evolved so much. But still, even without these improvements it is a great book."
1,Cruel & Unusual Received the book promptly and in great condition. Thank you Amazon for the opportunity to buy used books.
1,"Cruel & Unusual, was fabulous! Cruel and Unusual was another wonderful story by Ms. Cornwell. It was graphic in its detail but I stayed rivited to the end. I read everything she writes. None of it is boring and her knowledge of investigative procedures adds to the thrills of her stories."
1,"LOVED IT!!! I love reading all of her books I have read a few in the past, now I am going back and starting from the beginning and reading in order."
1,"Ronnie Joe Waddell meets the electric chair ... or does he? If you enjoy medical thrillers, you will enjoy this book. It is evident that Cornwell does her research on her subject & you gain useful information as you read."
1,"Cruel and Unusual Cruel and UInusalPatricia is an excellent writter and I love her books, but she sometimes leaves you a bit flat at the ending of the book"
1,Very nice book I really liked this book. It is a page turner for sure. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point.I think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel.
1,"Apatow's Depth Triumphs I am a stand-up fanatic. I enjoy the alternative comedians and the culture that have been cultivating in NY and LA lately. I consume the content of stand-ups like C.K., Cross, Tompkins, Glass, Jeselnik, Ansari, Posehn, Miller, and Holmes-to name a few. If you lean that way in your comedy preferences then my review will likely be applicable to you.I love this movie. You must go into it not knowing what to expect i.e. don't assume you know the movie will have the same feeling as knocked up. The characters are hilarious in their struggles and their actors are superb. Great director, great cast, and a hell of an perspective on alternative comedy.Lastly, buy the collector's edition. The bonus features are endless! If the film brings you down and you consequently reflect negatively on yourself, worry not, the second disc will right you. Just read the disc content and you'll be sold. Enough said."
1,"Lovely! This is just a wonderful graphic novel with beautiful illustrations, an interesting story set in a different culture. I had not been a fan of graphic novels, but this was one of those that have convinced me that they can, like opera, enhance the experience by using a fusion of art forms. I highly recommend it."
1,"A Masterpiece! Meet the first reconstructionist cat and rabbi from Algeria Safr's beautifully illustrated tale of a traditional rabbi who loses his faith in the face of colonial assimilation and a secular cat who tells the tale is on the level of Will Eisner's Contract With God and Art Speigelman's Maus. American readers will certainly connect to the tale as an Algerian parallel to the intellectual journey of Mordecai Kaplan, the American Jewish thinker whose Judaism as a Civilization was penned at the same time of the setting of this fictional fable. Safr raises the ultimate post-Enlightenment question: What is the role of religion in the absence of a supernatual God who acts in history? He is the first writer, I believe, to have a street-smart house cat answer this question. Rabbi Daniel S. Brenner, Director, Center for Multifaith Education, Auburn Theological Seminary, NYC."
1,"Fascinating yet tragic This was such and interesting book to read. It's about the one person who was the closest witness to the assassination of President Kennedy and how she was persecuted and finally redeemed. Namely Jean Hill. Her story needed to be told. It can't be ignored. She was filmed for Oliver Stone's movie titled JFK. She was cut from the theater production, but it is in the director's cut, which is the one you should see. It chronicles what lengths people will go to silence a dissenting witness. If you have ever seen the Zapruder film of the assassination, then you have seen Jean Hill. She was the woman standing on the curb in a red dress at the ""moment""."

1,"Great book. Not as spell binding as others in this series but still very good. It took getting to the last couple of chapters to understand the title, but that was minor. I also found a alot of typos in this book. usually just minor ones but a name was completely wrong, but correct in the very next sentence. I had to stop for a second and think....who is that? ok...off to Amazon.com to find the next one."
1,scarpetta this book is amazing. it was an all around exciting book. scarpetta definetly meets my expectations. it was a roller coster of emotions. i couldnt put the book down. i will re-read this book numerous times.
1,One of the best mysteries I've read in a while It was magnificent. I picked it up at a Border's bookstore for 3 dollars just to see how it was. ever since I've read it I've been stuck on her books. It was great a little gory at parts but it had a wonderful storyline and plot. I would highly recommend this to anyone that loves mysteries.
1,"Scarpetta rocks! I love the Kay Scarpetta series, that's how I got hooked on the whole forensics stuff! Patricia Cornwell is an excellent author!"
1,Hoping for more! Adermatt grabbed my attention from the very beginning and kept it to the end. She tells an extremely poignant and relevant story such that I felt I was watching every minute of it in real life. I hope this is the beginning of a series!
1,"a brilliant, well-written economics primer Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the ""common good."" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand."
1,"Never more needed than today Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and ""higher education"" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here's a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute."
1,"Economics even you will Understand For all who avoided economics like the plague, this is the book for you.very informative, and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject... Check it out.. next time you argue economics with uncle Fred, you wont sound like such a dope"
1,"Our Senators and Reps should read and heed This is not a new book;perhaps that's why it is so useful.There is no gobblygook, no arcane economic theories with fancy lables.What there are in this book are many examples of - - if the government takes this action to make this or that happen, the unintended consequences have proven to be and will probably be again something quite different, and usually not positive.Sound experiential economics in my view, clearly written; and a tremendous help to understanding what will probably happen if the nation takes on more debt, subsidizes this or that interest, taxes one interest at the expense of another, etc.I liked it; I could read and understand it."
1,"A common sense approach to Economics Economics in One Lesson is essentially an introduction into the Austrian school of Economic thought. Hazlitt's now renowned treatise originally written in 1946 is lauded by Libertarian stalwarts Ron Paul, Peter Schiff and Lew Rockwell among others. While some of the examples provided in the text may be dated the book is as relevant today as it was when first written. Hazlitt, from a 1940's perspective, takes on many of today's most controversial issues such as government spending, taxes, minimum wage, balance of trade, unions and inflation. In an era of big government, many of Hazlitt's economic lessons come as a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend Economics in One Lesson for those interested in learning about the Austrian School of economics and basic free market priciples."
1,"Changed my life I know it sounds stupid. I know it sounds extreme. I know it sounds ridiculous.But this book REALLY DID change my life.I used to be a bleeding-heart liberal: ""the government has to do X, Y and Z"".This book showed me how wrong I was. How so VERY wrong I was.This book should be mandated reading in all schools."
1,"Criticizing what you don't understand I have to laugh at the negative reviews of this book. They are probably written by socialists who don't understand economics, otherwise they wouldn't be socialists. Hazlitt's arguments are based on (1) a real understanding of economics and (2) facts, including that socialism has been an abject failure where ever it has been tried. In contrast, the arguments of modern liberals are based on emotions and are devoid of facts and of thinking about the world as it is.I can tell you that this is one of the very best books that has ever been written on economics."
1,"Worth the brain power This may be the only hardcore economics book I've really ever read. I don't follow through on many books period, but I pushed on through this one. The effort was valuable and worth it. From what I understand, it's held as one of the classics and rightly so. Just take it in chunks as you have time, but do yourself a favor and glean some knowledge from this one."
1,"Lives up to the hype Amazingly prophetic book. Could have been written yesterday. So far, a very educational read. I can see why so many people are recommending this book."
1,"Understanding the philosophy of economics These concepts are important for everyone to familiarize themselves with. I teach economics and it has been incredibly helpful to use these illustrations with my students. Such simple and easy to read chapters. Read one a day and really think about each one. Before you know it the financial reports and the governments budgeting process will come clearly into view. You will begin thinking in the micro and the macro with ease. If it makes sense in your home, it will most likely make sense on the national level.I highly recommend this easy to read little book. Learn these concepts and see what new world will open up for you in so many areas."
1,"A very accessible mathematical classic An excellent and lucid exposition of what we really mean when we talk about 2 houses, or 1/2 an hour, or square root of 2 meters, or that the counting numbers are infinite. It does not require any prior mathematical knowledge beyond the basics, although it probably will be of interest only to those that care about math at its most abstract. It is fascinating to realize how much we take for granted when we do math and how much ingenuity it takes to pin down the concept of number. Highly recommended."
1,"A delicious presentation indeed, packed with history and appeal Chocolate makers and company evolution are the focus of a tasty selection of historical notes in Beth Kimmerle's Chocolate: The Sweet History - but the focus doesn't end with company profiles alone. Historical details trace chocolate's Aztec origins, cocoa plant myths and usage, timelines of chocolate trade development, and more, adding depth and insights which include notes on different varieties of chocolate. Add luscious historical photos and ads in full color and you have a delicious presentation indeed, packed with history and appeal."
1,Great Camera I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. Nice going Sony!
1,"Virtually perfect folding table I've received and tried these great tables. I'm sorry I only ordered four. Even though I'm small, I can manage these tables - all 4 by myself! They fit in the back of my SUV and in my camper. My bruiser children have already started using them as a jungle gym/stairmaster -- they are incredibly stable and sturdy. My only concern is the legs don't lock in the folded(collapsed) position. If you hold them vertical it's not a problem, but when rotated, one leg drops - I'm using a canopy bungee to secure the two legs together for transport.Lori"
1,"Super handy on trips we didn't even use the magnetic feature but glad it had that option. Compact, easy to take (about size of Ipad but thicker). Would recommend for the avid backgammon enthusiasts like us who cannot bear to go too long without playing!"
1,very good product good quailty i liked this product so much i am going to buy one for my mom and another one in black for me
1,"Shapewear This is very well made, it came on time and does exactly what it is made to do, I give it 5 stars."
1,"Read Look a couple inches over ur belly button. Do you have a 'slouch line'? If no, then this is for u. Nice expensive material feel. Does wat it was made to do. It just didn't work out for me cuz I slouch all the time and it hurts where my belly fat curls. It's for those straight sitting people"
1,"GREAT THERAPEUTICALLY AS WELL AS GREAT FOR FASHION!!! I had two reasons for the purchase of this product, one was for my spine difficulties thanks to a severe injury many years ago & the other was pure vanity! But it has surpassed my expectations for both reasons! It is ever so comfortable and makes me look great so I feel beautiful!!! I just cannot express in words how great this product is!!!"
1,Love it! Help with posture and gives a mommy tummy a nice squeeze. It feels great on my ribs and seems to be bringing them back to pre-baby size. I highly recommend this!
1,"Awesome! I wear this religiously! It's extremely comfortable, I even sleep it in. I wear it as often as I can - only taking it off when I need to. So far so good. The only problem was it smelled like rubber at first since it was so new. I washed it (HAND WASHED, never put things like these in the washing machine/dryer as the item can warp!) and the rubber smell went away. I've only been wearing this for about a week so when it's been a month or so I will post an update. I wear this in conjunction with dieting and light exercise. When I started all of this my waist was 28 1/2 inches. Now it's down to 26 1/2"". I just hope I can actually keep the inches off. My goal is 24"" but even that may be too much."
1,in love I absolutely love the squeem!!!! Although it does take a couple days to get use to it....... I wear it all day at work and I already see and feel a difference I absolutely live the squeem!!!!
1,Wow I ordered my Squeem and it came earlier than promised. Mine didn't fit but it was my error and not the company's. I filed for a return and the company replied promptly with instructions to send back and offered to send me a different size. The company is very polite and courteous. It's one of the better companies selling on Amazon. The product itself from what I was able to do with it was very sturdy. The hook and eye enclosures were easy to use and the Squeem molded to my body shape. It was ridged but had give to allow for movement. The outside that goes away from your body is rubber but what actually touches you is a cotton material. It does smell a little like rubber if you put your nose to it but it's not strong enough to smell if you're wearing it. I can't wait to get my new sized one and try it out.
1,"good postpartum compression bought this over the other post-baby belly wraps marketed to pregnant women...and glad i did. the belly wraps are stiff and very visible under clothing, where the squeem is a good ol girdle and forms the mid section into a pretty shape while holding in the jelly belly left over after delivery. you have to wear the waist cincher for 40days/40nights for it to work on getting the belly to shrink; i'm on 2.5 weeks and have already gone from looking 6m prego to less than 3m prego when not wearing it. it also helps with initiating a healthy diet and losing weight b/c it makes you want to look better. but it is not comfortable to wear to sleep; makes me really hot. i have a cheaper wrap from babies r us that is more forgiving, but keeps up with the belly compression."
1,squeem is awesome!!! I love my squeem! A little tight at first but I got used to it. I lost 2 inches off my waist in 3 weeks. I love my squeem!!
1,"Love, love, love this product! I bought this with the hope I would look slimmer. It did that, and more! I bought a large, and after a week of wear, I am purchasing a medium. I have gotten complements on how much weight I have lost, and I have actually lost weight too. It gives me a shapely figure. I could not be more pleased."
1,"BEST waist cincher I'm extremely impressed with this waist cincher. I had a bridesmaid dress that I had to fit into that was about 2.5 inches too small...I was just about ready to pay over $50 for alterations which would have made the dress different than the other bridesmaids....and then this came in the mail! What a lifesaver! I contacted the tailor quickly and tried on the dress again using the squeem and it fit perfectly. I probably won't use this long term, and I can't imagine using it over diet and exercise for weight loss, but in a pinch, it works great."
1,Awesome! This CD is amazing. I am very sad that 107.7 The X in Birmingham is no longer. They made a great CD to benefit a great cause.
1,"Clever design Marie Antoinette is my daughter's favorite female historical figure. She was very smart, but not when it came to spending. She was a child bride from Austria who, as custom dictated, had to leave all her possessions at the border- including her beloved little doggie."
1,Wonderful! This book was just what I was looking for! HIGHLY informative information on each herb along with lore and magickal uses. It also explains deity correspondences and points out what sabbat you might use each herb for. I recommend this to anyone interested in magickal or medicinal uses of herbs.The product came early and the book was in excellent condition!
1,"A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe A refreshing, sunwarmed, beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of Ice Age Europe. A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. The plot line moves in different ways from other ""Woman against the odds"" novels so it is a fresh and not predictable. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel's ""Shelters of Stone""."
1,"Great Transaction! I placed an order for a book, the seller accepted payment quickly, the item shipped very fast, in fact I had item in hand in less than a week and it was exactly as described. Thank you for a pleasant transaction."
1,"An American Classic I first read The Scarlet Letter (TSL) back in high school. I thoroughly enjoyed the book then. Going back and rereading a second time still brought back the awe associated with the imagery painted by Hawthrowne. Perhaps the most striking image is that in the beginning, where Hester Prynne is about to come out of her jail cell and a single rose blossoming amidst the bleakness of her prison is used as a metaphor. Hawthrowne does a superb job describing the details and ways of life. I believe he captures 17th century Bostonian life accurately. In a way this book is a history book. I do admit that the plot is slow at times, but the book does appear to move much more quickly if you try to admire Hawthrownes writing style and descriptive language. Overall, I would say this book impressed me as much as War and Peace and some of Dickens' novels did."
1,i love books The description was exactly as written. Fast shipping and great costumer service. I would recommend the product and the seller.
1,Sad Story I love it but it saddened me. . . I will read it again . . . but will wait a while. Life can appear to be unfair sometimes. . .
1,"Excellent It is Hawthorne, of course it is excellent. Well written and worth a slow, methodical approach. Definitely a literary classic."
1,"Classic Book that I can read on my iPad Great book and it is nice to be able to read it on my iPad. Also, loved the price (FREE!) :)"
1,"The Best Of Puritans This is a very interesting book. I started reading it in my 4th period English class. I think it is a good book because somehow it relates to what people do, when they feel superior to other people. I think you should read this book, because it is very interesting. Plus, it was written by the great Nathaniel Hawhthorne!"
1,"I don't remember buying this. I did read the book in hs, so maybe that is when I bought it, but who knows. I just have to write words so that I can be done with reviewing this."
1,"The Scarlet Letter It is a very well written book. A little slow to get into, but once there it moved very well and was a pleasure to read."
1,No wonder itâ€˜s a classic. A great read that could easily be translated into modern situations. The way Hawthorne explains thing and his use of sybolism adds so much more to the story.
1,"Detailed, Beautiful, Tragic, & Engaging Hawthhone's ""The Scarlet Letter"" is literature at it's finest. The attention to detail for both settings, and especially the thoughs of the characters will chain you to this book. Sin, regret, guilt, self-punishment, and revenge are all detailed in relation to an extramarital affair resulting in a pregnancy. The symbolism is beautiful, the plot tragic, the characters engaging. The ""Scarlet Letter"" is a true masterpiece."
1,great thing I had to read this for school and since it was on my kindle I could just search a word to find the quote I needed. great book! Hawthorn's syntax is just so lengthy!!
1,"Best Tale of Scandal and Deceptjon I was required to read this book for English class, and it's my favorite book we've read all year :) full of juicy drama, scandal, and humor, the book is more like an entertaining Spanish soap than a boring classic novel some find it to be. If you look at the boon with the right eyes, you can enjoy it :))"
1,"Be true ""The Scarlet Letter"", by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a book about how keeping secrets can ruin a person. A very realistic view of how a society can treat others. Even though many of the towns people were no more innocent than Hester in many ways, they looked on her as one of the worse sinners in town, unable to be touched by the rest of society."
1,"Don't let your highschool teachers force feed you classics The Scarlet Letter is a very good book. It would be much better though if we were alowed to read it on our own and draw our own conclusions. How well can you appreciate a book if you have to hurry because you must read 40 pages in one night while making sure to remember details that may be on the test. Read it in highschool or not, it doesn't matter. But make sure to pick it up later in your life when you are ready for it, and you can draw your own conclusions instead of regurgitating what the teacher told you so you can pass a test."
1,"Scarlet Letter While I had a copy of the Scarlet Letter in my personal library, my son's teacher required the Dover edition. I was very pleased with the vendor's delivery, arriving before the due date. My son expressed ease with which he was able to read, especially when the class used the same edition as a text. Thank you!"
1,"Quite The Story ..... Where does one begin ? how does one begin ? This novel of Hawthorne is an excellent one .. a classic...a novel to be cherished . The lessons to be learnt about sin ,giult ,denial and eventual deliverance of truth ,redemption and socialization can all be internalized into real life . Yes , Hawthorne was not a perfect Writer but he portrays the language skillfully and beautifully . I must stress that to reaal understand this book, you shouldn't be cranking up the volume on your stereo and drinking caffeine drinks ....if you do . you'll fell the book is "" the worst book you could ever read """
1,"School Reading I had to read this book for the first time in high school and even then I fell in love with the story. Yes the onld english can bog you down a bit, but it is so worth it. it has a great story line. It's what can be considered old school scandalous!"
1,"The Scarlet Letter This book typifies the old English, colonialists, trying to impose their disgusting lawsThis is a must read book, for those who consider these authors worthy. The English have always been accomplished writers"
1,A Masterpiece for all times Gets better with every reading! Required reading in high school aeons ago - so it seemed terribly tedious. Am now entranced with every word.
1,An On line Read This went back to an old standard. It was a good read and easy to view on the reader. I enjoyed it as it was what I expected.
1,"Great book I love this book. It's a great classic, and I love Hawthorne's style. Very well written, and a good representation of the time."
1,"Better than the first in every way! In every way, 'Return of the Killer Tomatoes' is a far better film then the classic original. The characters, ranging from John Astin as the evil mad scientist, his clean cut news anchor servant Igor, and George Clooney in his first film role, are hilarious. The plot is more involved and understandable, and the jokes fly fast and furious. One thing potential buyers should be aware of is that this film, like the original, is presented in the fullscreen format common with straight-to-video productions, which this almost certainly was. A great film, a better sequel, and well worth the few dollars it costs."
1,great i think it is a great comidy just anther adam sandler if you dont like him then this prob isnt a great movie for you but i would still try it
1,how it works Love it. Works great. Have watched several times on at least three different players. Would like to have more movies of Adam Sandle.
1,"BEST HOLIDAY FILM IN YEARS!!!!!!!!!!! 8 Crazy Nights is one of the greatest holiday films I have ever seen in my life. It ranks up there as one of the greatest holiday films with Jingle All The Way, Christmas Vacation, and Home Alone. The jokes are HILARIOUS and the plot is so beautiful. I cried from laughing sooooo much and cried from the wonderful storyline. This movie is pure genius."
1,"Finally! Oh, my goodness. To all of you reading out there, I have been waiting for this movie's release date for almost a whole year. Ever since the film came out in theaters, I checked amazon.com every day to find out when it would be released and now, I know. Also, this DVD comes out on my birthday. That is cool. Anyway, all my friends who saw this movie and all the reviews I read said that this movie was terrible. I say forget those reviews because this movie is simply amazing. If you like Adam Sandler, then this movie is for you. If you don't like Adam Sandler this movie is still for you. This is by far his best movie ever (Happy Gilmore is his second best). This is a must buy for any Sandler fan. It is warm and witty and has the voice talents of so many people from Adam Sandler's SNL days. Classic movie. You can count on me being there at the store before school buying this. Can't wait!"
1,"Spinout Back in '66 when I was 16 I saw this film numerous times. Loved it!! Still enjoy it today. Funny. Great supporting cast. Pretty girls. Enjoyable soundtrack. Hilarious racing finale. What's not to like?To the reviewer(s) who consider this Elvis' worst film, I ask: Have you seen Harum Scarum? Now that one IS bad!!"
1,Great desk for the young scholar We bought this for our tall seven-year old and it is an excellent fit. It was not difficult to assemble and it is very sturdy and the finish is solid - it won't peel off with an accidental piece of tape or scratch. We have a similar set that is in espresso and love it. The kids spill stuff on it and stick things to it and it is still in good condition. This is a big sturdy desk and we highly recommend it.
1,"Mark of Love I would have to say that I love this movie for several reasons. First, it is a very cute story with some adorable characters. Second, my niece starred in it and produced it, and last but not least, my son has two songs in it!!!"
1,"""Brain Based Learning"" is a masterpiece ""Brain Based Learning"" suggests a new style of teaching that activates student brains and makes them an active participant in the learning process. Author Eric Jensen is absolutely brilliant with his delivery of this material. His writing style is engaging, profound and insightful. I'm so impressed with the way to weaves together a variety of sources to present his idea for personal transformation. Never before have I read a book that combines material on stress reduction, fight-or-flight, activating both hemispheres of the brain, and flow states-- and applied it to education.Seriously, this book is a masterpiece! You don't have to be a teacher to gleam something from ""Brain Based Learning"" -- it is also insightful for entrepeniurs, marketers and writers. If you listen to brain synch cds, use light and sound machines, or do any sort of AVE (audio visual entrainment), reading this book will rock your world. I highly recommend this book!"
1,"It's the Oscar buff's Bible. It's not really meant to be read from beginning to end, though you certainly can. It's a handy reference that will draw you in. You may begin by looking up the last year Bob Hope hosted, but an hour later you'll realize you're in the Billy Crystal era. Lots of fun -- dishy but accurate. Pick it up, turn to any chapter, and enjoy."
1,"I got lucky! I was able to buy this textbook for only ten dollars including shipping! My classmates were skeptical of such a low price and assured me the book would be in terrible condition. But they were wrong! There is not one note, highlight, or writing on the margins. The book looks practically new."
1,"AWESOME The book I received was in excellent condition and arrived fast. Unfortunately, my professor did not require the text only an on line Virtual Child. I returned the book and was given a prompt refund. Thank you so much for your great customer service."
1,Awesome CD and great value! Couldn't ask for a better transaction. Shipped super fast and item was as described!
1,"The Best Heart Album Ever This is the best Heart album ever made in my opinion. I grew up listening to Heart and I still listen to them. I saw Ann and Nancy in concert last year they were awsome as usual. My favorite song is ""These Dreams"". Another good song is ""What About Love"". Heart has had numerous #1 hits and it's amazing people still love to listen to them."
1,"Heavy synth, hairspray and Heart One of my favorite things from the 1980's was the synth-heavy pop-rock of Heart. Wow, how I love this album. Chock full of that classic 80's lite rock sound, with fantastic Ann and Nancy Wilson vocals. All around great stuff."
1,"A Touchstone 80's Album There really isn't any reason I can rationalize it, but this is a landmark 80's album in the same mode the recording ""Boston"" is to 70's albums. It just sounds huge, a Phil Spectorish ""wall of sound"": Great melody combined with some grit tacked on to saccharine sweet hooks. This massive aural assault has bunches of decent, though big-time AOR, songs that help it, for the most part, hold up way past it's prime. Sure it sounds dated, but infectious, so if the mood is right, it still works. Unlike Boston's ""Boston"" (undeniably their best), it certainly isn't the best thing the Wilson sisters have ever done, however it stands on it's own as a unique sonic place in time which remains highly listenable. A guilty pleasure."
1,"Good Memories If one word could describe ""the 80's"" it would have to be HEART. this cd brings back memories of when I was growing up and I would hear songs like ""These Dreams"" on the radio. Today when I that song it I con't get enough of it, I will never forget this song. If you love 80's music then I highly reccomend that you get this cd"
1,Finished it in one sitting! Keep them coming! Bantum is an appealing hero and his adventures are exciting and entertaining as he fights for his freedom and his maiden. The middle ages come alive before your eyes.
1,"this is the one! This is the Groove Holmes disc to get! The entire disc is loaded with great music; ""I Love Your Smile"" alone is worth the price, but there's much more. Get this; you'll be glad you did."
1,"A great family Christmas movie Christmas may be a time for joy and laughter, but Charlie Brown has the Blues. To get in the holiday spirit, he takes Lucy's advice and directs a Christmas play. And what's a Christmas play w/o a tree? Everyone makes fun of the short sparse ""nevergreen tree"" that he comes up with, until Christmas works it's true magic.This is a classic family holiday film. It has all the characters that we have known and loved our whole lives. This DVD also contains the ""It's Christmastime Again Charlie Brown"" story. It has English, Spanish, Japanese and Portuguese audio tracks. This is a great way to enjoy Christmas with the whole family or with friends."
1,"The best Christmas movie, ever. When I was a freshman in college, I stopped typing my term paper (due the next day) so I could watch it on TV. The next year my roommate gave me the video for my birthday so I could watch it whenever I want. There are only three things that I need for the Christmas season: A Charlie Brown Christmas, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and the Muppets album with John Denver. And then, even though I am a college student and have to spend most of December studying for finals 600 miles from home, somehow everything seems right again."
1,"Very Good Transfer to DVD Commenting on what a wonderful Christmas special this is would be superfluous: I would only be echoing the comments of all the reviews of the VHS edition. As for the DVD edition, it's a good transfer, clean, no artifacts, good sound. Skip the second feature, ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown."" It just doesn't compare. My only gripe about the DVD: they fixed the one moment in the original master that captured my attention and my heart. Every year, I watched for the moment when the Peanuts gang gathered around the newly decorated little tree and began singing ""Loo loo loo, loo loo loo loo loo"" to the tune of ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing."" As the camera pulls in on the left side of the group and pans right, Pig Pen's head disappears for one frame when they all take a breath. You can see Patty's orange dress suddenly appear where his head was. I was really sorry to see them fix that. I don't know why, but it makes the cartoon even more endearing to me."
1,"It's Charlie Brown... It's the movie you grew up with plus a bunch of other stuff. I teach kids who had never seen it before, they like it."
1,Charlie Brown Christmas I bought this movie for myself because it is a classic Christmas movie. Also it came in Blu Ray was a factor.
1,"Wonderful This Charlie Brown movie is the best, most masterful work ever made by the late great artist. This movie is part of the Christmas tradition - no less than the apple cider, the carols, and the tree - and truely captures the sentiment of Christmas."
1,"Proof that good things are built to last When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music, subject treatment and Linus's Bible reading were unlike anything else tried on TV before. Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - ""Sparky"" hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and, in true Peanuts' style, is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious. One of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season."
1,A Holiday Classic I love Snoopy. He is my favorite. And I love owning this classic and bringing it out every holiday season and watching it with family and friends. It never gets old. A timeless tradition!
1,"Christmas Tradition- Schultz was a genius! Like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" this animated film has imprinted on the American psyche the meaning of the Christmas holiday season."
1,"Amazon Fan There was more to this disc than I expected. It has several additions that were good to watch. The cartoon itself is a good reminder of what Christmas is all about. Great for the kids or grandkids, or even the Scrooge sitting on the sofa."
1,A Timeless Classic! This video has been around longer than me and has earned a place in my heart. It is a must have for every one who collects Peanuts' videos. Though it was done in 1965 it still holds true today. It is full of wit and charm and is fun and entertaining for all ages. It has become a Christmas tradition in our home to watch it every year!
1,"If you don't like this movie, you're just flat wrong!! Christmas is about more than santa and presents. It's more than just the biggest tree with the best decorations. It's about a babe in a manger, three wise men and eternal salvation. In an innocent way only Charles Shultz and the crew can do, Charlie Brown (And Linus, et al) deliver this message loud and clear. I say everyone needs to buy this DVD before everything related to God and Jesus and the true meaning of Christmas is removed from the world... It's sad when a cartoon such as this may very well be one of the last strongholds Christians have on our own identity.My own personal soapbox aside, this movie is great. It's timely, even today. It's meaningful and it's truth personified. It teaches about the things that really matter in life, not the superficial garbage most people tend to worry about during the holidays.God Bless Charlie Brown!"
1,"All time favorites I just bought the DVD to this great Christmas Special dated back to 1965. Who cannot love the Peanuts gang and Snoopy. Also, the DVD has It's Christmas Time Again Charlie Brown which is a bonus feature. Great family entertainment!! Too bad they don't make them like this anymore."
1,"Love it! I originally purchased this for my pregnancy, as I was using 5+ pillows for support, and i was tired of chasing them as they fell off the bed all night long. I loved the support and have slept with it ever since. (i even take it with me on trips.) its great because of the refluff-able fill and because you can roll over and not have to move it. I have yet to wash it in the laundermat and see how it turns out.one con, because of its size, it can be difficult to fluff... do it in the morning while you have energy, not at night when you're ready to go to bed."
1,"Exactly What I Wanted I looked at all the different types of body/pregnancy pillows on Amazon and finally settled on this one. I am pregnant and have recently gotten to the point that I just cannot get comfortable in bed. I have had this pillow a week now and I absolutely love it. It was worth every penny. It's like sleeping in a nest, it supports me beautifully and its very comfortable."
1,"Great item! The adaptor works really well on my ibook or powerbook. It has a really long extension cord. The only problem is that it is slightly more bulky than the apple one. So, for traveling around, unless you have a big computer case, it will not fit nicely. Other than that, it is great. Much cheaper than a new apple adapter and works just as nicely. It is also sturdier than the apple adaptor and does not have the annoying light."
1,"WHO NEEDS MAC ACCESSORIES Who needs Mac accessories when you can have an equally good (or better) product like Macally powerbook Ibook ac adapter? I purchased this item for my daughter when her Mac-made original AC adapter connection frayed and was not fixable. We tried to get a replacement at Mac retail stores and Mac on-line, but everyone was out of them and did not know when they would be available. This made me think that the original cords must have been somewhat defective since there was such a demand for them. We turned to Amazon to order the Macally AC adapter with some trepidation because the price was lower than the Mac-made product. That was several months ago and the Macally adapter has worked perfectly and we are very pleased with our purchase. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a new adapter and because of the lower price, would advise it instead of the Mac."
1,"Exactly what I wanted I was worried when I ordered this because there were so many bad reviews. After all, it's a power cord there is only one thing that can go wrong how can they all be so bad. I have had it for about a month now and it's a power cord. yay!"
1,"Very Good I read many positive reviews before buying this product, so my thanks to all of the previous posters. This adaptor is actually really great. I was a little upset before because I thought I was replacing my old G3 adapter with an even uglier one but was very happy to see that it isn't like the picture. It's the same shape but the chords everything is white, so it matches well with my ibook. It also has a pretty blue light that shines when the AC is connected, but it doesn't do much else. So if your worried about having an ugly adapter don't be because this is actually pretty nice. (at least much nicer than the G3 model adaper)"
1,"Great Solution! This Adapter will do the job as good or even better than the original adapter for a fraction of the price. Unless you are deeply in love with the ""cute looks"" and the Apple logo on the original adapter save your self some money by buying this one."
1,"Great replacement. We have 3 PowerBooks in the house, and 2 of them are using these cords now when their OEM powercords fizzled out - as the apple cords are known to do. While they don't light up, they do their intended job, and they do so without overheating QUITE as bad as the original cord. It still gets warm, so give it some space, but overall, a very nice product."
1,"Exactly what I hoped for My husband and I both have Mac laptops and the dog chewed his charger to pieces (yay!) and after five years of use, my charger literally started smokig while it was plugged in (yay!)I went to the Mac company store to buy new chargers, but at a whopping 79.99 I only bought one. I found the MacAlly charger on Amazon.com and decided to give it a try. When we got it and tried it out I immediately returned the Mac brand charger for a refund. I love the MacAlly charger! Its actually long enough to be practical. It doesn't fall out of the wall socket from its own weight (imagine that.) And it never gets hot enough to fry eggs.BUY IT! It's less than half the cost of the brand name, it's a more practical design, and it's still small enough to fit into my little laptop bag. Sure, its not as novel or cute, and it doesn't have the little Apple insignia on it, but I'm not paying eighty bucks for one charger when I could buy the two that I needed for about the same."
1,"Don't scrounge for the second-gen Apple adapter! This is your ticket! I don't know how long I searched and searched for a replacement for myPowerbook G4 power adapter replacement. I looked at Computer City,Apple Stores, apple.com, and even Ebay. The old adapters aren't availablein either of the two stores and online the adapters can hit you up for 80bucks! Ugh!This adapter works great with the generation of apple laptops before theMagSafe adapters and it's much less prone to malfunction and designflaws that will enable it to rip, etc. Very elegant, too."
1,FABULOUS! Recommend it over the genuine Mac alternative. Couldn't be more satisfied with this product! And the low price ...I've bought my last $80 Mac adapter. They can fook right orf !!!:-)
1,Mindcrime at the Moore Absolutely amazing. that's the only way to describe this DVD A must have for any Queensryche fans.
1,"It leaves you wondering... The Spanish version of Brian Weiss's book, ""Muchas vidas, muchos sabios"" is even more intriguing to me than my English version. (La version del libro de Brian Weiss es aun mas intrigante para me que la version en Ingles.) For those who believe in reincarnation, this is a great book (Para aquellos que creen en la reincarnacion, este es un gran libro.)"
1,"Oh, so cool! Such a cool check book cover! Seems very durable and will last a long time. Very roomy, yet slim enough to fit in my little purse! Excellent price and very prompt shipping. A definate converstion piece."
1,The most beautiful Cd I've ever bought. As a big fan of classical persian music and an Iranian I recommand this cd to anyone intersted in molavi's and nazeri's work.This very diffrent and amazing work by dastan and nazeri is for sure the best work i heard from them.I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I do.
1,"Clear and Concise Introduction to Palmistry In my opinion, Richard Webster's Revealing Hands is quite simply the best introduction to the fascinating subject of palmistry. Students will find the material to be concise and easily comprehensible, unlike many other chirological texts. This fine book is a mandatory addition to the library of any aspiring or professional palmist."
1,"..I Found This Excellent! Looking for a Palm Reading Bible you will go back to over all other pretty, colorful and modern New Age Palm Reading books? This is the one! Out of all the Palmistry books I go back to over and over when professional palm reading, this is the book I turn to. Why? Its black and white, diagrams give plenty of writing space for quick notes, writing style is down to earth and basic. For basic/intermediate study, this is a book based on old traditional rules.....Not a health study, more a realistic character study....I consider it the best I have in my Palmistry Library."
1,"Pure Funk This is just great music. Funk through the eyes of the great Eddie Palmieri. A total fusion of the time period. A mix of funky, jazzy latin rock-a little like the band ""War""."
1,Great extra pieces We always need these extra little pieces and couldn't find them anywhere. Great to find them here and good quality for the price!
1,"Reunited with Reunion From the first tune, the chills came back. And when Glen rips into the words early on in Just This One Time, I was back to the old chair with the vinyl on the stereo. The tunes are a testament to Webb's remarkable writing and arranging talents. He puts himself up for all to see and speaks as if he has read my thoughts. Such a long lost treasure found again....thanks to the Aussies for put it all together! Now I must get back to listening...and smiling!"
1,"The Finest Material Available - Period I can't express my gratitude at the reviews I've read enough - I remember finding ""Reunion"" in the remainder bin at a Caldor's a couple of decades ago. I couldn't believe what I was listening to when I got it home. How could this album not be a top seller, I thought? ""Wishing Now"" is one of the most achingly joyous, if that's the best way to put it, songs of longing you'll ever hear. ""You Might As Well Smile"" is a masterpiece of soulful humanity. ""The Moon's a Harsh Mistress"" is pure poetry set to music. One of the GREAT albums of all time - period."
1,"Plain and Simple I felt this was an extremely well written and moving little book, and I have recommended it to many friends. In fact, I bought copies and sent them out. It made you stop and think about your own life and how we complicate and prioritize."
1,"plastic globe pepper/salt grinders glass globes would be a welcome addition to thesewonderful little pepper and salt grinders, with 1 hand yet, the glass woul make it feel more professional, or legtitament if you will thnx bert"
1,"Stellar, as usual BP remains the standard for baseball annuals, with zillions of player comments both informative and entertaining, and team comments which are generally excellent.They know more about more players than anyone else.Minor quibble: Every year the back cover exhalts BP's predictive prowess and gives examples, yet for some reason the 2001 edition fails to speak of, for instance, the success of the Minnesota Twins and Jeff Kubenka. But that's just marketing, I suppose -- it is a great book."
1,"The New Standard Bearer BP sets the standard, not just for baseball books but for all annuals of any genre. The depth and breadth of coverage seems to grow each year. Whether you're a fantasy player or a hard core fan, this book is indispensable."
1,"Worth it for the Furs cover alone. Okay, a lot of this has been released elsewhere and some might find the price tag unjustified. However, this is worth it if for no other reason than the weird postmodern refraction (or something like that) of Robyn covering fellow '80s college rock casualties of the great alternative sellout of the 1990s, The Psychedelic Furs. ""The Ghost in You"" gains something in his sparse folk arrangement that it didn't have in its synth heavy/Richard Butler's limited vocal range but still great original version.Get it before it goes out of print like every other Hitchcock release.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
1,"Excellent travel book I ordered this book after visiting the Amazon and Dr. Smith's clinic. The descriptions of her work there and her clinic, local people and their community, culture, climate, plant and animal life were spot on so it was a joy to read and added depth to my travel experience. Dr. Smith's medical dedication and adjustment to life on the Amazon is inspirational."
1,"Unique and Captivating China High quality, light weight and uniquely interesting pattern. Adds fun to the dining experience and cleans up like a dream in the dishwasher. Arrived in absolutely perfect condition and was packaged exceptionally well."
1,"Wonderful book...from ex-Hoosier I grew up in Indianapolis and really enjoyed reading about all of the things that have gone away since I was a little kid. I used to love Burger Chef, and the downtown Ayres store. I remember the Riverside Amusement Park sitting closed there for years when we would pass it going out to the Speedway.The author also has a webpage called ""Lost Indiana"" which talks about some of the Lost Indy topics, but also some other neat sites in the rest of the state. You could google this to find it."
1,"It's my favorite CD!!!!!! Wow! This is my favorite CD right now. Warning, if you liked Natalise's first album this one is a little different. And it's 20 times better! The music is totally hot and there are some killer beats and really great slow songs too. Her voice is amazing. And the lyrics are really meaningful. If you listen to the lyrics you can tell that she is talking about true life experiences and not just singing the same things as other other artists. And ALL the lyrics are printed in the booklet. It's a really big booklet with LOTS of pages TONS of photos and all the lyrics for every single song! The booklet is like a bonus. There are so many good songs on this album, It's the best CD I've bought in a couple years.I give it 6 out of 5 stars"
1,"Guy Clark is the best Guy Clark continues to show what great country music really is. In these days of Shania Twain and the like where country is really a form of pop with cowboy hats, here comes Guy Clark with ""Cold Dog Soup"" that reminds you that great music with poetry in the likes of Hank Williams,Merle Haggard Willy Nelson and Townes Van Zandt still gets recorded. This is the true stuff that makes you think and tap your feet at the same time. This is an incredible production! Great work Guy! From Fort Worth Blues a Steve Earl Song to Red River, man you oughta be proud! This should be on the charts! But with the current country scene forget it.. Oh yeah what a great line "" Baby don't let um blow smoke up your dress...."" Also if you haven't written the song, you really know how to choose someone elses material and make it yours."
1,"Simply Wonderful Being a fan of progressive rock, at first listen I didn't think much of this album because it didn't sound like there was much there. Don't make the same mistake! Don't be fooled by this album's simple sounds. They belie a complexity of story and emotion - an honesty that permeates every note on this album and is beautifully woven into a harmony of voice and guitar. This is a great album that is also well recorded - nuff said!"
1,I feel like punching the Queen evertime I read his works Brilianty written with passion and fury for the common men of this historic period of time. Essays written not for the elitests but for those who could and did make a difference. Paines works are truly historical and express the point of view of the common man who day after day is raped with taxes and control by a royal family thousands of miles away who could care less for the people they take claim to.His works helped give birth to the greatest nation to bless the Earth.
1,"A Man of True Feelings For His Country. Not his Government. Paine was a patriot that believed that the country belonged to it's people, and it was up to the citizens to keep their democracy.He like the other founders knew that in order to be a truly free people they must rebel against th tyranny of England and set up a democracy where the people ruled it's government.A revoluntary, patriot whose readings is a must for anyone that is for keeping the government, of, by and for the people."
1,"A Man of Reason At the height of The Age of Reason, The United States of America was created by men such as Thomas Paine and many others who held Man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea ""Individual Rights"" down on paper in the form of The Constitution of the United States of America. Paine's contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that ""we have it in our power to make the world over again"", and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man's life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing ""We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way"". Let's work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters. To the Glory of Man!!"
1,"Suspensefull & well Written Although this is an old public domain book, it was an entertaining, well written and exciting book. You may be able to get it free on other sites or get his package of 13 novels on this site that includes this book for .99"
1,"super writer great reading. max brand has become one of my favotire authors. looking forward to reading more of his books,, great story teller."
1,"One of their best yes, but definitely their most unique. This is for sure many peoples favorite release from the band, and rightfully so, as it definitely is their most unique record in the catalog in my opinion. Epic and huge sounding, this is a classic album. Everything from killer cover art, to the lyrics... it actually transports you to the place you see on the cover of the album and makes you wonder; who is living in that cold and grim little ice castle that is sitting just on top of hell... or maybe that's just what icechests look like in Norway and they are camping and their campfire needs another log... Either way, this would be the album I would give to someone who has never heard or heard of the mighty IMMORTAL. Metalhead or not, You've never heard anything like this. IMMORTAL RULES!!!"
1,"Not just for black metal fans This is a great cd by Immortal, even though I'm not a huge black metal fan. A+.My favorite song on this cd is Withstand The Fall Of Time."
1,"A new fan of the almighty Sons Of Northern Darkness! The first music I heard from Immortal was the latest release ""Sons Of Northern Darkness"", and I was instantly hooked! I promptly picked up ""At The Heart Of Winter"", and, after hearing others in their catalog, regard this as their second greatest release. The music is varied and interesting to listen to (unlike Battles In The North...sorry guys!) with awesome riffs all over the place! It's been a while since I've been this excited about a band and am in awe of the power they incorporate into their playing. Although there are only 6 tracks, there is not a single bad song on here. You don't have to be a fan of so-called ""Black Metal"" (I'm not!) to love this album. I'm sure it will be one of my favorite CD's that I bought this year (and I buy a lot of music). Great artwork too! A must-have for the collection of any fan of real metal!"
1,"""views of the man in the street ~ Joseph Hill"" This is one of the best Reggae albums to come out for a long time ""World Peace"", featuring Culture a mesmerizing preacher-teacher who tells it like it is. Heavy bass and drums, vibrating your whole being and getting through the fibers of life with every lyric.Several highlights ~ ""WORLD PEACE"", purity of harmonies reign within this simply but true statement ~ ""NO SEGREGATION"", hits home in every part of the world, no matter where you're standing at the time ~ ""SELECTION TRAIN"", again the lyrics blend with the beat, all you need is clean hands and pure in heart to climb aboard the Reggae train...sounds good to me.If Reggae is your cup of tea, then this one is a keeper.

1,Garage Door replacement Circuit Circuit Board arrived in quick fashion and in good shape. If you are just slightly mechanically inclined you can do this replacement yourself. Maybe the most difficult thing is working on a ladder. Had garage door working in less than 30 minutes.
1,"Wow! What a treat. I had no idea Dolly Parton was this GOOD. Really, seriously, this is top notch and I rate it 5 stars."
1,"Help! I can't stop playng this CD! And I never thought I would go for bluegrass, always conjuring up images of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" in my mind. Leave it to Dolly to educate me. This music is extraordinary: very intricate all-stringed arrangements headed off by Parton's lovely, shimmering vocals. The lyrics are pretty much standard, straight-on country, but the singer is so heart-felt, she invests them with so many colors and nuances, she might as well be performing Shakespeare. Thanks, Dolly, for a truly GREAT CD!"
1,"This is a stellar piece of music. Coming from someone whose musical preferences run the gamut, from Mariah Carey to Portishead to the Cardigans and back to Geri Haliwell, these words hold quite a bit of meaning. I had read reviews of the album which touted it as the ""best of her career"" and, of course, was skeptical. I can say with complete honesty that this Bluegrass was something I was unfamiliar with, but something I have come to greatly appreciate. The music is fresh and live, different from any mainstream pop we hear nowadays, and is well-deserving of a listen by anyone with an ear for music, whether they are a city boy (Bronx, NY here) or not. Good music has a way of transcending boundaries, and this is one of those discs."
1,"DOLLY IS STILL QUEEN OF COUNTRY MUSIC ! DOLLY PARTON HAS SHOWN WITH THIS AMAZING ALL BLUEGRASS ALBUM, THE GRASS IS BLUE, WHY SHE CAN STILL CARRY THE TITLE OF QUEEN OF COUNTRY MUSIC. DOLLY IS NOT GETTING THE RADIO AIRPLAY THAT SHE STILL DESERVES. SO SHE LEFT COUNTRY MUSIC AND RELEASED AN ALL BLUEGRASS ALBUM THAT IS IN NO WAY DISAPPOINTING. I STRONGLY FEEL DOLLY WILL WIN A GRAMMY FOR THIS WORK OF PURE MOUNTAIN MUSIC ART. ALSO A WARM WELCOME TO THE RECENT HALL OF FAME MEMBER!"
1,"She could be sister, friend or mother... Lhasa's music:Her music crosses language/race boundaries. As a person who bond very strongly with female singers (eg. Kate Bush, Billie Holiday, Cesaria Evora), Lhasa's music speaks to me as if she is a close female friend, sister or mother.Amazing, intriguing voice. Simple yet dramatic; dramatic yet uncontrived.her velvet resonance and the beauty of the songs will slip unnotice past your defenses and touch the private self.I heard only about 30 seconds of the song ""de cara a la pared (Face to the Wall)"" on the show ""Due South"", but that was enough to make me determine to track down singer and song. I managed to do so on the net. And to my amazement, I found ""La Llorona"" in Singapore's HMV..."
1,"bought this as a christmas gift for a friend I gave this cd to my friend for christmas & this is what she emailed to me: I've got my discman set up with the little speakers on my desk and I'm listening to Lhasa. I love that girl! Song 9 (playing now: ""Pajarol, tu me despertaste..."") reminds me a little of the Klezmatics--kind of that Eastern European gipsy feeling... Makes me want to get up, smash my coffee cup and start dancing, with the belly beads showing...."
1,"I feel my skin with her voice. Lahasa, your music touches me in places which needed dusting. your gift reminds me i have a heart, skin, teeth, beauty. thank you. thank you. thank you."
1,"A fun-filled fantasy adventure ""Castle"" is a wonderful book for children who have short attention spans. It provides adventure and re-affirms the laws of chivalry."
1,"Castle in the Attic Castle in the Attic is a masterpiece beyond childhood recognition. Ms. Winthrop has woven a tale not confined to the limits of a child's imagination, but one that tests the mature intellect. Christian parents will be pleased to discover that while magic is a recurring theme in this book, it proves to be mearly a side story to the more important and intreguing prospect of William's character development. I recomend to any parent this book for their young son. It speaks of Honor and Chivalry in the face of evil, of strength and tender souls. What this book speaks of in regard to emotional strength is something that every child, and even adult, needs to discover; That to Cry is not Cowardice, to be tender hearted is not Weakness, and that Honor and courage is the Heart of a Knight."
1,"A very good book This is one of the many LJ Smith books I read and eventhough it is not the best, it was certainly very interesting... LJ Smith's books are very original and that's the main reason why I like reading them....I prefer all her other books about vampires though..since I'm a vampire freak..but I would encourage anyone to read this book...It's simply great!"
1,"Best witch book i've ever read!!! Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends,and I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come."
1,"Thanks for the info!!! I just wanted 2 say that I'm a real bookworm and I loved this book! I also want 2 thank L.J.Smith for putting in the book actual spells.(I'm a witch.) I've been looking for some of those like,forever"
1,"Magic, Love and Witchy Women........ This book is one of the greatest of the nightworld series. This book is about gentle, nature loving Thea and her wild beautiful cousin, Blaise.Thea falls in love with a human but since the rules of the nightworld state that she can't love a human Thea finds herself in a situation that could turn deadly......Blaise willing to do anything for her cousin tries to lure Eric into her trap and get him away from Thea for good!This has to be my favorite of the series. It was interesting to see the nightworld from the witches point of view and Thea and Blaise are great characters. Especially Blaise, she's no airhead beauty but like her name a bright blaze of passion, intelligence, and loyalty."
1,Great! This book like all of L.J.Smith's other books is absolutely divine! I luved it. Blaise was a perfect witch in my opinion. The only thing that disturbed me was the awful torture chamber for Halloween in the Gym. How can people actually laugh about that (I've met people who think it's funny)?
1,"Excellent! One of the best baseball books ever! Although most of the players from the 1961 Cincinnati Reds are forgotten now (exception: right fielder and National League MVP Frank Robinson), this book remains current due to the good humor and insider's view it affords the reader. Nearly 40 years old now, it shows how timeless the game of baseball is.I'm a lifelong NY Yankees fan, but this remains one of my favorite books on any subject.One note: this is one of the only baseball books that was _really_ written by the named author. Brosnan had no ghostwriter."
1,"Great series I have several titles in this series--they're great! The recipes are easy to make and clearly set out, and there is always an introductory chapter on the herb or spice covered by the book. There are several other titles in this series: coriander, ginger, garlic, chocolate, etc."
1,Always a great book... All I can say is that this is a nice nearly complete compilation of his work. A must read in my educated opinion.
1,"Good primer. Great book for an overall look at insects. Doesn't go into great depth on any one topic or insect, but provides a great cross section of information. Purchased this for my son and will admit that as usual, the DK illustrations caught my eye and I ended up reading the book too. This is a great series of books for kids that really captures their attention."
1,"Excellent Educationl Text I'm a teacher and I find the Eyewitness books highly educational. I like the way the concepts are presented in a form without backgrounds. This gives clear facts to the reader without over taxing the attention span. The books are highly informative, presenting difficult concepts in comprehendable chunks that stimulate interest. I have almost the whole collection for my own children and they LOVE them!"
1,"REMASTER 2012! GOTTA HAVE IT! So, what I've always wanted was a clean digitally remastered version of ""Pom Pom Play Girl"" in MONO! The stereo is rechanneled with Carl singing on one channel and the guys singing on the other! The Mono ""FUN, Fun, Fun is also a ""Must Have"" in Mono to get the full benefit of Brian's Vocal. The music and vocals are very clean on this CD. The gatefold packaging is a bit weak without any details on the songs but still an overwhelming experience for anyone who enjoys surf music."
1,"Fantastic Melting Pot of Music Having seen Scruj live a couple of times, and owning a copy of their studio release CD (see their website), I would consider myself a major fan. To quote a friend, ""Are they French, Irish, or American Country?"" Good question. Answer: all of the above.Blending Irish folk music, french fiddles and lyrics, and country twang, Scruj manages to always be true to the styles they worship. Yet they are all so young! If you have not seen them or heard them, do yourself a favor and do whatever it takes! They play such wonderful music with a profound respect for it's origins and it's spirit."
1,"Great in different styles !!! The reason that i give this cd 5 stars... it's simple... different styles of house music, compiled on one cd... you will enjoy it a whole time... so it's worth for your money !!!If Jack keeps it in this way... we may expect beautiful things of him in the future !!!"
1,"Excellent quality Wonderful product - heavy weight and well made. This has been a delightful and useful addition to my 50's style, diner kitchen."
1,"Real cultured butter of high quality I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said, there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.In my opinion, the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire, etc."
1,"The Distillationof Huxley's Views on Life and Death One of my all time favorite books, glad to have a new copy"
1,"Lovely stories. Gwen Bristow is an amazing author. Her books may be a mite old fashioned, but she still packs an emotional, historical and cultural punch. Really a great read, as are her other novels. Don't miss out."
1,awsome metal dude its like code red was an album from Sodom.This album is scarey and makes me feel cool
1,"Exactly what it says it is I'm an arts and crafts director for a girlscout camp, so I read a lot of craft books. Klutz really does have the best ones around. These rings are easy, the book gives you everything you need (but scissors) and there are several cute patterns. I'm sure campers will love these projects. The only complaints I have are with the included supplies-- the bead wheel is cumbersome to use, and the colors mix easily. Also, there isn't much variety in beads-- but you can easily supplement with whatever you have on hand."
1,"Useful, witty and profound I have always loved Peter McWilliams poetry.He had the most impact on my style of writing poetry(Poems in the Key of Life...a Journey). I never knew he wrote non-fiction books. When I couldn't find his poetry books I came to Amazon to purchase them again. This is when I saw his non-fiction work. I bought one. I loved it. It is a useful guide how to go through life with less distress. He does it in a witty, amusing and easy to understand way. I think everyone should read his books. I plan on getting the rest of his work. I have no doubt I will enjoy them as much as I have this one."
1,"The most wonderful self awareness/psychology book. A must read. When I was a Senior in High School I took an AP Psychology class and the teacher used this book. This book has helped me so much in life. It helped me understand all those awkward teenage years. Helped me deal with an abusive, destructive blended family and helped me learn about myself and my own dysfunctionsd. This is a wonderful book that is very easy to read and something that every one should read."
1,"Best band no one knows End of Romance is the great new album by one of the best rock and roll bands that no one has ever heard of. The album starts out with the rocking ""I'm No Angel"" which is a vastly different sound than anything on the band's previous works. The drum beat to this song will instantly have you pounding the dashboard in your car as you drive with the windows down and the stereo blasting. Other highlights include ""Walking Years Away"" and the best song on the album, ""Northstar"". The song ""Coping"" which was on the ""Born and Razed"" album makes an appearance in a different arrangement; one that gives the song a much harder edge, on this record. All in all ""End of Romance"" is a terrific rock and roll album and one that will hopefully garner the Charlie Mars Band the audience they deserve."
1,Great Quality They were really soft and great quality. No defects (which is always nice lol). The fiance and I both loved them.
1,A lingerie must-have I hate the modern day thigh highs with the silicone bands that hold them up on your thigh. These stockings do not have them in the lace trim. A garter belt is required or garter straps on your favorite bustier. Gives you that sexy garter style without the unsightly bulging and uncomfortable pinching.
1,"Beautiful and arrived perfect! I have been wanting this pattern for some time now, so I finally ordered it (3 actually)and they just arrived, very well packed, not a scratch on them, and on time!And you can't beat the price from Amazon, I saved about $75 on each set!"
1,"Marshall Hollenzer is Driving This is a superbly written book. Witty, clever, and thought provoking, I found if hard to put down. It is filled with quirky and interesting characters, prose that flows, and subtle humor that occasionally had me laughing out loud. I cannot wait to read the next book by this promising young author."
1,CAREFUL what you order It is a great tool and glad the manufacturer stands behind their products. They exchanged the Spanish for English. The tools is worth the money just make sure you get it in the correct language. I am just to OLD to learn a new language.
1,WONDERFUL Another Winner for Belva. The characters are real and you will both laugh and cry. The story is believable. You will not be able to put it down.
1,"This book is a straight 5 starts!! I'm an avid reader of Belva Plain's books, and After The Fire is just another one of her masterpieces. I really don't understand how anyone who've read this book can think otherwise."
1,"Better than expected! For thirty bucks, I wasn't expecting much. After reading the reviews, I knew not to expect much. I went so far as to add J-B Weld to my order in anticipation of wobbly joints.I've used it on one fire so far, and I have no need for the J-B Weld yet. When assembling it, the threads all seemed to fit quite well--very snugly, tight, and firm. No wobble. Can't beat the value of these. And all it takes is to J-B weld if it ever starts to ""go cheap"" on me."
1,"This is what a management game should be! Virtual Resort: Spring Break is a highly addictive, surprisingly humorous management game with detailed graphics. True, you will need a powerful computer to get it to run smoothly, but when it does it is well worth it. It requires a decent amount of thinking and rewards you with entertaining animations. Being able to import your own music is a great feature. The level of control that is involved is what makes the game so addictive. It is actually entertaining to sit back and watch all the little things that are going on on your island. All other management games should strive to be half as fun as this one."
1,"An adult sim I have enjoyed this game. It seems easy but you'll find yourself out of time or money before you have met your objectives. You don't feel cheated, it makes you want try again and again. Maybe no one will drown and perhaps you can even turn a profit. I'm looking forward to many hours of entertainment."
1,"Great Music--Fun Game I loved the music for this game and the 20 bucks i spent on this thing when i bought a few years ago was well spent. Its the oldest game for my computer that i still play, probably because there are no sequels, but i burnt the music to a cd and can listen to it in my car. For the 3.50 the game is going at now you might as well just buy it to try it, then again you have to factor in shipping cost, but all in all a great game especially for under ten dollars."
1,BB's the Best! It doesn't matter what this Master sings; he is the best. I have been a fan of BB's forever. There is no such thing as a bad BB collection of songs.
1,"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner- without making extra inte This book should wake up more people to the opportunity to manage and take control of their mortgage instead of the bank controling you. Good information, outlined well with easiy to understand examples.As and extra bonus it was great to meet the author Harj Gill the other night as he presented his information and also showed how to apply this knowledge to your business too.Look for this book to make a difference in banking here in the U.S."
1,"What an Eye-Opener! When you understand that banks are interested in making money -- LOTS of it -- for themselves, you'll understand why this book was written. It helps you keep more of your money while still paying off what you borrowed, only faster.For a conventional mortage, most of the payments in the first few years go primarily to paying the interest on the loan, with very little going to the principal. With most people moving to a new one (trading up) every 5-7 years, they wind up paying LOTS of interest with very little to show for it. The banks get VERY rich this way.With this book, you can learn how to move out of that pool of quicksand and stand on solid financial ground. Harj writes clearly and simply without talking down to you. He lays it all out from beginning to end, and everywhere in between.More than worth the INVESTMENT in your life. Definitely read it."
1,Love this story. Well written I love this story. Loaned it to my sister and she was just as impressed as I was. Highly recommended.
1,stress reliever Co-workers stop to comb the sand and ask where I got it. Its a great time out in a stressful environment.
1,Great for office I purchased this for my new office and I love it and so does everyone who comes in.
1,"a welcome return to form I want to second everything said by Mr. Grimlan with respect to this album and Les Baxter's output in general. Although I am extremely fond of Les's 1940s-50s work in all genres, some of his 60s pop things (specifically, VOICES IN RHYTHM and COLORS OF BRAZIL/AFRICAN BLUE) continue to leave me cold. This 1970 album, however, exhibits none of the shortcomings of those earlier ones - the lukewarm performances, the generic guitar/bass work or the uncomfortably passe doo-wahs. No, this abbreviated QUE MANGO! has real energy. It crackles - and not only is there not a bad track, but some of them (""Que Mango"", ""Tropicando"", ""On a Warm Night"", ""Felicia, My Love"") stand easily with the best of Les's work from his great 50s albums. Highly recommended even as it is at under 24 minutes."

1,"BEWARE! In this book Agatha Christie refers to the murderers in Death in the Clouds, the Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Mysterious Affair at Style and the Mystery of the Blue Train, so make sure you have read all of these before you read this one, our your fun will be spoilt!Dumb Witness is one my top ten favourite Agatha Christie novels. Dame Christie has expressed the character of Hastings better here than in any of the other seven novels in which he appears. It is also one of the most amusing.One thing I enjoy about this book is that we are given a fair crack at the whip - everything that Poirot sees we see, there are no last minute envelopes arriving (which often irritates me). His explanation is convincing.Go ahead and read it! But don't forget to read the books mentioned above first."
1,"Model 1911 Lovers An excellent addition to the library of any Model 1911 owner. The book deals with the history, shooting and maintenance of this iconic firearm."
1,Greatest Box Set Ever !! This box set is a MUST-HAVE for all Elvis/Orion fans alike. Booklet is fantastic. Songs are great . Can't wait till the next Orion box set !
1,great to use with action shots or beginning photographers im glad i bought this item i could have use this years ago as i love to take pictures and video my kids sports.Darrin & Jackie
1,"Nolde Ignites Passion I'm an always learning watercolorist and this book is great inspiration for letting more passion flow into my everyday and my art. the book arrived in 'very good' condition, as requested. Nolde's landscapes and flowers are unparalleled in their joy for color and sense of spontaneous energy and expression. i'm really glad i did the market buy and let Amazon find the book over a few months."
1,Arrived in great Book looks great everything that was promised and arrived in great time too. Thanks! Will enjoy reading it and sharing
1,"Excellent software, but NOT an audio CD Amazon needs to fix its info for this product - it's not an audio CD. It's a great package of software that has helped me bulk up my vocabulary and get a better pronuncation in modern standard arabic. I learned arabic grammar a while back, but found that its hard to communicate without a growing base of vocabulary to use. THis program is helping me do that. Love the clear audio recordings!"
1,sorta wonderful this is what wilco would sound like now if they had not turned into radiohead. first 6 songs are as strong as any record in the last 10 years.
1,"The BEST PUR cd. A must have for any PUR fan, it is if full of classic songs such as ""Lena"", ""Prinzessin"" and ""Drachen sollen fleigen"". Great cd."
1,"A timeless and memorable anthology Compiled and edited by William F. Buckiley, Jr., the Treasury Of Classic Children's Literature is an anthology of enduring stories for young folk, painstakingly selected and compiled by William F. Buckley, Jr. for their lasting appeal across the generations. Works by Jack London, Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, Mark Twain, Thorton W. Burgess, Palmer Cox, and others, are embellished with black-and-white illustrations in this timeless and memorable anthology which is a welcome and recommended addition to school and community library Children's Literature anthology collections."
1,CUT IT UP DEF IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.
1,Paperweight I purchase this for a friend who is a big fan of super girl she was really impress with the details lived it
1,"Excellent idea, went over perfectly at Christmas This gift for my brother at Christmas got more attention than any others. My sister and I hid upstairs for a good 20 minutes trying to get it together, which for us was fun. ""No, that doesn't look like the box. Let me try."" ""Maybe the German instructions make more sense"" (neither of us read German).Our time was well-spent: my brother and his girlfriend admired the appearance, loved the caddy, until my brother became suspicious and announced ""I think it's locked in"". As my sister and I sat smug, several people gave it a try, and we heard a resounding chorus of ""I know some people who absolutely must have this."""
1,"Imagine a cross between Tom Clancy and Tom McGuane A simple premise ... a wealthy American businessman's only granddaugter dies of a cocaine overdose. He decides that he's going to kill everyone who had anything to do with it, starting with her boyfriend and ending with the head of the Columbian drug cartel. Along the way yachts are wrecked and burned, secret love affairs are revealed, priests are consulted, and plenty of smartass dialogue is emitted. Buckley obviously knows what really rich people are really like, and in addition to having a great plot and memorable charactes, it's full of consistently interesting observations. A good book"
1,"Another Fine Parsifal Recording There are many very fine recordings of Parsifal in the catalog. In fact, it's difficult to find a poor performance. The highlight of this production is the magisterial Gurnemanz of Kurt Moll--possibly the best rendition ever. He is ablely supported by the poet of the baton Rafael Kubelik and a virile James King as Parsifal, also possibly his best recorded role ever. The recording has a wide and deep sound stage with excellent sonics. I enjoyed listening to this excellent studio rendition. Wagnerian singing of the highest standards.This recording is near the top of my favorite stereo studio editions along with Karajan's also fine rendition on DG recorded the same year as this one(1980). For the historically minded, I would recommend Krauss's 1953 Bayreuth live air check or Knappertsbusch's 1951 Bayreuth live recording on Decca. Karajan's live Vienna aircheck from 1961 on RCA is also interesting, but sounds older than the earlier recommendations."
1,"First alert plug in Carbon Monoxide Alarm I was very pleased with my first alert plug in Carbon Monoxide Alarm. I like it because it is not that noticeable. It's not an ugly plug in and I like that. We received it in the time that they said it would be delivered and I would not hesitate to order again from Amazon. We have ordered many, many things from Amazon and have never been disappointed with their service.Thank you,Mary Lou Pantuso"
1,"Easy to use, trusted After opening the package, I simply plugged this in to a wall socket (making sure that it is not near a heating source, gas, moving air, dust or sunlight). I tested it, the alarm rang loud and clear. A red light lets me know that it is functional.I feel better having it in my house."
1,"Easy Easy to install, just find an outlet in center of home. Product is made by first alert too which gives me confidence in operation."
1,very good product Great product. i gave this product to my son and i feel much better that he and his family are safer from carbon monoxide. thanks.
1,"No Brainer! I chose this alarm because it was the easiest to use. Just plug it in and that's it. I have a gas fireplace and was told that I needed a carbon monoxide detector. Plugged into a regular outlet, it has a dim light to let you know that it's working and you can test the monitor at any time to make sure it's ""alarmed."" Hopefully, I'll never have to see how well the monitor works in an emergency but I feel safer knowing that I have one."

1,"High quality and so cute! We love this set -- we used it for our daughter, and now we're using it for our son. Sumersault is rated highly by Baby Bargains, and this set is well worth the money. It's held up really well for us over almost three years. FYI, it goes well with the Pottery Barn ""classic stars"" rug in blue."
1,"Strait as an arrow Great product, good price, I have shot them several times and never had anything go wrong. I did robin hood one of them but that was my fault."
1,"Wonderful Ideas I found this book to be extremely useful. The techniques were all new to me. The one that I am going to try first is the wax resist. I am a little worried about the other techniques that use solvents - I don't know where to buy them, and I don't want anything unnatural that is going to hurt my body. Overall, this is a lovely book. One department that does need a little bit of expansion is making the journal itself. However, I already have a blank journal that I bought from a bookstore beginning with Bor (they offer great blank journals CHEAP) and I am just going to use the techniques. Cheers!!"
1,great fun for the whole family I have loved Lewis and Martin since I was a child and now I share the fun with my children. My 5 year old loves the hilarious stunts Lewis does and the soda machine scene must be rewound and played over and over. He has tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. I highly recommend for the family.
1,"Provides excellent knowledge about Tibetan Medicine ITem was shipped new and arrived in excellent condition. DVD provides a beginning knowledge about the almost lost art regarding Tibetan Medicine. As indicated in the DVD, there are very few doctors that still retain this knowledge and practice. Excellent overview but it is all in subtitles and obtaining any of the medicines/herbs seems as though it would be difficult. They take a wholistic approach and specialize the medicines for the person. You would need to go to India to get a diagnosis regarding your condition. Too bad it is not closer."
1,"Just when you thought it couldn't get any better in Xanth Now look, I know Piers Anthony is a great author. I've read his Incarnation of Immortality series, all the Xanth books, the Mode books, and the Apprentice Adept series. But this, I have to say, is the best of the bunch. What do you get when you cross a young black Mundane with a magical talent, a 130 year old man who was transformed into a tree, three kings, and a mess of zombies? Believe it or not, one of the best surprises to come into Xanth in years, thanks to the devious plotting of Good Magician Humphrey, Clio the Muse, and everybody's favorite elf, Jenny of the World of Two Moons. For all of us raised on fairy tales, this one beats them all."
1,"The most complex yet potentially important yet! I have just finished this novel, and must say that it is very complex, yet sets up countless options for the future of Xanth! This book is a story of love, hate, prejudice, potential adultery, and a complete denial and rejection of the Adult Conspiracy! If you love the Xanth novels, you MUST read this book!"
1,"The answers to a serious, life threatening disease I have a friend who has a family history of this disease. He wanted the most current information so I ordered it for him and he found it very valuable.Doc"
1,"New Mexico meets Iraq I have very little to add to these semi-enlighted reviews (above).However, of all his albums, I prefer the immediacy and dialogue here between these masters of string & percussion.We're blessed here in Land of Enchantment to have Alhaj in our midst, and on Music faculty of state university, UNM. It's a secret, but he also has a delicious sense of humor..."
1,"I've told half the women I know about this one! There are very few books that I recommend to other readers, because I assume that everyone has their own tastes and their interests -- especially in the area of ""self-help."" But, this book covers such a far reaching subject, and I think just about every woman I know could benefit from it. This woman talks about body image in regards to sex, dressing, jobs, long term success, even friendships.It really is inspirational, and it changed the way I looked at my waist, hips, thighs, butt, you name it!"
1,Required for Art class Drawing Textbook by Bruce McIntyre is required for an art class I'm in. I like how it laid out and easy to follow away from class. I love that I was able to find it on amazon.com so I could get my own copy. It helps that I don't have to try to follow along with several others at the same time.
1,Alaskan Beauty This book was more than I expected...the pictures are lovely - really makes you want to visit Alaska but if you can't you can certainly enjoy this book.....
1,Fantastic Account of The Soviet Union Highly recommended. This book not only gives a stunning history of the Soviet Union but also a much more personal account of the people who live there. This is truly a must read for anyone interested in Russia and the problems it faces today
1,"IT'S A KNOCKOUT !! Mr. Remnick has given us a masterwork. He seamlessly meshes intimate portraits of Soviet citizens within the larger landscape of the last days of the Soviet Empire. He has a rare ability to blend the micro and the macro in a soul-stirring narrative. This is a profound work that is filled with compelling stories. Lenin's Tomb is so superb that even those who avoid ""history books"" will relish it. Could not more highly recommend this book. The scads of glowing reviews below are all well deserved."
1,"A respectable work of history This is a very revealing and perhaps most revealing account of the last days of the Soviet Union put forth in a concise manner for the reader. It is smooth flowing, vivid in its descriptions and captured the mood at the time in such an authentic way. The reliance on interviews gives a lot of credibility to the narration and the portrayal of the character in the the situations they found themselves in. The society as a whole is bared for he reader to understand and the system's shortcomings are exposed. I read The Union Muzhik the other day and from it, understand the hopes of Perestroika and Glasnost that the demise of the Soviet Union failed to bring to the people."
1,"Huge, high-quality binder I bought this binder to hold a 700+ page anatomy book that was published unbound, and it probably could have held at least two books that size. It's huge. The pockets, D-rings, and opening mechanism are all top quality.When measuring how much space you'll need for this binder in your bookshelf, backpack, etc., remember that the rings themselves are four inches, so the binder is even wider, close to five inches. The side of the binder with the rings will non-negotiably need that much room."
1,"Same dependable Avery quality I keep all of my equipment manuals and owners' guides in these, and needed to add a volume. The others were bought in 2005, so I was worried that I might not be able to get the same durable quality. I worried needlessly. These are up to the usual Avery standards."
1,Bat Girl with Flare This Costume was just as it says. Was a great buy. The material was stretchy so it moved easily with my active child. No complaints.
1,"Pink Child Batgirl Costume Hello,This pink batgirl costume is the best and so perfect for this halloween! It's made well and the topic in kindergarten this past week has been all about bats!!! Daughter cannot wait to wear it and decided to become batgirl since she's already been a princess and ballerina before.Sandra M."
1,Awesome Costume This is a great costume. All the extra pieces make it really great. This is one of our favorite costumes.
1,SEAL TEAM TWO Nice work. Full disclosure. Some of these guys were drinking buddies when I worked in Norfolk . I produced the first TV documentary on SEALS
1,"Sturdy, stylish rod This is a great rod if you need if for a little space. It is stylish while being sturdy. The accents on the end bring out more charater than other plain rods. Had a strong resistance so it stays up on the walls. Holds a material curtain as well as a liner and hasen't budged. Love this rod and would buy again."
1,wonderful The DVD's are a great addition and compliment to the book. This would be wonderful for any cook from novice to expert.
1,"Anything Julia... This is one of three videos that comprise the show- about 8 episodes each to total approx. 24 episodes. I don't know how many were in the original show, so I can't say what percentage of it is on tape here. Reading the back covers, I don't see Martha Stewart's wedding cake presentation, although it was in the original show and that was great just by itself. It is really interesting to watch, and her guest chefs go slow enough to be able to reproduce what they are doing. It's good to have the companion book nearby by Dorie Greenspan, as well, so it's written down for you and you can focus on technique. More recipes in the book than on this DVD."
1,"Very nice design It's light, compact, and stable, easy to slip into a shirt pocket, and easy to use. It's great for fairly flat surfaces. From reading descriptions, the gorilla tripod (I think that's the name), while bulkier, is more versatile, since it can adjust for uneven surfaces and wrap around poles etc, but I haven't tried it."
1,"Good Product The material was nice and clean, no rust and flat. Drills nicely and was easy to work with.Highly recommend."
1,"Great Update! As with his first book, this book has more great information for me as a Type 2 Diabetic. Although my wife is not diabetic, we love ALL the recipe's in both books. They have kept my blood sugar in total control and are delicious! Thanks Dr. Bernstein!"
1,"The Solution: Properly Titled Of the 3 books on this subject by Dr. Bernstein that I have read including his suggested recipes, this is the most detailled and informative. I started practicing what Dr. Bernstein preaches and while it is indeed, difficult at first-especially when you look to revamp your food choices that were learned over your lifetime. After a week, the cravings tend to disappear and I am seeing my sugars come down and I lost 3 lbs. This is just one battle, but if these results keep up, I see this investment into Dr. Bernstein's program is a small price to pay for nutritional and healthy control."
1,"The Type 2 Diabetes Answer. Of the five books that I've read on diabetes, this is the one that has all the answers. I've been on Dr. Bernsteins blood sugar normalization and weight loss program for 6 weeks and have lost 21 pounds, with no craving for carbohydrates!! The program works because the author(a Type 1 diabetic)hasworked out all the answers from personal experience."
1,"Excellent mugs, my guests all agree I have had 12 of these 16 oz. mugs for some time now and think they are the best. Have had no chips, but am careful that no glasses touch other items in my dishwasher. I have given these for gifts and the recipients have asked for more of them for xmas next year. Thanks for an excellent product."
1,"As good as the guy's new book on Horatio Nelson. I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor's. It is also as good as Hayward's new book on Admiral Nelson. Both get my high praise. Scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between, so make the most of this guy's work."
1,"impressive book on a ghastly battle I enjoyed this book very much. I got it as a gift and have now brought a copy to give to someone else. It is very, very thorough, which makes it ideal for academics, but it is also easy for enthusiasts like me to understand and get absorbed in. And I did. Even though I naturally knew how the Stalingrad battle ended I still felt gripped by the dreadful story as it unfolded. Mr Hayward managed to make the events understable and the characters believable. I felt their frustration and their pain and their growing feelings of failure and terrible disappointment. This book goes well alongside Beavor's equally important study of the battle. Stalingrad enthusiasts simply MUST own copies of both, especially as Hayward's is the first to explain air operations (and brilliantly) and Beavor's is the first to look at the fate of the ordinary soldiers from both sides."
1,"A well written and informative book I read this book as part of a study I am doing into war on the Eastern Front.I found the book to be excellently researched and well written. For those who are interested in military history and in particular German Military history, I would say it's a must on any good bookshelf"
1,"I'm keen on Luftwaffe books and this is amongst the best. I agree with what esteemed Professor Richard Overy said in his review of this book: ""This is a model of its kind, which ought to set an agenda for the reconstruction of the air narrative in this and other theatres in the greatest of wars."" But I will go further; this book isn't only or even mainly a narrative. It's a powerfully strong piece of operational-level analysis. It is written in a lively and captivating way, which makes the density of analysis easy to cope with. I rate this work very highly."
1,"AN EXCEPTIONAL WORK This volume is a major contribution to the history of the Luftwaffe during the Russo-Germano war. ""Stopped at Stalingrad"" is also a richly drawn study of the most important air campaigns in the Eastern Front. Written in an accessible style this volume will be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the WWII. I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and also the quality of its contents. The author did a masterful job of research. Joel Hayward draws on diaries of both key commanders and regular airmen. He also shows that the poorly conceived strategies of Hitler and his buffoon, Goering, dommed the efforts of men such von Manstein, Milch and Wolfram von Richthofen (an outstanding soldier) to come to grips with an impossible situation. I heartily recommended this book."
1,"Fun Learning to Dance After receiving both of the Librero's tapes (The Big Band Swing and The Latin and Argentine Tango) as a gift, my husband and I cannot believe how easy it has been to learn to dance from them. Neither of us were dancers and Blanche and Emilio have made it fun and very simple for us to learn. Now we can dance all of the dances that we always wanted to, plus have a good time practicing with our friends. We also enjoy the music CDs that were part of the package, as well as the cue cards."
1,"Great for Beginners! I am an intermediate dancer in some dances, and a beginner in others. I found the Librero's Dance Series (both the Big Band and Latin) very helpful in providing and overall understanding of the similarities and differences of all the popular dances. Their Argentine Tango section would be specially good for beginners. Most videos I have seen on this dance can be frustrating and overwhelming. The music CD is not very inspiring but the tempos are very good for practice and it is convenient. I definitely recommend the Librero's Series, particularly for the Beginner dancer."
1,"The best series available for parents I buy Wiley's guide every year and always find her to be right on the money when it comes to rating the rides, recommending hotels, and giving tips on extras like how and where to meet the characters. What separates this book from the other Disney guides is that it's realistic....the unoffical guide lays out a itinerary that would kill anyone with kids and the official guide is all sugary and light, never telling you how to handle the crowds and the heat and all the other things that are just a factor when you're at Disney World. Wiley hits the middle ground - she's positive and obviously knows (and loves) her stuff but she'll also give you the facts."
1,"excellent I bought the 1999 version and am about to order the newest edition. I had not been to Disney World in 12 years so I had no idea on what to do and where do go. The book was right on about every detail. I especially like the ride advice for little ones and the hotel recommendations. If you are planning a trip, buy this book first!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Geography Book arrived in good contition as described and in the time indicated. Very happy with the service. I would use them again.
1,"fantastic This is a wonderful book with bright cute illustrations and a good story. We got one with stickers for Christmas, it was a nice bonus. My son read it 250+ times in the past few years, he is growing up but the book never gets old or boring :o) thank you"
1,"Great Seller This 3 package DVD arrived in perfect condition and rather quickly. Had no problems with this seller, very pleased. Always would recommend you to buy from this seller."
1,"Excellect Value and Fast Service When I am in need of a product I spend a lot of time doing research. Not only are the costs of the product and shipping/handling charges important but also the speed, accuracy and dependability of the company/person involved. I highly recommend this source to be checked out when searching for specific products."
1,Spider-Man Trilogy Received promptly - unfortunately I ordered the blu-ray and this is not what my son-in-law wanted. I trust the return will be equally easy.
1,"I imagine it's good I bought this as a gift for a kid who's a Spider Man fan. He really enjoys it, but I'm not a super hero fan myself."
1,Great buy! This was exactly what I was looking for. I have the trilogy on Blu-Ray but my son is a huge spider-man fan and only has a dvd player in his room so as I gift I wanted to get this for him so he would be able to watch it whenever he wanted.
1,"Wish I could get it locally The one supermarket chain in our area that carries Quaker Essentials Oat Bran cereal closed our local store. We can get it by driving around 60 miles round trip, but that is inconvenient and wasteful of gas.I could substitute another cereal for myself, but my peach-faced lovebird loves it, and so far will accept no substitute. She eats some, and dunks some in her water bowl, then piles it on a perch. The result is a ""cereal sculpture."" Why she does this, I don't know.I ordered it through an Amazon vendor and received excellent service, but I wish the shipping wasn't so darn expensive."
1,"How a religion is Born! This was an excellent historical work on modern Pagan Witchcraft. It does tend to focus on Wicca, but it does also talk about Druids, and non-Gardnarian Traditions. If you know nothing about Wicca, I recomend you start with another book, or the very last chapter serves as an excelent summary of what Wiccans belive, and though it seams weird to suggest it, you might want to read the last chapter first. Although the author is a historian and not a Pagan or a Witch, he remains respectful in his historical endevor. This book is an excelent example of how a new religion is born, and perhapse the only such history of the birth of a new faith to exist!"
1,"Review of Triumph of the Moon I have not finished reading the book. I have, however, found it hard to put down. It was engaging, comprehensive and enjoyable to read. I heard this book recommended by sales people in my city Halifax.It is without a doubt informative and accurate in the history of Witchcraft. I know it was preferred over other books on the history of Witchcraft."
1,"Worked just like it was supposed to This product worked exactly as it was supposed to. I had tried using the cable that came with the camera (USB cord) and found out exactly what many others had said on blogs.....IT DOESN'T WORK!!!Once I got this cable, it worked perfectly. I was able to easily download video from my camera to my computer. The only frustration I had was that I would rather have paid a little more for the camera and gotten this cable with it in the first place."
1,"Awesome glasses, would buy again. Very fast shipping and excellent transaction with Amazon. Couldn't be happier with these glasses, had them five years now and they are still wonderful."
1,"A defining book. This book would be effective for grief therapy and for teaching about life cycles. It specifically answers the question: What is a lifetime?My daughter, age 4, had a lot of questions about death. She was most especially interested in finding out when her ""dying day"" would be. This book seemed to help her understand that everyone's lifetime is special to them. I wanted her to understand that because someone else died it doesn't mean her death is imminent. A common fear among the young.An exquisitely illustrated and plainly written book, it speaks clearly to the children about a complicated subject. I highly recommend it for all home and school libraries for ages three and up. It should be used as part of a comprehensive set of books on biological and familial concepts as it is not meant to answer all of a child's questions on life cycles, grief, death or dying."
1,"PSI stilll rocks I eagerly anticipated the release of this album, knowing whatever came out of it would be excellent. Musically, it was a dramatic change when compared to other albums such as pitchshifter.com, or infotainment? I like the somewhat mellow approach to many songs, but dont get discouraged, they still have the heavier stuff like ""keep it clean,"" ""dead battery,"" and ""wafer thin."" (my personal favorites) They just keep getting better and better after every release. people complain that they are going mainstream, they change for the times, and what not. At first they resembled one of my favorite bands, ministry, but look at them now, they have stepped away from that, and now have their own unique blend of techno, rock, industrial. they are on a plain all by themselves. lyrically and musically, they cannot be outdone by any rock, or industrial band out at the time. This album is their best to date. PSI ROCKS"
1,Exceeded Expectaitions! The CD was exactly what I was looking for. It arrived early. It was in pristine condition. I'm very thankful that I found this vendor as this was a very rare CD. I will use this vendor again.
1,"Another RA Gem! For those of you that read my review for ""From One,"" pretty much what I said in that review is a repeat. This is an excellent CD, though toned down ""From One,"" it still rocks. You can't go wrong with ordering BOTH at the same time (that's what I did). BTW, I think RA does ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"" BETTER than Police originally did it!!! ;^)"
1,"I don't know what is everyone so disappointed about This was my first LJS book, recommended by a friend, who is a book critic. I was hooked on LJS books ever since. I have read every one of her books and have found them excellent."
1,Underrated This book is the ultimate revenge story. Sure Gillian is superficial but shes had a rough life and deserves to have her chance to shine in the spotlight. And all those readers who do not feel it fit in with the Night World must not have been very observant cuz her place in the Night World was hinted at quite a lot. And she does go to a witches store and she also trys to get in the black iris club once...besides it would be to formulaic if each book was wrapped tightly inside the Night World...each books show different levels of impact the Night World has...plus like all the nightworld books...this deals with a certain kinda topic...Secret Vampire was a girl who was dying and needed to be changed to live...soulmate covered reicarnation and this book delt with a near life experience. Its not the best of the series but its high up there on my list at least.
1,Heavenly Music This is by far the most beautiful CD I have ever listened to. I love it so much I have given it as a gift to family friends and they all love it as much as I do and it has quickly become everyone's favorite. It is truly music to adore and nourish your sprite and soul. Aeoliah is a genius - I give this music my highest recommendation.
1,"Outstanding UFO book Having read at least 50 books on UFOs and related phenomena, ""The Mothman Prophecies"" has become one of my favorites along with those of Jacques Vallee. This classic is a must read and reaches the unpopular but most likely true conclusion that UFOs aren't from outer space but are psychic in nature."
1,"This book is a classic! I read it first in the 60's and have never forgotten it. I was pleased when it was reprinted as I had wanted to read it again. It holds up surprisingly well. Keel had realized things about the 'UFO phenomena' then that most other researchers are only now beginning to understand. If you have a sense of wonder, get it. If you are a researcher, get it. If you are an open minded skeptic, this will give you a better perspective. If you're just looking for entertainment, it's a lot of fun."
1,"Very comfortable Beautifully made and perfect for restorative yoga. I couldn't be happier. I own several other products from Hugger Mugger and always choose their product when available for bolsters, meditation cushions, etc."
1,"Buy it. She is a genius, has a lot to say, it's worth hearing, and this hard-to-categorize music absolutely grows on you and becomes your favorite album for weeks once it sinks in. Sound is fun, too, considering lots of toy instruments are used here, and there are a number of producers.M.I.A. is relevant, interesting and makes you pay attention.Buy this album."
1,Worth the Buy You can't help but respect the creativity poring out of this album. This was M.I.A.'s debut & the reason why so many love her. I love this album & it hasn't left the car in weeks.
1,"Awesomely Different This is something my ears crave; uniqueness. This album has what you need to get loose. With it's wild beats and crazy lyrics, it'll keep you dancing (and in my case, running as well. Good workout music). M.I.A.'s music is not conventional. My guess is, most people either love it or hate it. Enjoy, it's a treat!1. Banana Skit2. Pull Up The People 8/103. Bucky Done Gun 10/10 (My fav. A true dance track. On point)4. Fire Fire 9/105. Freedom Skit6. Amazon 10/107. Bingo 6.5/108. Hombre 7.5/109. One For The Head Skit10. 10 $ 9/10 (The beat is sick! Robotic, lol)11. Sunshowers 10/10 (My 2nd fav. Gives me a real island vibe)12. Galang 9/10"
1,"Take this simple test If you can listen to this album - any track on this album - for more than 4 or at most 5 seconds and (1) stay still (2) keep it clean and PG13, my condolences to your family, alas, you are dead. You can expect to be receiving the memo shortly."
1,"Love It! Who is M.I.A. and what has she done to the art of music?! The London-raised Sri Lankan MC has mixed up all possible forms of music to give us something that we can't define. You can't put a label on her sound; you can only identify her inspiration. With a combination of Jamaican dance hall, hip-hop, electronica, Brazilian funk, and Asian bhangra, her style is different from anything we're used to; it's addictive and fun. Her lyrics are filled with passion about life and society. She gets political and sexual all in the same song! Who does that? Maya Arulpragasam does... just listen to Bucky Done Gun off her debut album Arular to get a feel of her artistic flair."
1,"Wha can I get for ten dollah? Anyting you want! Definitely spend a couple of bucks more & get this. Maya Arular is one of the few hip-hop sensations who deserves all the hype. Phrases like ""raw talent"" are often used, but what also impress are the musical sophistication and biting wit. This is a hugely appealing sex-war-and-lollipops album, and fears that non-British audiences ""won't get it"" seem to have been unfounded judging by the sales. Exuberant and bursting with energy."
1,"this girl can spit! i first heard the track bingo on the radio not long ago, and that has now opened a whole can of worms for me. how can one album be so catchy, raw, fun,fresh ,chunky and funky. while so many rappers drawl on about tired blah blah, MIA just mixes the singing and ragga-ish vocals straight into the most modern type of no-category music with little effort. the style? its kind of UK grime meets hip-hop meets calypso or something. definately a british vibe here, but this is still unique. the beats and sound effects are very well implemented into the chatting. cant stop listening to this. wicked stuff"
1,"His Best? Well it so hard to pick a favorite Kundrea book because they are all so Brilliant, but I might pick this one."
1,"The Three Ds I've read the poems within, and the depth of feeling within them is impressive. What's more, the honesty in the poems is a breath of fresh air that has brought a new perspective to a lot of the ways I see things, partcularly loss and betrayal, as well as hope. Reading this book, I feel as if I truly know the poet behind the words."
1,"A wish to time travel to 1880's Rockaway. Old Rockaway, New York in Early Photographs, exceeded my expectations! I thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the 1930's and 1940's. I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960's and 70's, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930's."
1,"Lyricist, singer, and more!!!!!!! Bernie is one of the best lyricists out there!!! His vocal performance on this cd and ""Tribe"" show that he is not just a lyric writer, but also someone who loves music. His passion for music has continued on to the formation of the band ""Farmdogs"".I have a question, however. The previous reviews state that this is either Bernie's second or third solo album. What were his first attempts?Please let me know at: Robin@moonsitter.comThank you!!!!"
1,"One great album! I bought this album because I got into bands like Theatre of Tragedy, Tristania, and The Gathering. Like someone else said, however, Nightwish is not doom/goth metal. Was I dissapointed?...no! This album is a masterpiece, pure metal all the way. Power metal with a female opera singer? I can't think of two things which go together any better. It is a wonder that it hasn't been done before. The songwriting is very good, and definitely laden with fantasy. The production is excellent as well. Then there is the amazing singer. I was captivated after hearing her for a mere ten seconds. Nightwish is one band that SHOULD NOT be overlooked!"
1,"The Greatest Band To Ever grace my ears Nightwish Rules! The Music is spine tingling and melodic while powerful. Everything I thought I knew About Music has changed forever. As a long Time fan of Savatage, and other prog-metal bands.. Nightwish has become my favorite. I can play their music over and over... I never thought I would enjoy Opera but her voice seems to be meant for it...like we never should have had to listen to it any other way. The world is full of tasteless crap like eminem, and god please can we forget the boybands and all the other put together mindless gatbage we are smacked with by local radio. NIGHTWISH Thank you for the wonderful barrage of sound you have given to me. I still love my other-prog metal bands but Nightwish has something for everyone who enjoys ""TRUE"" Music. Death to the false ones! LOL"
1,"The perfect formula still to be copied Nightwish works so near perfection! None of the other similar bands (Lacuna Coil, Sinergy, Stratovarius, Angra...) even approach this. No, Therion approaches. Many people tend to compare Nightwish to doom/goth metal bands such as Theatre Of Tragedy, Tristania and Sins Of Thy Beloved. Please, Nightwish is not doom/goth metal, it's clearly high level POWER METAL! Fast versatile guitar riffs, poignant ballads and above all, intense female vocals. Wishmaster's most touching moment is the gentle ""Two For Tragedy"", when Tarja's passionate lament reaches the soul of the listener. Other highlights are the fast ""Wanderlust"" and ""Crownless"". The last song, ""FantasMic"", is divided in three parts and is also very touching. Wishmaster and its predecessor Oceanborn are without a doubt essential albums for any metal listener..."
1,"Nightwish is unique and rocks for eva Moi to you all,Nightwish est vraiment le plus cool des bands. Unqiue pis des tounes supers orginales, ca ma faite dÃ©couvrir le mÃ©tal pis aucune autre band ma faite vribrer comme eux. Ã€ tous le monde cest un must buy."
1,"Why just 4 stars? Un album tout simplement renversant, extraordinaire, sensationnelle. Il est excellent sur toute la ligne avec une voix si bien cadrÃ©, si bien mis en evidence devenant la suite de se qu'ils avaient commencer avec Oceanborn, il revienne a la charge avec une disque presque aussi parfait. Un album tout comme le deuxieme, remplis de rebondissement, remplis de moment intense et de moment plus romantique avec Dead Boy's Poem qui est sans aucun doute la meilleur toute qu'ils ont faites. Souvent comparer a Dream Theater pour leur beat de piano, d'instrument progressif, ils ont sus selon moi allez une coche au dessus et nous offrir quelque chose d'encore superieur au membre de Dream Theater... En bref, il s'agit d'un CD dispendieux, mais combien il en vaut la peine, il est merveilleux et chaqu'un se doit de connaitre se magnifique groupe Allemand."
1,"Welch Allen Suretemp Plus 690 Thermometer Finally got fed up with all small digital thermometers, none of which seem to be reliable, or require a full 3-4 minutes to be accurate, which is an aggravating long time for the (OB) patient. I LOVE this ""machine"", it is accurate and well worth the expense !"
1,"Great thermometer, long-lasting We do home care for my dad and have to take his rectal temperature every 2 hours when we turn and re-position him. We have had the same Welch-Allyn Sure Temp 690 thermometer for 4 1/2 years now. We just replaced the well and probe a few months ago. The casing finally cracked after all of this time. We have only had to change the batteries twice, too. It is still working perfectly and we would recommend this thermometer to anyone who really needs to take temperatures often. It is so reliable. This one gets 5 stars!!!!!"
1,A Great Documentary this documentary tells you the relationship of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddle. and also tells how alice in wonderland was created. this was a very intersting documentary. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
1,"Beethoven, Motzart, Sanford Townsend Band ........ Thats how music history books should be written, it was 1977, I first heard this album on a verandah overlooking the Indian Ocean in Perth Western Australia on a hot breezy Saturday evening watching the sun setting over the whitetops ..... WOW, what a old flashback that is, party goin on inside, my Triumph under the balcony, I got up, grabbed the keys, and went for a blast, that song has been a permanant source of pleasure in my old head for decades now .... mist in your eyes from the smoke of a distant fire.... da da da da ada, sounds even better with the exhaust note of a 750 Bonnie ... da da da da"
1,The Witches' God by Janet and Stewart Farrar This is a really good book for people that are studying the gods. I truely enjoyed this book. It was very informative.
1,The best book on Pagan Gods All too often the Pagan God is forgotten in favor of the Goddess. This book will bring the balance back to our lives. It gives the history of many well know Gods as well as many not so well known Ones. It also includes rituals in direct relation to the Gods listed. I love this book! It goes well with The Witches' Goddess!
1,"Beautiful Submission What struck me the most all throughout the reading of ""Beauty and submission"" is the power and bravery behind Maria Pita's prose. She is undoubtedly a wise old soul. Yet, in the same instance, her no-holds-barred honesty about the lifestyle and personal odyssey with her beloved Dom has a youthful innocence that refreshes and renews like rain in the springtime. Love is new, and forever renewed, by each other. Life obstacles faced by most vanilla lovers face are present along with the countless obstacles any alternative lifestyle will bring. Every such mountain is a challenge scaled with intelligent and triumphant results. Missa's enormous heart, and huge capacity to love and submit to her man in the purest sense, will stay with me (and I'm sure all her readers) long after this book is closed. This real life romance makes fictional renditions pale in comparison."
1,"St. Rose of Lima: the First Canonized Saint in the Americas Excellent read, for children or for any age; also for adults who want to get to know Saint Rose of Lima."
1,"Wonderful app I love reading Essence magazine, I am happy I can now read it on my kindle fire. I recommend this"
1,"Delivered As Promised I LOVE Essence and I am quite pleased with the delivery and maintence by Amazon, I receive it like clockwork each month!"
1,Koontz is always good this book is very good as I have come to expect of Dean KoontzI've been reading his books as long as he has been writing them and am never disappointedI wish the 3rd book was coming sooner but i'll take it when I can get it
1,"Best yet! I have always been a fan of Dean Koontz's books and when my flight was grounded and I was to spend the night in the airport, I figured I'd better get myself a book to keep me entertained. That's exactly what this book did. I enjoyed reading it so much that I almost missed my connecting flight back home because I didn't want to put the book down.It's unique, fresh and fast paced. If you enjoyed the original Frankenstein story, you will adore this ""updated"" and more complete modern version. You will not be disappointed!"
1,"Not into monsters...unless Koontz is The Creator One has suggested the Decaulion character lacked depth. Another has hinted that the ending lacked surprise (must have been reading a different book). Remember two things: Koontz wrote it, and it's Book One. We will get into the mystery of the original ""monster"" (Decaulion) and we readers will find many surprises and twists as the story continues to unfold.That being said, I loooooved this book. This is a fun, intriguing look at the evil Doc Frankenstein, who was certainly a monster before chopping his own body up to become yet more so. Dr. F., impervious to aging and disease after 200 years, has been a busy bee, building and perfecting more monsters. But things are starting to go terribly wrong for New Orleans and for the Doctor we love to hate.Read it, you'll love it."
1,"Koontz is getting even better over time. This is a wonderful twist on the classic. The characters are very well rounded and I was grabbed from the beginning. I now and then ponder how the biologically impossible events in the book could actually be brewing in someones own lab at this very moment. Mr. Koontz takes today's traditional underdog and makes him not someone to pity but someone to perhaps admire. My only negative on the book is that I am hooked and will make sure I quickly purchase the next in the series.If you like seeing the dark side of life let in a little light, you will undoubtedly become a Koontz addict as have I. Don't plan on doing anything else until you finish this one.I also highly recommend THE FACE. Another dark side trying to usurp the light. Excellent, excellent, excellent books."
1,"Koontz's BEST book I have to admitt that I am not as big a book reader as I used to be. However, when I saw this book in the store I couldn't resist.The idea of making a remake of the classic book was exciting and possibly to like the original. Let me tell you upfront that this book was GREAT!!!! It is the fastest I've ever read a book (4 days); I could not put it down. This book is very direct in the plot, and easy to follow the chapter changes. Koontz writes the characters in a way that you can truely understand exactly what they're feeling, and you can sympathize with even the dubious villians. I hope you take the time to read this book, IT IS WORTH IT!!!!!!!PS- The next part to this book is set to be released in July 2005 :)"
1,"Dean Koontz's Frankenstein I have loved Dean Koontz for years but his books of late have gotten away from the reason I fell in love with his stories... All I can say is HE'S BACK! I can't wait for the 2nd book!! I could not put this down,it made me breathless the whole way through!"
1,"Forget Mary Shelly Well actually, no. Of course not. Nothing can top the original. But Koontz comes at this classic tale with his own scythe ready to cause a change of faith in the fans of the original. This is not so much a remake as a supplement to the classic tale. Koontz references the story we all now and simply fast-forwards to our time, keeping the original Victor and his monster, and giving them longevity.The prose is ellegant and the speed is neck-breaking. It appears that Mr. Koontz uses 'big' words and paints detailed scenarios that may intimidate some readers, but I challenge you to read his work out loud - you'll see how nicely the words roll off your tongue."
1,A better Dean Koontz I've always liked Dean Koontz. This one however is different from his others. It is still a fast read; I found hard to put down. I have already ordered the second and have started on it. This is one saga I won't want to end.
1,book This is a gift for Christmas. I'm sure they will enjoy it. Had a hard time finding these books. Thanks
1,"Great Camcorder Excellent camcorder, does very well in all kinds of light. I have had no trouble with it indoors, and I find that it performs very well in low light. Flawlessly performs with Windows Movie Maker 2 through firewire. The sound is outstanding, considering the picture is it's strong point. I did not need the digital camera built in as I already have one. Effects are fun to play around with, especially with the handy scroll button. I have not heard the motor noise at all, so I can't see where that is coming from. My only complaint is that it shuts off too quickly if inactive, but it's really not that much of a problem. Image stablizer works really well, as I often have an unsteady hand but it is hardly noticeable with this camcorder. I just wish they made a VCR that could record the footage as well as it was taped!"
1,"Great Music, and A Lot of It, At A Great Price This disc contains Ornette Coleman's pioneering 37-minute 'Free Jazz' PLUS 40 minutes of shorter pieces recorded in the same year. So for a little less money than the American release of 'Free Jazz' you get about twice as much music, and the title track is the final piece, a fitting climax to a great set of music. That said, the jazz on this disc may be more challenging than some listeners would like, but among the extended collective improvisations of the sixties, besides being the first, this one is more immediately accessible, because it SWINGS and it COOKS! And you can tell the musicians are actively listening to each other and responding to each other's work, not just showing off or venting their emotions. So in a nutshell, 'Free Jazz' is less cosmic than Sun Ra's 'Magic City', less cerebral than Cecil Taylor, and less primal than Coltrane's 'Ascension', but probably more likely to hook you into an intensely brilliant musical world."
1,"Different isn't always good--sometimes it's better I'm a commercial pilot and flight instructor. I read many aviation related books and magazines. I don't often read books that contain a lot of poetry, which AIR FARE does.(It also has short stories and excerpts from longer works.) So to say I was pleasantly surprised by this little wonder of a book is an understatement.My advice? If you've never flown but wonder what it's like, you should read this book. If you have flown as a passenger, you'll recognize your own emotions, both good and bad, in every page. If you are a pilot, you'll see yourself reflected in myriad indelible images; you'll be drawn back by memory to a hundred different experiences; and you'll want to read-and reread-each and every privileged glimpse into the human heart of flight, and be left wanting more. It's a must-have for any aviator's library. Get it!"
1,"Give a copy to your teenage children! Read this book as soon as possible. It is so jam filled (malaprop intended) with wisdom and knowledge and so well written with passion and power. Give a copy to each of your teenage children, nieces and nephews! They need this stuff at as young an age as possible.And once you've read it, you must readYour Own Worst Enemy: Breaking the Habit of Adult Underachievementwhich gets down to the nitty gritty of breaking the bad habits that gifted people edge into because of their own gifted pride."
1,A fine novel about a forgotten time Houston exaggerates for effect--not all of the historical characters that he uses were actually at Bisbee. But how could anyone resist using the bigger-than-life leaders of the IWW?
1,Works Great! The shorter length of this rod is exactly what we needed for our shower. Tension rods in this length are difficult to find and we were glad to buy this one. Great product.
1,Recommend for young musicians This is a great book for young musicians for inspiration. It tells a brief story in an easy to read format for each musician for a variety of instruments. Good for those who have the potential to go professional.
1,"Delightful - Magic and Romance Ghosts, Time Travel, Fairies, Magic and Scotland figure in this delightful story. I liked it. I had one little wish -- I got a bit confused with the love scenes - wish they were a little more detailed and longer."
1,"Sensiblity and jarana. The fisrt time I fist met Son de Madera on a live show in the city of Oaxaca, Mex. It's a very talented group, originary from the state of Veracruz, they made a ""rescue"" of the original Jarochan Son, Laura's voice its one of the best of Jarochan Son. their music leads you to tropical and apassionated world of the mexican jarochan soul.La primera vez que conoci a Son de Madera fue en una presentaciÃ³n en cico enla ciudad de Oaxaca, mex. Son un grupo talentoso originario del estado de Veracruz. Ellos hicieron un ""rescate"" del son jarocho original. La voz de laura es una de las mejores del Son Jarocho. Su m'sica te conduce al tropical y apasionado mundo del alma Jarocha de MÃ©xico."
1,Spiritual Fitness An inspiring read which has the potential to change your life providing you actively apply the principles.
1,"enough with the exclamation points already! mr. galsworhy may have written a fine solid substantial novel, byt by heaven mr. anthony trollope who lived and wrote over fifty years before was a much more modern writer and didn't qualify every goddam sentence with an exclamation mark. (!) very dated stuff. who knows, maybe one day i'll get past all those damn exclamation marks."
1,"High Quality One of my favorite gifts I have gotten! These are exquisite and top quality glasses! I remember my Great Grandma had these in the Fire King/Anchor ""Coronation"" that is what attracted me to them. They are so beautiful and would work for any function. I plan on having them for a long time since they are such good quality. You cannot go wrong with this reproduction!!! Especially if you are into Cottage or Shabby Chic home decor. Go for it you wont be dissapointed!"
1,Excellent Excellent karaoke CD. We love it and the music of Abba just makes us happy! Recommend highly - nice collection of songs.
1,Great cable I was able to plug this cable into my video camera and download my videos in HD. This allowed me to see my videos in true HD and not just SD.
1,video cable Easy way to get video from a digital video camera to your computer. You will need a special port on your computer to use this.
1,"BEST TROMA SO FAR I thought troma was dead. i did'nt really like tromeo and juilet and i never saw terror firmer. well, as soon as i thought troma was dead the toxic avenger 4 proved me wrong ( and i am very happy about that!). Any way this movie is awsome it is sooooooo gory and has a lot of funny parts, like the retarted rebel, the ""duck"" scene, and the scene where the original melvin makes an appearence!!!!!! It is also very gory and has a head running over scene that gives the one from the first movie a run for it's money. also the scene where toxie kills all of these nazi cops....i also give loyd kaufman cridet for sticking his neck out and making fun of abortion, raceism and others.TROMA LIVES!!!!"
1,"Great Value Used this saw to cut 3/8 inch granit tile and it worked better than i anticipated. Had no leaks as others indicated..some mess, yes, but not unusual with tile cutting. The diamond blade lasted throughout the kitchen project but did show signs of wear towards the end. . Certainly a great value!!!"
1,"GREAT for my rosacea I have bought this and also the extra strength. I bought the regular then realize it came in extra strength. I alternate using them and they seem to work the same. This product has taken away 95% of my redness and flaking due to my rosacea. I have really tried everything and nothing worked in the past. Even my skin Dr suggested things and nothing worked. I saw this on a show on NBC and thought I would give it a try and so glad I did. I use it everyday. I am unsure why the price is so much lower on Amazon vs buying it directly from the Dr Gross website, seems odd to me."
1,"excellent product This skincare product has saved my 50+ year old complexion. It's like having a facial every day. Great for anybody, any skintype, even teenagers. Worth the money. Leaves the skin w/ a ""just right"" texture: not dry, not greasy. You can apply make-up right after using the pads."
1,SO Expensive BUT... Great product! I have used many a skin care product and this was by far the best one. But because its so expensive i have to buy it sparingly. (Im not a high roller) I have ordered this product twice in the last year and it works right away. The problem is you really have to use them all in 30 days or the pads will dry up on you. This is dissapointing since i really dont need to use them everyday. Nonetheless this product works...if i had the money i would keep a ready supply in my cabinet.
1,They fit Perfect.... I think that they are both nice voiced and this Cd is a great combination. A relaxive song with nice music. The only bad thing is that there is only 1 song including in this Cd. Anyway this is great Cd to buy...
1,"""When you believe"" This song, sung by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey is GREAT! Sometimes, it leaves tears in my eyes. But, the song has some contrasts. Whitney Houston has one of the most beautiful voices in the universe. So when she sings the first verse and chorus, and then Mariah Carey starts to sing the second verse... it's a HUGE CONTRAST! Mariah screeches... If Celine Dion, who has the most wonderfully beautiful voice in the universe, had sung it with Whitney Houston, the song would've been irresistible. It would have been so unexplainable beautiful. Anyway, great job, Mariah and Whitney!"
1,great book this is a great book. it was written well and read more like a story and not a manual the information although somewhat dated was great to read about and made me think about how a woodsman would have lived in the early 1900s
1,"Magic Malamud Malamud does three or four tricks in his fiction well, and here he does each one to utter perfection. And when taken together, this collection of stories almost transcends Malamud's normal limits: the stories are compressed, short, and below the surface, charged with almost unbearable tension. Unlike other collections of stories (or when you read too many Malamud stories) Malamud does not parody himself in the Magic Barrell. Everything is where it is supposed to be, and works like a well oiled machine. It is a shame that (as of writing this) only eight people have reviewed this masterpiece of a short story collection. In Roth's The Ghost Writer, Zuckerman explains that the world's morality has already passed by the E.I. Lonoff's (a character based on Malamud). Seems Roth was correct... and this is true even more today, thirty years after the publication of The Ghost Writer. We no longer live in Malamud's world, and it is a shame."
1,"The first excellent book ever written about Heinlein Finally, somebody has written a truly useful book about that most important of American science fiction authors, Robert A. Heinlein. In the past, sloppy criticism and the grinding of personal axes have ruined every single attempt to produce a book discussing Heinlein's works (I have the misfortune of having read them all). Gifford has produced what has to be the groundwork for all future studies of Heinlein: a basic categorization and numbering of every single published and unpublished work in the canon, along with the insiders' story on each entry. Readable from cover to cover, or as a reference work, Gifford has also performed the one invaluable goal of every reader's companion: he's sent me back to rereading the original works, but with fresh perspectives and insights. A perfect score, after twenty years of utter failures in Heinlein scholarship. Bravo!"
1,"An intelligent, broad-ranging book James Gifford has given us a book immense in its scope, detailing the works of one of Science Fiction's Grand Master, and one of the genre's most prolific authors.The format is very reader-friendly. The individual entries for each work are fascinating for any Heinlein lover, and the bibliography and opus list will prove invaluable to new readers who wish to delve into Heinlein's universe. Truly a landmark achievement in research and clarity."
1,"great goggles These are the best goggles we have ever tried. They fit well, do not fog up and have a good seal. No rashes from the material. The instructions for replacing the clear lenses with optic lenses are rubbish but once you pop the plastic frame off, the rest is very easy. Ignore the packet instructions and just follow your instincts!"
1,"Wonderfrul Creatures No one describes a creature like Alan Dean Foster! Hands down, the very best. His silverslith sent shivers down my arms. I've read it many times, and I even use it to teach my students how to write a descriptive paragraph. His mind knows no bounds when inventing animals, plants, and humans. Probably my favorite fantasy book of all times (though Mid-Flinx) comes in a close second."
1,"You'll read this one again and again. This book, like Heinlein's Starship Troopers, is a book I keep reading again and again over the years, and for similar reasons. As previous reviewers have stated, this book is quite compact, yet rich and complete, and operates on several levels. It's the description of a fascinating world. It's an adventure story. It's a character study. It's a parable. The concept is intriguing, and the characters are multi-faceted. It's a compact classic, and until today I hadn't realized that Midworld had shown up in any other books. Those books (all of them) are going on my Amazon Wish List today.Read this book, and read Starship Troopers. Both are SO much more than bugs-in-space. They're worth far more time than they actually take to read."
1,"Wonderful world I first read this book as a teenager, many, many years ago, and I still dig it out of my bookshelf every other year to re-immerse myself in Foster's wildly imaginative world. He has such a great talent for inventing intriguing flora and fauna!Only two little flaws come to mind:1. Midworld seems a little too lethal for any colony to survive long enough to discover the Home Trees and make use of them.2. In Mid-Flinx, the author describes fire-extinguishing flora. They apparently don't exist in Midworld because if they did, the corporation couldn't have built their R&D; complex."
1,"Treat yourself & buy it! I'd have to agree with M-Speedy, this album is great! If you enjoy Cyndi Boste this second album won't disappoint."
1,"My issue isn't with the work of fiction I love the story of Tess. Considering many of the classics I have ever read, I think Tess is one of the easier ones to understand. The work itself is a masterful story. However, I take issue with Penguin's version. The Notes are just awful- referencing back and forth from your place in the book to the back is a nightmare and many times isn't worth breaking your flow. Some of the Notes are helpful and even necessary to understand the sentence, but others are pointless and annoying. I recommend a different version, either without notes entirely or with more reasonable ones."
1,"Just so tragic! I can't believe how tragic this book is! I picked up this book with an unexpected decision. The book I was supposed to read was Queen of the Damned, but then I saw this book and the cover appealed to me. So I decided I'll read it. At first it was kinda boring, until the last 1/3 of the book, I was so depressed by it...how fate was toying with them, and how their characteristic had decided their fate............Anywayz, this is truly a wonderful book, either by plot, writing, background, history, religion, describtion, etc etc, it's all with perfection. Read it, even though the beginning part might be kinda boring, it's for you to understand it better.I'd recommend this book to anybody, and if you like tragedies, you definitely *have* to read it!!"
1,"Deliberately frustrating, occasionally profound, great read. About fifteen years ago, this book was almost universally considered Hardy's great masterpiece. However, times have changed and its relevance is not as immediate as that of Hardy's last novel, Jude the Obscure. Still, the message of this book is far from foreign. Hardy's gift for creating sympathetic characters seems infinite in magnitude. His prose is unique and at times more harrowing in tone than Conrad's. This book would be a great introduction to the work of one of the great masters of English Literature."
1,"Time Well Spent For those beginning to read the classics this one is a great hook. While the characters are complex the story is linear and the allusions are simple enough to follow. One can't help but hope Tess's life will somehow turn out right although knowing it will not. The burdens she encounters seem to do little to stop her from moving forward. Life seems so unfair to her, but Hardy handles her masterfully; indeed it is safe to say Hardy loves her more than God does."
1,"A classic frustration... Not a frustration in the negative sense, but in fact, this was a book which I could hardly put down. The fact that I felt compelled to express my thoughts here perhaps point to it's even greater impact on me. A fabulous story, and of course, tragic in the end... And why do I feel frustrated? Perhaps merely for the fact of Tess ' rash action, almost one of self defence, which closes her tragic life. And the want or need for the story to extend beyond the final close to see her defence succeed and her life prevail. However, these are not the modern times, and the chasm seems wide. Tess is a beautiful person - innocent and with only the intention of good - and suffers as a result. While not a ground breaking novel, it's eloquence and true to life appeal allows it to become part of you. I can only highly recommed this book and will read it again and again..."
1,"A classic that isn't boring or dull, actually fun to read!!! This was a very chilling and creepy book to read, I highly enjoyed it and recommended it. It came as such a great surprise that this book, written decades ago, is comparabely as scary as Stephen King novels, but more wicked (and rather a bit more difficult of a task to read).Through circumstances and the evil of others, the young just prior nymph Tess Durverfield, suffers a series of tragedies. A victim of innocence, youth, beauty, and love. THIS WAS GREAT!"
1,"Mechanical Female Tess is a very difficult book and I would not recommend it to the average old contemporary reader. There is so much more meaning behind the birth of the rapist's child, and the break-up of Tess and her ""husband"" Angel. You have to read the fine-lines and ""footnotes"". In other words, there is absolutely no way you could relate to this book, and anyways...why would you want to relate to books? The experiences Tess goes throught at such an early age has scarred her for life. Well, she doesn't live much of a life now that you think about it."
1,"MOST WORTHY CLASSIC NOVEL As the synoposis says: Violated by one man, forsaken by another, Tess Durbeyfield is a magnificent and spirited heroine of Thomas Hardy's immortal work.Written in a no-nonsense yet frilly female tone, Tess of the Durbervilles is just as comarible to ADAM BEDE, both are beloved and my most honored classics every. I enthusiastically recommend the two, these are the books that deserve to be called CLASSICS."
1,"Alec or Angel? False Morality Exposed through one Woman's Innocence ""I became acquainted with Thomas Hardy through another of his classic works, which lent to my curiosity on this one when the audio version was made available to me. It was an experience, to the say the least, hearing how the innocent life of this girl of late 19th century England played out. For no reason other than her own naivetÃ© is she rendered with injustice and prejudicial attitudes of the day - Hardy's denouncement of his own country's false morals. In my view, all males of our current day and age should find this impressive work required reading, and then determine whether they are an Alec D'urberville or an Angel Clare. It seems we all fall into one category or the other."""
1,Excellent I put this book on my ipod and then thought I'd like to be able to read it when I couldn't listen. I have a kindle and kindle fire. It went to both Kindles! Yea! Now I have the book all places so how ever I want to read it I can!! Amazon makes it all happen like magic.
1,"One of the best Victorian literature ever... Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best books I have ever set my eyes upon. I have tried to finish the book in one sitting but found out that I can't because there is just so many things to figure out in the story. No doubt, fate plays such an important role in the life of Tess Durbeyfield and it is due to her noble descent that spawns the events leading to her own demise. The ending of the story is somewhat disturbing. Should we feel happy that Angel fufiled Tess's wish or should we feel sad for Tess?"
1,"I recommend this I thoroughly enjoyed Tess, even though it left me raging and gnashing my teeth at times. No picture of Victorian life can be complete without reading this book first."
1,"Great product Great product, works as advertised. It might be a bit to heavy for me (a woman) to manage alone but I'm not sure light product would be as sturdy and secure.We are able to fit out 4 bikes on it all right. Despite some reviews saying you can't put a kids bike on it - well, we hauled our little one's 14-incher with training wheels together with three bigger bikes, no problems. No additional bars for our bikes, no safety issues, recommend."
1,"Big & heavy but great We have four bikes in our family and needed stronger rack to carry them. This is perfect for four bikes. It takes a little practice to figure out which bike goes on in which order. It is pretty easy to adjust as necessary. It is very heavy and therefore a little difficult to take on and off, but a little assistance is all you need. The locking pin does not ""lock"" in it only screws in, so for security you may need to purchase a locking pin with a key. Do not try to use this without a 2"" hitch, it is so heavy it wobbles and does not look very secure on the back of the car. The clamps that lock the bike hold them in place and do not allow them to move but they do mark up the bikes. I just use a small washcloth to protect the bike frame. For the price, this is a great rack."
1,"Perfect!!! I did alot of research before I made my purchase. For a 4-bike rack, this was the best price and quality. It is a little hard to put together because the instructions are not very detailed at all. Took my husband about 45 minutes to put it together. It is a little heavy but it is extremely sturdy. I wouldnt trust a cheap wobbly rack for my bikes. I read reviews that said it was too complicating so I was nervous when I decided to purchase despite those reviews, but other than the assembly,it is not complicating at all. It fits all types of bikes with no problem. It is perfect and I love it!!"
1,Light and easy to use The Swagman XTC-4 Cross-Country Hitch Mount Rack is lighter than other bike racks and is easy to attach to vehicle. The attachments are easy to move and adjust to each bike that is put on it. Will be enjoying using this product for a long time. Seems to be very durable.
1,"Solid Rack A little heavy, but a good solid rack. Its great for any size bike or tires! No problems what so ever! I'd recommend it to anyone but the weak!!!"
1,"OUTSTANDING! The View From the Hill was one of the most exciting books I have read in a long time. It's a touching almost love story, an with exciting battle over Sterling Castle. This is a great book for not only the historical accuracy, but also for the story behind the action. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
1,"Best Disposable Nipples I love these nipples. I've ordered so many of these because my son will only use this nipple. We have tried the Medela nipples and every other type imagineable that will fit on our Medela bottles, but this is the only one he would use. It's a slow flow which is perfect for him. We will be buying more before we head to Cancun so we can use with the Similac Ready to Feed bottles."
1,"A Great Read About Japan! I remember before I left for my first trip to Japan in 1996, reading about Feiler and his adventures in an Onsen hot springs. I remember his description of having to take of all his clothes and bathe in front of all these Japanese guys he just met. Any yet, during my trip in 1996 the same thing happened to me! I felt just like Feiler! The book is informative about Japanese culture and at the same time a great read. Its a must read if you plan to visit Japan...especially if you are a teacher."
1,"Best Book This is the best book I have read by or about foreigners living in Japan. The author has moved to Japan to teach English in a typical small town school. Quite a wide variety of situations and scenes in Japanese daily life are covered from an outsider's perspective. His interactions with the school's principal, district administrators, teachers, the students and their parents are well written in a descriptive and anecdotal way. Mr Feiler is not just a good storyteller but is a very insightful writer as well. I immediately reread the book and enjoyed the second reading even more than the first."
1,"A book on Japanese culture... This book by Bruce Feiler is not just about the Japanese educational system but about the Japanese themselves. While it does touch on how students and teachers work together, teen suicide and cram school, it also deals with the problems of racism, the way the Japanese balance their lives and their duties to society, and even a few chapters on Japanese dating and marriage. It is full of humor, insight and clear thinking. Mr. Feiler clearly but a lot of thought into his visit and is just as clear in explaining to us what he feels is the important and major issues that Japan has to deal with - not just then but now and in the future. A must for any library on Asia or Japan."
1,"Classic When I heard they were making a file of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, I thought, ""good luck!"". The main gist of the book is philosophical, a hard quality to translate on film. But Kaufman does it here, with the help of Daniel Day-Lewis - and manages to improve upon the book, adding color, humor, and a profound sense if intimacy. A touching and beautifully done love story."
1,"An investigation into the nature of relationships Why do we commit to one another? Do we really know? Would a life of independence and detachment be better? Both analytical and powerfully moving, this movie deals with these questions. At first seeming light and slightly intellectual, the movie evolves into something more felt than thought. The film shows what is going on without telling the viewer in words. This is a story about the nature of love in all its human forms. It is a heavy story that stays with you. Not for those not in touch with their inner self or who object to some tasteful nudity."
1,"Timeless This film is by far one of the best ever produced: It`s erotic, humoures, sad, poetic and the protagonists are all interesting. Now, this is why many Europeans critizise American films.... They feel most productions from the US are stereotyped, all glam and over the top, while the European productions tend to move more straightforward into our human soul.... This film is one of those glorious occasions when film is high art and linked to the freespirited human soul."
1,"Unique: Abstracting to connect I've seen nothing like it. The supreme and rich acting of Binoche and the abstract cinematography and direction manage to distance the viewers in such a way from the everyday noise of a thousand feelings, enabling the viewers to taste and sense all the emotion and ideas of the characters and the era with a vividness only accesible in dreams."
1,"The best film nobody saw The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a masterpiece, the most underrated American film of the past 30 years. Poetic, haunting, subtle, and terribly sad, it says more about the crushing impact of repressive (i.e. communist) regimes than a thousand documanteries or inflammatory speeches could tell. While idealizing the free-wheeling Prague of the late 60's the film also examines the emptiness of such a non-commital lifestyle- the unbearable lightness. If this all sounds very somber, ULOB is also one of the sexiest films you will ever see, and one of the few intelligent studies of sex in cinema. More surprisingly, it is a heartbreaking romance. Like a great novel, ULOB grows on you, and you'll hate to see the characters leave you at the end. Perfectly acted by its then unknown leads, and beautifully photographed, this is a film to grow old with."
1,"A literate, moving film I served in the Peace Corps in E. Europe in the early 1990s; this movie conforms to my experience of Prague, the Czech people, and E. European literature so completely as to take my breath away. Creating a full movie out of the first 26 pages of Milan Kundera's original novel is scriptwriting brilliance. The film's breadth and depth of each character, the larger-than-life issues played out against the seeming frivolity of the Prague Spring--and its tragic historic aftermath--never fail to impress me. This film has a very European sentiment regarding sexuality/sensuality, however; it is as woven into the fabric of daily life as a glass of fine wine. If you prefer more staid fare, I'd recommend many excellent British films."
1,"This product saved my marriage! Just kidding. It's no fruit juicer, but it made my wife happy and works well. Nice size for an apartment and when combined with a rotary cutter, my wife found that cutting fabric was a delight as opposed to working with scissors, or the katana/stump combination I bought her for the job before I bit the bullet and bought her this mat. Once you get one, you'll wonder how you ever survived without this...and you'll keep your katanas sharp and ready for impending samurai attack. Or zombies."
1,"A fabulous LITTLE kitchen -- Love it We purchased this for our daughter for her first birthday. She loves it & plays with it constantly. It is great quality and fun colors & also comes with great accessories. It is very small (perfect for her size), but note this if you are buying it for an older toddler."
1,"Very Fast for Size! I now own 3 of them 512, 1G, 2G, write to it is 6MB/sec read is about 13MB/sec for it size the best you will find. I use it with RoboForm and BART-PE Boot OS, so it stays pluged in for long periods at a time and its size and round back make it the safest USB to leave in a laptop as you use it and move around and won't get knocked out or damage your USB port due to torque. I hope they never discontinue this model. A must have for the moble person on the move.Phil"
1,Simple solution that works great! We installed these on the switches for the exhaust fans in our two bathrooms and the closet light in our daughter's room. They work great. They don't need batteries -- the low-tech spring does the job. They save energy because you can't leave for the day and leave the fan going all day long.
1,Fits in my switch boxes... Our home was built in 2003 and this fits just fine in the outlet/switch box. It does exactly what it's supposed to. We set it for 10 minutes after we're done and it shuts the exhaust fan off in our bathroom.Saves money on heat and cooling...
1,"excellent book An amazing book. Personal life stories that all of us can relate to. Attempts to answer the question""why me?"" that we tend to ask in adverse times.Inspirational and uplifting."
1,"Awesome images. I love this book. Honestly, I haven't read it. I've only stared at the images and drawn the dragons from the book. I LOVE drawing them.Perhaps I should read it some time too!"
1,For use in the Foreign Language Curriculum Excellent book for staff development within the Foreign Language department. Includes tools for evaluating both student and instructor performance with guidance on how to improve those scores.
1,"ISS Research Creatine. Good Product I HAVE SEEN ENERGY AT THE GYM, EVEN WHEN I RAN. NOT SURE IF IT'S FROM THE CREATINE BUT I KNOW ISS RESEARCH MAKES GOOD STUFF BECAUSE FIRST TIME I USE THE GLUTAMINE THAT STUFF WORKED REALLY GOOD.THEY'RE NOT FLASHY ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT; DON'T ADD CRAZY FLAVORS AND WHAT NOT, BUT THEY DO MAKE GOOD PRODUCTS. EVERYONE'S BODY IS DIFFERENT SO EXPERIMENT WHICH WORKS FOR YOU."
1,"EXPERIENCE A NEW AGE. Shutters come down, safety inside, exile at home, this is more than just the best CD in the world.... This is the beginning of a new music age."
1,"Extremely rare type of pleasant ""art"" music from these ages. I first heard a track on the tv while I was doing something else. In a program reviewing new music. I was astonished. It didn't sound at all as all the other worthless types of modern pop. The first parallell I made was to the ""old"" 10cc. But of course, anyone who knows about Beach Boys, Brian Wilson and the ""Pet Sounds"" album would rather like to refer to those. I will go and buy at least two of the albums."
1,"Correction in my previous review It's actually ""Hoops Hooley"" that sounds straight off the Beach Boys ""Pet Sounds"" album. I love this stuff. Get it!"
1,"Less cold...more bouncy Wow! With ""Snowbug"", a return trip to ""Hawaii"", Sean O'Hagan and friends have created their most accessible CD yet. While retaining the Wilsonesque arrangements for the most part, the vocal aspects of the production have been honed to a more refined level, thanks in part to the inclusion of more female background vocals. Gone are the avant-garde electronic-bloop excursions of ""Cold and Bouncy"". The new direction on this CD is the incorporation of Brazilian influences into the already exotic High Llamas cocktail. These developments in the band's sound gives ""Snowbug"" a warmer overall feel than any of their previous efforts. I don't see how any critics could argue the true excellence of this collection of songs, though many have pointed to the Llamas too-strong Beach Boys influence in the past. It is unassailable in it's musical genius, a beautiful work of art."
1,"The book that initiated my addiction to beat As a Californian, frequenter of the Sierra Nevadas, as well as a college student who obsesses over fine American Literature, I found this work to be perhaps the most well written piece of beat fiction i've read. Contrary to popular belief, I feel this is a much more mature and insightful piece than ""On the Road"" (not to take anything from the brilliance of Kerouac's breakthrough work) and should be held in reverence by literature and philosophy enthusiasts across the globe. Japhy Ryder's Buddha representation, as well as Kerouac's struggle to incorporate his new discovery of traditional buddhism with his original Catholic upbringing are representative of the Western Frontier of Eastern Thought, which is becoming more popular even today, thanks to the likes of Jack Kerouac. Bravo!"
1,Favorite Liked this more than On the Road. Has a completely different feel. One of my favorite reads.
1,VIVA RUCKSACK REVOLUCION! Cracker Jack's got quite a nack at righting these shindigs about the bums in rucksacks. Dharma Bums gives you a glimpse into the life of the Beats with a focus on their cut of Zen. This really is a great story and it will inspire you. On a side note I recommend trying to find the original edition; the old pages really smell a lot better.
1,"kerouac's best This is the book that lured me into the world of kerouac. I had previously read ""On the Road,"" which was excellent, but I feel no match for ""the Dharma Bums."" This book changed my life. It changed the way that i thought. Kerouac introduces the reader to his experiences and beliefs through his novels; they are mostly semi-autobiographical. Before this novel consumed me, i had no notion of Buddhism. In retrospect this has been the single most influential thing that I have been exposed to. This book is just a starting point for a Kerouac fan. I recommend that you follow this book with Kerouac's ""Desolation Angels."" Simple, and yet so satisfying literature. I have not really encountered any other writers who are so beloved, so beautiful and poetic in few and simple jazz talk and random amusing European literary name dropping. Pick this one up, maybe it will change your life too!"
1,"Kerouac's finest, most blissful novel...you MUST read it! Yes, ""On The Road"" gets all the attention, but this follow-up work is by far his most gorgeous and uplifting...from sleeping on the beach to climbing a mountain, to the flowering of his Buddhist consciousness, Jack really takes the reader with him. Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. ""Dharma Bums"" soars as high as ""Big Sur"" dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors."
1,"Five Rule! Five are definetly the world's greatest boy band. Even though they split up, they are still awesome.""Let's Dance"" is a very poppy song, and definetly makes me want to dance as the title suggests. The extra track ""Sometimes"" is awesome and the remix is pretty good. The Megamix rules and overall ""Let's Dance"" is a good single to buy.I recommend it to any people who like dance music, pop music or anything catchy. Also, if you're a huge Five fan, this is a must to buy. A definete 5 star."
1,"Probably the best movie of the year I don't understand why people didn't like Revenge of the Fallen. I thought that was great. I thought that the first Transformers the best... Until I saw Dark of the Moon. Dark of the Moon was just a perfect movie. It had comedy, suspense, and (Most importantly) action. Some of these action sequences were just great. And there were some white knuckling sequences that you HAVE to be prepared for. And Shia LaBoef was just great with the new actress. She was better than Megan Fox. In more than one way if you know what I mean =) But altogether, this was an A+ in my book. So dissapointed that it's the final one. Michael Bay, this was your MASTERPIECE!"
1,"Transformers Excellent sequel and follow-up to the first movie. I think I still like the first one better but, either way I definitely enjoyed it. ;-)"
1,I love this series! I like the new love interest in this movie a lot. Also this is a great extension of the last two movies. i can't wait for a 4th to come out.
1,"Good I was very satisfied the product and the speed I received it I would do business with them again, I was very satisfied"
1,"More than made up for Revenge of the Fallen!!! DOTM made it easy to forget 2009's ROTF. The ""plot"" was much improved, possibly because there was only ONE writer this time. Some of the best action sequences I have ever seen were in this movie. A great way to end the series, as well. If they made any more, I would hope it would be the military and Autobots working together to hunt down Decepticons, similar to how ROTF started out.Please take my advice: how good a movie is has nothing to do with the studio wanting to get consumers to buy the movie twice. If you disagree, then spam the studio with correspondence rather than deduct stars from your review.Try it this way next time: ""DOTM was a fantastic action film, but I am disappointed the Blu-Ray release hardly has any extras. Otherwise, 5 STARS!!!!"""
1,loved it loved the movie more than the television series from the 80's.......my boys loved it so much they were characters from the movie for Halloween....my 3 year old loves cars more than ever after seeing this
1,Was a gift for my daughter She loved it when she opened it on her birthday. Now I want to watch it lol. It looks exciting.
1,"Watching it on my PS3... Great Quality! no problems at all playing it on my PS3. Not a fan of buying Collector's edition, price is great."
1,luv it Must i say more it a f****in good movie me and the kids love it.. If you dont have it ur late
1,"Awesome Action Movie!! This movie is a great movie for those of you seeking for action. It's simple, fun, and it's full of action. If you're into movies with a deep meaning, this isn't it for you, but for those of you that just love action like me, it'll be awesome! Blu-ray definitely makes this movie pop out and you'll love it if you have a huge awesome HDTV."
1,fabuloso mil gracias por el producto fabuloso recomiendo a este vendedor todo llego en perfectas condiciones excelentesaludos espero seguir contando con ustedes
1,"Great movie Like all the other Transformer movies just great, one you can play over and over and never get sick of seeing it."
1,"Love Transformers I really liked this movie. I own the first two on DVD and despite what a lot of people think of Michael Bay's movies, I took this for what it was: a fun movie bringing an iconic childhood toy to life. I grew up watching the cartoons and was really excited when I heard there were going to be live action movies. Now I did enjoy this movie more than the second one, not that I hated Revenge of the Fallen. I loved the action sequences and the special effects. I admit I watch them more for the actual Transformers than the human actors. I didn't care for Patrick Dempsey's character. I don't watch Grey's Anatomy so I have no attachment to him as an actor and I really didn't like Rosie Huntington-Whitley. Sorry, but she shouldn't quit her day job. Acting just isn't her thing. Other than that, I loved the movie. I'm waiting until the collector's edition is released later this year. I have to have my special features."
1,I enjoy these movies I've enjoyed all of these movies. Growing up with the Transformers I was very excited when the first one came out. This Blu-Ray looks great and the digital copy is great for when I travel.
1,Transformers This item worked as advertised and excellent customer service. I would do business again in the future with this vendor.
1,More than meets the eye Transformers: Dark of the Moon is an excellent movie. The adaptation of the animated series into a cinematic format has been completed with great effect. The storyline is also imaginatively and creatively thought-out.
1,kicks ass this is a must-own bluray. looks killer and sounds incredible. definitely a great way to show off your system and the story resonates with our current economic and political problems when it feels like evil has already won.
1,"What can i say, its Transformer!!! Just wondering when they are coming out with the next movie hehe. Of the 3 in this trilogy, this is my son's favorite."
1,Optimus Prime have all of them now..was a good movie..only part that sucked was them replacing sam's girlfriend w/someone else..other than that it's filled w/lots of action and all those Autobots..
1,Brand New! I am so glad I got this Transformers Video for my younger brother he is going to love it and it is in brand new condition. Thank you for this great Christmas present at a great rate !
1,movie i love it cuz it was fast delivery and my son wanted this as a movie night to add with the other two he has and plus the movie was in good condition and i was ok with it not having a case cuz the case to me is collecting dust and when you have a disc you can add inthe dvd book sleeve
1,Transformers: Dark of the Moon watched this one and the previous one several times. Like this movie lots and so did the kids! thanks so much
1,Cant wait for Transformers 4 Absolutely awesome as usual. One of the best actions series of all time!! You cannot ask for anymore than what Michael Bay and company provide here.
1,"best movie made to date, and fast shipping Seen the movie at the theatre and knew then it was going to be a must buy on blu ray when released. Amazon always delivers promptly and on the release date."
1,Great movie I bought this as a preorder from Amazon and you couldn't be the price for a 3 disc set! Movie is very good and if you like the other Transformers movies it's a must have.
1,get this movie i love this movie for the action and all the bad crimanals get what they deserve at the end.i recommend this movie 100/00 percent
1,marine thanks for getting my movie here so quick. we really enjoy and its in great shape that is great thanks
1,"Non-stop action from beginning to end! I was skeptical of this movie featuring a WWE wrestler (WWE wrestlers are notoriously bad actors) and because the movie was produced by the WWE rather a than a major motion picture company. However I was wrong. The movie was full of action and special effects. John Cena did a respectable job acting. The theme and plot were very entertaining, not cheesey or bogus. If you like action movies such as ""Arnold"" movies or Rambo movies then you will very much enjoy this movie!"
1,"This service works great! I'm really happy with this eMarker thing. I mark songs with it almost everyday on WPLJ and I download the songs from Napster. I do have to wait for about 3-10 minutes (sometimes less) to get the song name, but I'm usually in the car so it is not really a problem. It would be great if they covered NPR. It works on my Windows 2000 PC at work and my Windows ME PC at home. The technology behind it seems to be pretty simple. I think the keychain product just remembers the time. It works flawlessly for my station, which is what is important anyway. The site is a bit slow, but it is a really slick design that is very interactive. I wish it held more songs than ten."
1,"INSANELY SCARY,MAN! This book is scary stuff! I read a story, ""Me-Tie-Doughty-Walker"" that scared the stuffing out of me! Now I'm in seventh grade, and the book still gives me chills when I'm reading it alone! The pictures are so trippy and disturbingly graphic!"
1,"Scary as heck! This, along with the other two books in the series, is a classic. Alvin Schwartz's tales are so simple yet so deviously scary, and Gammell's dark, surreal illustrations greatly enhance them. Actually, some of the illustrations are midly disturbing...(what IS that thing coming up the stairs in ""The Voice""?) Once you've read at least a couple of them, you'll start to realize just how scary the world is...(for instance, ""The Girl who Stood on a Grave"", ""The Red Spot"", and ""No Thanks""). So give them a try...you won't be dissapointed!"
1,"NIGHTMARES YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW SCARY LOOKING THE PICTURES ARE IN ALL OF THE BOOKS!!!! THAT COULD DEFINETELY GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES FOR A WHILE.EVEN IN SOME STORIES. THERE WAS NOT A PICTURE OF THE WENDINGO, BUT THE BACK OF THE BOOK SAID IT WAS A FEMALE SPIRIT, AND/OR A CANNIBAL GIANT THAT KILLS FOR HUMAN FLESH AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS DESCRIBED INDIANS WANTING TO EAT FLESH AS A ""WENDIGO PSYCHOSIS"". {I'm sure that's how you spell that word}."
1,"Wow, so creepy as a child! Okay, I had all three books when I was a kid. The original ones look like their worth some money so I'll be kicking myself in the back later. If these new ones stay true to the stories from the 90's editions, then you need to buy all three of them for your kids. The stories are pretty freaky for kids, but if I recall, most of them do state some lessons to be learned. Definitely buy all three."
1,Great Jam!! This is truly wonderful gooseberry jam. It is packed with chunks of gooseberries. I highly recommend this product!! It truly met my expectations.
1,Amazingly beautiful trance cd. This is the perfect cd to put in after a night of partying. Great to chill out to. Track 5 and 6 are just amazing.
1,awesome This has to be the best group of performers I've ever enjoyed. I've seen them 4 times.. well 5 times.. once on the 55 freeway.. :P This is cd is very creative and will set you in the mood that will take your mind away from everyday life.. GET IT!!! -Darkpeace (Moontriber 4 life)
1,Nice boot I bought these for my boys for Christmas and they love them so much they refuse to take them off. They told me these are the best pair of shoes/boots they have ever had.
1,"Excellent Boots! These boots are an excellent value. They are comfortable, provide great heel and ankle support, good grip, and keep your feed warm and dry in cold climates.Purchased a pair for a vacation in New Brunswick, Canada. These boots kept my feet dry and comfortable the whole time, even while snow shoeing and hiking across a snow covered beach front. Didn't slip once in them, though I encountered ice a few times.Very good purchase!"
1,"Hi-Tec Altitude I first purchased a pair of Hi-Tech Altitude boots approximately 10 years ago. They fit me extremely well and were very comfortable from the first moment I wore them. Prior to this purchase, I have had 2 different pairs of the Hi-Tech Altitude boots and I have not been disappointed. They wear extremely well and seem to last me about 4 or 5 years. I have found them excellent for everyday wear as well as for use in fishing and hunting. I think these are excellent low cut boots for such a moderate price. Haven't ventured into buying the $100+ boots, but then why should I when these work so well, so can not comment or compare my $70 Hi-Techs to the more pricey boots. I think you will be pleased with these boots."
1,"Only shoe my husband will wear Kudos to the Hi-Tec designers & manufacturers! My husband wears these daily for all types of situations. Easy to keep clean and looking nice. VERY durable. Almost no time to ""break them in"". Design has stayed constant. Run true to size. No need to change something that already works great. Will continue buying these in the future."
1,"Great Boots Went to Yellowstone in these boots. They were comfortable, waterproof and did well on the 328 steps to get down to lower falls."
1,"Mercacia pendiente por despachar. Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Hiking BootEste producto fue comprado y cacelado junto con una cartera para caballero NAUTICA Men's Trifold Wallent y numca fue enviado, este comentario lo he enviado muchas veses pero no me han solucionado nada, no voy a rrepatir mas este mensaje, pero no realizare mas compras por esta pajina debido a lo que esta sicediendo."
1,"More than one year used a lot ! Exactly I'm using this ones from 16 months, ALL the sundays, and in some trips to the mountain and beach for a complete week, they are great in all the ways! I can't hope something better from a daily used and/or hicking shoes! Another thing to consider; I'm a ""big and heavy boy"":6 ft.2 in.and 225 lbs."
1,Great all season Boot! I've now had these boots for a month and they just continue to impress me. They were comfortable right out of the box so break in was very quick. I've worn them day hiking and have had no problems with hot spots.Even though they are waterproof I still recommend spraying them with silicone.5 Stars!
1,"Nice boots! I ordered these in fall when I was going for a backpacking trip and I could just forget about twisting an ankle or anything. Wear these, step on any kind of surface with confidence, lots of grip, good support for the ankle. Will highly recommend these for snow as well as adventure!!"
1,"A powerful anti-war film. This is not only a spectacular and stunning piece of film making, it is a powerful anti-war film. If you can watch this film today and not be haunted and disturbed by it, you are not paying attention. I watched it recently for the first time in over 20 years and came away shaken. I can't help but wonder if it is not on DVD because there are people who do not want this film to be widely available. As it is now, you have to dig for it. If more people watched this film they might be asking questions our ""leaders"" would rather have left unasked. If you have not seen this film, or it has been a number of years since you saw it last, I can recommend it. It is not an overt anti-war film with an explicit anti-war message, but after seeing it, you will not view world events with the same eyes you did before, I promise."
1,"ONE OF MY FAVORITE DIRECTORS AND FILM DAVID LEAN COULD HAVE DIRECTED ALMOST ANY FILM HE WANTED AT THIS TIME IN HIS CAREER, AND HE CHOSE THIS PROVOCATIVE AND EMOTIONAL STORY OF A LITTLE TOWN IN IRELAND. THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER OF HIS, INCLUDING THE EARLY ONES. THE CASTING IS SUPERB, COULD NOT BE BETTER RIGHT DOWN TO THE SMALL ROLES LIKE MAUREEN. I SAW IT WHEN I WAS 13 WITH MY PARENTS WHO WERE LEAN FANS. ITS HIS BEST FILM, TREATED BY SOME AS HIS WORST FILM. I EXPECTED TO SEE ALEC GUINESS IN IT, BUT THERE IS NO REAL ROLE FOR HIM. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PEOPLES LIVES IN THE FILM IS AMAZING AND I THINK AHEAD OF ITS TIME FOR 1970 FILM VIEWERS."
1,"Great Beginner Camera We had used a decent quality camcorder before our son bought this one. This one has been a pleasant surprise. Although the picture quality might be more like 4 stars, the features that are provided at such a low cost make this a 5 star product. It has all the fundamentals for a beginner and it fits well in medium size and small size hands (unlike some that require two hands or very large hands or cost five times as much for a small form-factor). We had it out of the box in minutes and were recording first videos with it in less than 15 minutes. The price makes it affordable for school kids to have all kinds of fun projects with it."
1,"YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU BOUGHT THIS!!! This album is proof that Jason Robert Brown is a musician's musician, and that he has mastered many different forms of popular music. Each of these 11 songs could stand on their own as a brilliant song, and none of these have the same style or feel as another.Brown's pure talent shines through this album, and there are several moments that are just so beautiful that I just get chills listening to them. Every lyric and harmony has been precisely placed, and the music always fits the idea of the song very naturally. There are some amazing performance moments on this album; Brown is an incredible pianist and singer in addition to his composing and arranging talents.This is probably the album that I listen to more than any other, and I would recommend it to anyone. It is packed with amazing musicality.Don't listen to this while trying to get work done; these songs will steal your attention and keep it for the whole duration of the CD."
1,RPM Sensor Assembly Great purchase. I was so frustrated and I couldn't figure out what was causing my garage door to reverse direction after just a few feet. This was an easy fix. Everything was packed well and shipped fast
1,"Easy For Me To Use This is a good,inexpensive printer.It is easy for me,stillvery gadget illiterate,to install and use."
1,"Perfect choice This CD is really awesome...the style of their songs are not exactly trance, not euro dance/trance either...they have their own way of playin their songs...AWESOME CHOICE"
1,"A wonderful helping of Brazilian jazz! This is a great CD from an extraordinary jazz saxophone player and probably the biggest name in Brazilian jazz today. We got a chance to see Leo Gandelman perform a lot of these songs at the Blue Note in June. Maracatu is a superb song...his son played it alongside him that night, it was one of the best experiences of live music I've ever heard. If you are into this type of jazz, this is a ""must have"" collection."
1,EXTREMELY RARE AND HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER! Unfortunately this one won't be on cd anytime soon. A bargain at $2400 for the cassette. So rare its worth it. You won't find it anytime soon! If you make an offer you might be lucky and get it for less.
1,"Deceptively good Just to be clear: the album is uniformly quiet and just consists of electric guitar without lots of special effects except long sustain. The genius of the record is that MazzaCane can bring out so much with minute details -- muffled string noises, minute pitch changes, perfect arhythmic timing of notes. Don't mistake apparent simplicity for emptiness, as another reviewer did. One of the most moving records I've heard, with a rare, sad, clear quality. I'd recommend this as a first album by this artist (he calls it his best too)."
1,"LUX Programmable Thermostat. Easy to setup. Looks good, great price. Shopped around a bit and this value is second to none. I have only had it for a month or so and good so far."
1,great product Works well and easy to program. Has definitely decreased our heating bills. Price of product was also very good. Would buy again
1,"Favguti is excellent !! In an age of the internet GUI store fronts, the typical on-line stores may forget the importance of quality in F2F interaction with the customer. In this regards, FAVGUTI exceeds all expectations on customer satisfaction!The product ordered opposed to product recieved was incorrect (...it happens), to final product quality / reliability was addressed daily till mutually satisfied. Need more on-line stores like FAVGUTI !!--Michael (in San Diego)"
1,"The ""goods"" make the ""bads"" look utterly insignificant! A+! Granted, most of the songs on this album are decent, but not great. However, the four songs that ARE great (Tubthumping, etc.) are so incredible that they literally blow the rest of the songs away! It is worth paying twice the price just to hear one of these amazing four songs!"
1,"HAPPY, SHINY ANARCHY'S NEVER BEEN MORE FUN! While Chumbawamba's recent musical efforts have left little or no impression on the music scene, their debut album ""TUBTHUMPER"" will remain ""thumping"" to the dance club beat of a different drum. For unexplainable reasons, I find myself coming back to this album time and time again. The music will not let you go. It's enjoyable, entertaining, and fun!""Tubthumping"" is an unrellenting statement of defiance. ""Amnesia""'s persistent guitar riff and catchy trumpets will NOT leave you suffering from ""long term memory loss"". ""The Big Issue"" contains some tatalizing chorale, and a catchy, lyrical tune. ""Mary, Mary"" is probably my favorite questioning the sanctity of Catholicism.Chambawamba may come and go, but let this be known. There was a band with a wierd name from England, whose music was fun to listen to, coherant, and made anarchy seem like fun!God Save ""Tubthumper""!"
1,"Fast and loud, that's how I like it. Even though Chumbawamba's most popular single in America was Tubthumping, that is my least favorite song on this album. It's way too slow. The rest of the songs are really fast, and have a great beat. If you like music with a beat, you must get this CD! Hey, even better, many of Chumbawamba's songs actually have meaning, for those of you that have a brain. There are a total of 12 songs and about ten mini-songs on the CD"
1,"So far sooooooo good I bought this printer two weeks ago and had it up and running within minutes of unpacking. When I first bought this PC I feared the two most commonly documented problems,paper jams and printer driver problems/OS problems, but to date I have not experienced either and the quality is as good as the laser printers I use in the office. The only thing I dislike about this printer is the high cost of replacement cartridges so I am hoping someone will deveolpe a refill kit similiar to the one I used with my old Canon BJC 250, which worked great..."
1,"Quilts from the Smithsonian I'm a quilt lover, and my favorite are old scrappy quilts. I do alot of quilting myself, but as a result of my love for quilts I also collect quilt books. One of my favorites is this little books from That Patchwork Place, Quilts from the Smithsonian by Mimi DietrichThe book has pictures and patterns of 12 great quilts from the Smithsonian collection, from a simple Plaid Patch to the more complexed Chesapeake Rose, and The Lilies of the Quilters. There are all colored pictures all through the book, and the there are easy to follow directions helping you to make your own quilts for future generations to love. Or if you are not a quilter the book si a perfect coffee table book with all it's colors and inspirations.Britt Arnhild Lindland"
1,"Your Signature Life by Dianna Booher Personal accountability, integrity, character - whatever you label it, it's doing the right thing, even when no one else is watching. ""Your Signature Life"" is a personal-development home run!Through captivating imagery and intriguing statistics, Dianna Booher challenges us to examine our lives to see what kind of character we are developing. Do we reflect light or darkness? She shows us how our experiences and relationships may help to form the way we look at the world, but they do not have to define who we are or who we will become.Although we cannot control the actions of those around us, we are called to control our responses to those actions. Personal accountability is not a thing of the past. We can and must have it today if we ever hope to look back over our lives and smile. Others are watching. God is watching.Ms. Booher's latest release, ""Your Signature Life,"" is a triumph for those seeking to live a life of integrity and total fulfillment."
1,"Never gets old Having just finished Greg Bear's brilliant ""Foundation & Chaos"", I've decided I can no longer wait to begin re-reading the original again. I wish I could take the next few months to start off with the Robot series, move on to the Galactic Empire series, and then finsh with the entire collection of the Foundation books (because it's all one big wunnerful story, doncha' know!). Well, not this year, perhaps, but in a few I may do just that. In the meantime, I will re-read ""Foundation"" with yet another new perspective of Hari Seldon and all that came before this original masterpiece... it truly never gets old."
1,"Tapes were as advertise The set arrived on time and enjoyed listening to the tapes, the tapes arrived in good condition and great sound."
1,Foundation Great book by Isaac Asimov. What a wonderful sci fi book. I'd recommend this series for anyone that likes fiction
1,It Holds up Not earth shaking or intensely mind bending but even after 30 years I enjoyed rereading the series. Asimov's storytelling is great!
1,Smart. Thought provoking. Classic. Sci-fi at its best! Asimov was one of the founding fathers of Sci-fi and to him we owe a debt of gratitude for making the genre worthy of the literary title. His messages and considerations give the reader a lot more than just something to kill time. It makes sci-fi an avenue to real soul searching.
1,"OUTSTANDING a must read and re-read (by ISAAC ASIMOV) Any coment's on this serie of books must be a positive one and if it's not then thats becouse you dident understand the story, so you should reread them all again, i stronly recommend this serie of books to anyone, not just sci fans, but to all that have the taste to read. The author of this serie wrote 470 books, he was a genius and died out of his time with the age of 72, in memory of ISAAC ASIMOV i recommend all of his books, but especially the foundation series,thaks for reading my review."
1,"The Zenith of Asimov! I highly recommend the time to read ""Foundation""...it just may convince you to continue on with the rest of the series. I believe it was the forerunner and main idea behind the concept of a galactic empire as has been expanded on by Star Wars and Star Trek. If you would like to see the genesis of the idea behind those phenomena then you'll very much be rewarded by reading the Foundation series...besides, anything by Asimov is worth its weight in gold and this is the zenith of his space operatic writings!"
1,"great read The book doesn't really need yet another enthusiastic review, so I'll keep this to the point.The stories in this book are really enjoyable. You get to learn about characters in the beginning and then spend the rest of the time reading about the legacy they created and the later events that they had a hand in shaping. I find this satisfying in a way similar to the Dune series but I didn't have to read 6 books.As with every Asimov book I've read, the plots in this book are forged and hewn into complicated machines that are disassembled before your eyes at just the right climactic moment. It makes for a hard book to put down."
1,"Excellent, but it now! I admit it, I am an Asimov-phile. This is yet another book by Asimov that is very hard to put down. I rate this, and all of Asimovs books with the highest regard. Quite simply buy it now, or you are a fool. ;-)"
1,"Always liked Asimov I always liked Asimov, but finding series books in sequence is difficult with print books. Kindle makes it easy! Now they're all cataloged in order and I don't even have to get out of bed for the next one.Reading the ""Foundation"" series in order rather than by availability makes a great writer even better."
1,"Best Book by Asimov (fiction) I have read almost all of Asimov's fiction, and this book is by far one of the best. I would recommend it to anyone interested!Boom, Done.-Jeremy Paul Gallagher"
1,"One of the best ever This book it simply one of the best science fiction stories ever written. It should be on the ""must read"" list for any sci-fi fan."
1,"Wonderful What can I say??? Asimov at his best. It's impossible to stop reading this book. The chapters are so incredible, that you can't wait to get to the finish to know how the plot ends. If you haven't read it, you don't know what you are missing"
1,"Cornerstone of Science Fiction Foundation has been called by science-fiction lovers all over the world as a cornerstone for science fiction. Isaac Asimov's all time best, this book tells the tale of the crumbling of the Galactic Empire and is only the beggining of a 7-book series. The way Asimov uses the analogy of the Fall of the Roman Empire has pleased readers for decades. Asimov tells the story of a planet alone at the edge of the galaxy awaiting a future already planned for it. Leaders struggle for the planets survival, for this planet, Terminus, holds the future of the Human Race in its hands. Isaac Asimov tells the thrilling tale of human survival in an environment that is against it."
1,"Classic science fiction I remember walking to the library as a thirteen year old with my back pack, smile on my face between each of the foundation books. Now, I have read them over again (a few times) and the only difference is that I now own them so no more walks to the library."
1,"What a Great Read! This is really an incredible book! Steven Selengut has incorporated very creative insight with some highly original thinking to produce one of the best ""investing manuals"" ever written! I wholeheartedly endorse this book!"
1,HIS SYSTEM WORKS !!!!! Steve Selengut really knows his stuff. Follow his system andwatch your net worth GROW for a change!
1,"Getting Second Degree I'm going back for a second degree after 21 years. This book is very easy to understand and will make my class a lot easier and enjoyable. Great seller, quick shipping. I would highly recommend."
1,"FINALLY--A BOOK THAT TELLS HOW TO RAISE PEACEFUL KIDS If every parent had just one book on their nightshelf this should be the one. It's packed with simple, usable ideas I can use instantly to help my kids become decent human beings. The tips for helping kids stand up to bullies and learn to fight fair are worth the cost of the book alone. If more parents would read this book we really could minimize violence and raise peaceful kids. We should read this book together!"
1,"It's what we need... At a time when confusion seems to reign, Michele Borba's book is a ressuring tool that helps to keep our family grounded. I refer to it often and my husband and I use it as a conversation builder with our four children. This book was recommended to me by a fellow physician, and I have chosen to give copies of this book as gifts. Whether a new parent or a seasoned one, this book should be in every family's home."
1,"DIRTY HARRY MOVE OVER Imagine Dirty Harry with a bad coke habit, played by Nicolas Cage in New Orleans. Cage gives us an outstanding performance as someone who goes though those violent coke induced mood swings. The iguana which appears in the movie from time to time is symbolic of the metaphor ""monkey on the back."" Cage is investigating a brutal family execution and interweaves his personal failings into the process. His girlfriend is a prostitute who he protects and supplies drugs. He has a gambling habit, and owes money (bets too much on LSU) and of course steals from the evidence locker. He also shakes down people for information, even grandmothers. Makes Dirty Harry look like a sissy. Lots of drug use, bad language, sexual situations, and some violence. Good story. Plot fairly simple to follow. The movie, at time, has the feel of a dark comedy."
1,"Not for everyone, but if it's for you - you're in luck Arguably one of Werner Herzog's best films. Cage packs a punch with some intense acting. Of course it's edgy and not for everyone as well as pushes the limits of traditional film-making. Get tranced by extra-long shots of wildlife as the music trips you into a 'though-you-were on drugs' daze. Quirky humor, crazed rants and a man breaking all the rules in a wreckless but focused and effective way. I'm not one to watch movies more than once, but have seen this one at least three times."
1,"Underbelly Regency Style This book shocked me, educated me and was truly a page turner.I purchased this book as I am doing some research into the period and it didn't disappoint. The book focuses on the darker side of life which is present in every society in some form.If you are looking to understand our history and human nature you will discover that soccer hooliganism is nothing new."
1,"Lock Laces These stand up better than other types of elastic shoelaces. Once set, the lock does not slip and the shoes fit the same way always."
1,"funny bone laughter If you want to laugh and laugh hard this is the DVD to purchase, also this DVD will bring back memories of the late 70s when Tv comedy was at it's best.i give this DVD a 2+ thumbs up. Looking 2 purchase season 2 soon!!.."
1,first season of Three Company Loved Three's Company when I used to watch it on TV Land so I had to get the first season. Would love to eventually get all the seasons of it. It is a great comedy show not like the so called comedy today that I personally think should be called sick or dark comedy.
1,"great comedy. Another funny sitcom of the 70's it's still unbelievable that John Ritter a great and funny actor is gone, order the entire series it will crack you up."
1,great item we LOVE the classic tv series. this was one of the best. can't wait to buy the rest of the seasons.
1,"This is one of the best seasons. I love Three's Company, always have, always will! The first season is one of my favorite seasons and I love all the episodes but especially the episodes where Chrissie and Janet first meet Jack and the episode where Chrissie's conservative mother comes for a visit and she worries that her mother will be upset that one of her roommates is a man and that her mother will get the wrong idea about the living conditions. This season may be short with only having 6 episodes but it's still worth buying because the episodes are funny and Amazon is offering it at a great low price!"
1,"A OK ~ Three's Company Season 1 I'm glad Three's Company was put on DVD. It was a good show back in its days and it is still a good show. I can't wait to buy the Second Season when it comes out in the spring of 2004. If you have never seen any of the shows, I suggest you start watching and own this DVD. You won't stop laughing."
1,"Fun, Fun, Fun! I love this show!!! Ritter was a comedic genius as far as I am concerned. Everyone of the episodes on this disc is a real hoot for anyone that grew up watching reruns of the show. Give it a whirl and you won't be sorry. R.I.P John Ritter...We'll miss you."
1,"How Much Better Can This Get! I'm so glad this show is finally coming out on dvd. I've been waiting for it ever since MASH came out on dvd. Mash and Three's Company have always been my all time favorite shows and i'm only 20 years old. You can't get much better in John Ritter's physical comedy in Three's Company. He's probably the greatest actor/comedian to ever walk the face of this earth. And to hear of his passing tore a whole in my heart. I never got to meet the guy, but his tv performances helped me to generate a many a laught and I can't wait till i can get my hands on this dvd. It's a safe bet i'm gonna wear this dvd set out quickly as i did MASH. RIP Mr. John Ritter, but your awesome legacy will live on in my dvd player for years to come."
1,Delighfully Entertaining I've watched all the episodes a dozen times and I never get tired of watching these three. This show is definitely the best. I forget my worries and relieves me of the stress that everyone go through in their daily lives.
1,"jack, janet, and chrissy The first season of Three's Company. One of the funniest sitcoms around. The story of two girls, who need a roommate. After throwing a party (in the first episode) Janet and Chrissy find a man sleeping in their bathtub. . .eventually, they become roommates.A lot of storylines on the show revolved around misconceptions, and misunderstandings. The on-going joke that the landlord thinks that Jack is gay. In the first three seasons, the landlords are an older couple named The Ropers. And their on-going joke about him not wanting to sleep with her. Kind of like Al Bundy, on Married...with Children.Guaranteed many laughs. Rest in peace John Ritter."
1,"hilarious, thought provoking, very aware of todays society What a shame this book is no longer in print! I adore this book to its core. What a beautiful story.The text on the back said it was a hilarious comedy about god and the devil returning to earth to see what happened to creation, but as a matter of fact it is so much more. It is about society, it is about humanity, it is about downfall. And yes, it is extremely witty.I am so glad I found it at the shelves of my favorite second hand book shopping place. I do hope it will get back into print, so more people can enjoy this awesome tale."
1,"A great and useful tool! I bought this book on a whim because I had just found my interest in photography, and I was done reading it two days later! Garrett makes all the concepts of photography understandable to those without any prior knowledge! I even found myself going through the book again and jotting down notes about film speeds and filters for easy reference later! I cannot wait to try out the things I have learned from this wonderful book! I only wish I had more to read! I recommed this for anyone who thinks he would not be able to understand the concepts of photography and the camera. This book is not written on a technical level so make this the first photography book you buy!"
1,"Definately ""NOT"" more of the same Larry with great ""4"" piece horn section.Much, much different than the Larry Carlton/Steve lukather DVD, which is great.Who doesn't love a good horn section: Mark Douthit/T sax; Doug Moffet/Baritone; Mike Haynes/trumpet; Barry Green TromboneKeyboardist/Rick Jackson/phenomenal(same as Carlton/Lukather DVD), Moyes Lucas/drums/exceptional and none other than Travis Carlton/Bass/tight.Songs:Friday Night ShuffleNight SweatsJosieSapphire BluesMinute by MinuteJust an excuse7 for yaTenor MadnessSlightly DirtyDeep into itRoom 335sleepwalkextrasThis is great, but do NOT miss the new Larry and Tak DVD. That thing is just way too much. Phenomenal.No, I am not a Larry Carlton freak/affectionado/wierdo. I just love great concert DVDs."
1,"A must for membership staff! Excellent resource. Covers all the issues revolving around membership programs. Lots of specifics, examples and ideas;for membership staff, boards, and executives. Fills a major need for specific ways to carryout and improve membership programs. Great to have input from experts on a subject that so many non-profits grabble with everyday. Covers such essential membership topics as planning, membership and fund-raising, getting and keeping members, volunteers, the internet. Also helpful examples:of worksheets, budgets, and helpful case studies, plus software information.Truly ""an action plan for results."" Recommended highly."
1,"some groovy beats This is really good stuff. Strong uplifting beats with some serious funk thrown in, sketches of twisting melodies, beautiful airy vocal overtones. It's a lasting favorite that still hits all my get-up-and-groove reflexes."
1,"one more positive note Don't know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls, painted white and sealed against moisture, but I fussed with that or drywall. I considered my own sound issues and went with wood. But after reading some of the author's comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop. Not for me alone, but for my nieghbors as well. Good book to read before, during or contemplating a shop. Hey, we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well."
1,"What a great resource! As a library administrator, and avid woodworker, I get to see and read a lot of woodworking and shop building books. This is among the best I have ever read. I even purchased a copy of this one for myself. I was really impressed with all of the common-sense advice for day-to-day problems encountered in any workshop. Many of the other workshop books on the market are either too simplistic, or serve only to showcase famous woodworking shops without detail. This book gives all the nitty-gritty that you will need to set up or rework your dream shop. It definitely helped me."
1,"The credible source for authentic ninjutsu. There is no way anyone can truly say that they study or train ninjutsu without reading Stephen Hayes' material. He is probably the only reason that ninjutsu is accessable to the masses. His work and dedication to the art without being a fringe kook or a wacko give him the highest level of credibility. This is good stuff. His master, Masaaki Hatsumi is still alive and in Japan. There are no secrets--just verifiable truth waiting to be discovered. If you want your knowledge of ninjutsu/ninjitsu/ninpo etc. to be complete, you will buy his books."
1,Mad Max special edition This is the ultimate action movie and still after more than 20 years I really enjoy watching the film again. Max has to fight crazy motorbikers with his supercharger V8 car in the futuristic landscape. He give no mercy to the bad boys after they have killed of his family.
1,"Finally the Australian version. I first saw this movie in the theatre in 1980 or 81. I have purchased the VHS version and the DVD version as soon as they came out. Since then I have been searching for the Australian soundtrack version but to no avail. When I read on a Mad Max website that the Australian version was available, I bought it immediately. Man was I blown away. This was one of my favorite movies. Now it is my favorite! How they could have released this movie with the overdub is insane. It's like watching a brand new movie. Definitely worth the price of admission. Oh and there is no comparison between this movie and it's sequels. Road Warrior was okay but Thunderdome was a joke.Turkey."
1,"Cult Classic In the near furture, the high ways of tomorrow are no longer a safe place. Gangs of bikers and kamikaze lunatics roam the long stretches of road that populate the stretch of land known as the Austrailian outback. Mel Gibson soars as the tough futuristic cop Mad Max in this extreme action thriller that started it all. Amazing non-computerized stunts make this movie a treat to watch over and over again. After his wife is brutally murdered by an evil group of bikers, Max sets out on a crazed revenge, earning his heading ""Mad"". Grinding action sequences and Gibson's cool headed attitude make Han Solo look like second hand trash. Just like what Star Wars did for sci-fi, this movie revolutionized action movies for all time, setting the standard of today."
1,"The first the better ! A true action movie with Mel Gibson as "" vigilante "" after the death of his wife and son by mad bikers : truly a masterpiece !"
1,"One of the greatest Arthur tales ever. This is the book I read as a child and loved, then read again as a man and loved more. It is part of how I see the King Arthur legend. I will never part with my copy, and I will read it to my son when I have one."
1,"Funny This movie has the little girl from Matilda and Martin Short. Good family picture , we loved it. Came in excellent condition!"
1,"Trout Does it Again! Like all of their CD's, Trout fishing in America has done it again! Fun, entertaining music that is great for adults, kids...whomever!Trout continues to be one of my favorite groups out there-- it's amazing that they do not get more national publicity."
1,MAGIC Great looking toy. I have Magic doing his no-look-pass pose towards my other Lakers greats. Good size and similar resemblance to the Magic man.
1,"ORGASM OF THE WORD Burroughs searches in his writing for the same thing he searched for in drug use, sex and the russian roulette games he played with his guns: to try and distill out of an experience the pure essence of what it means to be alive, that single moment of ecstasy when living is made real in a blinding flash. Through graphic imagery of sex and death Burroughs will play you like a miscreant attacking a cathedral pipe organ, pulling out all the stops, feet pounding all the pedals at once, hands stomping the keys, blasting the pipes. In that rush of noise he challenges you to find the whisper of truth. A Liturgy and Scripture for the Damned."
1,"Gather in the Nets Burroughs drags in the nets he has held out for fifty years or so and sorts out the information he has gathered. In his most lucid, almost straight forward prose (inspired by Denton Welch), Burroughs puts forward a trilogy -Cities of the Red Night, Place of Dead Roads, and The Western Lands- with all his loves and hates, and serves them in his most favourite genres from childhood up: Pulp Dectective; Sci Fi; Pirates; High School Theatre; Egyptian; and others.Naked Lunch may have messed with you, but it never infiltrated your thinking as much as these books will. I think the deceptively simple language and 'sense' of 'narrative continuity' help to disarm and act as a Trogan Horse.If you are easily offended you may want to skip Burroughs altogether, though, in that case, I suspect you need him to unsettle your morals, just a little, so you can reflect on your position."
1,Awesome! This was the first novel I've read by Shari MacDonald. It was great. She ranks right up there with Lori Wick and Lori Copeland. This is a must read.
1,It was the best Night World book! Compared to all the night world books this one is the best! I love how Rasheal is so brave and finds her soulmate while fighting vampires.
1,"I LOVE THIS BOOK! Of all the books that L. J. has written in this series, ""The Chosen"" is by far the best. I have read all nine of the currently published books(and am still eagerly awaiting the tenth). This book has the wonderful premise of the previous and subsequent books. However, it also has main characters with more depth than many characters in other novels and realistic motives. Rashel and Quinn spend most of the book trying to ignore their feelings for eachother and trying to kill eachother. Both things are something that the other books really lack. Niether readily admit to bieng soulmates. The two characters fellings towards the members of Circle Daybreak coin the term ""damned Daybreakers.""All of these things and their depth of character contribute to make this a great book rather than a marginally good book as the other books in this series have been."
1,Dog rescue I really loved this book. It made you laugh and made you sad. I wish I could have the courage to rescue dogs in the same manner as Randy Grim does. Truly inspiring stories.
1,"Life as a dog A fascinating account of one man's crusade to rescue the stray dogs of St. Louis, this book gives us incredible insight into the issues surrounding the stray animal problem in this country. I learned more than I knew there was to know about feral dogs and their place in our society. But this book is not just about dogs - the lessons learned could just as easily be applied to the ""capture"" and ""saving"" of all the other strays found in our cities--including those lost & homeless children who have become so commonplace. The behaviors they exhibit are scarily similar to those described by Randy Grim in this book. A gripping tale and one which should be read by anyone interested in the plight of all the strays of the world."
1,"truly beautiful Marie Curie's youngest daughter Eve has given us a gift by writing this biography of her mother. Eve manages to let us into her mother's private world while inspiring our full respect of her privacy. Madame Curie and her husband Pierre exemplify the meaning of the word integrity - a rarity, especially in our culture of constantly searching for fame and wealth at all cost. I will read this book multiple times like visiting a friend and learning a bit more about this remarkable person each time."
1,"Fantastic When my doctor gave me a choice between crutches or a walker, I chose walker. My uncle had one of these and offered me its use. I loved the ease of its smooth gliding wheels and especially the hand brake. I never felt like it was getting away from me. The compartment was handy for traveling around with a book, meds, etc. and doubled as a seat when I was tired and had to rest. I think this is the best walker on the market!"
1,Great Puzzle This is an excellent puzzle for very young children. Melissa & Doug products are well made and kids love them. This puzzle is wooden so kids wont destroy it if they try to roughly put the pieces in. The design is adorable and makes a great gift for any young animal lover.
1,Very pretty and good quality My two year absolutely loves puzzles and this has been a great addition to our collection.. It's sturdy and I don't think she'll be able to wear it out or break it.
1,"Really great shoes I love these shoes. I live in Dubai where it is currently hotter than you can imagine, yet I have 2 dogs that need daily walks. I wanted something that gave me comfort and support while walking but without the heat of socks and shoes. I bought these shoes last week and have worn them every day since. They are so supportive yet comfortable, I feel like i could run in them, yet I barely feel like I'm wearing anything! This was my first pair of Merrells - over the week I bought 2 more pairs :)"
1,"This cd is worthy of 100 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think Evita is the best music piece ever. Madonna and Antonio Banderas are the best Evita and Che. This musical is probably the only one where I listen to EVERYTHING. Even tracks like ""A Cinema in Bueonos Aires"" even though it is not even music."
1,EVITA SOUND TRACKS I ordered the sound tracks for the film Evita since the 1st of Dec.'07 I am still waiting for it to be delivered. I have been a long time customer of Amazon and I've never had any problems with deliveries before. The item ordered was meant to be a Christmas present. Since it's not here where is it? I need an answer please...P.S Happy New Year to you all.Chas>>>>>
1,"Great movie and soundtrack I loved the movie EVITA and rented it so many times, the movie store eventually sold it to me. The songs are upbeat and there's a variety, so it kept my attention. Banderas and Madonna made a great pair!"
1,"Reliable I bought this printer for my son's new computer which runs XP. No problem loading the software, no paper jams, no problems at all. For [the money]including the USB cable. I am still using an HP Deskjet 540 that I bought with my Packard Bell Pentium 75mHz over 6 - 8 years ago. The PB is gone, but the HP lives on and on and on. That's says a lot. New print heads with each cartridge I think is the way to go. Will use 825 mostly for text, but having printed a photo, it compares fairly well with my Epson 780 with glossy paper."
1,"ordered used received new I ordered an used copy and received a brand new one. Mistake? I don't know. Quick shipment and delivery. For about $10 I am very happy with this purchase.I bought it for school, and the content is interesting.I was surprized by the size of this book. It is almost like a pocket book"
1,Great value I love how high it gets - I have bad knees and have trouble getting up from a position where my knees are bent more than 90 degrees - and it is so easy to set up
1,As comfy as a regular bed Bought this for my summer cottage for extra guests. Very comfortable. Great size and built in Air Pump made it a breeze to inflate. The Velour top was also a great plus. Would reccommend highly.
1,"Fantastic Bed I bought this bed, for my niece who was visiting. The bed was so simple to put air in it, took about 3 minutes or less and very comfortable, did not have to put more air in it the whole weekend. It was much better than the Aerobed, and cost less. I have been through three of them, which didnt last past two years. It was well worth the purchase, will buy another one. Fast shipping too."
1,Great Product A++++++ It fills up really fast and is a sweet bed. Best Airbed ever!!!! A must buy item.... Fast shipping as well =)
1,Great Product. I sleep on this until I got a real mattress. Great for allergies. Will keep it in the car in case I spend the night at the kids house.
1,"Comfortable, Inflates Beautifully Does everything I expected it to. The built in pump works perfectly (for both inflation and deflation), and it hasn't sprung a leak on me yet."
1,Perfect for me I like itI was looking for it I found it I got and I am enjoying it to the fullestI recommend it to anyone
1,Excellent product! I was very happy with the airbed that I chose - it met all my expectations - service was excellent.
1,"Best Bed for the Buck For the price, this air mattress is a great bargain. Inflates fast, deflation is done via the fan motor which speeds up the process, compact and light, easy to store.....I highly recommend this as quick and easy way to accommodate the need for an extra bed."
1,"Air Bed Twin Size This item arrived on within just a matter of a few days. It sure did serve its purpose. It took about a minute to inflate and deflate I am very pleased with this product. Would buy from seller again, definitly."
1,Awesome!! I love how quickly inflates & deflates! Maintains fullness throughout the night! Love that's it's raised high enough for getting in & out of bed! Very easy to store away. Love the tote in which you can carry to anywhere you may need to travel. Totally recommend it!!
1,"Aerobed saves the day (and night) with comfortable sleep alternative! I ordered the aerobed for visiting guests, and they loved it. Also, it fit nicely in my space-challenged unit. Shipping was great! Price was great! all happy campers."
1,"Good quality bed I bought this to use whilst staying at my sister in laws house for a couple weeks around Christmas. This bed is awesome! It pumps up very quickly and is comfortable and big enough. My nephew is 6ft and 220 pounds and I'm 5'5 and 140 pounds and we could both lay on this whilst watching a movie with no problems. I used it for 2 weeks and only inflated it slightly on the second day, I think the material stretched a little during my first nights sleep to break it in and thats why it seemed like it lost air. After the second day I never had to refill it. I left it there when I went home and my nephews are still using it and love it more than their regular beds."
1,"No complaint Really good product. For this price, I give it a 5. Very comfortable and easy to use. You do have to refill the air after two nights though."
1,What a deal! This is an incredible air mattress. We purchased this for a last minute house guest. It was shipped quickly. The mattress itself is very nice and comfortable. And the automatic pump makes blowing up and deflating a breeze!!! I would highly recommend to anyone needing an air mattress
1,Thank You I bought this for my daughter to use when she visits. She found it was so comfy that it was hard getting her out of it at all. It came packaged nicely & was exactly as described on Amazon. Very pleased!
1,"Excellent product! One of the best air mattresses I've owned. Extremely easy to fill and let the air out, just plug in and flip a switch. I like that it's all one unit, the plug and air in/out take is attached and hidden in a compartment. It's comfortable and does not loose air, even over an extended period of time."
1,Most Excellent Love it! this bed fits the bill. my guess like it compliments on how comfortable it is. Easy to inflate and store. An excellent buy in my book. The built in pump is a super feature.
1,"Great extra bed or travel bed I took this with me on a vacation for our guest to use. But, it is so comfortable that it turned out that I used it the whole week and gave the guest the actual regular mattress bed and used this air mattress instead. I have used it for 3 different 1 week vacations and have had no problems with it. It even deflates electrically so it fits back into the travel bag it came with. Amazing deal."
1,"Scout Mom -B'ham I needed this for a Scout outing, had no idear about air mattress. I wanted something easy to carry and not to many items. This air mattress is true to it's word. Just like my home bed, comfort and ease of sleeping. Ease for filling and letting air out. Going to order another one that is larger."
1,"Bueno Good afternoon I would inform them that the item was received in perfect conditions, and they estimated the time, so I give the maximum score. thanks"
1,"Easy to inflate - comfortable I bought one and it was so easy to use and quick to inflate, that I ended up buying one for a family member as well. The pump is build right into the mattress so you don't have to worry about misplacing the pump as with many other air mattresses. Inflates in just a few minutes and the pump is not as loud as other pumps I've had in the past."
1,"the band you've heard their music, now hear their words. this dvd gives insight into an extrordinary album of the early 70's; a release that was polar opposite to much of the musical landscape of the era. timeless tunes created by five talented musicians. the joy on levon helm's face is rich as he recounts how the harmonies of himself, richard manuel and rick danko were structured. an impromtu version of unfaithful servant performed by rick is just as emotionally poignant now, as it was on the lp. a couple keyboard demos by garth hudson is both pythonesque, and accomplished keyboardist, in it's scope. and with much less screen time compared to the last waltz, robbie robertson has a word or two as well. after viewing this dvd, cue up the band's lp on the turntable, or tray in the cd, and relive this great work once more!"
1,"Amazing! I'm 24 years old and have never had an orgasm. It's not that it's not enjoyable, it definitely feels good, but I've just never been able to get to that state. I've had sex with enough men and tried doing it on my own, it just never worked. Then I finally did something about it and ordered this item. It was my first toy. Within 2 minutes I had my first orgasm. WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO TRY A TOY?!?!? :p Now I just have to get a few more toys and introduce them to my sex life with my boyfriend...hopefully he won't mind ^_^"
1,"jack rabbit totally comfortable, and extremely sensual i love it.i adore the bunny ears and the controls are super easyi recommend for any woman looking for comfortable, intense pleasure (:"
1,"OMG! What can I say?! I absolutely CANNOT believe how wonderful this product is! I own 5 toys and this one by far is my favorite! I have no regrets or complaints when it comes to me purchasing this product. It certainly gets the job done, and quick too. I have never had to use it for more than a few minutes, its amazing! It has 3 speeds of vibration for clit stimulation, 3 speeds of rotation in the shaft, you can change the direction in which it rotates, and it is completely submergeable! It even has a bumpy texture on the shaft to stimulate the g-spot. As far as batteries go, they do not have to be replaced very often either. This is a very well thought out invention and I can't think of any ways to improve it!"
1,Wife loves this toy! We were a little hesitant to add a toy of this nature to our collection but the wife absolutely loves this one!
1,Amazing! This was my second toy and I love it! As soon as it arrived I tried it out. I highly recommend this! It is worth the $28.06 and shipping. I've never had an orgasm that powerful (:
1,"So Good, I Bought Another I bought this to replace the same item I'd purchased 2 years ago from Amazon and, after many, many uses, burnt out the vibe portion of the toy.This product is slightly thicker than average rabbits, but definately not oversized. The motor is quiet and VERY effective, almost too much so; my husband and I like to use it during playtime, but I find I often have to turn it down or off to hold back a little...Don't hesitate to purchase this; at this price point, it's the best you can get!"
1,"A ""Must Have"" for any FleetwoodMac Fan!!! By far, one of the best videos I've ever purchased. This video takes each band member down memory lane and you get a wonderful inside scoop to what was really going on behind the scenes making Rumors. Stevie, Christine, Lindsey, John & Mick tell of how their very personal struggles with each other had to be put aside for the survival of the band. With all the emotions running in high gear, no wonder this was their best album yet. I had to watch it a couple of times...Remarkable video about a remarkable band."
1,"excellent This DVD is fanstatic, the interviews are great the band has made it through all the tough times, they are going to have with each other and come out the other side.This insight to this classic album is just great a wonderful look, into their lives and problems they where having at the time.Now we can rely see and hear the rumours album the way it was.Now all that needs to happen, is for the record company to get off there back sides and re-issue the cd digitally remastered. While there at it do a new greatest hits digitally remastered, would be great too."
1,"Awsome documentary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you love the Stevie and Lindsey era your going to love this CD!!! This is jam packed with interview with the entire band, how they got started, and all the ups and downs thru the years."
1,"It's all good! This timer is AWESOME! It's very easy to install, and because it operates on a 9 volt battery, I won't hafta replace as often as my old timer that used 3 AAs"
1,"Solid water timer I first bought a Ray Padula deluxe water timer.Returned that because it was terrible.Couldn't even keep time!Cheap cheap cheap.Ordered a couple of these and so far impressed.Quality feel and function, made in Germany.I had no problems programming this, very logical.Worked perfectly so far.No comparison to the Ray Padula Time It Deluxe Water Timer.The Claber is like a Mercedes, the Padula, a Kia.But, that is really unfair to Kia.Spend the extra few dollars and return it if I'm wrong."
1,"If I was stranded on a desert island with one album... If I was stranded on a desert island with one album it would be this one. One deep complex song after another. Put on the headphones, close your eyes and take a trip into a world where the beat never ends and melodies play with your emotions."
1,"Under Italy's Skin Virginia Ryan gives what no standard travel book could even approach: the authentic feel, taste and emotions of Italy, all interwoven in a fascinating personal story. It reads like a novel, yet takes you into an Italy that few tourists could hope to glimpse. Frances Mayes pales in comparison. I'd recommend it for anyone going to Italy, or who would like to go there in their armchair. It's a great, adventurous, authentic read. I loved it."
1,"Motifs for stitchers This is a wonderful book: the spiral bound format makes it perfect to work from. The motifs themselves are clearly presented and lend themselves to stitching on all manner of items.From bookmarks to babywear, from towels to tableclothes: there is something here for every stitcher!Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
1,"Highly recommended In this extremely useful book for understanding the poetry of Wallace Stevens, Lensing effortlessly traces the poet's life and development as those were important in determining the sort of writer Stevens would become. Many Stevens poems are explicated in terms of their original context, and a lot of fascinating information is provided about the nature of the poetry ""establishment"" of the early 20th century, and how important such sponsorship and networking was for Stevens' emergence as a major voice.This book deserves much more attention from Stevens fans that it seems to enjoy. It is very well written, a work of erudition and scholarship that avoids the all of the pedantry and other typical negatives of its genre. If you're a reader of Stevens, this is a book well worth owning."
1,"Brings Pogroms & Antisemitism into a sharp perspective. Potok, a master of the written word and an accomplished artist, recreates New York ""ghetto-life"" and makes it live through the eyes and life of a young boy growing up in New York between the two World Wars. The sensitive reader will experience unthinking hate, intolerance, love, intellect, and most of all, the perserverance of the human spirit--a vividly painted portrait of human existence and spirituality."
1,"The Gentle, Sensitive Intellectual Averse to books (and movies) with gratuitous sex and violence? Try Chaim Potok. His books tend to honor the gentle, sensitive intellectual (see Elaine Aron's writings on highly sensitive people). In this book, you follow the childhood of David Lurie, a Jewish boy growing up in 1930s and '40s Bronx (New York). An early injury leaves him physically weak and vulnerable to teasing, but his scholarly talents, vivid imagination, and tight-knit community allow him to grow into a fine young adult with the courage to forge his own way, even when that means challenging some of the religious values of his family and friends."
1,"A smart analysis of an understudied aspect of culture The movie industry in India is the world's largest. Steve Derne's book takes this idea and runs with it, using the film industry as a lens for focusing on Indian men's ideas about gender. It's a commonplace that, while people might not talk about their personal attitudes with a stranger, they are more than willing to discuss similar issues in their favorite films, and thus this report (as the very good previous review shows) reveals some surprising insights about how Indian men perceive the construction of masculinity.This book, unlike many sociological texts, is both scholarly and readable, and would make a good addition to undergraduate or graduate courses in area and gender studies. Highly recommended."
1,"PERFECT! This item came earlier than expected! It is everything I wanted and more! I speak Italian, so it was easy to read the instructions. You can change it to English if you like...SUPER SIMPLE! GRAZIE!"
1,"It challenged me to take ""my game"" of life up another notch ""A great book that motivates you to reflect on your current life and challenges you to be and do better. It made me wonder what people at my funeral would say to each other about me and the inpact I had on them, others, my profession and my community. It challenged me to take ""my game"" of life up another notch to live my life in a way that I can be proud of my signature work."""
1,"Dianna Booher is a great life coach Those most likely to read this book will be those who are basically good people and they want to be even better. This book will help them. Those who Should read this book are all people who need a shot in the arm, a feeling of hope, a renewed sense of self confidence. This book will transform them!Dianna Booher is a unique thought leader in the field of personal and professional growth. She not only knows and lives the concepts, she also fully understands the steps to take. And she shows the rest of us the paths in her many wonderful works. The sports metaphor used to structure the book gives it a refreshing and memorable flow. You will love the book and like yourself even better after reading it."
1,"That wonderful laugh! Many here have commented how more relaxed Barbra appears to be on this live performance disc compared to earlier ones.No where is this more evident than in the many instances you hear her infectious, lilting laugh.As a student of Ms. Streisand I always treasued those brief moments of hearing that laughter on earlier concert recordings.She says she has been enjoying the concert tour and all that heartfelt laughter we hear is testament to that fact. But I guess it's not surprising that someone who sings so gloriously laughs so gloriously also."
1,"BABS IS WELL AND STILL A HEAVY HITTER!! Streisand: Live In Concert (2 CD's)Her voice is stronger than ever. She's obviously had work done but still looks like an incredible diva. Surprisingly, her numbers with Il Divo are terrific and they are choreographed so she is like a Greek goddess and they are her chorus. It's also nice she does old songs from ""Funny Girl"" that she has never performed in concert before. A must have CD set at any price."
1,Like Buttah! Saw Barbra in Atlanta and this is a wonderful album to bring back the memory of an unforgettable experience! I just hope there is a DVD planned!
1,Streisand: Live in Concert (2 CD's) This is one of the best CD's of all her concerts. I was lucky enough to go to her concert in Los Angeles and it was fantastic. The CD makes you feel as if you are there listening to her wonderful voice. ILDivo performs and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a Streisand fan.
1,"A pocket encyclopedia of writing style Bring your style reference everywhere you write. An unbeatable classic. Every time I open it up, I find something to use in what I'm working on."
1,"OMG.....THIS FILM IS SOOOO WORTH UR $$$ I, personally, am not a lesbian. I would recommend this movie to any of the ""GaY Phobia"" people. The fact that Mirren turns out to be a lesbian has no baring on the emotions you will express while watching this film. It has a wonderful cast of characters and exceptional use of words. I would recommend this to anyone 13 yrs or older, of any gender, and any sexual prefrence."
1,"Great monitor! I've been using this monitor for about 2 weeks now. Easy to set up, works great! No dead pixels. I'm using the analog input for my old PC and the DVI input for me new PC. Even my 7 year old PC looks great on this using the analog input! Minor complaint: have to hit a few menu buttons to toggle between analog and DVI inputs, wish there was a toggle button so it could be done in a single push. Haven't used the built-in speakers yet. The monitor tilts up and down just fine. Overall, great monitor!"
1,Surprised This is my first Madeleine Wickham's book that I have read and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was! It was a slow start but once I got into it I couldn't put it down!!! I will definitely read more of her books!!!
1,"LOVED IT! I must say that I was very impressed with ""Cocktails for Three!"".You read about the tales of 3 best friends who meet at a Manhattan Bar the same night every month. They get to catch up on everything that is going on with their lives.Maggie is pregnant. Roxanne has been dating a married man for 6 years. Candice has such a warm heart and can't seem to say ""NO.""The end of the book will throw you for a loop. As other reviews have said, you will not see it coming.This book kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next to the (3) characters. I am sure that you will be able to identify a personal friend of yours for Maggie, Roxanne and Candice. I was able to finish in just (1) day which is rare for me.I can't wait to check out Wickman's other two books.Enjoy!"
1,"My Favorite Shakespeare The language wraps you up and transports you to a time and land like no other. It's full of love, hate, brutality, and loyalty. All these emotions get tangled up and mixed together. That lends itself to an amazing set of circumstances. There is no greater love story than Juliet and her fair Romeo. All other love stories are measured against this one and you will get lost in this classics story. It's a true classic."
1,"True Love The play's setting is the Italian city of Verona where Romeo and Juliet, the star-crossed lovers, face authorianism with a blood feud between each other's family, the Montegues and the Capulets. At a feast, Romeo notices and is struck by Juliet's beauty. At the first opportunity he approaches her; they fall in love immediately. Only after parting do they learn that they belong to rival families. The two exchange vows and decide to marry the next day, expecting that they will bring peace to the feuding families. Many deaths resulted from this relationship. Romeo and Juliet is one of the best romantic stories in history which motivated many people to rethink hatred against one another. It captures the essence of true love."
1,this book makes it very easy to understand the writing in this book. this book makes it so much easier to understand the context of this book. there are definitions of some of the words that are almost impossible to understand. there are character explainations as well. very good version for a student!
1,"Best play ever! This is definitely the best play of all time! If you have never read it, then you should as soon as possible!"
1,A Old Novel It a old novel but a good one that u can more then one time. A lot school use it for English reading.
1,"Shakespeare&#65533;s books are complicated and awful! The first time I read one of Shakespeare book was at school, I thought is was going to be amazing because he is one of the most recognised writers in history. But I couldn't understand anything; it has a very old and complicated language that young people can't understand well enough. I think that all that style is very complex for us, older people could understand it well and enjoy it. But in that case I would only recommend it to women, I really don't think men will like all that kind of love stories as this one, where two people are strongly in love and that is a forbidden one by their families. I recognise that is has a very good ending but that's all. This is my personal opinion, you may like it. I have my respect for William Shakespeare but I think he is awful."
1,Great book This book not only a classic but a real journey(not really but just saying) the only thing I dislike about this book is the names at the sides. If you are looking for a script this is the best thing told use. Plus at the book defines some uncommon words with numbers beside them that are defined in the next page. A true five star book!
1,An Amazing Compilation I stumbled upon this set one day at a store and I initially purchased it based on some of the familiar artists on the track listing. What I had purchased turned out to be probably the best compilation of downtempo music I've ever heard. From start to finish on both discs I can't turn it off. If you're not enjoying it directly the compilation makes for excellent background music if you're having friends over to enjoy some drinks. I recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of downtempo music.
1,Was great shape. Like new just little wear around the edges the binding does not have a crease and pages are cripse. Over all I'm very happy.
1,Fabulous I bought the pillow covers and the mattress covers and they are great. They wash and dry well and do exactly the job they should.....protecting pillows and mattresses.
1,"breathtaking Even though, this album was not critics' favorite, give it a try. You'll be mesmerized! Its pulsating hypnotic melodies will drive you to the ecstasy and force you to listen to it again and again. I must admit that by being Yello's fan I can not be very objective in describing their work. But after so many years since I've heard album for the first time and after so many changes in my personal taste in the popular music, it is still one of my favorites. It is quite simply THE BEST CD TO LISTEN IN THE CAR by any artist. And hey, if all you know about Yello is infamous OH YEAH, consider this: it is not even in the best five of this album. What can I say more! Enjoy."
1,"Consecrated Masterpiece. I got goosebumps in 1987 the first time I heard Dr. Van Steiner @ 1'26"", still today in 2011 the same.Let me take this CD to heaven."
1,"Another Roundup of His Classics If you're a long time Jobim fan (or just a fan of music) - you'll have all these tracks scattered across various CD's and LP's - if you want a roundup of his some of his greatest romantic/chill/ lounge and quiet bossa tracks - this is really another greatest hits package. The version of DINDI is backed by Astrud Gilberto. Elis Regina joins him on a couple tracks also. For longtime fans who might want a convenient CD to put in the car or have ready a romantic evening CD with his ""quiet"" classics, no reason not to add this to your collection. For new fans, this is a great starter CD but you'll be buying many more of Jobim's - no reason not to start with this one :-)"
1,Excellent Resource on Problem Pregnancy I have worked in an abortion clinic for over twenty years and Anne Baker's work is required reading for all new counselors on our staff. In addition her book is an excellent resource for the seasoned counselor. Her expertise and sensitivity in dealing with a host of patient issues relating to abortion becomes apparent in the first few pages of this manual. She also manages to provide useful guidelines to help clinic staff deal with the special stresses involved in working in an abortion clinic.
1,"Your child's self esteem well, what can i say? i love it because i needed it, i do believe the seller should have given the book more credit, they should have categorized it VERY good, in the ""condition"" it was.. i am more than please, i started reading it for class already and i actually did grow fond of this book its very interesting and filled with knowledge!"
1,"Strongly recommend it I am half way through the book and am enjoying every page of it. The author seems to be enlightened as well, which makes the read more enjoyable. God bless her soul. My condolensces to her loved ones (she seems to have passed away on Sep 21, 2012)."
1,NOT YOUR TYPICAL CHARLES MANSON/HELTER SKELTER BOOK MANSON IN HIS OWN WORDS ALLOWS YOU THE READER TO SEE THINGS FROM MANSON'S POINT OF VIEW. I WAS IMPRESSED HOW CHARLES MANSON DID NOT DOWN PLAY HIS ROLE IN ANY OF HIS HORRIBLE CRIMES. HE OWNED UP TO THEM AND REALISTICALLY POINTS OUT HOW HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONTENT SPENDING HIS LIFE BEHIND BARS. HE ALSO ALLOWS THE READERS TO SEE HOW THE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WERE IN FACT RESPONSIBILE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS. I'VE READ MANY BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE MANSON FAMILY AND I MUST SAY THIS WAS DEFINETELY A WELCOME DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW ON THE SUBJECT.
1,"Great Ep this rocks they are right now one of the best bands out. Mirror Spirit is one of the best songs to come out in a long time. The only band out that is better then these guys right now is silvertide, and possibly Rose Hill Drive. Sounds like classic 70's 60's rock and roll. The singer has a great voice, I believe his name is Eric Shea and there lead guitarist is a girl but she can really play. Expect to see these guys again because this completly rocks out. Rock and Roll is here to Stay.down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.The DarknessJetHurricane PartyParchman Farm (Only have an ep out but it rocks and you can find it here on amazon.)Rose Hill Drive ( have an ep out but not on amazon. They toured with Van Halen and completly rock and the guitarist is incredible.)SupagroupTokyo DragonsYoung Heart AttackBlack Keysand the best new band Silvertide"
1,"Comfort This earset must be tried; it is nothing like what you used as a kid. It fits well, is light and guess what - no hands!"
1,Great book I enjoyed this book. I needed to read a book like this. There are feelings I need to change about myself and this book made me realize it.
1,"Hard SF makes a comeback After many years wandering lost amid fantasy mislabeled SF, and turning in desperation to the oldies but goodies written by Niven, Zelazny, and their ilk, I stumbled onPushing Ice. Fabulous! Enough explanation that this non-physics major can follow (or pretend to), with plenty of action. The typical male failure (sorry, guys) to track character development, but it is quite possible (sorry, girls) for a woman to hold an implacable grudge for 50 years or even 18,000. 5 stars for the pleasure to read some really good, and new, hard SF."
1,"A vortex of ideas.... Other reviewers mention technologies and relationship to previous stories. Yes, but I would add that Pushing Ice is a major novel featuring complex, believable female protagonists. They deal with frustration and competition on an intellectual level; in a first-contact story, there is a lot of both. People change only gradually (clinging to old beliefs) as the universe changes drastically around them.Several chapters build toward crises, and I hesitated to start the next because some character faced certain defeat. But few disappeared, and new scientific concepts are thereby introduced. The last chapter really does not end the tale- you will find yourself wondering what the crew of Rockhopper will encounter next. This book really pulls you into their lives."
1,Great Book! I am a huge Dali fan and this is another one of those books that gives a great insight into the man's thoughts and feelings.
1,"This was a terrific book!!!! I have read many books about the Lindbergh kidnapping. I feel Lloyd Gardner's book is thoroughly and thoughtfully researched. I have read it twice carefully and each time I read it I discovered new information. Who was John Condon? Why did Violet Sharpe commit suicide? Why did Lindbergh act so strangely the night of March 1,1932? Does a parent call his attorney before calling the police when he suspects his 20 month old child is missing? There are so many bizarre events surrounding the disappearance of the Lindbergh baby that it is no surprise that Lloyd Gardner titled his book ""The Case That Never Dies"". The trial was a farce and a circus: an embarrassment to the State of New Jersey. Read it!!!!"
1,"Amazing wealth of info Almost 500 pages! The author, Fritz Springmeier, shares a tone of info that's mind blowing. It may not all be 100% true yet just a fraction of it being true is astounding. A highly recommended read.This book, though out of print, is freely available in PDF format, at the time of writing this review. If you search for its title on Yahoo there will be some links showing the PDF format for download. One of the sites it can be found on is ministryoflies-com.Springmeier also has a one hour video that can be freely watched. It's also under the same title as the book, and can be better found by searching with Google in the Video section of the search options. It's not as comprehensive as the book but worthwhile. God bless."
1,"Great Book This is a really great Animal Ark Pets book. A new boy named Jack moves into Welford. Mandy and James know he's sad so they try to get him to adopt a rabbit, but Jack doesn't want one. Then at a picnic the rabbit is in danger. Will Jack be able to save him in time?"
1,"REALLY RECOMMEND! I just bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it and is playing with it every day! She was very excited pulling out the puppies to see how many the mommy would have. I would really recommend this toy, especially to those who love puppies!"
1,"If you want to buy an edition of this album, this is the one When it was announced that this remastered CD version would reveal new things to even the most accustomed Klaatu fan, I was skeptical. Then I heard it. No other CD edition comes remotely close to this one! My only, _singular_ gripe is that an extra crossfade was added between True-Life Hero and Doctor Marvello (which the band insists was wanted by them ever since the first days of the album, and that they had passed on it on the original release simply because they had maxxed out their studio's capacities). Apart from that, this is an amazing reissue! And now that Hope is ready and on its way, I'm looking forward to hearing that remastered issue as well. Unreal!...Oh, and the album is really great as well. They're _not_ the Beatles, time has proven us that... but this album is worthy of the Beatles moniker! Sun King it is."
1,"A Summary of George and Joy Adamson's work This is a great summary program about all of the work George and Joy Adamson did. It features Elsa, Boy, Christian, and the lives and personalities of George and Joy. A lot of perspective from Mrs. McKenna who played Joy in the film."
1,A Mostly True Adventure One of my top books of my 7 decades of reading! Love the way it's told in the voice of the 13-year-old. Great descriptions of the French setting in the country!!
1,"Absolutely awesome service and product I ordered this card yesterday (19 Oct 2006) and received it today (20 Oct 2006), free shipping with Prime - excellent service.The card?I installed it in my Quicksilver in 3 minutes and 2 minutes later my USB 2.0 300GB external disk drive was screaming through a complete backup.No need to go to the vendor's web site for drivers - Tiger supports it out of the box. Superb value."
1,"Perfectly Imperfect If you can only afford one Ella songbook set, make Ellington the one. Ella and Duke are perfectly matched. Having her sing with the composer is a unique feature of this set. There is an exuberant spontaneity here which is unmatched by any other songbook album. This mean that there are some imperfections and improvisations, and that's what jazz is. The material is fabulous. The obvious reciprocal adoration and respect of these two legends permeate everything. It is one of the all time great jazz albums ever. Not to be missed."
1,"THE MOST UNUSUAL IN THE SONGBOOK SERIES Even if i could have done without the third disc,this tribute to DUKE ELLINGTON really hits home ,and is a must buy for anyone interested in these two legends of jazz.ELLA takes more chances here than in previous and later records of the series ,and this is probably due to DUKE himself who took an active part by creating new songs and rearranging a few of his classics.CARAVAN shows ELLA in a rare sensual mood ,and does she delivers?All the well known songs of ELLINGTON are present, from MOOD INDIGO to SOPHISTICATED LADY.The only songbook celebrating a non BROADWAY composer was indeed worth its price."
1,"Why isn't there a 6-star rating? Well... I really despise reading. I hate it with a passion. There has never been a time when I decide to just ""pick up a book"" for a good time, I usually won't even consider that in my plans. However, a few summers ago I picked up King Rat. And I picked it up again a few weeks later. I lost it, but bought it last summer. I finished it in a weekend because I just couldn't put it down. I read it again a couple weeks ago. Every time you finish that book, something just comes over you, I swear it. It's the most amazing book I have ever, or will ever read in my entire life. Now that that's done, I can go paint my nails."
1,"KIng Rat, tied with Shogun, is the best of Clavell's Asian.. King Rat, tied with Shogun, is the best of Clavell's Asian Saga. He incorporated, and illustrated the very core of what it is to be a man. What makes this book an instant classic, is the simple, yet horrific, setting. Also, Clavell was able to fill each page with such meaning, he didn't have to make a several-hundred-page-behemoth of a book in order to digest the meaning within it. Compelling was the depth that a man falls to in such a desolate existance, and the measures required to lift a man up to some degree of dignity. For his ability to depict the strength of charicter of this western man in asia, Clavell has earned a place of honor among the great novellest of our time."
1,"Enjoyed Reading It! I found this to be a very entertaining and insightful book. That the author lived through the experience is clear as one reads. Although some of the subplots died off with no explanation and the ending was a bit anticlimactic, overall it kept me turning the pages and I finished it in two days. Some of the dialogue remains with me to this day like from a dying man:(paraphrasing here) ""From nothing and into nothing with 22 years in-between, seems kind of pointless doesn't it?"" I recommend this book as one any fan of WWII fiction should read."
1,This is one of the best novels ever writen. I rated this book as high as book godfather and brave new world !
1,"Love Mozart Loved the documentary about Mozart. I learned things I never knew about him. Too bad he died so young, can you imagine the amount of music he could have written?"
1,"Children like this book My children (ages 5-10) love this book. I have also read from this book to hospitalized teenagers; when I read Oedipus I finished the story and heard a chorus of ""read it again!""I noticed that some of the reviews posted here say that this book is unsuitable for children, but I wonder if the reviewers actually tried reading the book to them."
1,"Put Ramsey in Your Musical Stocking It was never offically Christmas until my mother hooked up the Jingle Bells door chime and my father put Ramsey Lewis "" Sound of Christmas"" on our HiFi. This is a fantastic holiday treat. I have loads of Christmas music, but I place this recording very high in my December rotation. The strings that play on"" What Are You Doing New Years Eve?"" and the bouncy ""Sleigh Ride"" take me back to the Wonder Years of my youth. I believe it will become an evergreen in your collection. Happy Holidays or as Ramsey puts it...Merry Christmas Baby !"
1,"I'm in w/ the 'In' crowd' This was a real find! I've always been a Ramsey Lewis fan since I'm in w/ the In-crowd' hit of the '60's! A nice easy 'laid back' compilation of Christmas songs. Add this to your Christmas CD's, you won't be disappointed!!"
1,Excellent Sporty Shoe This is my best shoe purchase in a long time. Sporty look. Comfortable. Perfect fit. I wear them every chance I get.
1,Perfect shoes Another masterpiece from Rockport. I recently purchase these shoes and I am so happy with this product. It is very comfortable. Its worth every single penny.
1,"Gentle Explanation This book is a thorough and gentle explanation of the how the process of forgiveness works, and how completeness in our own lives (we who have been hurt and need to forgive the person(s) who hurt us) can be attained through the five stages of forgiveness. It is also a gentle and compassionate explanation of how hurts affect the various aspects of our lives. Linn's format is easy to read and to understand. A must for anyone's bookshelf."
1,"Gets to the root of the issues This book, based on Kuebler Ross five stages of death & dying, is a wonderful way to work through life's hurts, giving us permission to take our anger, pain, bargaining, to God in prayer & allow Him to show us how to stop letting the past continue to hurt us in the present. The section on the unconditional love of Christ is healing in its presentation. I have used it over & over & have loaned this book out to my friends in need."
1,Just like the other ''STREET'' Games This is an awsome game for the psp. You should definetely pick this game up at a store. There are party play games which include ''shot blocker'' and ''arcade shootout''. There is wireless head to head mode. This game also includes ea's pocket trax which is when you get to listen to any of the songs from the game. Also King of the court mode. So pick this game up its awsome!!!blue
1,"Love Mercer Mayer Every Mercer Mayer book is a hit. I try to buy all the new titles, and my grandkids love them! The art work & the stories are great for adults & children."
1,"Insight Guide Bali Insight Guide Bali is an exceptional travel guide. The history is well written and rich with interesting facts. I reads like a good novel. The maps are deteiled with plenty of cross references. There are plenty of travel tips from riding a bus to how to order food without MSGS. It appears that every possible travel issue has been addressed; from how not to get arrested to finding the swank resorts. The book is worth the price just for the exquisite pictures. I have never seen a travel book with photos as exceptional as these. Usually I purchase a couple of guide books before going to a new location, but this time I will only use the Insight Guide Bali."
1,"Valuable companion to Harry Smith This 1973 book is keyed to Harry Smith's famed music anthology, now available on CD. It is edited by Josh Dunson and Ethel Raim, and includes interviews with Moses Asch and Frank Walker, as well as song lyrics, chords (for many but not all songs on the Anthology) new anecdotes, and very nice b & w photos of artists and rural scenes (folks hanging out on front porches, etc.) Some of the anecdotes are a bit disturbing--about Bascam Lunsford's racism and anti-semitism, for example--but it'll save ear-strain trying to grasp some of the numbers. May not be worth the hefty price being asked here, but a nice volume for those of us drawn to this strange, exciting music."
1,"Feminisim restored to flesh, blood, & fire. The blockheadedness & utter insensitivity of the two reviews below, in an open forum such as this, demand a response.Frances Sherwood's reimagining of the life of the brave Mary Wollstonecraft, the woman who wrote the groundsbreaking ""Vindication of the Rights of Women,"" proves quite the equal of her subject. Sherwood brilliantly recreates her protagonist's haunted Enlightenment world, at once alive with new ideas & half-smothered in medieval fears & prejudice. Better still, however, her history goes far beyond the merely correct, investing its conflicts with the chilled yet heightened humanity they must've engendered at the time. The ""Mary"" of this book has the wallop of her namesake, providing a new testament to women's toil & tragedy while never losing her humor, her smarts, or her desires."
1,Masterpiece I've listened to heavy metal/hardrock music for close to 20 years now and this is the one record in 10 years that have made me go WOW! At first i didn't think this record was much to have but it grew on me and now i just love it. This record is one that can and will stand the test of time. I'm sure that this record will remembered as a hardrock classic if Evergrey makes it outside Sweden. Tom's voice cries with agony and you can't help to get swept away along with it.
1,"The Best Italian Vegan Cookbook Ever!!!!!!! Bryanna has created the absolute best cookbook ever! My friend originally bought this and when she told me I should get it, I remarked ""why would I need an Italian cookbook, I know how to cook vegan Italian!"" I was then treated to several meals at my friend's apt. where she used Nonna's Italian Kitchen and was I wowed!!! I couldn't believe how delicious these recipes are and how satisfying - much better than anything I've ever had as a non-vegan! Now every year for my birhday, my friend knows what I want for my birthday meal from her- the lasagna al forno Bolognese on page 113 - to die for (or to live for really!). Buy this book - all my non-vegan friends love the dishes and can't believe it's not dairy!"
1,"Like being on vacation in Tuscany! This is a wonderful book with a nice combination of quick and other more involved recipes. I love Grogen's side notes on the recipes and her comments in the beginning of the book. The recipes are divided up into courses of an authentic Italian meal, so it's easy to plan a full menu, or just a single dish. These dishes would appeal to anyone, vegan or not. These are good, wholesome meals. Grogan mentioned in the introduction that Italian was her favorite cuisine with Chinese and Indian running a close second. Maybe she could be convinced to write a Chinese Vegan cookbook next?"
1,"That's Italian! This book is not only a must for vegan kitchens but for everyone who likes Italian food. The recipes make very authentic tasting vegan versions of popular dishes. My vegan friends are enjoying this food too, always the best sign."
1,"More Excellent Instruction from the Hoopnotica Team As with their first dvd, the instruction in this is clear and detailed. The pace is faster than in the first dvd, and they do not cover as many moves, but it is still worth it."
1,"The Island Keeper Out of the hundreds of books I have read through out my life, this book remains one of the most endearing to me. Maybe it is the way Cleo triumphs over her life troubles and struggles that I like. Or maybe it was something that I would have liked to do as a girl-escape and make my own pathway toward learning about myself. We are reading this book in our book review group in March 06 and I am so excited to share this with my adult friends who maybe by reading it will have gained an appreciation for this young 16 year old hero."
1,"beautiful This was a can't-miss concept, and the result was even greater than I assumed it would be. Frisell proves himself as an imaginative orchestrator, never heavy-handed. The feeling of the album is light but substantive, effervescent but always grounded in the deep well of musicianship brought to the project by Frisell, Costello/Bacharach, and a lineup that includes such giants as Brian Blade, Don Byron and Cassandra Wilson."
1,"infinite tonal possibilities This is about the most versatile bass amp I've ever had. It's very clean and punchy and has plenty of power. with two preamps, a compressor, a graphic eq and high and low contour controls, this amp covers it all. Hard to beat for the price."
1,"Always the Best... The woman known to rock and roll history as Tina Turner proves once again why she is, and will always be, the ""Queen of Rock and Roll."" Fiery and dynamic."
1,This is super!!!!! Miss Turner never fades!!!! She will always be number one!!!. This is a must see for everyone young and old alike!!!! Grrrrrreat Show!!!!!
1,"A truly entertaining concert Tina Turner outdoes herself! She really knows how to work a stage (almost a lost talent in the MTV era), and the music is first-rate. It is no wonder that the entire tour was such an incredible success. Turner also surrounded herself with first-rate musicians and dancers. I heartily recommend this video to anyone."
1,"What a show! This is a great DVD of a great performance. If you think Tina Turner is just ""okay"", you'll be a real fan after seeing her in concert in Amsterdam. Tina is full of energy, the dancers and musicians do a magnificent job, the camera work is exceptional, and the DTS sound is phenomenal. Among the best concert DVDs out there."
1,Good Read. Book was a little hard to get started on but once into it was quite interesting. Written different than what I am ;used to
1,"A Page Turner Ivan Doag has captured my attention. After reading this great adventure story, I intend to order more books written by this author. His ability to create dialogue and tell a fascinating tale is remarkable. My only wish is for a sequel."
1,"bithday gift it was a gift for my son he use to have the smaller version years ago . so, when i saw this i new he would enjoy it. thank you."
1,Excelent product! I definitely like this. All the features that has makes this product smooth and easy to operate.Definitely recommended.
1,"Sansa View 8GB, very nice little unit. I bought it to use for taking my Unbox videos mobile. Great, clear little screen. Very easy to use, very easy to transfer media, very compatable with Unbox, Windows Media, Rhapsody and Yahoo Music (which will soon be Rhapsody, too). Can't load my photos on it, but I think that's more of a problem with my computer rather than the Sansa Media Converter. (It originally worked until I started messing a bit with it, and it was easy to use, too. Will fix the problem when I find the time. Until then, it's not a big deal.) Expansion slot is a big plus. The View automatically senses what media is being loaded and adjusts accordingly, a feature that is absent in the E250, which I also have. Great sound with the right earphones. Loads of space. What else can I say that hasn't already been said. I love my little View and hope it lasts a long time. Good price at Amazon, as always."
1,"Great little mp3 I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player! Saved myself a little money and don't look like everyone else out there."
1,"sandisk sansa I am proud that the item purchased on amazon, and therefore recommends to cybernauts to use and buy on Amazon because so far is a trusted site and find everything you need to this.SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB Video MP3 Player (Black)"
1,Years of Knowledge I loved this book. I am in the process of becoming a public speaker and wanted to be very affective with the people I speak to. This book helped me to make sure my workshop is designed in the correct order to teach from A to B rather than floundering around from one to another topic never smoothly progressing toward the ultimate goal. I am well on my way to become an excellent public speaker.
1,As Expected It was what I expected it was and told me what I needed to know. It's a very worthwhile purchase
1,"Another great book by Kin Platt! This is the sequel to Kin Platt's excellent mystery ""Sinbad and Me"". All the great characters are back: adventurous teenager Steve, his heroic bulldog Sinbad, girlfriend Minerva, her suspicious dad the Sheriff, Herk, all investigating goings on involving witches, mandrake root, and a deadly bracelet. What a great book! If you are ten on up, you'll love it! If you are an old person, you will still love it!"
1,Wonderful Recipes for a Quick and Healthy Meal! Another great purchase of the Sandra Lee cookbooks to add to my collection. Recipes so quick and easy to prepare. ~ Thank you Sandra Lee for making cooking enjoyable again for women everywhere!
1,great cookbook this is one of sandra lee's best ever. The recipes are easy to make and best of all delicious.
1,"One of the best Good variety of recipes, complete with brand names and suggestions....pictures are gorgeous. Good for the new or experienced but busy cook."
1,"Semi-Homemade I love this book! Its such a fresh concept, especially for a full time working mother of 3. Full of great time saving ideas!This is a great christmas gift for people who love to cook, but dont necessarily have the time."
1,The best and most comprehensive report of the Manson murders Who better to write a book on the Manson family murders than the prosecutiing attorney. Vincent Bugliosi captures what actually happened during those two nights in 1969. Through testimony of his witnesses he gets eye-witness truths abouy Manson and his family. The best book I've ever read.
1,"Helter Skelter I was 16 years old the summer of 1969 and remember it vividly. I didn't read Helter skelter until I was 22, when it first came out and learned for the first time many of the detail, and the book truly stays in your mind. That is what most of the other reviews say that it haunts you for many years and you actually feel that you are there on that hot summer night, Sharon and Jay talking in the bedroom and a strange woman walks in and orders them to the living room. How terrifying could it have been for Sharon watching Jay die in front of her and Frykowski and Folger fighting for their lives knowing very well her unborn child and her couldn't defend themselves. Bugliosi wrote with such compassion for the victims and we can truly thank him that these people are behind bars now. Watching Charles Manson talk on television shows how unremorseful he is and will always be."
1,"I could not put this book down... I found this book very interesting and disturbing. It's all the details you would want to know about the Charles Manson case.To think that one man could convince people to carry out such horrendous crimes. That he had such skill in story telling and making people follow him blindly. I enjoyed reading all the details of the case and how evidence would come up and start up new leads. Bugliosi did an excellent Job of walking us through the crime, and all the way through to the Trial.I could not put the book down. It's a definite page turner, and has many photo's of the victims, the killers and the evidence. Not for the squeamish, very detailed."
1,"Helter Skelter Fantastic! I have read this book twice. I love the way the author narrates the real life drama of these murders, murderers and inefficiency of the LAPD. It is probably one of the scarriest books I have read so far. The author does a great job of explaining the psychological influences of Charles Manson and the crazy/hipnotic behavior of the Manson Family. He also paints a very clear picture of the long and difficult trial and the obstacles that needed to be overcome to convict Manson and his followers. It's a very interesting book from a psychological and legal stand point. I probably will read it again some time soon because the second time around helped me understand even more, the real-life occurences and legal complexities of this case."
1,"One of the best true crime stories ever written In the begining of the book it reads ""This book will scare the hell out of you"" and was that ever an understatement. Charles Manson and his crew will always be the ultimate in evil. The only time you will put this book down is to sleep, that is, if you can."
1,"Made a great gift! My husband has always wanted to add Helter Skelter into his book collection and today he opened it as a Christmas gift. It's four hours later and he's still reading it, pausing every now and again to tell me some other disturbing connection that was made between music and the murders. This was his perfect gift!"
1,"Good, but just one objection your honor! This is a fascinating account of the Manson case from the eyes of prosecution attorney Vincent Bugliosi. Well paced, haunting, somewhat grissly, but suprisingly quite funny in places- (the defense attorney made over two hunderd objections on the first three days of the trial!). A real pager turner probably best read in the daytime so it won't give you nightmares. One quible though I feel the author has grossly misinterpreted the philiosophy of Friedrich Nietzche by affilating his philiosophy with the spread of Nazism. Yes Hitler (who shared with Manson many characteristic's; they were both loved animals more than humans, each a vegetarian, and had spent time as an ""outsider"" living on the fringes of society) had read his work. Yet those documents he read were greatly adulterated under the cursed hand of the authors sister, who, after the philosophers death re wrote his manuscripts to fit Nazi ideals in the hope of courting parties leader..."
1,"A scary, captivating tale This book is certainly not a Pulitzer prize winner, but it is definitely a must read for any true-crime fans. I found myself unable to put the book down for hours. Bugliosi carefully unwinds the horrific details that surround these infamous murders. This book is much more than a gruesome exploitive account. I found myself understanding the late sixties as the tumultuous period that could host this episode in history."
1,"America's best prosecuting attorney is also a great author. This is an excellent book on one of the most horrific crimes ever committed even by today's standards. The research, details, and explanations are absolute top-notch. It is evident that Vincent Bugliosi is one the greatest prosecuting attorneys ever to step into the courtroom. The way he can rationally reconstruct the events of a crime and get into the heads of the criminals and lay out their motives is just amazing. The courtroom drama is re-created in dramatic detail so you can feel the tension, suspense and horror all throughout the trial. We also learn alot about cult psychology and how people can be driven to extreme bahavior. What's even scarier is that there are people in this world like Charles Manson's fanatical followers ready to do his darkest bidding."
1,Most interesting This book by Vincent Bugliosi is by far the best book I have ever read. The Manson murders being the most interesting subject I have ever researched. Being the prosector in the longest trial in American history the author is also an extremly good writer! I recommend this book to anyone and it is well worth the money
1,"Outstanding writing Mr. Bugliosi has been able to make us feel we were there throuhtout this nightmare. This book will keep you on your toes, wondering if you locked all doors at night. For those who had not been born yet like me, is testament that that crazy idiotic losers have been present is every generation, williwng to do the unthinkable. The skills and genious shown on behalf of Bugliosi during this trial is enough to make anyone want to achieve excellence, no matter what the field of expertise may be."
1,"One of my all time favorite books I ordered this book to read on a road trip because I have always been interested in true crime stories.This book, of all the true crime books that I have read, was by far the most gripping and interesting. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book, and I had a hard time putting it down.Even if you do not care for true crime stories, this book is so shocking and well documented. I have since read several books about the Manson family and Tate- La Bianca tragedies and this book is the best out of them all.I strongly recommend reading this book."
1,"One of the most harrowing crime stories ever... I first read ""Helter Skelter"" the same summer I read ""In Cold Blood."" Both books left indelible images in my psyche and ensured I would never look at the world of crime and investigation the same again.I've never read a book quite like HS since. Bugliosi and Gentry have written a taught and gripping blow-by-blow account of the two seemingly unconnected streams of events, the Tate/La Bianca murders and Manson's cult, how they horribly intersected and the breathtaking resolution.Bugliosi's reminiscences provide both the personal anguish that the investigation caused him and his family and the urgent immediacy that gripped him and the community to see that justice was finally done.Unforgettable and unflinching, ""Helter Skelter"" forces us to look into the eyes of evil and learn more about ourselves.See also my reviews of the ""Helter Skelter"" TV movie and the audio book version."
1,Fierce Eden (The Louisiana History Collection) Fierce Eden (The Louisiana History Collection) ~ Another great collection by Jennifer Blake. A Real attention getter. If you like historical romances you will love this collection. I had trouble putting this one down.
1,"Fierce Eden well written, lots of historical info about a period of history that are not too well known. characters were believable, good descriptions of places and time period. was a page turner, sorry when it ended, loved the characters."
1,"Best Toy for my 8 year old son I love this toy for my son. He spends so much time manipulating it and discovering all that it is capable of. This is really his best toy ever. It is a bit difficult to assemble the tanks and green rings, but oveall I highly recommend this toy.Hydrodynamic Deluxe Building Set"
1,"great for card players Works well, especially for arthritic hands. Use it once a week with group I play cards with and having more fun due to less hand pain."
1,"LOVED THEM All of us girls loved the card holders. It did have an odor, but I sprayed them with Fabreeze and let them dry, then washed with soap and water and let them dry again. After that all was fine. We find that we even use them when we have 3 cards left. You can set it on the table and it leaves your hands free for important things--like snacks!"
1,"Boon to Boomers So, if along with inheriting your Mom's Roseville, you also got her arthritic hands, you'll want to check out these nifty card holders. No more achy palms after a hot Canasta hand, no more spilling the cards while sorting, no more locked thumbs......and you can even play relatively hands-free!The Games Dames (of the NC Piedmont Triad) love these little things."
1,Perfect for a ten year old I bought this for my ten year old daughter so she could play canasta with her grandmother. Her little hands did not allow her to hold all the cards. With the card holder she enjoys the game a lot more. I think they are grooming her as a substitute in the Canasta league!
1,National treasure What an incredible compendium. I would like to see the US create something similar to Japan's Cultural National Treasure and Robert Frost would certainly be included as such.
1,"The complete Frost- The road not taken For most of us most poets live through a few poems of theirs we have read in anthologies. It may be that in the case of a poet we especially love we have gone and read most of their poetry.This volume presents a wonderful opportunity for the devotees of Frost to have in one book the work of a lifetime.For me Frost is ""The Road Not Taken"" and ""Birches"" and ""Mending Wall"" and a host of scattered lines, "" Good fences make good neighbors"" and "" The land was ours, before we were the land's"".Frost is also however, I must admit , for me the poet whose life casts a shadow on his work. Unfortunately perhaps I long ago read parts of the Thompson biography of Frost the central theme of which was his inveterate cruelty to all those around him.All this has left me, you will excuse this, a bit 'cool toward Frost' and I personally prefer the more musical metrics of Wallace Stevens to the canny, often pithily wise lines of Frost."
1,"Frost rehabilitated Jay Parini's ROBERT FROST: A LIFE, 1999, may rehabilitate somewhat the view of Frost as terrible person, presented in Lawrence Thompson's earlier biography. See Parini, pp.452 ff. Some reviews may tend to discourage reading Frost, because of Thompson's jaundiced portrait.This wonderful, copious collection of Frost contains many of his best poems, which do not show up in popular anthologies. And his prose is filled with wit and wisdom you might not suspect. A great contribution to our Art and our humanity."
1,"crowsfoot tools never thought i would need these, but they have come in handy numerous times since i bought them. quite well made."
1,"Pure science fiction One of the foundations of SF is examining the consequences of science and technology on society. Here Hogan creates two diametrically opposed societies - those of Earth founded on limited resources and those of the newly colonized planet Chrion having unlimited resources. You won't find deep character development in this book, the focus is on the effects of technology on society - what we can become. Telling the story from the viewpoint of solders on the second colonization starship traveling and landing on the planet Chrion, Hogan explores his vision of what humanity can be. Chrionians value and trade respect, possessions are in abundence and free from automated factories. On the second colonization starship traveling from a militarized Earth, imagine the consequences to those powers to be when character matters! Unlimited resources you ask? Hogan postulates, the mind is a unlimited resource."
1,"Great ear piece adapter The Jawbone bluetooth headset is a great little device, but unfortunately, none of the supplied ear pieces fit comfortable in my ear. I was all ready to return it, when I decided to try these Jabra EarGels. Well, I got them yesterday, and they make a world of difference. The Jawbone now comfortable fits in my ear, the little piece that is supposed to be touching my cheek is doing so. In fact, it is such a good fit I don't even need the other-the-ear hook any more!The EarGels come in three sizes, and are designed to fit the contours of your ear - not just to be shoved in an held in my force. Why JawBone themselves don't make something like this to come with the headset is beyond me, but at least Jabra stepped up to fill the void!"
1,"Bought for Jawbone Bluetooth Headset I bought these to use in place of the earpieces that were included with the Jawbone. With these I am able to remove the bow that goes over the ear and just wear it in my ear. The Jawbone does not fall out of my ear, and I walk all over work without risk of losing it."
1,Good I have not really had a chance to use these but my daughter states that it works for her very well.
1,"It's a keeper! I first looked through this cookbook in another lady's kitchen. She had it all earmarked and I could tell she had tried many of the recipes. I knew this lady was a great cook, so I ordered it myself. I'm pretty picky about which cookbooks I keep. This one is very nice. I love all the seafood recipes. A classic."
1,A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This Oddysey is great for anyone that has a sense of adventure or just likes the Greek myths. It is well done and has a great cast of characters. The movie is a summary of all the adventures Oddyseus had to go through in order to get back to Ithaca- to his wife and son. I highly recommend this movie and give it five full stars.
1,Actioned packed The movie wsa filled with action and lots of special effects....I loved the plot and the sory was meaning full.
1,"The Odyssey I think the movie 'The Odyssey' was great. You would think for this movie that the special effects would be really bad, but they wern't. 'The Odyssey' is about a man called Odissius. He and his wife Penelope had a son. But on the day Oddisiusses son was born he had to go to the Trojan war. The story has many twists and turns as he goes through the jorney of trying to get back home."
1,"Armande Asante, need I say more? This movie is fabulous. Anyone who is a fan of greek mythology or the Roman era would love this movie.I cannot get enough of Armande Asante and this movie portrays him in a way that would make any woman drool.Definitely a great buy. {^_^}"
1,The Odyssey. My review was about The Odyssey.I think that this movie is a good movie to watch and you might learnt something from this story. The Odyssey is about when he had a wife with his baby and he left on a journey after defeating Troy! He met many monsters and many perils over many years! I loved the action and special effects in this movie! It was cool!
1,"Entertainment is not always accurate! I have read and re read all of the reviews for this film and I have to say my two cents. I have been studying Ancient Mythology(mostly Egyptain) for the past ten years. Yes, this film is NOT 100% correct. What film is? History is always open to interpertation. Anyone who does not understand this needs a new hobby. Anyhoo I loved it, Armand Assante was amazing in his role. The rest of the cast was great too. There was a veil of erotitisem throughout the film, which was interesting considering the film wasn't outwardly graphic. Overall, the movie was wonderful. Don't rent this film, buy it! (you'll want to watch it over and over!)"
1,"My family and other animals I read Gerald Durrell's books 10 years ago, while I was still living in Romania. I loved his books from the first page to the last and literally I couldn't put them down until I finished them. The best humour I ever met in books! His stile is unique. I am planning on reading all of them again in English. I would recommend them to anyone!"
1,"Another book of lovely excursions to the island of Corfu This is another wonderful books of Gerald Durrell's memories of his time on the island of Corfu prior to the Second World War. He takes us back to another time and place before the world changed for good.Each chapter is a separate story and rememberence of those days when as a young man he marvels at not only the natural world around him, but also the various people he encounters and learns to appreciate. It is easy to get lost in one of these stories and feel like you are there with him on a hot summer day with his faithful dogs tagging along beside him.I recommend this book to anyone who not only loves nature, but also can appreciate a time gone by when people were different and even strangers were looked as guests. This book is one that I intend to read again and again in the coming years and will appreciate the stories just much each time as the first time."
1,"GReat solution for a special space... Great solution for a special space. I know how difficult is to hang things from a modern ceiling. This item, will solve that problem. Installation is very fast and price was great. Seller was very fast delivering the item. Good job."
1,Psalms Now a moving and useful worship resource After using Psalms Now in Bible study for litergical prayer I decided to try it in a Contemporary Christian Worship setting. The response was phenomenal. Whether it is used as a basis for prayer or in a traditional liturgical style it is a very helpful book to bring the psalmists words to life!
1,"One of the best movies I've ever seen The original Moby Dick book is in some cases better than the movie.... that's true.... but the actors (instead of Patrick Stewart (normally i really love him) his role was good, but tooo nervous and toooo crazy... it didn't sypathize with the other roles... e.g. Starbuck, Ismail ...) the whale was stupid and awful, like in a very low budget film... could be much better... but it's worth to buy it and to watch ....! that's my opinion ... bye and enjoy the time you see moby dick"
1,"Exceptional Movie Just like any movie produced from a book, if you compare it to the book, it will most certainly fall short. If you take the movie in the context that its a dramatic movie made to enthrall you for a couple of hours, than you'll find this movie exceptional. I watch it about twice a year and find it one of the better movies in my personal collection."
1,"Sweet Read It's been a long time since a book kept me up on a week night, but Sweet Hush was that kind of read. I loved the characters, I loved the family, and wondering where they were all going to end up made this a un-put-downable book for me. Wish they'd make a movie of the story! I was already casting it in my head."
1,"Quriky but Fun! I acutally bought this for my kindle and fell so in love with this quirkly little story that I turned around and bought the hardback book for my mom. Deborah Smith has given us this wonderful cast of characters that believe in family and the family business. They love each other, stand up for each other, and will do anything to protect each other. I know the plot has been review by other readers, so let me just say this: it doesn't matter what your genre of reading is, this story will draw you in and keep you entertained. It is a wonder story and a terrific read."
1,Very good introduction to the field The authors takes time to explain the basic hypotheses of statistical mechanics. I believe that it is an excellent introduction to this field.
1,"No better place to start with Stat Mech If you are intrested with studing statistical mechanics then start here. Hill starts from the defintions and postulates of thermodynamics and then moves into applications and problems. You will need to understand Diff EQ for this book.The first chapter took me a week to read and work out the math but then I red the rest in 4 weeks. It is a hard start because Hill develops your background before starting with applications of the theory. I really began to grasp the subject after reading this book. Ohter books will not lay the mathout as well as Hill does. It is a hard read because Hill is so thorough, but the rewasd is well worth the struggle. It is a great introduction and I suggest all of Hill's Stat mech book. Another great bargin from DOVER PRESS.At the price I recomend it to all graduate chemical engineers and chemists"
1,"An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics- Terrel L.Hill An excellent text book for Physical Chemist who want to get sound footing in Statistical Thermodynamics.Inorder to really get a good view of the basics of statistical mechanics the reader really needs to spend an adequate amount of time in digesting the contents of the initial chapter. However, after spending some amount of time in reading those initial chapters, one can grasp the latter parts of the book in a quite interesting fashion.In my opinion, this book is a must for those who want to master the statstical thermodynamics. Infact, one would be really amazed at the standard of the book considering the fact that it is reasonably old. No new standard books on ' Statistical Mechanics' can provide such an adequate foundations as it in this book. I would strongly recommend this book along with the other book 'Statistical Mechanics' by the same author.Sasisanker Padmanabhan"
1,"Perry is now two times as classy! William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon"
1,A very informatinve book! I had to read this book for a class at school and its very well written. This book is very informative and a recommend reading.
1,"SOLID METAL!! Very gald these guys are back, this is the debut album by Hallows Eve and it's brutal, hard edged, pure thrash the way it was ment to be. When I think of the pure 80's thrash metal sound I always think of Hallow's Eve and their first three glorious albums. Solid release, Worth every cent! \m/\m/"
1,"A Fabulous Alternative History I'm not one who normally likes alternative histories, but this is one of the best, most complex Lackey books I've read in ages. The characters, as always, have depth and humor, and the plot is fascinating -- my one question -- will there be a sequel?One word of caution -- those who have read C.J. Cherryh's Merovingen Nights Series may find many aspects of the plot strangely familiar..."
1,"GREAT ENTERTAINMENT. GORGEOUS MOVIE! What a great movie! Entertaining and enjoyable with some very, very funny moments and great acting by Diane Lane. The film is so beautiful to look at on the bigscreen and the story is beautiful and avoids any cliches or sentimentality. A great movie. Very recommnded indeed! 5 stars."
1,"Funny, uplifting, inspiring, beautiful - a GREAT movie! Under The Tuscan Sun is one of those special films that comes along once in a while. It is funny, uplifting, inspiring, beautiful and above all entertaining. This is one of the most enjoyable films I've seen for ages and the acting by Diane Lane and the lovely scenery make it a modern-day classic! 10 stars!"
1,"A guy's persective - actually a GREAT movie! As a guy I was not sure if I would enjoy this film or not. It had Diane Lane in it who I like alot. It had good reviews in the newspapers and magazines. But it also didn't really appeal as subject matter AND I had never read the book either. Having said all of that - I did really enjoy this film. It is funny and enjoyable and has a pleasant, uplifting tone to it. Diane Lane was sexy and again gave a great performance like last years 'Unfaithful' for which she was Oscar nominated. The supporting characters in the movie were very entertaining and the Tuscan hills looked spectacular. This is a very good movie that I would recommend even to other guys. Give it a try."
1,Feel good movie! Love this one and have seen it many times...When you want to watch something sweet and uplifting that makes you smile when it is over - this is the one!
1,"High-art! I must say, i avoided this movie like the plague for a year. It was deemed to me to be just a sacchrine ""chick-flick."" Now I have to ask myself...what were you waiting for? This movie which I now own, definitely deserves more praise and should be essential to anyone intrested in high-art. It's a magical and uplifting tale set in some of the most beautiful locations in Italy. Diane lane sparkles! She carries the film so well you forget she's only acting. A remarkable movie, filled with poignant characters and a heartbreaking story-line. It's message is one that transcends time and gender. Watch and learn...it's fabulous!"
1,So heartwarming and entertaining. A great comedy! So entertaining and enjoyable. A masterful and beautiful comedy that is heartwarming and inspiring. Beautifully acted and shot. Wonderful. 5 stars!
1,:( :( :( I never actually got to watch this movie. It got lost on the trip from my mailbox to my dorm room on campus. I went ahead and gave you 5 stars anyway because I know it would have been in excellent condition.
1,"Magnificent movie! Diane Lane shines! A truly magnificent movie. Diane Lane shines in her role as Frances Mayes in this funny, sweet, enjoyable piece of great entertainment. The director makes this movie so engrossing and enjoyable that it is impossible to not be drawn into the wonderfully realized 3D characters and the brilliant played out scenes. The scenic locations help and so does the likable characters. Make no mistake... this is a magnificent movie."
1,A Must See A great actress and beautiful scenery. It is good to watch a woman coming into her own and growing strong from from what can be a devistating loss. Women will love this and men should watch it at least once.
1,"wonderful movie This is a great movie. Views of the Tuscan towns and other scenery make you want to hop on a plane for Italy. The movie content was both funny, entertaining, and a travel advertisement."
1,"Italy...Take me away! Destined to be a favorite of yours as well, I'm sure. It has everything a chick flick should have...romance, finding strength, empowering substance. If you didn't think you could survive life's pitfalls before...this movie will give you the strength to keep on keepin' on! Funny, entertaining, ensightful and empowering, this movie is a bowl of popcorn and a bottle of wine away from being a classic!"
1,"You're missing the point Superficially, this movie is indeed sappy. However, look beneath the surface.What I see is that Diane Lane's character is playing the Superego. Sandra Oh plays the ego. And the Fellini Fatale is playing pure ID.They all play their part to explain love, despair, dissappointment and lust.The buying and remodeling an old house is just like cleaning out the cobwebs upstairs. Clean house to move something new in.I believe this movie is made more for what it is representing than what is flat out shows you.It is a good psychological study of the human mind and the ups and downs that it goes through in a lifetime."
1,"Great movie! Wonderful story about a woman who reclaims her life. Great ""feel good movie"". I love how all her dreams come true!"
1,"It wasn't that bad!!! I don't know, but it seems a lot of people don't like this movie! Why? Because they don't like the feel good feeling at then end? I mean, sure, usually the book is ten times better than the movie, but come on, this movie should be at least a four! When you read a book, and than a movie comes out based on it, don't expect it to be as good as the book, because it very rarely is. Even the movie Lord of the Rings wasn't as good as the book for some people. And if you look at movies like Harry Potter, Ella Enchanted, Bourne Supremacy.... a lot of these movies aren't better than the book. So, if you have read the book, and you are thinking about seeing the movie, my advice to you is try not to expect too much. Think of the movie seperate from the book. By the way, I only rated this movie five stars because I think some people should lighten up, and watch a nice, family movie for a change."
1,"Much more than ""eye candy"" for the ladies!!! ILOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! THE WIDESCREEN DVD VERSION REALLY TAKES IN THE BREATHTAKING SCENERY, AND THE BEAUTIFUL COLORS IN THE LANDSCAPE. THIS MOVIE REALLY DREW ME IN FROM THE BEGINNING, AND IT REALLY BROUGHT OUT EMOTIONS RANGING FROM SADNESS AT THE BEGINNING OF HER DIVORCE, HAPPINESS IN WHEN SHE BEGINS HER NEW LIFE IN TUSCANY AND MEET THE ""EYE CANDY"", ANGER OVER HOW SHE IS TREATED, AND TEARY-EYED AT THE BITTERSWEET ENDING OF THIS MOVIE. YEP, THIS IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!!!! I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE MORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE!! HAVE NO DISTRACTIONS, RELAX, AND LET TUSCANY TAKE YOU AWAY!!!!"
1,Beautiful Tuscany I enjoyed the story and the scenery in Tuscany. It makes you want to visit there!!
1,"Under the Tuscan Sun If you like romantic movies, this is the perfect one for you. But, please don't cry! It was a gift for someone else, eventhough I personally had seen it. It arrived just in time and I could keep track (via UPS) where it was, since I purchased it being in Puerto Rico."
1,"Love this movie! One of my absolute fav movies. It's so rich looking and makes you want to go to Tuscany. I wish this had come out in blu-ray, the colors would be even more amazing. Watch with a blanket and a bottle of vino!"
1,"A really fun, smart and sexy movie! This was a GREAT and FUN movie. It was so funny and touching, yet did'nt have the 'cliches'. It was well acted by Diane Lane and it looked fantastic! A great fun movie! Highly recommended!"
1,"Not your usual romantic chick flick! Determined to rebuild her life after a sudden, unexpected divorce, Diane Lane gets away from it all by going on a gays-only excursion to Italy where she falls in love - with a house! She buys a delapidated villa to renovate and quickly fills it with an engaging cast of characters. She finds her dreams - love (sponsoring star-crossed lovers), her family (her pregnant friend, jilted by her lesbian partner) and finally hopes for a romance of her own. More than just a ""chick flick"" this movie offers a little something for everyone, including exquisite cinematography. Highly recommend!"
1,"Tuscan Sun and Diane Lane ==Perfect Match I can't say enough positive words about this movie.It was good at the show but like alot of things the second time at home it was so much better. It was a DVD gift from my daughter,and that night I watched it and noticed all the little things you often miss in a large show. As a women I could idenify with Frances in many way's. When she leaves her home she loved and goes to her tempory apartment,and lays down on the floor.. It was Diane's and her best friend performance that you ,the viewer grow to love and laugh with. But the most important message in the movie is that France's positive and helpfull attitude towards everyone is as beautiful as Tuscany."
1,Under the Tuscan Sun I saw this on TV & I just had to have it. I just love watching this movie. I watch it every yr :)
1,Canon NB-5L Great Battery. Last a long time to be depleted. I was going to get another one as second spare when traveling. I don't need it anymore. One is enough. Highly recommended.
1,"Long lasting Battery I took more than 130 photos in addition to 5 minutes movies all with LCD on without any need to recharge. it is so powerful. the battery is much powerful than the one for SD 750, NB-4L family. 1120 mAh is great."
1,Wonderful... This battery works like a charm and gives me the same life as the original battery I received from Canon. I bought this as a back up battery and I am extremely happy with it. Ships damn quick. Merchant's service is excellent. Cheers.....
1,"Same as original! A must have for your SD950IS, because you never know when you need a backup battery!"
1,Quality battery I can't imagine not having a spare battery for my camera. I bought this for my 1st Canon Powershot camera and it works exactly as you would expect. I was even more excited when I discovered that my new Canon Powershot uses the same batteries. Now I have 3...the ones that came with each of the cameras plus an extra.
1,Very Very Pleased Great price on a genuine Canon battery.Reasonable shipping cost.Arrived in reasonable time.
1,Cannon battery Not much to say it was a true Cannon battery not a generic battery which don't seem to last as long. I had bought generics before and had problems with them retaining the charge after a while. It's worth the cost to have an actual Cannon product. It was sent promptly and it works
1,Spare Battery for my SD800 Camera The battery works just as good as the one that came with my camera.
1,so easy to use love this kettle looks and works beautiful. I have no p;roblem with it being remanafactured have many other ones I higly reccommen d this to perk up anyones kitchen
1,The Pledge of Allegiance This book is beautifully illustrated with photographs that are sure to spark discussion. The text (the Pledge of Allegiance) is broken into meaningful phrases that make the reader reflect on the words that we sometimes rush through or take for granted. I highly recommend purchasing the big book version for lower grade classroom use. A gem!
1,"Beautiful photos The text is the spoken pledge, and the photos show America -- the people and places and landmarks. Beautiful photos -- did I already say that?Facts at the back -- every family with a kindergartener should be equipped with this book."
1,"Friend of the author I work with Hank Hassell at NAU and know him as a friend and kind and unassuming person who, from what I've gathered, can hike the doglegs off anyone. This book is the offspring of his love for the Colorado Plateau area. It is a well told story of a piece of our geological heritage that could only be written by someone who has been there and done that. I would recommend this book for the academic community as well as for travel buffs. Betty Lee/Library Specialist @ NAU"
1,my first REAL netbattle this PET is so cool. after I got it I started buy battlechips and fight my bro. then for some reason my computer had a virus. so I went in with megaman. Thank goodness that I had the right chips or I would have been deleted. And it was all thanks to my favorite battle chip...........TIME BOMB. Now my computer is safe.
1,The Best Handheld Game Ever I just recently got the megaman pet and it is a lot of fun. I play with it all the time and i am 13 years old. The only problem is that you only get battle chips through the toys. When you by the pet you only get 3 battlechips. The game is easy and hard to play.I think it is the best game ever
1,"I love this book! I'm a big fan of Vickery's ever since I read his previous book, Cocksure. I have to say that as good as Cocksure was, Play Buddies is even better! Not only are his stories hot, Vickery writes with real humanity, making his characters come across as real and three dimensional, out on the prowl, looking for sex wherever they can find it. As far as erotic writing goes, Vickery is a master!"
1,"Great album!!! This album is the best release of the ""New Mayhem"". Total insane, brutal black metal. Only for people that like primitive raw black metal. Hellhamer plays in an incredible way, necrobutcher give an atmospheric sound to the tracks, and maniac voice is totaly inhuman. WLA is a must have.!"
1,"""MARLOWE BY ANY OTHER NAME WOULD BE JUST AS TOUGH"" For you hard-boiled detective fans who are also intogeneology, you might like to trace Philip Marlowe's familytree. Raymond Chandler's prototypes for his now famous detective began in the mid-30's with characters from some of his early pulp magazine stories. Whether the character is Ted Carmady, Johnny Dalmas, John Evans, Tony Resick or a character named simply Mallory, they all had the qualities and charactoristics that eventually evolved into what became Philip Marlowe. Red Wind, Trouble Is My Business and Goldfish are just three of more than 40 stories Chandler wrote during his lifetime. Don't miss a single one!"
1,"What a debut! This album was not death metal or even thrash metal by today's standards. It was, however, an incredible debut that I ended up owning on cassette, album form, and finally, CD. Unfortunately, Nasty Savage sounded best when they werent trying to be heavy. Some bands do (Metallica, Possessed come to mind immediately), just check out the incredible original version of XXX (available on Metal Massacre 6) and then listen to the much faster, more aggressive, and much less interesting version on the CD 'Indulgence' and see what I mean.)This album is actually very good ""idontknowwhatyouwouldcategorizethisstuffas"" metal for this time period. For some reason, they decided to use more death metal growls and faster beats on future records and that made them sound like they were trying to do too much....This album is their crowning glory."
1,"The new ""rage"" in our hood After a neighbor girl got one for her 6th birthday, my 7 year-old son had to have one for his (birthday). He got it today as a group gift from several families and he loves it. The Trikke across the street was labled ""Trikke"", but my son's says ""Razor"", but they seem to be almost identical. My son is very athletic and took to it right away, but he has been riding his regular Razor (two wheeler) for over 2 years now. The brakes are a little tight, but my husband is just stretching the cords for a smoother brake...which I'm told is common with new brakes.We live in a hilly area, but he seems to have no problem adjusting to the ""squirlliness"" of the Trikke."
1,"MY PERSONAL FAVORITE BOOK BY MY PERSONAL FAVORITE AUTHOR!!!! This book is amazing! It provides us with great humor while taking a serious look at religion as a whole. Personally I think the Great God Om is the best character on the whole Discworld (followed by a close second of Rincewind and then Death bringing up third place) and I hope to see him again sometime soon, maybe in another Discworld book(of course). This book also has the best villian in the whole series as far as I'm concerned...he was really truly an evil man. In short...I LOVED IT!!!!!"
1,"A good basis for religion It is just as entertaining and well written as all the other Discworld Novels. The basic philosophy about the nature of religion is brilliant; it is much more credible and closer to reality than the official dogmas of most of the existing religions. Actually, it is quite close to Nordic paganism (as practiced in Iceland), traditional Shinto (not the official version practiced by the Japanese state) and religious Taoism."
1,"Best of the Best I've read nearly all of the Disc World series and have thoroughly enjoyed most of the ones I've read. SMALL GODS holds a special place in my heart. The characters are engaging. Om as a little turtle won me over completely. Brutha, the naive is one I could relate to. What a villian Vorbis! Pratchett is at his best with his usual terrific humor, but in addion -- and upon rereading I keep discovering this -- there is much much more to this story. It invites us to think and to question. If you only want to read one Terry Pratchett story I recommend SMALL GODS."
1,"Simply Extraordinary If you have the slightest inkling that you have what it takes to be a professional author, do not read Terry Pratchett. This is not because he's not worth reading, or because I don't think that aspiring writers can learn anything from his prose: that is patently false. Do not read Terry Pratchett because one chapter in, you will feel like a kid with a toy xylophone staring at Beethoven at the head of a symphony. Pratchett is one of the truly great writers today, with vivid imagery and beautiful wordplay that is unparalleled. In Small Gods, Pratchett follows the Discworld version of the Spanish inquisition, and creates a story that managed to make me laugh in the same chapter that it caused me to genuinely think about the nature of religion, belief and faith. I know I'm using hyperbole, and I know I'm raving to a ridiculous extent. But Small Gods earns the praise."
1,"A grim and gritty travel masterpiece Tabasco and Chiapas in the 1930's - not a nice place either to live or to visit. Greene's explorations provided background and some characters for his great short novel or tale, The Power and the Glory. If you are a student of fine writing, read the novel first, then read this to see how he gathered and used material. Or read this first for background that adds depth to the novel. If you are an armchair traveler or student of Mexico, enjoy Greene's adventures and be grateful he went through them so you don't have to do it yourself. This is truly a classic of travel writing."
1,"Awesome voice I discovered Anastacia on you tube and fell in love with her music. I love the CD, especially the track ""I belong to you"" and ""everything burns"". There isn't a song on the CD that I don't like. Why she is not more popular in the US is beyond me."
1,It really is the Gluten free Bible Packed with great information.Great for people like myself just diagnosed with Celiac Diseasefunny friendly fact filled! The one recommended by my nutritionist!
1,"First book for newly-diagnosed celiacs! Jax updates her ""Against the Grain"" success story! It's the first resource to get when one is newly diagnosed with gluten intolerance or wheat sensitivity. Jax writes with intelligence, knowledge, sensitivity, creativity and wit about the gluten-free lifestyle. She tells it like it is; the gluten-free diet is very do-able, but attitude is everything. You'll enjoy learning with Jax as your guide in this GLUTEN-FREE BIBLE. [...]"
1,Anyone with Gluten issues should read this! I have a family history of auto-immune disorders and have started developing them myself. This book was recommended by some other family members and I have read it and passed it on to more family who need it! Great book!
1,"Good for storage and for being less breakable than hard cases This item is good for storage of cds and is less breakable than the harder cases. Wish I'd have bought and may buy more of them than harder cases, which can crack."
1,"Pictures and Words in Perfect Harmony Diane Schoemperlen said she found inspiration for this book when her young son asked her how come her books never have any pictures. She then had the brilliant idea to wrap short stories around antique drawings, 100 year old catalogue pictures and illustrations from the original Gray's Anatomy. The results are stories that are compelling on their own but are perfectly enhanced by the pictures put in them. A great gift or coffee table book to be flipped through again and again."
1,"magic under a microscope After reading Schoemperlen's Language of Love I couldn't wait to read her new book. I was NOT disappointed. All of the magic and insight and wonder and irony is there. Later when I took a walk on the beach, everything seemed magnified. The sun and a grain of sand were suddenly about the same size and equally amazing."
1,"She's lovely I found out about this author while reading a collection of shorts stories from 1998 with a forward from Garrison Keillor. Her short ""Body Language"" was included and it was the most impacting story of the bunch. This full collection does not disappoint!"
1,"Sharing Pain... I just bought my second copy of this CD - I have loaned my first to so many friends, one finally kept it! When I first heard the CD, I wondered if something had gone wrong with Amy Grant's long-time marriage to Gary Chapman. A long-term relationship of my own had just ended badly, and the songs I was hearing, particularly ""Like I Love You"", ""Cry a River"", ""Missing You"", ""The Feeling I Had"" and ""Somewhere Down the Road"", echoed my very feelings of regret, loss, hope and emptiness. Later, I heard that Grant's marriage had ended. I had never heard a collection that so profoundly captured those feelings, as if the person on the CD was in my shoes. She writes and performs each song from her own torn heart and in words she has cried. It is the rawness and honesty which brings me back again and again and keeps me recommending it to my friends."
1,"I love this CD Leave it all Behind, I Will be Your Friend, Like I Love You, Takes a Little Time, Turn this World Around.. OMG, pretty much all are my favorites!! Gotta have it!"
1,"Amy's Best! Amy Grant's albums are like a soundtrack to all of our lives. Out of all of her albums, ""Behind The Eyes"" is definitely the album that shows us the real Amy Grant, of who she is as a person, not a personality. Personally, I thought this was going to be another ""Heart In Motion"" (which I still love), but boywas I wrong. I remember when Iheard her doing her version ofJoni Mitchell's ""Big YellowTaxi"" (from ""House Of Love""), I kind of guessed that will bewhat this album would sound like: Very earthy, acoustic, and organic. ""Lead Me On"" was just like that too when it came out in 1988. I love ""Takes A Little Time."" It has a Tom Petty-like sound that you would never her on an Amyrecord. I like all the songs,especially ""Somewhere Down The Road,"" ""Missing You,"" and ""I Will Be Your Friend."" This album will stand the test of time."
1,"The REAL Amy Grant has come forward Truthful. Dark. Uplifting. - call it what ya like but this isindefinitely her most personal and emotional powerful record to date. Behind the eyes captures sheer honesty from within Amy Grant and the best part is, it's very relatable. From Like i love you, to the ""Feeling I had"" and then "" I will be your friend"" it's apparent that Amy has come through many changes. But what is Strikingly interesting is how she toned down the ""fluffy pop"" sound and got accoustic. She's showing the listener that this record isn't about sappy love songs, it's about life and making peace in her life. I think we all need some peace in our lives every now and then..don't ya think?"
1,"tremendous skin flick - one worth owning No plot, very little talking, tons of high-quality flesh - all you could hope for from this genre in one package"
1,"Out of the Garden of Eden . . . To many people Mr. Young's thesis will seem to be outlandish. Yet, he is the one author I know of who actually tries to seek out the origins of religion using modern research into chimpanzee behavior. I wonder what Jane Goodall thinks of it? First there was Freud's Totem and Taboo, a mere root to Young's amazing tree. As he writes, "" . . . the Darwinian-Freudian-Foxian root-stock on to which I would graft the story of alpha-shaman."" I'm not sure exactly how to take him, but it is dazzling stuff. Since there was no impartial observer in the Garden of Eden, perhaps he is correct."
1,"Dell E207WFP Monitor This monitor, when it first came out, received rave reviews and I have not been disappointed. Since first buying it a few years ago, I have since added two additional ones as well. I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a older model that performs well."
1,"Your Child Your Child is one of the best books I have ever picked up to read! My toddler and I were experiencing some difficulties at home, which is why I purchased the book. After reading this wonderful map through childhood, I believe we are both going to be just fine. It gives hope to parents that we really are doing a good job at raising our kids in todays world. And if we aren't, it gives great advise on how to seek help. This isn't your typical ""self-help"" book!"
1,Hard Times Book was in excellent condition and service was excellent. It's not the seller's fault that the book is boring.
1,"To Jake Song Jake Song ""Jake"" (New Jersey USA) this is for you remember when you said ask you if anyone wants to know the glich to get any battle chip you want. [...]"
1,pretty outfit this item was fantastic and neat. it arrived on time.it was worth the money. I will buy more items like this again.
1,cooker This is a book I had when I was in the first grade. I recently started cooking with my eight year old and hoped this book was still out there. I have never seen it it a bookstore and there it was on Amazon and for less than three dollars!! It was exactly the way I remembered it. We have already made several of the things in the book. We have a lot of fun looking at the pictures and following the directions and the together time is great! A classic forever!
1,"Regina Carter., Motor City Moments, I'll Be Seeing You, Paganini After A Dream. I'm reviewing all three Albums together as they are by the same artist; Regina Carter. Again I purchased these Albums on the basis of a 30 sec listen. They all lived up to my expectations. If anyone is familiar with Stephane Grapelli, Regina Carter's style is very similar. She really swings. I love these albums and play them over and over again."
1,"excellent praise and worship CD I really enjoyed this album, especially the songs ""I can't live without you"", ""King of Glory"", ""More of You"", and ""One God"". There were a few songs that would be good for choirs or dance ministries. I'll play this one for a while."
1,"un livre pour comprendre la vie / a guide for life En rÃ©sumÃ©, si vous tes dans une pÃ©riode de votre vie oÃ¹ tout semble arriver sans raison et but prÃ©cis...ce livre pourrais bien vous redonnez de l'espoir et vous aider Ã  comprendre ''le pourquoi'' de la vie.In resumÃ©, if your stuck in a rut, and you feel like nothing is going like you planned out in life; that your wondering why ''this or that'' is happenning....this book will give you hope by allowing you to understand ''the why'' of life."
1,"Wonderful! Consider what might have happened to England if Dracula had survived Stoker's novel. This is the premise upon which Newman's story is built. Fortunately, his knowledge of Victorian history and literature is matched only by his brilliant ability as a storyteller. Newman is one of the best!"
1,"As advertised The seller presented the title accurately and honestly. The book arrived in a timely manner, in tact."
1,Crucial Confrontations Excellent book. Easy directions and explanations to implement the Crucial Confrontation Model.
1,"Best Business Tool Ever! Knowing I had to face a crucial confrontation I looked for answers to help me in this uncomfortable situation; and, I found them!! Not only is the information valuable in business but it applies to family and life in general. Recommend it to anyone that has a hard time facing confrontations. It is written in a way that is both easy to understand and to apply. The information flows in a format that makes total sense."
1,"Great for individuals or companies The follow up to ""Crucial Conversations"" this book has some great tools and insight into dealing with those crucial confrontations that we all have from time to time."
1,Best on this topic! This is the most practical and best researched book on conflict resolution. On my top 10 best management/leadership books. Must read!
1,WOW!!!! Great reference book! I bought this as an inspiration for my wife who makes boxes. We both love the book and have come away with some great ideas!
1,"Great Music This is a great music DVD I love it. Lot's of rock stars and loads of songs, I am very pleased. Money well spent, If you like this DVD you will love ""A Concert For George"" that was a ten plus+++++"
1,"Music for Montserrat The most amazing music DVD I have ever seen. I have had many a party when this DVD was played that captivated the crowd. To have Paul McCartney, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Sting, Phil Collins, Mark Knoffler and more all playing together is an historic event.DC"
1,Fantastic! This is one of the best music DVD's I've ever seen. If you likeany of the artists listed on the sleeve -- and particularly ifyou like most or all of them -- you'll love this DVD. Claptonplays rhythm guitar on Money for Nothing. Knopfler playsbackup on Layla. Everyone plays on Golden Slumbers -- whichfinishes with The End and Carry That Weight. Awesome!
1,"All-Star Lineup This is a very good recording of a fabulous concert. The sound and picture are first rate and the list of performers is, simply, a stunning collection of British rockers. McCartney singing ""Golden Slumbers"" is alone worth the purchase price. I highly recommend it."
1,"A page-turner! I could not put this book down! The story is riveting and heartbreaking, and the writing is fantastic -- this reads like a novel more than a true crime. I felt like I was right there as the horrifying events unfold, and as the family deals with the tragedy and the injustices that follow. What I admired most is how the author, herself in the center of the story, manages to be so generous in its telling. We go into the heads and viewpoints of each family member as well as the four killers, and as a result we get a nuanced, thoughtful and balanced portrait of that fateful night and resulting tragedy. The killers are living breathing men whose lives and personalities converge to create this crime -- a senseless tragedy that robs the world of two amazing, spirited young women. The author calls the book her ""personal memory stone"" to her cousins, and it's a beautiful, heartbreaking tribute."
1,"Strange Twists This true account is well written, riviting, and perfectly clear. What happens to the young man is beyond understanding. Crime on top of crime is what comes to mind. But he survived to tell the story."
1,"headphone extension. almost a year of use, and it still works great, this runs from our tv, to my treadmill, I exercise 6 days a week, and this is a fantastic extension."
1,"Love it I am allowed to listen to music with headphones when I'm at work, but my computer is on the floor and it's too far for my headphones to reach, so I bought this extension cord and it has saved my life. I'm happily listening to music as I type this!!"
1,"Free at last! This headphone extension works great. I bought it for use at work, and it's wonderful not to be tethered to my desk. I may now move freely around my cubicle without constantly having to take off my headphones. It may be my imagination, but I swear the sound quality has improved too."
1,"The BEST book I have ever read. This book has everything! Romance, intrigue, deceit, Religious persicution, War... with a discription and belief in honor, love and God that parellel my own beliefs. This book has been a multiple read for me and I will probably read it many, Many more times."
1,Awesome!!! Very good book! Well written and a def must have for all collectors!!!! It's a little off from the movie but still as exciting as it gets you to want more and more Rambo!!!
1,"Rambo III: This Time It's for his Friend Co-written by David Morrell (FIRST BLOOD AND RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II). Based on a Screenplay by Sylvester Stallone and Sheldon Lettich.John Rambo. The most dangerous man alive. His country has called him once again -- this time for a mission he will not accept. Living in exile in a Buddist monestary, far from home, he is finished with the glory and the blood of war.Now, his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman, the only man Rambo trusts, is in trouble. On a mission meant for Rambo, he has been captured by Soviet troops on the Afghan border.For John Rambo it's a call to arms. And an invitation back into Hell...with the help of Afghan rebels."
1,"Um album excelente I know that this wonderful band delayed five years to launch this album, however was compensatory. The quality of this material is surpreedente. The style of the band is gothic/atmospheric. In some passes of the CD, we perceive the influence of the Dead Can Dance. For who it does not know, the songestress of the band, Francesca Nicoli, is the same songstress of the band "" Ataraxia "". The vocal masculine is for account of the Andrea Zanetti, where the gothic style predominates. All the CD is excellent, the instrumental part is sufficiently melancholic, but gorgeous. The bands prettiest of the CD are, instrumental:""Battesimo: Nero Opaco "" (introduction), "" Consuming Jerusalem "", ""Fade to Grey "", "" On perspective of Spiritual Catharsis "" (Title) and "" Nephtali "". Who to want to acquire this CD, with certainty will not go to repent itself, valley to confer."
1,"strangely wonderful If you've seen that strange and wonderful movie, The Triplets of Belleville, then you should order the soundtrack. If the triplet's song plays over and over in your head, then you need the cd, because not only is it there three times (twice in French and once in English), but the French Mafia' s theme shows you those horrid clones perfectly. If you've ever wanted a recording of music by a vacuum cleaner, a newspaper, a bicycle wheel and a refrigerator, this is the cd for you."
1,"Small but contains the universe.. Another treasure from one of the world's greatest-somewhat-unknown poets...more more more is all I can say! To see his translations in his own hand is the greatest thrill, as well as the brief but wonderful interview at the end conducted by the editor and publishers. A true touchstone for living dharma and freedom."
1,"The real deal. I ordered this charger for my Canon PowerShot SD 880 IS. Fortunately, I ALWAYS go to Amazon when looking for anything. I found an ORIGINAL Canon battery charger for a lot less( half off!) than the Canon site's price & with Amazon Prime shipping & it's guarantee. I was able to order two for the price of one charger. They both came in authentic Canon boxes & sealed new. I have two Canon batteries for my camera, so I immediately popped them into charge. They went into the charger perfectly and charged within two hrs. I'm SO glad that Amazon had these chargers on their site. They're authentic & backed by Amazon's guarantee."
1,Great Service for My Charger Thank you for great prompt service for the Canon camera charger.I misplaced mine a month ago and was in desperate need of a new one> Thank you so much!
1,Oem replacement This is the perfect replacement to your lost charger. Not much to say about it. I like that it doesn't have a long wire. The electric prongs slide in and out of the back. Good compact and portable.
1,Works great This was a replacement for our original recharger and it was a wonderful price. We are happy with it so far after a charge or two. We just bought some super cheap replacement batteries and will see how they fare. Was happy to bring the camera back to life with these purchases!
1,"Exactly the charger that came with the camera If you lost your charger that came with the camera, this is exactly the same one. I looked for cheaper versions at Best Buy and other stores, but those chargers were all so much larger in size. This Cannon charger is so compact that it is easy to keep with the camera, and it seems to charge faster than the cheaper brands as well."
1,Happy with a Canon product again This is a well made battery charger and very easy to use. No long cord with a plug. It plugs right into the electric socket. Handy to carry with you. I am happy with the Canon SD700IS digital camera and not surprised that any accessories would also merit a 5 star rating.
1,"Works great! Got this to replace the missing one from my daughters camera. It works perfectly! We really shopped around but found that Amazon had the best price on the real Canon charger. There were many others that, when examined closely, were not actually Canon brand. We were not willing to take the risk of an off brand just to save a few $$. Would recommend to others."
1,Works as expected I lost my original charger and needed a replacement. Works as expected. Charges the battery quickly and the battery holds a charge for a good amount of time.
1,Just like the original one. I lost the battery charger that came with my Canon camera this Christmas. Looked for a while for a replacement and found this one. Looks exactly like the original one and works just as good.
1,"Great solid performance / Great Action / Great Music I first saw the HBO Special, and looked forward for the DVD to come out with Dobly 5.1. Fun to watch, and dance too. They did a great job on this DVD."
1,"Excellent Concert By Excellent Artist! Janet is one of the best artists in music and she knows how to get a crowd going, even when it's home viewers with their DVD's. I saw Janet in concert as well and it's really this much fun. This is also a great DVD as well. Great motion menu's and animated chapter selection. Get the DVD now!"
1,Janet!!! Janet is at her best in this excellent concert! I love this video and have seen many concerts... This it top entertainment!! I recommend it highly.Janet Jackson - The Velvet Rope Tour (Live in Concert) (DTS)
1,"All Hail the Queen of Pop Okay, I'll admit it...I'm a Janet fan. But you've got to give it to her, Girlfriend is a fantastic performer. This video proves it. I've seen her live twice and this video brought me back to the great times I had at those concerts. She gives so much of herself that you don't mind the price you paid for the tickets. With that in mind, this video is a bargain at any price. Madonna who?"
1,"An awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists... Simply an awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists (Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Hound Dog Taylor, etc.) from an Austrian label called Wolf Records."
1,"Another Great Addition To The Buddy Holl(e)y Story! If you are a totally out of control Buddy Holly fan (like I am), then this book is a ""must have"" for your library! It adds a great deal of information about Buddy and his performances in England and is well written and researched with some great bibliographic information!"
1,The last Xbox book you will ever need! This book describes how to do anything and everything you could ever want with an xbox.It starts of very simple by describing how to open up the xbox and take out the parts. But by the end of the book you will have covered such things as;-Installing Mod chips on all versions of xbox-Choosing the right dashboard-Learning the Xenium OS-FTP your computer and xbox-Flashing a bios and installing a dash board-Customizing your own dashboard-Replacing the case-Installing hard drives over 137GB's-Custom lighting-Xbox Media CenterThese are just a few of the many things that fascinated me about this book. A person who has never seen an xbox before could pick up this book and read it and have a completely pimped out xbox in a week.It is FULL of very detailed explanations and it has tons of very useful photographs.I would HIGHLY recommend this for ANY one who is going to open up their xbox.
1,Working cable I had no issues running this cable through a drop ceiling and connecting it in to my devices. The connectors seem solid and had no issues during connection.
1,"awesome!! Makes the speakers portable, without this harness the speakers are difficult to handle.Altec Lansing IM7 Speaker Shoulder Harness"
1,"IM7 Shoulder Harness - Great! Besides being so happy with the IM7 Speaker Boombox that I got for my daughter (the sound is terrific, it rocks), the shoulder harness is great. You put it on the IM7 and just leave it on. It makes the IM7 much more portable. I love the IM7! And the harness. What a team!"
1,"Could be Crawford's Best! Joan Crawford & Jack Palance are sheer perfection in this tightly directed film noir suspense film. Not for a moment does the tension ease! Crawford has done excellent work in many of her large library of films, but this ranks right at the top. This is one to own!"
1,"Quit your whining, this DVD rocks! Alright, there are no special features. Alright, so there aren't even any subtitles. And there are a couple of seconds where the picture had grain- ok, I give. But overall, this film is excellently presented. I don't have any complaints about the sound or the picture- in fact, I thought it was remarkably clear considering that it hasn't been preserved as well as a lot of other pictures. Trust me, the plot more than makes up for any minor annoyances.In an Oscar nominated performance, Joan Crawford plays successful playwright Myra Hudson. When she falls in love with a handsome actor named Lester (played by Jack Palance, nominated for Best Supporting Actor) everything seems perfect. But when she discovers her husband's plot to murder her, she designs a plan to reverse the gun.This movie is great, and if you're not one of those people who whine when they don't get all the bells and whistles, you'll love it too."
1,Honestly Raw It makes us look at our lives as Africans living in America...trying to assimilate into mainstream America or maintain our Blackness. One thing that affirmed what I've always said is that we have to try to help whomever we can to realize their potential.
1,"classic every young lady and young man should read this book in high school or freshman year in college. easy read in one day, get it, read it ,enjoy it, i did twice:)"
1,"Life Changing Memoir I was in my early twenties when this book found its way into my heart; I will never forget the sound of Sister Souljah's voice in my head, I could hear her words and feel the pain rising from the pages. Though it has been since the early nineties that I read No Disrespect, I will always heartily recommend Sister Souljah's grand debut; this book is pure heart; not easy to come by in these plastic times. I say, pick it up and give it a read, you won't be disappointed, and something might change within your soul, a new perspective, or even a song within your heart might be born and you might chance to sing along with No Disrespect ~ I think it takes guts to write like this, and this author has my full respect for putting herself out there. Not an easy thing to do. Sometimes its not easy to read a book chock full of opinions that one may or may not agree with; and that is the glorious thing about this book; new perspective, new horizons; freedom to think newly."
1,Simply Excellent There aren't enough words to explain how much I enjoyed this book. Everyone should read this joint! I read it twice!
1,"UNDER-RATED Fates Warning's Inside Out is hailed by a majority of their fans as one of the band's weakest, if not the weakest album. I dont agree with this feeling.Inside Out is similar to Parallels, but generally lighter. The lyrics are more focused on euphoric feelings. Its a light progressive fans dream. If you like the melody and passion of No Exit, and the lighter feel of Parallels, this is the Fates Warning CD for you. But do not buy this CD if you expect Fates to bring the Metal, because they dont.Inside Out is my second Fav Fates, next to No Exit."
1,Amazing An amazing book that I couldn't put down. The Shuberts have compiled a great tribute to Broadway theater. It's worth the money if you are a theater history buff!
1,A Real Page Turner Jack Polidoro has a writing style that will keep you turning the pages. This book is a fast read. The plot is exciting and moves. Jack has a way of making the tale come alive in your head. This book should be made into one of those disaster movies starring George Kennedy. It would be a knock-out! Jack included a generous helping of juicy sex too.
1,"Excellent The Freddie Slack collection is especially well assembled. It's great to hear these tracks again, particularly his work with Margaret Whiting."
1,"great I thought this was great. The complaints about sound and video quality I thought were unfounded. I didn't find her annoying and both my husband and I did laugh and learn. The breathing techniques are helpful and clearly taught, and being a dvd if you miss it or somehow just aren't getting it you can always rewind. I especially like this format compared to a class as I can review this any time I feel the need."
1,"The Perfect Shower Gift! Soon after my baby shower our doctor ordered me on bed rest. She said I wouldn't be able to attend a regular lamaze class and recommended this DVD. Happily, my sister had just given it to us as a shower gift. It was a joy to watch and very informative."
1,Great product This is a great product. We watched a couple child birthing videos and this one was by far the most informative and entertaining. Great money saving idea too with birthing classes costing over $100 these days. Highly recommended. Other videos in the series are great too (breastfeeding and newborn care). Good luck!
1,Very Informative Video! I am so glad I did not sign up for in-person classes. This video fulfills that need. I now feel very well-informed.
1,"Learn About Birth at Home: Convenient, Easy Love it!This DVD includes real couples in classes by Shirley (who is teaching the classes)In a nutshell she walks you through women anatomy, birth (or labor signs), do's and dont's; breathing exercises, and labor.Because each sections is separated in chapters, you can choose which ones to view; The best part is to be able to view this in the comfort of your home with your partner or husband, at your convenience; ask questions to you doctor or midwife as well."
1,"Complete classes at your convenience As a ""first-timer,"" I knew I needed to take a childbirth/lamaze class. Since I'm still working full-time, however, I couldn't imagine having to drive into town and actually sit through scheduled lessons. This DVD was truly the answer. We learned just as much as we would have if we actually went to a live class, if not more (I know this because I did actually go to classes with my sister a few years back). Yes, the instructor has sort of an unusual sense of humor--but she gives you tons of information, answers the questions you'd ask if you were there in person, and addresses the issues you were unaware of or might be afraid to ask about. The best part is I could sit on the couch in my PJs and hit ""pause"" if I needed a potty break!"
1,"So Much Information plus You Can Watch at Your Own Pace I am pregnant with my first and this DVD was great. It was easy to understand and gave all the important information I need to know before I go into labor. I especially like the fact that I could attend classes at the local hospital, but my schedule is very hectic. This way I can watch it as many times as I need to and in the comfort of my house."
1,"Definitely worth getting We chose to get this DVD prior to enrolling in any local class. I'm glad we did. I've never gone to a class on this information so won't really compare a class to the video.This DVD was extremely informative. Yes, there are some antics and humor in the DVD that may not suit all tastes, but this is not a comedy DVD. The purpose of us buying this was to gain understanding of what's in store for our first childbirth, not to be entertained. If she didn't have some of the comedy and antics this would be a really boring dump of straight knowledge like a college course or something. I think she does a great job overall in the DVD mixing facts, concerns, choices, questions, and keeping us paying attention with some comedic examples and editorial.I would recommend this to any of my friends/family. It's great to own because I know we will need to watch this again at least once. There's a lot of content for review."
1,"Well Worth It! We did not take a birth class, they were too expensive, cost too much, and who's got the time?! I did a lot of reading, and thought I was good-to-go... Women have done this for 1000's of years right? I don't need a class....Wait... Maybe just a short class. By the time I found this DVD I was 37 weeks along!I saw the reviews that the instructor was annoying, and tried too hard. So what?! I didn't want this women to be my new best friend! I wanted to see what she had to say, and I'm glad I did!After watching this DVD set I went on to have a natural labor & delivery! I knew how to breath, I knew how to push, I knew when to go to the hospital. She covered all the key points, and I would reccomend this to any pregnant women, and her coach. No doubt, it's well worth it!"
1,"Required Purchase for all Pregnant Mothers (and Fathers) A major challenge of preparing for childbirth is the immense volume of information you are required to digest in a relatively short period of time. Most people have huge networks of people who give them tons of advice, which often serves to confuse rather than to enlighten since it is often contradictory. Enter Sheri Bayles.This product is amazing. It provides vitually everything you need to know, in a super efficient format. And with Sheri Bayles' witty presentation, the DVD is engaging and entertaining. Sheri Bayles has a way of making you feel comfortable and confident, by being honest, upfront and absolutely comprehensive.This DVD should be required viewing in all OB/GYN waiting rooms and hospitals. An absolute must buy."
1,Very Helpful...........! I loved this Dvd. It had so much info that I found so very helpful. I would tell all my friends to buy it. It was very intertaining and funny. It awnsered all my questions on child birth.
1,Good Down Home Blues I enjoyed listening to Big Wheeler. He played his harmonica and sang like the old Delta blues I grew up with. Thumbs up!
1,"You did it! I had to priviledge to get to know Izzy while he was recording his album in orlando, FL. He is an extremely talented and anointed young man. Most of all he is a christian behind the scenes and in his real everyday life. His production is super hot and his lyrics are uplifing. I hope that everyone who listens to his samples will buy the album and support my boy. You did it Izzy!"
1,How To Speak and Write Correctly It has been a long time since high school and college English classes. This book helped me remember things I did not realize I had forgotten. Order it today. See what you forgot!! I would give more stars if it were possible!!!
1,"Masterpiece. Excellent album, a masterpiece of this guys (and the shipping was absolutely great). A must in every music collection."
1,"AN INCREDIBLE BOOK!!! This book was riveting from the first page! I couldn't put it down and ignored children, laundry, and dishes until I reached the end. Adams brilliantly weaves her characters through an 'end of days' experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat (At least it kept me on the edge of mine!) Can't wait for book three!"
1,WOW! This is an awesome CD. The title track will put you in a state of mind that makes other music become just noise.A truly talented man.
1,"This One Will Surprise You I was so happy to see this came out on DVD, finally. This is a longtime favorite movie of mine. I love to share it with friends who have never seen it; they invariably enjoy it as much if not more than me. Believe it or not, it's a great ""date movie"" to cuddle up with....there are enough plot twists to make the story, at one time or another, enjoyable for just about everyone, and yet nobody will be turned off by them. This movie is great fun....enjoy!!!!"
1,Great Great movie. I had to watch it for class and I actually enjoyed it!! It's in French but you won't even realize you're reading the subtitles
1,"Delightful and funny This was a really funny movie. I usually don't like reading sub-titles, but I hardly even noticed them because the movie was so good. The humor is understated and well-done. I highly recommend this movie."
1,Daniel Auteuil is fabulous I've been a fan of Daniel Auteuil for some time and look forward to each new movie. This one is very funny and entertaining.
1,"If you didn't already know... This whole series of books is magnificent. So unique, such a wonderful heroine. There are a lot of details in these books, and it's easy to get bogged down in them, but you just have to look at it as a learning experience. Other than that, this book is fantastic. Moving and inspiring. Could teach people today a thing or two about racism. The only thing I would caution is that I bought this to go with my set, which are the normal size for novels and this book is like a foot high. Not what I thought I was getting. But the text itself is fabulous!!"
1,"Captivating and fascinating! From the moment you open the book and begin reading the first page, you will most likely be hooked to Auel's first novel in the Earth's Children series. Auel did wonders with this first book! Not only is the story of Ayla, the blonde-haired orphan raised by Neanderthals, touching and, at times, exciting, there is a wealth of knowledge about Ice Age plants and animals. The first installment of the series can, at times, move along more slowly then I would have liked. However, I never found myself bored when reading this book. The ending won't necessarily leave you on the edge of your seat but you will be longing to read the next installment as soon as possible."
1,"The Clan of the Cave Bear An excellent AUEL written story that you cannot put down, Many suprises, and life as it was thousands of years ago. EXCELLENT RECOMMENDATION."
1,"I'm going nuts! PPLLEEAASSEE HURRY UP! I read this book when I was in grade 5, am now in grade 8 and have read it 5 times since then! Okay, so I'm a literiture junkie. I have read the whole series twice and have thought about the fifth book for so long that I think I could write it myself!"
1,"Take a walk on an awesome journey into the past It's a wild ride that you will take with Ayla as she learns what the world around her is all about. This book is a real treat. Start with this one (it is the first in a series of four, soon to be five books) and keep going. Jean Auel is definitely talented. Enjoy"
1,Great book if you like the ice age........... I loved this book. I have read it and the rest in the series at least 5 times. Not only were they fun to read I also felt they were educational and Jean Auel did so much research to try and make the books as accurate as possible.
1,"The Clan of the Cavebear The book was listed as used but was in perfect condition. Excellent book, I would recommend it highly. It is evident that the author did extensive research before writing the book."
1,"These stories are fascinating! I have the whole series on my Kindle Fire, and I love to read them over and over again. THey are really good reading."
1,The Cave Bear Series The Claln of the Cave Bear. I had lost the original book that I had purchased so I chose this oneTo replace the first book of this Earth's Children Series. I love this book very much and reread it immediately. This soft cover volume is easier for my elderly fingers to handle while reading. This is a series that will never grow old and one that I will pass on to my grandchildren in the future.
1,"Wonderful Description Of Life During The Ice Age Auel's story of Ayla who lived at an earlier time during human evolution is very exciting. Auel's description of life during the ice age is well researched and her writing is filled with description of life at that time. This is the first book in the series and, in my opinion, it is the best of the bunch. For the reader, it is thrilling to learn and imagine what life must have been like during this earlier age.I ""read the book"" on an unabridged audio by Brilliance Corporation. Their version was very well produced so that the listener feels like he is right there with Ayla at that earlier time."
1,"The Clan Of The Cave Bear Loved the story. And have now read the next book Valley Of The Horses, and am in the process of getting the third book, The Mammoth Hunter. Great Author."
1,Great book! I love this book! The entire series!=) Everyone should read it. You feel you are actually there through the story.
1,"Fabulous book, couldn't put it down! I loved this book, and I can't wait to buy The Valley of Horses. The way Ms. Auel could create such an intricate culture amazed me. Her writing techniques combined with a wonderful plotline make for an incredibly enjoyable book."
1,"Excellent! Non-stop reading, I couldn't put it down. This book was the first ever I had read of its kind. Not usually into the prehistoric era, I found that I fell in love with the characters. I cried and laughed with them. I am looking forward to her fifth book of the series."
1,"The Clan of the cave bears I read almost all of these books many, many years ago and found them so interesting - am loving The Clan again, and will probably order the entire set in time. So nice not to have the usual voilence, although the primitives were sometimes pretty rough, but in a more natural way! Just lovely night-time reading whilst the hubby snores!!! So good to have something to read in the dark."
1,"MY WIFE ABOUT FELL OVER! She had a older book in paper back, but the ex tore it up in spite. I got her the hard back, and she nearly broke my back with excitment!!! She was nearly in tears she was so happy."
1,"Great. Really Great. I really liked this book, I have always been interested in early man, and I think this book sheds new light on the way it could of been back then. I found this book facinating, and I think that it was a wonderful experence.Although she didn't have any facts she still did a good job of filling in those empty spaces."
1,Very good I rated that good because this book grabbed my attention inmediatly. Not only is intersting but also instructive. I recommends it to everybody. Regards.
1,"Neato This is unlike my usual choice of reading, but I really enjoyed it. It contained a lot of interesting events and information that really stimulated my anger (such as the cruel treatment of Broud to Ayla). I disliked Broud and would have done everything in my power to annoy him if I were Ayla. i am disappointed that Ayla left her son behind with the clan, but he would have slowed her down. I reccomend this book for any avid reader that can handle long yet interesting books. Also, if I were a district official of a school, I would make it mandatory for prehistoric history students."
1,"The details in this book will blow your mind. I loved this book so much. Ayla is sure to be a classic in liturature to come in the next decade or so. She is a great role modle. I think this woman has major courage! If this is your first book in the series, keep reading it's worth the time and effort, I promise!"
1,"A GREAT book. The Great Book. I got this book for Christmas, and was hesitant to read it, because it sounded a little boring. But I brought myself to read it, and loved it! I loved every word! It is 500 pgs, and I read it in 3 days. It was so excellent. Jean Auel expressed Ayla's feeling, Broud's hatred, Iza's love, and Creb's frustration. It was a wonderful story!"
1,"The Best Book Ever! The best book is this one right here! Ms. Auel's story makes you feel as though you right there next to Ayla the whole time. You're there when she's in the earthquake, during her time with the clan, when she leaves and all the way up until the end. When I read the first story, I couldn't put it down and when I finished, I ran to the bookstore to buy the others. I can't wait for the fifth one to come out. And as long as there are more books of this series coming, I'll be reading them. Two thumbs up and a must read!"
1,Stunning What an amazing and visually stunning book. It has been years since I have read anything that has shook me to the core of my humanity. This book has done just that. Will be reading this entire series. Such a prolific and dynamic writer. So glad my mother in law introduced me to this author.
1,"Classic While some people complain of inaccuracies in Ms. Auel's novel, it is important to remember that this was written in the 70's, back before much of our archaeological technologies existed. Much of what we know today we did not know back then, especially in the field of genes. However, with what she researched back then, we're presented with a solid and enjoyable read. The descriptions are lush (and sometimes overwhelming) and you definitely get a very good read - I find this better than many novels today by sub-par authors like Danielle Steel and Fern Michaels."
1,"A tour de force in literature I read this book around 30n years ago, and have read it several times since. The amount of research that Ms. Auel puts into these books make the story really shine. I had no problem envisioning the settings and surroundings of the Clan and their territory. Sometimes Ms. Auel could get heavy on descriptions, but better than some authors who rush through this vital element of any story. Ayla's struggle to fit in with the Clan and learn their ways is not always easy, especially with the constant antagonism of Broud, a man who hates Ayla for no apparent reason. In the immensely patriarchal society of the Clan, where it is okay for a man to beat a woman, Ayla has a hard time, but there are also good moments, and she finds a place of value within the Clan. This is a book I will never forget, and it is a shame that this enthralling saga came to such a pathetic end in 'Land of Painted Caves', the sixth and final book of this series."
1,"I've read it countless times This is one of the few books that I've read *many* times. It's one of my favorite books. It tells the story of Ayla, that, due to an earthquake in her childhood, is adopted by a group of people that are both like and unlike her. In order to fit in to her new society, she must go against her own instict. She learns to hunt, though it's forbiddin, and she learns to heal..because her family thinks that this is the only way she will have any value in the patriarchal society. She is raped at a young age, and bears a child, which she nearly loses.Many people are critical, because Ayla is TOO perfect, and discovers too much. Well...so what? It's fiction. She isn't perfect in every way, and she is full of self doubt, and frequently makes poor decisions in her life.Ayla is a strong character, and Jean Auel is a great writer, and the imagery in her books is fantastic. They are well researched and enjoyable. I loved it!"
1,"Fantastic series....have read every one This is one of the better book series out there. You grow to love the characters, and they are quite realistic. Talk about going back in time because of a book! Jean Auel has a wonderful way of doing that for the reader. Excellent series in which I've anxiously read every book."
1,"clan of the cave bear It will be difficult to keep once step ahead of ms aurels. I never gave any thought to people of this time in our history. But from the first paragra your mind carries you away to a new adventure, which gives promise to a long and happy union."
1,"Amazing book Finished reading this last night. Amazing story!!! It was a bit difficult getting through the 1st chapter but after that, I was good to go! Totally imaginative, riveting, touching & pretty much leaves you with a kinda obsessive focus even when you're not reading. I loved the language; can't remember the last time I read a book that taught me SO many new words!!! & the story line? good grief....... I totally had NO idea the book was going to be that intense! or amazing! It's one of those moments where I realize & appreciate that you really cannot judge a book by it's cover/name. Some things you just MUST read! Auel is so descriptive and thorough in her writing. I'm so happy I came across this series... it realllllyyy makes you THINK and pulls on all your emotions. If you're reading this on your kindle, you will truly indulge in and love the dictionary! Every few pages I will hover my kindle cursor over a word and get the definition. Good stuff!"
1,Clan of the cave bear This book came within a week of when I ordered it. It was in good condition and I am enjoying it.
1,Absolutely wonderful! Jean Auel is a wonderful writer! Her books magiacally come alive. Impossible to put down once it has been started! The best book I have read in my lifetime!
1,"Absolutely Breathtaking!!!!!!!!!!! I first read Clan of the Cave Bear when I was prompted by my mom.I thought ""another one of your lousy stories"" I read the first page and I was enthralled!! I simply could not take my eyes off the page!!I am a 12-year-old living in Kars,Ontario,and I reccommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!!!!Nobody writes like Jean M. Not ever.This book made me laugh,as well as cry. I have read all of her books,and am eagerly awaiting her 5th book.I love this book! I would give it 10000000 stars,if possible. If anyone dares to insult her work in my presence......."
1,Where is N 5 and 6 I've read the 4 books by Jean M. Auel (twice). I'm sure the story has not ended yet. I cannot sleep because I want to know what happens next. Please Mrs. Auel could you finish the other books as you entended to do ? A suggestion : the story is very strong on its own. No need to waste paper by inserting a full description of their love-life every twenty pages. I'm sure you did it for commercial reasons and not because the story is incomplete without these descriptions. Thanks for the many hours of joy I had with your books. Hope I did not make to many mistakes in English.Anita
1,Clan Of The Cave Bear by Jean Auel A beautiful story. Couldn't put it down. So well written that I felt like I was there with Ayla and the clan.
1,A novel you will be reading into the early morning hours While reading this series it seemed to always slip into my mind throughout anytime of the day. It became so facinating that I would ponder it constantly. I am marveled at the talent Mrs.Auel has been blessed with and grateful she has shared her blessings and given us a true heroine in Ayla. This will been a series I will treasure and will love to read again and again.The time she has put into researching truely paid off.You feel as if you are right there treking along on the steppes. Reading this series has been such a wonderful experience.
1,"Excellent!!! My best friend first introduced these books to me probably when I was 14 or 15. Since then, I have not been able to put them down. I don't know how many times that I've read, and re-read these books. They still get me every time. The detailing and description really makes me think, and visualize what Ayla sees. I often wish that I could be her, sees what she sees, and Jondalar! How cute is he? I know every book almost off by heart. I know what's coming, and how they will all end, but I still anticipate and agonize every time. I haven't bought many other books because the Earth's Children Series always satisfies, and leaves me wanting more. I too, am anxious for the next book(s) to come out. Hurry up already!"
1,"MAJESTIC, AMAZING, CAPTIVATING I read this book for the first time when I was 14 years old. Since that time, I got the others in the series. I cannot tell you how many times I have read and reread this story, as well as the others. At one time, they came together in paperback, and I bought it. Now, they are so ragged they are held together by tape. I have been awaiting the time when Mrs. Auel comes out with another book. I would definetely be in line for that one."
1,Excellent Book One of the best books I've read. It brought tears to my eyes especially at the end. Strong and touching it made me really think. The book is excellent to the very last word.
1,"A Must-Read book and series I purchased this copy of ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" to help complete the set of ""Earth's Children"" books. My first reading of it was a library book. I loved the series and decided to own and reread them all. Jean Auel is amazing and I look forward to another book."
1,Excellent compilation on Leadershipattributes for innovation Excellent compilation on Leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well written articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon. I enjoy reading Peter Drucker's books and the content of the book has Peter Drucker's flavor to it. The Clarity and style of this book is truly outstanding.
1,"Love My New Orleans Saints Floor Mats I am a New Orleans Saints fan and have been since the franchise began. I no longer live in New Orleans but I do still support the team. I wear Saints gear when they play and so does our dog. My entire family are die hard Saints fans. I fly my Saints flag on my car, so why not have the Saints floor mats. Every time I get in my car, I say ""geaux Saints!!!!"" The color is perfect for the interior of my vehicle. I would recommend the Saints floor mats to all Saints fans. I just wished there were mats for the rear."
1,"book i have this book and bought it for my best friend. It has a lot of easy, inexpensive ideas; great reference book."
1,"A Civilization Swept Away The son of a Russian general, Prince Serge Obolensky grew up at the court of Nicholas II, and served as an officer in the Chevalier Guards in WWI. This is a remarkable tale of Obolensky's long and varied life - from student to soldier to City stockbroker to soldier again (this time as Lt. Col. in the US OSS in WWII) to hotel impresario in New York City. Married first to a Russian princess and later to Alice Astor, Obolensky was one of those rare 20th c. characters who ""knew everyone"". Yet he comes across in print as humble and self-deprecating. He was a leading representative of a civilization that was completely swept away by the 1917 Revolution. This is a good read; it is a pity it is not in print at present."
1,"Un libro importante Por favor, no te importa mi espaÃ±ol pobre, pero en serio no soy hispanohablante. Cuando tuve trece aÃ±os esto libro mi mejora amiga me dio, y imediamente fue enamorado con su idioma, tema, y jugadores en una historia complicada y intimo. ""Mas Que Humano"" es un libro de los mas importantes del siencias, y de los libros intelligentes."
1,"Not your usual romance movie This movie has a wonderful and fully devloped story that reveals itself slowly during the first part of the film. It is filled with family drama, sexual tension, and one mans deep love for his family when he knows he is dying. Well worth the long movie time, and being dubbed in English (I am American and don't speak Danish). I am still thinking about it today, after watching it yesterday evening."
1,one of my favorite films Great film. Interesting narrative that is easy to follow. The story of a past love reintroduced and how a twenty year gap has effected those involved. A new family is melded as the original partners story is revealed. Beautifully shot and cast.
1,"Superb Movie Great acting by all, love all the characters and the story, a real love story. Watching the deleted scenes and listening to the director interview really fills in the whole story and adds to the character motives. I enjoyed the spoken Danish. I'll enjoy watching it many times."
1,Great Movie!!! Flawless... great movie with lots of heart and a beautiful perspective. Thoughtful story line that makes life hit home! Enjoy!
1,"Ridiculous replay value Path of Radiance is an incredible game that I've spent waaayyyy too much time on, simply because there are so many characters to choose from, and thus so many different tactics to use. It's an excellent turn based strategy game that requires much more planning and attention to enemy movement capabilities than other similar games (e.g. FF Tactics). The only real gripe I have with the game is the fact that you cannot revive characters once they die, so you may find yourself in the position of nearly complete with a stage when an enemy gets a lucky critical hit on one of your guys and destroys him, leading to you beating your controller against your head / swearing liberally as you reach for the reset button and prepare yourself for another hour of the same exact stage. Thus, I only gave it 4 ""fun"" stars, because having your characters die is definitely NOT fun. Otherwise, I love this game, and highly reccommend it."
1,"A Fantastic epic! This has got be one of the best games out there for the gamecube. The combat is simple and easy to learn, yet later on it soon get,s very complicated and fun at the same time. About 3% of the story is done through cinematic cutscenes and the voice acting is good. The graphics are beautiful and colerful and look great. everything also sounds good too. The story is showstopping and full of surprises and in terms of epic it can be compared to lord of the rings. Overall 10 out of 10!"
1,"The BEST Fire Emblem! I don't know why this does not have 5 stars as the overal rating! Path of Radiance is fantastic!!!1: The charecters names are atleast sane unlike many of the other charecters in Fire Emblems.2: The charecters are also different from eachother and interesting!3: The storyline has much more to it than the others as well! I never get board or try hard to get to the fighting sequences like I did in Sacred Stones.If you have any interest in games, get this one it will definately be among your top 5!"
1,"Pros and Cons This may be one of my favorite games ever. Here are its pros and cons.Pros:1. It has a good plot.2. There is also a strong main character that you don't have to worry about dying.3. You need to use at least some strategy to win.4. Pick who you want to fight in each battle from out of a possible 43 characters.5. Good art and cut scenes.6. A lot of hours of gameplay.7. Good replay value. If you're bored you can make a new game and try using different people and strategies.Cons:1. Can be confusing at first.2. A little to much talking between the battles. Sometimes, when I would be in a hurry, I would have to skip the plot in order to save the game.Can go either way:When a character dies in battle you can't get him back. Instead you have to restart the level. However it also adds more strategy to the battles.9/10I beleive this game is worth buying."
1,"what hard rock is all about Cut the crap! it's motorhead, it's rock n' roll, loud, dirty, agressive, but also a singalong album.By far, my favourite Motorhead album, actually the only one that still survives in my collection nowadays.many eternal hard rock classics that must be listened by every metal, hard rock, stoner fan of the XXI century.check out Overkill, stay clean, no class, i'll be your sister, metropolis."
1,"Awesome noise....Metallica deservers thanks for introducing me to this band... I decided to buy this album because my good friends Metallica told me they really liked this band. They covered four songs of theirs on their garage, inc. album, so I thought they couldn't be that bad. And Motorhead are awesome! This is wonderful noise, especially the title track (which feels like it can go on forever, which is OK by me), and Stay Clean, which has a great bass solo in it. Lemmy can't really sing, but that's OK, I still dig the crazy vibe this album has. It's also hard to believe this guy are only a trio, as they sound larger than that. Overkill is a perfect introduction to the genius (?) of Motorhead."
1,"One of the Better Mars Books More similar in its simplicity to a Princess of Mars than Gods/Warlord. John Carter's son engages in search for abducted Thuvia, while he remains the prime suspect in her abduction. Usual strange meetings and stranger neighborhoods, but this story is a little less frenentic than Gods/Warlord, and both Carthoris and Thuvia are solid characters."
1,"Blissfully arranged, elegant easy listening music..... Something of a Cult band insofar as their albums (although critically applauded) are usually stumbled across by word of mouth. The unashamedly `Easy Listening' tag associated with their music, probably deters people. But if you actually listen to the tracks, there's a preciousness to they very accessibly music, that although features lyrics of hushed sighs & several instrumental tracks feature throughout. You'd have to be a cynical listener not to smile when hearing the catchy guitar pop of ""Afternoon Speaker"", or indeed the acoustic lounge of ""The Leaf"".....not an album to impress your friends with. But for music that evokes positive expression & sunny afternoon on every turn, restrained, Bittersweet indie Pop has rarely been so well composed."
1,Tried it and then bought it. Simple to install and easy to use the software does not eat much memory and works without much intrusion in your daily life and fore that I give it 5 stars.Updates are done often or as often as you wish and take only a very short time to download...try that with other programs of this nature.I would buy again.
1,"Panasonic 1GB SD Memory Card (133x) This card was free with my new Panasonic Lumix TZ-3. It came pre-formatted, has plenty of capacity and is certainly fast enough for my needs. I don't shoot movies or multiple-frame sequences very often. All in all, I'm very pleased with it."
1,"Received the correct SD card Since there is this issue of people getting the wrong card, I just wanted to say Amazon did send the correct card.I have a Nikon Coolpix 5m camera. The card seems to work fast. I have only tried it for a few days."
1,This movie was GREAT if only for the end Overall the movie had what might be considered a plot but I do have to say the blonde in the movie was simply awesome. The ending blow my mind WOW if anything get the movie just to watch the ending over and over.....
1,"Flyboys [ Blu-Ray ] The disc was send in fast time,and made it in perfect shape.Info was great between Amazon and me,Thanks for a great job well done."
1,Movie fan Excellent documentary drama. If you enjoy history you will love this! Would have liked the happy ever after ending though.
1,"Excellent dogfight While the story drifts at times, it is still an entertaining movie with great dogfight scenes. Makes you wonder what early fighter pilots went through."
1,"Great Movie I went to see this in the theater with tempered expectations based on the ""average"" reviews the movie received from the critics. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a great movie about a subject and period that is largely ignored by Hollywood."
1,"Missionary Pal Reference Guide for Missionaries and Teachers I've wanted this book for a gift. It's in excelent shape except for a dedication in side front cover, It alteady arrived today, which made me happier. This is ""Missionary Pal for Missionaries and Teachers"". 1/11/13."
1,"book purchase Book was recieved fast and in great shape, I needed this fast so I could send it to my son in China that is serving a mission and it came in time to send it with his Christmas package. thank you for your service"
1,"New favorites! These socks are my husband's new favorites. And he has tried LOTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS of socks. He used to wear the Gold Toe Windsor Wool OTC for many years, which were beautifully made and stayed up and came in 4 colors. Gold Toe changed them more and more so they became so tight that they'd leave marks/indentations on his legs. My husband bought numerous different Gold Toe styles and finally loves these. They only come in black and navy, so he is wearing only the black for now and uses old brown, navy, or gray ones when he needs those colors.These are very soft and stretchy but durable feeling. They stay up and do not make your feet sweat like many fabrics do. For the time being this is the new favorite at our house. (Gold Toe, PLEASE make more colors!!!) Two thumbs and 10 toes up!"
1,"an excellent tune Here they are again! German deejay and producer Yanou and the Dutch goddess Do(minique). If you liked Heaven, you will love this song even more! Radio edit is a nice trance tune. Extended version is even more powerfull. Piano version is a nice ballad. Even your mom will like it! Dj's@work remix is the best version, and the Flashrider remix is the least commercial version of this tune. My favorite remix is Flashrider meets Yanou remix. Buy it! (Unfortunately, there is no enhanced video. It is an interesing story about the dancer (Do) and her admirer (Yanou).)Yanou and Do, please be here for us!ON & ON!"
1,"Exceptionally helpful to someone in their first year I found this book to be very comprehensive: addressing what MS is, what causes MS, symptoms of MS, diagnosis, symptom management, treatment options, and social aspects. It includes the technical description, but through the use of analogies, makes each description very tangible for the layperson. I found the section on medications (and their evolution) particularly helpful. This book reinforced much of what I've learned through doctors, websites, and support organizations and filled in the gaps where information was lacking. It's an excellent resource for someone who has been newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis."
1,"Not really a review, sorry I do not own this book, and am not reviewing it. But there is a quote from the essay ""On Living In An Atomic Age"" that is going around once again, following the London bombings of July 2005. I am putting it here on Amazon so interested parties Googling to find the source of the quote might have an easier time of it:""If we are . . . going to be destroyed by [a] bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things--praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts--not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.""--C.S. Lewis"
1,Maturity in his writing After reading his earlyworks you can see how Chandler used his previous stories and ideas to develop these incredible novels featuring his most famous detective Philip Marlowe.
1,"New and Brilliant This film is exactly as it says on the box, ""A historic lock, stock and two smoking barrels""! I sat down to watch this film with an open mind as to wether I'd like it or not as it is different to anything i've ever watched before but as soon as the movie started I was mesmerised by the excellent acting, complex,yet easy to follow storyline and excellent soundtrack! Carlyle and Miller both never fail to (Stand and)deliverand Liv tyler as support is also excellent. If you like LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS you're bound to like this!"
1,"The finest! Novak is another of my all time favorites. I have all of his recorded orchestral music, which is my passion. I thought, this one won't hold up to my favorites, In the Tatras and the Eternal Longing. Wrong. They do hold up, they are as beautiful as all of his other compositions. Creative, inventive, runs the full gamut of emotions from tiny delicate passages, to the full beautiful storm. Don't miss this composer!"
1,"Brownie ""Brownie"" was a true genius. Although he died in 1950 at age 25, he was one of the fathers of hard bop. He could play the fastest bebop tune with ease, he was also adept at the ballad, i.e., ""You Go to My Head."" He was also an accomplished composer, i.e. Daahoud"" & Sandu.Brownie was taken from us muchy too early. No, he was not into the Parker influenced drug scene; he died in an auto accident.I guess my favorite tune he wrote was ""Joy7 Spring"" & he plays it on this album.If you're into jazz at all, get some of his albums. The ever present Max Roach was always with him, & on this one Sonny Rollins has a lot to say. The interplay between them is fascinating."
1,"Beautiful Photos, Great Info I am a beginner backyard bird watcher and I really enjoyed this book. It has some great pictures to help you identify birds, or even just to look at. The book doesn't stop there, however, it gives you nice detailed information of bird behavior, sounds, nests and habitat. I recommend this book to beginner or intermediate bird watchers."
1,Old Time Favorite This purchase was made as a replacement for a copy that was ruined when it got wet. Exactly what I wanted.
1,"Outstanding trilogy The notion of three different books by three different authors about the same story, each from a different character's perspective is new to me. I'd enjoyed the Diary series, and thought it was worth picking up the three books just to see how well the concept worked.I actually thought the books by the other two authors were better than this, but only by a small margin. They are all excellent, and reading the same story three different times never got boring because they are all so different, while remaining consistent.In many ways it's so true of life - we really don't know what's going on in other people's heads, especially when it comes to subterfuge and illicit behavior.Three different authors, three different characters, three different styles, one terrific story."
1,"Perfect Love this, amazingly sexy. bought it in white for our wedding night so my future husband has something to rip through ;)"
1,Fantastic I use this product to pickup chopped vegetables from my chopping board. I saw it used on a food show and I thought I would try it. I love it.
1,"The Best Any fan who appreciates the Everly Brothers has to havethis album. The remastered sound is superb of course, butthe deciding factor on this one should be the inclusionof their last hit, after more than 20 years had passed sincetheir previous one.After the team reunited, one of their biggest fans wrotea song especially for them. Paul McCartney wrote ""Wings ofa Nightingale"" for them, and it is a truly beautiful songthat displays their harmony at its best, and the song isnot usually found on other collections.Get the best of all their classic early hits, plus thislast hit.A must have for any fan."
1,Excellent addition to Holocaust Literature Well written with a sense of humor about a very tragic period of time. I liked his style of writing with a story told from a different point of view.
1,"Ballet anyone? Franz von Suppe (German form of Francesco Ezechiele Ermenegildo Cavaliere Suppe-Demelli, which I like better) is known for his ballet music, but the CD series 1-6 contains even more wonderful music. All his music is very conducive to movement, whether ballet or other calisthenics (beauty and strength). Enjoyable when sitting still, too! He is a relative of Donizetti, so he had great musical examples to help him along (probably good genetics, too)."
1,Grat book! A must have for those wanting to know about the growth of civil aviation in the 1920's and beyond.
1,"This is REAL hockey!!! I have been playing hockey games on the PC and on consoles since NHL95. Until now I have not found a console game I could tolerate. I have now found it! NHL 2k3 is the closest to real hockey I have ever played. What makes a game good is flexibility. The sliders in this game make it fun for anyone. The designers have given us the ability to modify the AI even after starting a season, franchise, or even in the middle of a game. You can tweek this baby until you find the right skill level for you. The controls are more like that of the PC. I can chose the setup that lets me use the right trigger for speed burst, to me that's the only way it can be done comfortably. There are just too many good things to mention about this game so I will just finish by saying...EA Sports has just fallen way behind. This game sets the standard for video hockey games."
1,"A Must Have I recently purchased NHL2K3 and I must say I am impressed. Being a loyal follower of the EA NHL franchise I was a slightly apprehensive. But after two games were under my belt I quickly came to the conclusion that this is the best console hockey game to date. The game play is far more realistic than the EA version. That combined with the fact that the game is supported by X-BOX live make this game a must have for any sports console game enthusiast. The live interface does leave a little to be desired when choosing opponents, but the online game play is smooth. Go out and get this game you won't be disappointed."
1,"Very imaginative and mysterious Did you ever wonder what may have happened to Tiny Tim, the Cratchett family, or old Mr. Scrooge? Bayard answers that question in a very imaginative and mysterious way. Part historical fiction, part mystery, and part psychological thriller, this book is a wonderful read."
1,"My favorite album, period This album is just so great that it's a crime that so few people know about it. Sometimes just gorgeous and sometimes really crunching cathartic stuff, all combined with the kind of odd murky and haunting sonic atmosphere that you expect from 3MP. This was album was clearly a slapped-together job, comprising of new material plus B sides and outtakes etc over a period of years. And yet the material outdistances anything else they've done. The bass work in particular is phenomenal -- he plays it like a lead guitar. Also, if you're a fan of Pinback then you really should own this. One caveat: I almost never listen to CD2 -- except for the song ""The Trail"", which is great -- and the very first song on CD 1 is really the worst on the album. So don't let that put you off, because the rest of that first CD... wow. Wow! If my desert island disc was limited to one choice, it might be this one. (Well, okay, a Beatles disc might win instead, but only just.) Really, it's that good."
1,Best CD for the bathroom I LOVE this CD! I listen to it whenever I'm on the can. It helps me do my thing.
1,RICKY MARTIN LIVE! REVIEW IT WAS EXCELLENT. VERY HOT! HOT! HOT! IT BROUGHT BACK MANY MEMORIES OF THE CONCERT I SAW IN NOVEMBER '99.

1,"compelling, riveting and inspiring In 1980, I successfully climbed Mt. Rainier, reaching the ""true"" summit. It took several attempts because of weather. It was hard work. But after reading Lene's book, I came to realize how strenuous and physically challenging it is to climb Everest. I was not aware of all the work and risks that are taken just to prepare for the final assault. Lene proved herself, showing incredible strength, fortitude and emotion. There must have been such a terrible sense of despair and fear knowing that death was probably inevitable and no help available.Lene gives the reader another perspective of this awesome event, using her professional knowledge as a clinician and writer. I would recommend everyone who has followed this climbing event, either from past magazine articles and stories, or from the several books written about this Everest climb, to read this book."
1,"Great Video!!! I have a 22 month old son who LOVES this DVD. He is really into trucks, fire engines, and ambulances. Basically, any vehicle that makes noises. He begs for me to put this in every day. He was not afraid at all in the beginning when Elmo shakes. They do show Elmo very afraid, but the adults in the DVD really do everything to make him feel better and let him explain his feelings. There are catchy songs and good fire safety information. You should preview this DVD and judge for yourself if your child is to sensitive for the part where Elmo shakes in the beginning. If you feel that part is to scary for your child then skip to the next chapter of the DVD. It's a small part of the DVD and the rest of the DVD has so much educational material. I highly recommend this DVD."
1,"Elmo When my granddaughter was small, she loved this video and squealed with delight when the fire truck drove out of the Fire House. Alas, she grew up. My grandson is now 2, and I may have bought this prematurely for him. He loves Elmo, so I know he will eventually get into this video. Video also includes some good information as to how to act if there is a fire in your home. Very instructive for small children."
1,"A Master Teacher! Avery Dulles takes the untrained reader on a journey through the complex thought processes of a religious scholar, in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step manner.He sets up criteria and begins building five philosophies or models of revelation theology that are most commonly embraced by Christians today. These models serve as a great eye-opening tool in the final compare-and-contrast stage of his analysis.Perhaps more fascinating, Dulles expands his search to include specific historical periods, so that the reader gets a better understanding of how theological thought evolves and changes, as one generation of Christian believers builds on the knowledge or misconceptions of the past, and how meaningful dialogue with historians, scientists and other religious groups have enhanced our traditions and affirmed our convictions.This book represents a rare opportunity for one of the laity to peer into the mind of a great theologian. One can not help but be impressed."
1,"Trigger steals the show Quentin Tarantino lauded William Witney's directing of this movie and Roy's performance in a New York Times interview this year (2000). Trigger is blamed for a killing done by a wild horse, and Roy confesses to the crime to save him and serves three years for manslaughter. Witney once again handles animal scenes with finesse as the wild mare dies after giving birth to Trigger Jr. A beautiful story, in color showing off both golden palominos, in which Roy temporarily loses Trigger to a band of diamond smugglers and recovers him in a typical Witney action climax."
1,"Simply the Best Show! I got introduced to CSI this year and have been addicted ever since. It is a great show. Great characters and great cases that all you need to have a great show. The mysteries are so well put together and thought out. Buy this box set and in the future, you will be buying others."
1,"exactly as advertised The DVD arrived quickly and exactly as advertised. Plus, the pricing was better than retail. Thanks!"
1,"Amazing.... she is an Excelent and great violin player, her music is unique, if you love instrumental music, you can't miss it."
1,"Excellent, sophisticated. I read this book several years ago. One of the better, more cerebral espionage books I've ever read. Been trying to find his other spy book (i.e., ""Zolta""), but its out of print. Too bad the author does not appear to be writing this type of fiction anymore--while his nature stuff is good, I'd love to see him fill the void left by Adam Hall."
1,"Wonderful Upgrade I have purchased this knife as an upgrade from a Farberware Pro Chef's Knife. Kershaw is a lot thinner, lighter, and infinitely sharper (buy some Band Aids). It has enough curve for a rocking low motion and long enough for high cutting technique. I love it.P.S. Still love it after half a year, recommend dulling the blade corner near the pummel, it will reduce number of little cuts with out sacrificing usability."
1,"Bonus Tracks Not Much A Bonus The additional songs aren't that great, so if you already have the original album, it's not much worth buying this CD solely for the bonus tracks. The original album is one of the better Cranberries albums, but all Cranberries CDs are great, and that includes this one, a must have to complete your Cranberries collection."
1,"Buy or steal....no matter what method, Get these tapes. You cannot go wrong with Mr. Stuart Wilde's teachings. Each book he writes or tapes/CD he produces is a jewel. He's a great teacher and these tapes will really help the one who seeks knowledge in living courageously with awareness."
1,"Great Album I down loaded this for my Mother for Christmas. She loves the harmony of the songs. I burned a CD for her to play in the car while they travel. We all love it, I plan to make a CD for myself so I can listen to it in the car. Another Christmas Album that is wonderful is The Singers Unlimited Christmas. They are a Jazz group, but their harmony is even closer than that of the Mills Brothers. They are both very good albums."
1,"My Favorite Book Enter a world where there is no past. Where the past is the present. Follow Winston as he thinks THOUGHT- CRIME, works on fake documents, and plots to shut down the system. Big Brother's eyes follow Winston Everywhere he goes. If you want to see wether Winston accomplishes his mission, you must read the book. After you read this book go check out the 1984 Movie. But don't see the Movie unless you've read the book or else you will have no idea what is going on in the movie."
1,Great read!!! This should me a must read for everyone. It will make you think twice about things that go on in our government and those around the world.
1,"Just what I expected It was a good book. It was not my favorite book ever, but I feel more cultured because I read it."
1,"Science fiction? To call 1984 a work of science fiction is, while technically accurate, somewhat a disservice to the book. 1984 is a chillingly accurate glimpse into a future of hellish totalitarianism, and quite amazingly, with each passing generation it actually seems to become more and more relevant. It should be regarded not only as great literature, but also as an oracle of the very real storm clouds that are consistently looming just overhead. But perhaps most importantly, it should also serve as a much needed kick in the groin to anyone who is constantly blinded by the bright lights of patriotism, war, greed, fear, and all forms of propaganda.1984 is not science fiction. 1984 isn't fiction at all."
1,"can predictions really come true? read and make up your own George Orwell has another hit. Animal Farm was only a glimpse at his intellectual genius. This story takes you on a carefully regulated emotional rollercoster. You will go from intense shock to indignation for the characters involved. This small glimpse into what Orwell considered to be our inevitable future has left me with a strong sense of denial. Everything from the telescreen that watches your every move to the mere thought of a ""thought Police"" force gave me the shivers. There are several interesting implications for example the use of a term called ""doublethink"" which implies that people can hold two contradictory thoughts in their heads at the same time and beleive them both to be true. overall this book was an amazing peice of work, there was never a time that i put it down unless i had to. i would definitely recommend this to any person who wants to take their mind for a ride."
1,"Time to think George Orwell is a master of the English language, his superb style of writing and the intensity of the story is sustained throughout.The novel covers a timeless issue. Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius."
1,"An amazing and thought provoking novel George Orwell had my attention from the first to last page of his novel 1984. 1984 is a fascinating and mind-inducing novel. The story of Winston Smith's struggle through life in Oceania is extremely captivating and thought provoking. Orwell's sharp, detailed descriptions paint an image of an unforgettably unique society. His story is a detailed description of a man living in the worst case scenario communistic society. Orwell's ideas and images are extremely brilliant. His extreme communist society brainwashes their citizens to become emotionless, violent, and thoughtless. I was mesmerized by the way the society dehumanized its citizens. People had no freedom what so ever. The concept of people having the inability to think, loves, and express themselves is engaging. I found 1984 to be an extremely thrilling novel, I recommend it to anyone interested in a classic and contemplative piece of literature."
1,"Definitely a must read 1984 is the biggest achievement of Eric Blair as a novelist and anybody even slightly interested in politics, history or the future should give it a read. I think 1984 is one of the few books which you can't skip reading and just watch the movie. Very detailed, very thorough, very challenging - the book is more than 50 years old, and yet very very current. I've read it more than 5 times now, but the paperback copy from amazon is definitely the nicest edition I've had - printed on something that looks like recycled paper, roughly cut and printed in weird, but nice font - I recommend buying it."
1,Perfect This is such a great book! I ordered it on cassette so that I could listen to it on a long road trip and the product arrived right on time in great condition.
1,"oh yes. this is a good one. this was the first novel ever that i have finished (i tend to read the first few pages and quickly move over to the end). yes. like a winter in london under heavy smog, this novel has a gloomy, cold, and a bit cynical perspective. but there's something pulling you in. it's the secret love between winston and julia. so beautiful. soon to be crushed like a flower under some fat tires, though..."
1,Early Perspective - take warning 1984-A good example of what government can and may do. Good warnings of what may happen when government is given too much power and how it may completely take over without being noticed. Depressing but gives good insight. READ IT!!
1,"The best book you should read, but don't in High School Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come."
1,"Deserves SIX stars! I wish there was a way Amazon would let you rate ONE book with six stars, your all-time favorite. If they did that, 1984 would be my pick. I've read it at least four times, once when I had insomnia I read the whole thing front to back again. The first time I read it was in high school, and I was disappointed because it didn't have a happy ending, because Smith didn't manage to somehow smash Big Brother. But now I recognize the book for what it is: a timeless statement on totalitarianism and individualism. Don't let the title fool you: if we're not very, very careful it can happen yet."
1,"A Brilliant Warning About Totalitarianism George Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty Four"" is a brilliant warning about totalitarianism. It is certainly about communism. You can tell from their physical descriptions that Big Brother is Stalin and Goldstein is Trotsky. At a time when many people admired the Soviet Union, George Orwell saw the Soviet system for what it was- a brutal dictatorship based on fear. However, it is not just about communism. It is a warning against all totalitarian systems of thought that seek to impose forcibly a particular ideology on people and to mould people at will. Winston Smith's struggle to hold on to objective truth in a world of lies and human decency in a world of cruelty symbolises the real life struggle to do just that of so many people in this century that has brought us the horrors of the Gulags and Auschwitz."
1,This Book gives you Insight of Human Mind This book tells us about how one person's Total thinking can be altered by means of a simple tool called Torture.
1,Very realistic! In my opinion this is Orwell's best novel and is also my favorite book. It can happen to us as long as their are power hungry human beings in this world.
1,"Engrossing, horrific read Wow is the first phrase that came to my mind after finishing this book. It is one of the best I have ever read and certainly my favorite read over the last year. I am sure everyone knows the plot by now so I will not rehash. But I knew the general plot beforehand i.e. ""Big Brother"" and the thought police, and I was STILL overwhelmed by 1984. Orwell's writing makes you keep coming back for more, always eager to find out how the current situation will turn out, and what will happen next. Besides the sketch of a tyrannical government using mass propaganda to literally brainwash its citizens, Orwell also shows how powerless the ordinary citizen becomes, how much trouble must be gone through to engage in illegal conduct, and how brutal the aftermath of getting caught is. And the love story, which I expected to be the weakest part of the book, is actually fascinating and heartbreaking. A Must-Read if there ever was one!"
1,More than just entertaining... There are many works where the story is the content. These books are usually for entertainment. This book uses the story to deliver its content. It uses the story to illustrate some awsome philosophical ideas. By presenting the ideas in a story they are easier to understand and they are more entertaining.I could not put the book down as I got towards the end. This is the only book I have ever read that has given me the shakes.
1,"a must read one of the best books i've ever read. makes you think about what is true and what isn't. though written in the 50's i believe, the concept can be applied to the present and the future."
1,"Amazing! This book was amazing! I've never read anything like it, not even other Orwell. After this I read every book and paper he'd ever published. An ominous vision of his future and our present."
1,"the 2nd best book ever this book was unstoppable!i couldnt put it down.i suddenly felt like i was being watched from everywhere just like the folks in the book.ive read it twice.the 1st time i was on winstons side but i learned to love big brother by the time i was done the 2nd time.big brother is watching!writer george orwell gets a lot of props for ""animal farm"" but this ones way better!"
1,"Outstanding. This book is the most amazing, influential, disturbing, wonderful, and sickening, nightmarish, fantastic book I have ever read in my life.Don't read this review. Read the book. now, by whatever means."
1,"Chilling Book!!!! It is hard to belive that a totalitarian government can happen, People say it can't, but in truth it has. George Orwell's book has almost in a cense read the future. Take what happened in Stazi Germany, it is identical. And i belive that anyone who can guess at the future like that and be so right is deserving of some complement. And for the people out there who think that the readers of this book are all paranoied they are wrong. Read this book and then take a look around, how close are we really?"
1,"George Orwell : Modern Day Prophet It takes a lifetime to read this book. It's packed with symbolism and meaning. Few people will be able to absorb it all in one reading. Probably one of the Top Ten greatest literary works of all time. An excellent example of clear, concise, efficient use of the English language. Not one word out of place, not one word more or less than is needed. No 'Newspeak' in this book. It should be required reading for everyone who wants to live in a free society."
1,"This book scared the living daylights out of me Orwell crafts one of the most absolutle horrors of a future world in this celebrated novel.Written in the late 40's, Orwell crafts the tale of a bureaucrat in the future whose job along with countless other mindless peons, is (in essence) to erase history.Bombarded by slogans that hammer the totalitarian nature of the state, he finds some comfort in a woman who shares his ambition to break free from the controls of ""Big Brother"".Parables abound in this book, to a world and people seemingly oblivious to what is going on around them. Orwell has managed to create one of the most frigthening environments put to paper and weave a future world bleaker, but more importantly, theoreticaly possible in any day or age. So ingenious in usage of slogans, and terms made up by the author, that they are culturaly refered to still in this day and age.An astounding piece of fiction."
1,"Harrowing, thought-provoking, powerful I just finished 1984 about a week ago and loved it. Orwell showed his maturity as a writer and his evolution from Animal Farm (also great). 1984 shows the force of totalitarian governments and the faults of human nature. This should be read by any progressive-minded persons in the world."
1,"A Dictionary for 2003 Doublethink and Newspeak need no explanation to people growing up with a Patriot Act that takes away liberties. We don't need the brilliant economic explanation that Orwell provides for the state of perpetual war with constantly changing enemies...But it's amazing how ""1984"" keeps popping up on enigmatic posters at recent antiwar rallies with references to doubleplusgood wars and war equalling peace and freedom equalling slavery. On February 15 in New York, I saw a young man holding a poster with the ultimate reference to this great cautionary novel: ""1 + 1 = 2"". If you don't know what that's referring to, please read this book today."
1,"Horrifyingly prophetic Orwell was dead-on in his vision of a possible future for the Western world. Indeed, according to recent events, Big Brother is HERE and voting Republican."
1,"Amazing I read this book to kill some time at work, and I have to say that the time I ""killed"" was some of the best time I ever spent with any work of fiction. I would re-read this book in a heartbeat. This novel is one of the most worthy of five stars ever published.To all students: If this is a book you were assigned in a class, definately give this one a chance. You'll come out of the assignment with a new favorite novel, and thoughts and ideas that will challange and haunt you for weeks, if not years to come."
1,"If you read just 2 books, read the Bible, and this! This book is extremely powerful. That isn't a secret. The power of this book is that this is now happening in the freeworld as it had been happening in radical dictatorships. First it was western europe in the 70's and 80's. Then it began in the US in the 90's during the Clinton's reign and the rise of the NSA and ATF. Now it is spreading because of Terrorism. The bottom line is that many in the governments in these free countries mean well but don't comprehend what is coming. The current Bush administration is just answering the call because of the power that technology has given our governments and global terrorist. We must either accept that we are always at risk or give up some of our freedoms. We just have to hope that when this risk dissapates, if ever, we can get them back. Lucky for us FDR died before he became king... If you think this is about facism you are thinking too liberal-1984 can occur in a pure democracy."
1,"If you only read one more book, read 1984 If you only read one more book, read George Orwell's ""1984.""Other reviewers including the ... reviewer, has captured the essence of this incredible, disturbing, poignant, an accurate view into the mind of the totalitarians - and yes, folks, they live among us even today.I'll only add this: the ""book-within-a-book"" by Orwell's fictional author, Emmanual Goldstein, should be required study by every single high school and college student in the world. Don't know what I'm talking about? Read ""1984"" and look for Emmanual Goldstein within this book's pages. Then ask yourself the questions you dared not ask yourself before.Then go read ""Brave New World"" and ""The Probability Broach."" The first is a different, altogether more pleasant version of Hell. The second holds out the real promise of freedom-loving people (""Broach""). Then tell others what you have learned."
1,"I read this in 1994 -- after visiting Russia I read this book in 1994, just after a trip to Byelorussia, Russia and Poland. Life under the Soviet regime must have been a nightmare. This book helped me appreciate what it must have been like."
1,"the end is near!!! a ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!! Just as high lord Orwell predicted, the world is at an apocalyptic state. Constant war, no privacy, thought police, the world is truly at its end. Though this lowly species has somehow managed to survive 15 years longer than lord Orwell predicted, surely this feeble race will extinguish itself because of its own greed and blind hatred. The contempt of the aristocrats has finally backfired as all knew it would. Creating ignorance and superficiality amongst the masses has finally gone too far, and there are no functional human beings left to survive. The contempt for nature and human ideals has led us to the brink of destruction, by our own hand."
1,"A classic that should be read by all An excellent and horrifying view of a possible future for our world. Written in 1949, ""1984"" takes place in a future ruled by a rutheless and violent governemnt that watches all its citezins. The story's main character is Winston Smith, who's life is changed after buying an old journal and simply writing the words, ""DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER"" From there, paranoia turns into realised fear as everything Winston does makes him a target for the governments thought police, who are everywhere. Orwell does not hold back in his warning to the citezins of a free world of what may happen if one day we stopped watching ourselves and those who govern us. Don't take advantage of your feedom."
1,IT LEFT ME IN A SLEEPLESS DAZE this is one of the greates books i have ever read it goes along with orwells great reputation of pplitical novles it left me wondering on how the human race is so week and breakable once you pass the first page you will not put it down till you finsh it
1,Great Symbolic and Incredibly Smart Book Stephen Bradley: I first read this book and now Im 15 and I still haven't read another book. Every time I read it again I find another piece of clever symbolism. I would recommend this book to anyone! I am incredibly awed by the clever uses of English and symbolic meanings. For example I have been told that Gin was thought to be the downfall of the British Working Class. It would be a shallow understanding of the book to claim it as an anti-socalist book as Orwell (Eric Blair) obviously cared about the working class and was only against pretentous totalatarian states. I invite any like minded people to discuss the book with me. I apolagise for carless grammar and spelling (Im only 15 :) )
1,"Life Altering Here is the book that first got me thinking about politics and philosophy.This is Orwell's dystopia of how he feared the world would become run by a group of cahooting despots by 1984.The main character, Winston Smith, lives in London in a dictatoeship run by ""big brother"". In this state there is no love but love for big brother. There is no excitment but patriotism. Chocolate is rationed and orgasms are banned. In this world smith somehow manages to fall in love.. and that's just the start of his problems.1984 warns us to be wary of those who might take our freedom whilst trying to convince us we are actually gaining extra liberty. Buy it."
1,"Much better than ""Brave New World"" Although Brave New World has been written before Orwell's masterpiece - which is the great merit of Aldous Huxley - and these books show different views of the future, I consider 1984 much more mature than the other. When I started to read it, I couldn't stop. It's intelligent, interesting and VERY well written. Besides, it deals with many, many issues, not only totalitarism, as people use to say. It deals also with loneliness, mass media and the power of verbal language. I really like Orwell's description of a profesional ""building"" a new language, a language so limited that would control human's thought. George Orwell was very inspired when he wrote this book. Congratulations to this sensitive writer."
1,"Best book I have ever read To this day, no other novel has changed the way I look at society as George Orwell has done with ""1984."" I highly recommend this book."
1,"Classic Message in a Modern World Winston lives in a world of constant survelence and secret police. Truth is what the government says, not what actually happened. According to the ""facts"" produced by the government, the country is getting better, but according to memory, the country is getting worse. Society has been brainwashed by fear of its own government and also by incited anger at its enemy country.1984 yields the (very) far extreme of a society that many fear some current societies are headed. Although fiction, it is fascinating to look at certain similar aspects to current societies (again, nowhere near as extreme as the book's society), and is a good book in terms of where we should keep our society from heading. Truly a great read in terms of perspective.The only downside that I took from the book was that I was so bothered by what Winston endured and especially the last 50 pages of the book. Never a regret reading it, but definitely not a ""happy book."" I like my eyes wide open."
1,"1984 - A Book About the Future What can you say about this book that hasn't already been said? It's dark. It's real dark. It's real, real dark. Get your flashlight. The future is not a nice place and this is no fairytale. It is, however, a classic and a must read."
1,"Masterpiece of Satire I believe there are some people--many of whom are artists-- who arrive on this earth to warn us of the future. George Orwell--a Humanistic Socialist--is one of those people. I write in the present tense because although Mr. Orwell has left us, his masterpiece works such as 1984 and Animal Farm, remain, and probably will--as all great artistic works--for a very long time.The warning that 1984 represents is that of impending dystopia--evil in its abject, Senseless, Self-Serving brutality--that threatens to take hold of our human society whenever people become complacent. The question is will we heed the warnings and begin taking responsibility for creating heaven on earth-- or will we wallow in this dangerous complacency and thereby enable the bullies to take over for the sheer love of power?"
1,Covers Redness Bought this to disguise redness occurring with rosacea. It does a good job when used over a moisturizer and primer covering the redness but not cracking. Recommend using it with a primer and moisturizer.
1,coverblend concealer Product covers my black allery eye circles perfectly without drying the eye area; it stays until you wash it away.
1,"brilliant i suffer from severe skin discoloration and i cant tell you how good this product is at hiding most if not all of it. For those people who have issues relating to skin, pls try this as it is by far one of the best concealers i have come across....."
1,"Don't you get it? What a brilliant movie about incest and how it leads to the devastation of a woman. A woman who can't feel anything, who is trying desperately in every way to feel...something. And when someone presents himself to draw her out of her withered self, all she can do is re-enact her adoloscent despair. Come on, folks -- her mother tells her she's filthy, she berates her for giving in to a man -- this is Psychology 101, but brilliantly acted and compelling. Of course, she wants her student to be damaged, because she is both jealous and trying to protect her student from her overbearing parents. I doubt that I'm going to sleep well tonight."
1,"now this is a great psychological portrait Bound to become a classic of world cinema, 'the piano teacher', is Michael Haneke's most perfect film.. It tells the story of a women so repressed and abused by her mother that she explodes with sexual tension..it comes out in her music.. and in a sort of chaotic relationship with one of her students.. at times incestuous and at times perverse this is a truly disturbed women who is as rigid as her own philosophy of music- this is a must see - a modern classic from a powerful new cinematic voice.."
1,"more people should see this dvd! if your unaware ,buy it. amazing insight Excellent dvd! gives insight to a scociety that created a major movement of last century. many of these techniques have carried on through other inovators, but we will surely cherish this dvd and use it as a resource.[...]"
1,"Like silky, velvet dreams The moment I put this cd on and heard the light, lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sun-kissed Gregorian chants, followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat, I knew this was going to be one journey I'd be willing to take for many years to come...and that was the impression I got from the first track alone! Imagine what ensued... It only gets better from there!Every song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood, and while I find this exotically soothing debut album by Black Ether (an astonishingly overlooked group) extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles, I'd have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnic-world flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea."
1,"Put it out on DVD,PLEASE See my review of this movie on vhs.Some day before I'm dead,maybe this will come out on dvd.If you want this movie out on dvdthen click yes."
1,"""A Majority of one"" I have been a big fan of the movie ""A Majority of One"" for many years. I have a ""tape"" of the movie, but was thrilled when the movie came out on DVD. Rosalind Russell is superb. The interaction between Rosalind and Alec Guiness is extremely pleasurable to watch from the time they met on the ship to their relationship in Japan. The scenes with Rosalind dressed in the Japanese Kimono were priceless. The ending was extremely enjoyable leaving the audience to draw its own conclusion on where their relationship would go."

1,"May I borrow your Penquin? Not only is this 5 stars, it should get a rosette in the Peguin catalogue.It's simply the best since the 1970's superb Emi recordings. Thanks Emi for putting all this material on one disc. Mr Cleobury's has directed this music in a somewhat faster pace than the 70's versions, thus rendering these works absolutely fun to listen to, especially the ""Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem"". It's just astonishing. I've followed Purcell recordings since Yehudi Menuhin, Schwartzkof...Baker...Britten...Deller Consort...James Bowman...Elloit Gardiner...Will Christie..I am quiet intimate with Purcell. And, this one stands right up there with the best of them. Intense, passionate and very singable. This one could revive the Purcell Society or maybe, even start one in the states."
1,"DA WEST IS COMING BACK IN MY OPINION THA DOGG POUND IS MAKING A GREAT MOVEMENT....ITS BEEN A WHILE SINCE THE WEST COAST HAS BEEN PUTTIN THIS MANY ALBUMS OUT. WE HAVE ""THE GAME"" , ""ICE CUBE"" AND MANY MORE STILL TO COME....IN MY OPINION THA DOGG POUND IS DOING GREAT THINGS....SO IM SAYIN IF YOU GONNA GET THIS ALBUM PREPARE TO BE AMAZED"
1,"Excellent! Movie was okay, I liked it. Never realized there was a book for it. I was buying more Anne Rice's books and saw Exit to Eden, I picked it up knowing if Anne Rice wrote it, it would be good. But... it was even better! A MUST READ! It was completely different than the movie! But totally BETTER! I recommend this book with no problem. You must be open-minded. I like the fact it went from The Club to real-life. I have read most reviews. I agree with people saying its the best. For those who say it ""trash,"" you may need to open your eyes and see the true world out there. It's not the 50's anymore. You have your opinions, but I have mine and this is an EXCELLENT BOOK TO READ. I have read the Witching Hour and the books to follow for the series. Anne Rice continues to amaze me with her works, specially considering this is a earlier written book! Amazing. Read it!"
1,"Completely changed my life A friend recommended this book to me. Once I started, I couldn't put it down - it captured so many ideas I'd already been thinking. I then gave it to my wife, who, to my surprise, also loved. Needless to say, it has completely changed our lives for the better."
1,"Wonderfully Erotic I was not able to put this book down. If you have ever been interested in s/m, you must read this. Anne takes you to the point of being sexually submissive like no one ever will!"
1,"WOW! I can't believe I read this book in one sitting. This is the first novel by Anne Rice I've ever read. Her words are so descriptive, I found myself just painting the images in my mind. Even my body shivered as I read some of the encounters between Elliott and Lisa. It's a good story. I don't really get the S&M stuff, but still a good book. Most memorable section...the butter and cinnamon in New Orleans."
1,"The hell with princesses; I'm saving the world! I think this is enough to tell you that the game is great. This game resembles Mario64 and Banjo-Kazooie, but has the better graphics and more mature gameplay that you would expect from XBOX. The graphics are amazing, and the controls are easy to use. The characters in this game are amazing, each with their own unique traits. There are several levels in which the game takes you to places far and wide. From a Snowy Winter Wonderlad to a Firery Desert, you get the feeling of visiting places all around the world just by a move of the joystick. With a resemblance to the old and happy Mario64 and Banjo-Kazooie, this is a must buy game."
1,"Nice quality necklace I get a lot of compliments on this necklace when I wear it. The chain is heavy enough to be sturdy, but not too bulky. The amethysts are very deep in color and have good clarity. Recommended."
1,Fabulous book! I read this book many years ago and wanted to read it again.My order was handled quickly and professionally.Great service. Great book.
1,"The near future is here! Come on - a classic. Montag is iconic and impervious to criticism; c'mon, he hates burning books and he's a 'fireman.' Bradbury has created one his best stories in this tale of the near future, which tragically, is beginning to mirror our own. How many young people to I hear say 'I don't like to read, not my thing.' Are we so far away from Fahrenheit 451? Five stars."
1,"Hauntingly realistic! I'm a sophomore in high school, and I just finished reading F451. I may be slightly bias, since I love to read, particularly Sci-fi (Star Trek rules!), but this book was really good. I know many read this book in their junior high years, but I think it's better if it's read a little later, when it can be ""digested"" more thoroughly by a more mature audience. So many people, regardless of high school levels, hate to read, and I sincerely believe that is one of the most dangerous things in today's society. Schools do not stress music, art, and literature nearly as much as they should. We learn to THINK--we gain WISDOM from what we READ, not from playing sports and playing games on computers. Even many colleges give out more sports scholarships than academic scholarships. Western Civilization had better watch out, or Ray Bradbury's sci-fi book will become REALITY..."
1,"Ironic & Captivating This book was short, and deep. It was amazingly deep in fact, for the length. Bradbury captures something about our nature both to believe in something passionately, and to ignorantly become sheepish. There is lying, betrayal, and small glimmers of home, in a macabre future. One of my favorites by far."
1,"Best Book This book just sweeps into the world of so called happiness.I think the book is warning us about the dangers of technology.I love the way he portrays life in the future and how liberal and lazy the people have become.I especially love Captain Beatty's personality, he can burn books but yet he knows quite alot about them.Captain Beatty's name is kind of ironic in how it incorporates the word beatific, which means to show extreme joy or bliss,when in the book they all are trying to stay happy when really they're not.They are not happy in my opinion because they always have to be doing something they can't just think or have a conversation with a human being.This book is very interesting and I recomend it to teens so they can learn more about life itself."
1,"I really enjoyed this one! For grade levels 11th and up, Fahrenheit 451 is sure to please readers of all intrests. Fireman Guy Montag is deeply troubled when he meets a local girl and watchs a women burn in her home. He then realizes the importance of those books he keeps burning and within a few days, he is a totally diffrent person.Author Ray Bradbury predicts the future and successfuly holds the reader's intrest. Frightingly, Ray predictions are quite acurate. Read it and see for yourself."
1,"Farenheit 451: The relevant and haunting masterpiece Guy Montag is a hero of heroes in this masterpiece of a book. He is a misguided soul who never wonders whether his and his companions' actions are just and right. When the idea of the flaw of his society is introduced, Guy goes on a difficult journey for the truth. This is a book that will stay with you forever."
1,"Breathtaking This book was the most breathtaking, jawdropping, and eyeopening phenomenon. I have read this book several times and every time I see something that I didn't see before and gain one more level in the battle against ignorance."
1,Great book All theses years later this book still holds up. Loved it. I would recommend this book to anyone. Somebody should do a modern movie remake of this story.
1,"Fahrenheit 451 I read this book as a teenager, and I wanted my students to read it as well. Although I loved it, I did not get the same reaction as when they saw the video. However they did think the video was cheesy... :D"
1,Great Sale! I bought this book for my personal library and was thrilled by it's condition. It was in mint condition and the seller was great to work with. The book was delivered really quickly and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Thanks!
1,"A Great Read...Thank you! Grateful I stumbled upon this book. A fantastic read. Timeless and incredibly thought provoking.If the summary grabs you at all, give it a chance."
1,"One of the Best Books EVER! This is such an amazing novel, everybody should read it because of its message. While some books become outdated, this novel is still relevant today."
1,"Chilling To you reviewers who had to read this book for school and hated it: I too was forced to read it when I was in 8th grade, and felt the same way about it that you do. I thought it was the dumbest most boring book I'd ever read.I'm telling you now: wait 5 or 6 years, and pick this book up again. I promise you will enjoy it. It's a story of an oppressed society and a man with the courage to try and break free. Please, give Farenheit 451 another chance. You won't regret it."
1,"A Great Summer Read Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a book that will make you think. As you are reading this book, questions pop up that you would have probably never thought of. Set in the not so distant future, Bradbury plunges you into the life of Guy Montag. He is a fireman who was always taught to ask how, not why. His job is to burn, not put out flames, never asking the reasons behind the burnings. He goes through life happy, not knowing anything is wrong. He lives in an unperfected utopia. Due to one event, his whole mentality crumbles and chaos emerges as he goes through a transformation, making everyone around him his enemy, except the few people who have gone through this metamorphosis. No longer ignorant he becomes isolated, pushing for some way out.This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read; it might even be my favorite. If you like books such as The Giver, or the short story Harrison Bergeron, then this is definitely a book to read."
1,"My Favorite Book I love the writings of Ray Bradbury and this book tops them all.Although decades old, it's message is loud and clear. And I still think that the allegories and themes in this are still prevelant in today's society."
1,"Thinking is for LOSERS! This book was really good and made me think a lot more about society and censorship. We are already at the point where everything we think about has already been thought for us(news, magazines,media,etc.). I guess as long as one is happy with society we will always be ruled and brainwashed by the government. Anyways...read this book it'll make you think about real life and how lucky we are that society isn't as screwed up as it could be."
1,"Mike's Review Farenheight 451 is an extrordinary piece of literature. It contains a number of symbols. Ray Bradbury has written a deep complex piece of literaature in Farenheight 451. It is set to take place in the future. Everything isin a fast pace, and there is not a second to breathe in the world that it takes place. You can not walk along the road. Also you can not talk. The most odd things in this book are firemen start fires, and it is illegal to own books. After reading this book I am left to wonder... will the future really be like this?"
1,"A Perfect Quick Read A great story to pass the time during travel, such as on a plane or in car, because it should only take 2-and-a-half Hours to read. It starts with Guy Montag, a fireman whose job is to actually start fires, primarily to burn books and their owner's houses. After being encountered by a strange 17-year old girl who asks not only ""what"" things are about but ""why"", and witnessing a woman commit suicide by lighting her house (bearing books) on fire rather than let the Firemen do it themselves, he decides there must be something else to books than just words and paper. The story is about his struggles to revive the book world and save it from certain destruction."
1,"Thesis Statement For Fahrenheit 451 Ray Bradbury in his classical novel Fahrenheit 451 uses symbolism, imagery, and literary devises to create an abhorrent world filled with censorship. In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury gives a frightening vision of the future where firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury paints society as holding happiness as there highest goal, where trivial, useless information is good and ideas and knowledge is bad. One of the most reoccurring literary devises in this novel is symbolism. We often see symbolism in the character's names. For example, one of the main characters, Guy Montag can have two translations. Guy signifies Guy Faux a famous man we associate with effigy, and Mischief Day (Nov.4), and Montag is the trademark of the Need American Paper Company, also a brand of furnaces. More symbolism is shown when we meet Faber. Faber is America's leading pencil company and it is going to be the pencil that writes on Montag's paper."
1,"Incredible literature (I am only 11) I thought that this book was great and it really makes you wonder. This book was written by a person who had a great imagination, the best. And like Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important that knowledge."" Which I thought was the moral of the book. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants to read where one page makes you read the next."
1,"None I am reading this book in 7th grade advanced language arts. Most students don't like it and think that it's confusing, but i love it."
1,One of a kind masterpiece! This is a marvellous book. I found it full of compelling text and did not want to put it down. I recommend this book to anyone whom likes a good can't put down book.
1,I'm a big fan of Bradbury I think his writings are amazing. I know many differ on that opinion but I truly enjoy his works. 451 is my favorite of his writings. I think it is fascinating to see how much the time influenced him. How so many things you see in the movie are now in creation like the wall tv (our flat screen now). This book was required reading in my youth and I feel it should be required today as well. It's a view of a world which could easily occur if we allow our rights to be flushed basically. How we could easily fall into a dystopian world if we become complacent and lack knowledge. I highly recommend this book!
1,"Sweet, sweet irony The irony of this book always slayed me. Here is a book of a future where books are like drugs: outlawed, sold on the black market, and if there's a ""library,"" firemen destroy it. And the added bonus is that the main character, a loyal fireman, has a library! The irony that gets me is that this book is about banning books, yet it is a banned book, so nobody read it! (Ha ha, just kidding folks!)"
1,"Philosophical This book should not merely by its face value. It is a ""good"" book on its plot and development alone. Its insight into life, however, knocks it up a step. It is very profound and warns us of an ignorant, entertainment society."
1,451 This was a fantastic book. Felt like the quality and price were fair as well. I would recommend this book.
1,"Quite an achievement I read this book as an assignment when I was 11 or 12, I believe. The reason I write this is because all the moronic kids who were ""forced"" to read it seem to think it sucks; well, let the record show that not *all* schoolchildren are idiots who must interpret every line of every book literally. I was duly impressed by the book even in 7th grade (?) and it gets better the older I get. The fact that I, an impoverished (well, you know what I mean) teenager, am willing to pay double the price of the book for a signed copy says something."
1,The best book in the world If you haven't read this book you have to do so now. I know you are thinking its science fiction but once you read it you'll be thinking how can they burn books and kill people who do. You will agree bradbury's ideas. I hope a movie comes out of this book eventhough bradbury doesn't like it.Maybe the book can be remember by a movie.
1,"Excellent! It's definitely one of the best movies I have seen in the past 5 years. Amazing performances, great cast and story."
1,The Dead Girl (DVD) I really like this movie. It is one that I would stronglyrecommend to my friends and all good movie buffs. It is bestthe first time you see it as there are surprises in it thatyou don't want to know before you see it. Watch this movie.
1,It worked Yep. Motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord. Has a convenient on off light that you'll never miss. It's big and bright.
1,"Excited I am very, very pleased with the car charger. It came packed very well and in a very timely manner. The price was great compared to retail stores. No worries now when traveling long distances."
1,"Slick unit. Wish all chargers had coiled cords like this on has, stays out of the way. Very nice looking unit, well made and works great."
1,"Eye-opening, profoundly moving Who are these people who beg by the side of the road? What has driven them to so desperate a measure as panhandling? How much money do they collect? Where do they go and how do they live when they are not on the streetcorners? While Bruce Moody's book cannot speak for all street beggars, it does provide a thoughtful and penetrating glimpse into the hidden world of the down and out. In reading this account, one must perforce give up the well-worn cliches and stereotypes about those inhabiting this netherworld. Moody's tale is one of raw adversity, yes, but also one of redemption. The kindness of strangers he encounted in one year is, I daresay, more than most of us will experience in a lifetime. ""Will Work For Food or $"" shines as a bright beacon of hope through the darkness of despair."
1,"Wow! You gotta hear this! This entire album is great! In particular, ""The Chant of the Islands"" is a breathtaking song. Its what paradise sounds like.Do yourself a favor and purchase this album."
1,"Balrog! I am such a huge fan of author J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderful Lord of the Rings book trilogy and I must say that Fellowship of the Ring for the Game Boy Advance is a remarkable adaptation to Tolkien's book trilogy! But, beware of the glitches in this game! I got past them, but it wasn't easy. The game crashes in the Old Forest and the Mines of Moria levels. Other than that, this is a stunning game!"
1,"The best game I have ever played. JoeF-k This is by far the best game I have ever played. You may get stuck in the Mines Of Moria ,but this game you won't be able put down! The frist time I played it I played for 7 hours strait!"
1,Great memories My grandmother gave me this book when it was first published. I loved it then and I love it now. My grandmother lived in similar conditions and now I am too. Its a wonderful read. Full of laughter and smiles.
1,"Who says Old Folks don't have fun I just saw this book at a yard sale, the title caught my interest and I am not sorry I bought it. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my Daughter-in law's birthday"
1,"Elder adventure and northern California history I've read Dear Mad'm three times and am still amazed at the author's ability to transport me into the Klamath mountains. She skillfully paints a detailed picture of her late-in-life adventures amidst enchanting mountain forest life and people who take care of each other around the mid-1900s. You'll learn a lot about small-scale gold mining, the beautiful plant life of the area and the ability that one can have to change his or her destiny with the simple phrase of, ""I'm going to do it!"" I hope someone turns this into a movie!"
1,"Both Stuart Little 1 & 2 on one ""little"" PSP UMD Disc! WOW! This is a great PSP UMD Video!!! Includes BOTH Stuart Little and Stuart Little 2 on one tiny PSP UMD!!! Two great family films!!! Will keep the kiddies(and adults too!)entertained for hours!!! Recommended!!! A+"
1,"I agree... I know this isn't the most helpful review but I would justlike to concur with the other reviews. I have had these bootsfor a year now and except for a few scuffs, they still are ingreat condition."
1,"A Great Contemporary Story I had my doubts that I would even like ""Baby Oh Baby"" due the fact that I saw it advertise in the back of another book that I didn't like, but I took a chance and bought and I am glad that I did. ""Baby Oh Baby"" is a great story about losing love and finding it again. The one thing that I really liked was the fact that the secondary characters also had a storyline to, that help to contribute to the main story. Can't wait to read more by Robin Wells"
1,"A gem amidst a pile of rocks ""Dreams were nothing but diving boards for disappointment. The higher you climbed, the deeper you plunged."" This sentiment could describe my reading experiences this year, until Baby, Oh Baby. In fact, it gets my early, albeit imaginary, vote for Best Contemporary for 2001. The characters were deeply realistic, yet likeble. Jake's return to the fertility clinic (""The clinic was sterile. Just like the patients who came here."") made me choke up. Annie's attention to ""signs"" and intuition was touching, not silly. Her steadfast resolve not to be second place was admirable: ""I want a no-holds-barred, not-holding-anything-back, in-it-with-everything-I've-got kind of love."" The ending scene at the courthouse was perfect, and had me singing along...""Baby, oh baby..."""
1,"a real gem This is one of those rare romance books that just suck you in from the very beginning. There are actually two romances in one in this book. I actually found the secondary romance as good as the main one and that is not easy to find in a book. Usually you find yourself skipping over the second relationship because the first one is so much better.Actually, I think this book would adapt well as a movie. There were enough humorous parts to rival any of today's romantic comedies.If you haven't read this one, you're missing out. I'd give it 10 stars instead of the 5 allowed."
1,Worth every penny Can't say very much about this.Cord doesn't tangle and there is no noticeable loss in sound quality compared to plugging phones directly in to stereo.
1,Great addition to camera I am very happy with this product. It keep the camera completely dry and still allows full functionality of all the buttons!!
1,"Great for your camera! I really like this housing, it's light, easy to use, easy to clean. Takes great underwater pictures from simply snorkeling to deep (30m) diving."
1,"AWESOME I just had to write and say how wonderful this CD is. The kids and I love it so much. As a matter of fact, I listen to it when the kids aren't even with me! We have purchased it for all of our friends!"
1,He knew he was right A far better book than the BBC movie. i enjoyed it immensely even though it is long. Some of the characters are not real particularly some of the young women
1,"Video Violence (Howard and Eli crapped) Video Violence is one of the greatest horror movies ever. Howard and Eli crapped their pants in a bad way. Video Violence is just so tight. Steven has a vicious mullet, and the movie just kicks diaper butt."
1,Excellent British Movies This set of 8 movies are top notch entertainmentyou will enjoy some great stories with excellent actingso do your self a favor and order this set of movieschfancierFancier of fine movies
1,Excellent Collection I am a great fan of Colin Firth and bought it for that reason. A fortunate purchase because there are some great films that I may have missed.
1,"Movie It was brand new as stated and received very quickly. I love BBC and historical pieces. This is a good one, especially for this price."
1,"A Fabulous Surprise I never thought I would get addicted to this book in the way that I did. As a hetero female, I assumed I wasn't the target audience. And I'm not. But that's besides the point. The stories are so engaging, so honest and funny that they transcend gay porn or erotic fiction. They're fascinating stories--a truly spectacular entree into the world of the penis."
1,"Great performances!! A very interesting compilation of wonderful performances, from several heavy duties of the prog rock scene in the 90s. The progfest was an amazing opportunity of enjoy our well beloved bands, old and new! The John Wetton Band is at its best in this concert, and also are specially inspired the intervention of Spock's Beard and Arena. The Flower Kings is always a great presence, and watching Le Orme after so many years, was a wonderful surprise.Thanks to the progfest! To have the video is at least a good consolation for all of us who were not able to be there. Only problem is that you want to watch more of the performances!!"
1,"If you know what Atari is, buy this! I've been searching for a gamecube game that is like the old style Atari-Like video games I grew up with and here it is! Plus, when you succeed with a pac-man game (not sure how many levels), you are given a bonus game of Pac Man to try which was a wonderful surprise. The galaxia games are pretty much like I remember. Pole Position is still hard for me to maneuver. Also no directions onscreen so plan on figuring out the game for yourself. I love it because it's simple w/ no frills!"
1,"Love the classics This game is simply amazing and flawless! There are some unlockables, and all the games have multi-player action! It's seriouly like a classic arcade, rooled into a updated game system. Before I go on with the posative, I have one just one, the entire reveiw, I promis this is the only negative...In some of the pac-man games, if you play on a small TV (like me) then it's hard to see everything in general.*gasping for air* I'm so glad that negative part is over! Back to the posative!With three totally new games: Pac-man Arrangement, Galaga Arrangement, and Dig-Dug arrangement. These are all great games, that are so much fun!In addition, there are two games you can unlock:1. Pac-attack - Unlock by scoring 20,000 points or more in Pac-man2. Pac-Mania - Unlock by scoring 15,000 points or more in Ms. Pac-ManPros -EverythingCons -Read above"
1,"Great sale! Great item, and I'm enjoying it, thanks! Great sale too! Item came to me very quickly! I'm very happy with my order!"
1,"Don't write a review until you read this and waited... Don't write a review until you read this and waited.Finnegans Wake takes time to penetrate the mind.At first, it makes no sense. But keep trying, and try, and try...and then you will get its awesomeness."
1,"Cross-world O.k. this book is unreadable. It is not enjoying and it definitely shows you your limits in all categories. But what power must lie within a text whose first 5 or 6 lines could be the subject of 100 dissertations or 1000s of interpretations that make sense too. Just hand the first paragraph to a student class and let them brainstorm what could be meant by ""riverrun,... commodius vicus or recirculation, ...etc."" and you will see and feel it."
1,this book is cool this book is like so cool man i mean it is like watching the spice girls movie cept its in a book i really like it so i think you should buy it
1,"Nursing as a Ministry Again, Sr Mary Elizabeth O'Brien has writeen an excellent book. I give this book to nurses when they graduate. It truly puts nurses in an angelic and spiritual perspective which they deserve."
1,"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life I purchased this book as ""used"". It is in excellent shape. At the moment I am still reading it. Great."
1,"Best Spiritual Disciplines Book There is a lifetime worth of practical advice on developing spiritual disciplines. Chapter on Bible Intake 1 & 2, Prayer, Worship, Evangelism, Serving, Stewardship, Fasting, Silence & Solitude, Journaling, Learning and Perseverance in the disciplines."
1,"Fantastic! Any Christian, new or old, needs to read this book! It will absolutely change the way you go about life!"
1,"Your lap will never be the same The comfort, the ease of use, and finally, a protective surface for my tender lap that was being burned off by the heat of laptop! Lapinator to the rescue!I'll be honest, this isn't my first lapinator. I have bought two before and used them for meetings. When I got a new house, I had to have one for here too, so I got the ultimate! With a mouse holder! Way cool and good for either righties or lefties! :)I've tried them all, every product to protect my privates, and this is the only one I'll trust my tender thighs to!"
1,"Hatebreed I read a reveiw on here from a customer named xtestosteronexsupplimentsx and he seemed to think that Hatebreed stole their sound from such non-hardcore bands as Slipknot and others. Well, seeing that Hatebreed was formed in the early 90's I don't see how that could be. Sorry man, but you just don't know. Hatebreed is a brutal hardcore band with in-your-face hard hitting riffs and relentless vocals. I love the music of Hatebreed. Being a Christian I do find some of their lyrics confrontational but the music is great. It can get a bit repetative but nonetheless good. This band is for those who enjoy true hardcore, not what has recently been attributed as hardcore (for example bands like Korn, Slipknot, Kid Rock....these are pop bands that are very heavy...not hardcore bands. hardcore is different). If you have any comments just write me an e-mail."
1,The best I bought this cd when it first came out. It has not left my cd player yet. The only problem is that it's kinda short. But I can deal with that because it's heavy. The bigger problem is that I haven't heard of them touring. I hope they do!
1,"outstanding... Im ussualy into something much more brutal & insane & gore then the likes of hatebreed but i can't deny tha fact that i enjoy their music alot! I seen this guys at ozzfest & i did enjoy their performance alot & i just like how their music attracts all kinds of people...Some how that makes me like them even more! I quess that's hatebreed for you! Okay, hatebreed's new album ""rise of brutaly"" as well as the one before that ""perseverance"" are also pretty amazing in itslef...Support hatebreed!PS: I hate the fact that they put slipknot in the same category as hatebreed...F*ck slipknot--they suckkk!!!!!!! Only posers listing to slipknot,f*ck 'em!"
1,"Brutal!!!! Wow!!! Just insane and just how I like it. NO rapping. No singing. No slow parts!!!!! It is short but it still well worth it!!! Closest thing to what they sound like is probably Soulfly. EVERY SINGLE TRACK IS GOOD!!! I cant even say that about Slipknot! Although, Slipknot is the best band out there. Another band to check out is Mudvayne!!"
1,"Why does nobody seem to care about this album?! People call themselves a huge Hatebreed fan, but they don't have this, let alone the fact that they have probably never heard any of the 25 minutes of brutality that is Hatebreed's indie-debut. I won't say their new stuff sucks (it rocks), but this is even better. Go down to a Newbury comics or somewhere where you can find some great underground metal and check it out, especially if you like Perseverance or Rise Of Brutality."
1,"The best of the best This CD works wonders on people. If I had to fight Mike Tyson, I would make sure to have this CD with me before the fight. This CD is sick. My dog likes it, too."
1,"Score true to movie Many piano-vocal reductions for musicals are completely different from the original score. This one stays surprisingly true, though the left hand is missing a lot of interesting rhythms, and not many vocal harmonies are present. The keys of all songs are the same as the movie, and all intros, choruses, and verses are intact. Some of the interludes and dances are shortened or omitted, however. If you're looking for the karaoke CD, try iTunes."
1,"Another Winner by Jackpine Bob ""Born to Pull"" is vintage Bob Cary, maybe his best work ever. As always the question is, is it Cary's marvelous prose or his illustrations that make this book great? Wait. It's illustrated by someone else - Gail de Marcken. But Bob, please don't try to tell us you had no hand in the art work.Even if the reader is a die-hard dog sled fan there are things to be learned in this book. Even die-hard Cary fans will be moved by the stories of mushers and their dogs.This is a beautifully put-together book. It even feels good to hold. The centerpiece is the collection of great stories. Cary lets his subjects speak for themselves as he guides the reader through the details; he is the master of this technique.Five paws up."
1,"Great fit for 70# lab mix I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a 70# lab-shar-pei mix. Even though this dog's head is a bit smaller than the one pictured on the front of the product, it fit perfectly and my friend has seen great results in her walks with her dog, who used to pull like mad, but is now behaving really well thanks to this little contraption."
1,"This product is superior to the gentle leader! After our new furry family member chewed through two of the Gentle Leader collars in three months, I went in search of something new. We have had this collar now for over nine months and it is still in one piece. The nose loop does not slip off like with the other collar, so he can't eat it! And even if he managed to do so - the material is thicker and stronger. Our dog is a 75 lb lab/bulldog mix, who can out-pull me or my husband on a standard neck collar. But this head collar really minimizes his ability and desire to pull. I can control him with two fingers on the leash - HUGE difference! LOVE this one!"
1,"Love it I bought the Halti brand first... This brand is better... has a soft piece of material that goes over the nose of your pet.. This is the best thing I could have purchased for my dogs.. It DEFINITELY WORKS... I have 2 strong-willed Boxers that try to control me... but this product is a lifesaver... Thank you, thank you, thank you !!!!"
1,"Great product - Must have! My dog is a puller and I being a petite woman with a bad back found it difficult walking my spunky 65 lb lab. Prior to purchasing the Holt, I had been using the Gentle Leader from Premier and truly liked it. Both collars are similarly designed. The only dislike I had with the Gentle Leader was with the nose loop. It didn't have the supportive cushion my dog required leaving her skin very raw.The Holt collar is designed with a cushioned nose-band which adds extra protection.What I did appropriate with the Premier Gentle Leader was the informative DVD they provided that instructed how to properly fit the collar to the dog and how to properly use it.Transitioning between the two leaders was minimal to nothing. I would recommend either one of these products, they are a life saver!!!"
1,"Perfect size 3 for doberman/shepherd mix What a great invention! Not only it fits on my doberman/german shepherd mix dog, it also works! My dog tends to pull during the walk, especially when she sees another dog. This training collar distracts her from pulling because it is positioned under her mouth. She did not like it initially and tried to take it off, but then she concentrated on the walk itself.Another nice feature of this collar is that it is adjustable in the front under her nose, so if it is hot outside and the dog has to pant she can open her mouth.The collar is supposed to attach to a regular collar that the dog wears all the time, although I used it as a single collar on my dog."
1,LOVE THIS WALKING COLLAR This walking collar has the greatest design. I do not have to have great upper body strength to control my excited boxer. She walks next to me like she is supposed to. No more pulling me down the street. Bravo
1,"simply magick!!! perfect pictures and no extra cost I cannot estimate the endless fortune this will save me. I have a SLR and developed my own film, till I got so tired of the darkroom and the cost! Still, having it developed even from 'quickie' mail order sites cost a fortune. Worse, when you are trying to take a good picture of kitty and she goes zoom zoom zoom and ruin nearly a whole roll of film you want to scream. With this, pop it into my camera and click all day. I held on to my SLR for so long because I felt there was no way something so simply could have such quality! Wow!the colours are true, the images brilliant and SO SHARP. Too a picture of kitty four foot away and you could see a flea on her nose in the picture!Get a good camera like the Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom, get one of these cards and takes 100s of pictures. It puts the fun back in taking pics!!"
1,"If you liked StarGate at all, you'll want to see Continuum. GREAT movie. I hope they keep making these direct-to-DVD Stargate films. The TV show was outstanding and I loved all ten seasons. The previous ""Ark of Truth"" direct-to-DVD movie was terrific and this one maintains the high production quality, storyline and acting.Somehow, they managed to get practically all of the actors portraying the various heros and villians over the years back together for the story. For example, there are lots of cameos by all the best ""System Lords"" we loved to hate in the TV show.If you're a Stargate fan, you won't want to miss this.My only regret is that I just bought the DVD last week for $15 at Best Buy when I could've rented it here for $3.99, but at least the DVD includes a few hours of bonus material about the production.Two Kentucky thumbs up to the Stargate cast and crew!"
1,Great movie. If you are a fan of the Stargate series and want to see an end to the series as a movie this is a great movie and a must see and I got this fast after ordering it.
1,Great Closing to stargate sg1 Wonderful movie to close the stargate sg1 saga. A must see for your whole family. Guaranteed wonder and amusement once again
1,"Continuum makes the grade! A fan since the beginning I've seen every show there was..loved the final 2 hour wrap up of StarGate, even if you never watched a show, this would be fun for some who like Sci-Fi! I enjoyed several of the fun things Ben Browder slipped in while taking Command of the starship... and the fact that many of our past ""bad guys"" come back for one last peek.. Love owning this... nothing like a rainy day with some snacks and a great Stargate to watch!"
1,"Great Movie Loved seeing Jack again, this is for all of the stargate addicts! I'm not a big fan of the new SG1leader but the movie is still a good watch"
1,"Wow! Great Movie What a great addition to the SG-1 series. This is one of the best stories of the series. I've watched it twice and am eager for a third time.It's great to see Jack back, of course. The story line kept me guessing, and the action scenes were very good and not overdone. The CG is absolutely amazing and fits in without looking gimicky.This movie really brought me back to the feel of the first few series, yet we have characters that span all 10 series. I think everyone from the writers, actors, and production crew were spot on with this movie."
1,"Excellent indeed ! When I saw it first time I was under the impression that I was looking at some Oscar prize movie so I had to seen it once more just after ending... Sometime after first 25-30 minutes of the second view I realize that is on DVD... so no Oscar, too bad. It's better than the ""ARK"", better than ""Children of the Gods"" sometimes better than first one ""Stargate"" (Kurt Russel). Rick is great again, as usual... What can I say, it's not only for Stargate fans, it's for anyone and anything...It's just great. And I guess right now O'Neill asked ... what?!"
1,"Sure hope this is not the end of the road! Really enjoyed this. Got it a couple of weeks ago and have watched it twice already, actually did a whole SG1 thing with this film and The Ark of Truth this past weekend, told the wife is was all based on fact, so she left me alone. Sure hope this is not the end of it all. Anyway this film and 'The Ark of Truth' are well worth the money and you will not be sorry you bought them."
1,"None stop action with a twist From the opening scene, until you realize the movie is already over, this is a great film. Very well done, and worthy of having in a collection for Stargate SG1 junkies!"
1,"Miss the series I was very upset when they took this series off the air. I'm glad to have these movies but still wish the series was still around, Love this movie."
1,"Stargate Pleaser If you are a Stargate fan, then this movie is a must for you. When a couple of the team begin to disappear into thin air the remaining team hits the Stargate and end up in a 20th century when the Stargate has not yet been invented. We have all of our favorite and familiar characters who, of course, go to the North Arctic and Russia to find the frozen Stargate, make things work allowing them to return to their own time and things are made right and all is right with the world. We watched this as a Prime Member free through our computer/TV 60"" monitor. Wonderful."
1,"coolest movie ever!!!!! i have the entire stargate sg-1 box set and the ark of truth movie... this one is my favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the continued story line of the evil but suave gould Bal is just so well crafted and keeps you on the edge of your seat/sofa/bean bag... what ever your setting on:) if you are a huge sg-1 fan, you have to watch this!"
1,MOVIE STARGATE CONTINUUM Movie arrived quickly. Just as good as new. A+++++++Surpassed my expectations. Bought the movie cheaper than what I could have rented it.
1,"great item SG1 Continuum, is a great movie. The CGI is flawless and over all a great movie. I hope it isn't the last MGM does."
1,"Great cooker This is my first rice cooker...it was rated one of the best as I did my research and decided to buy based on feedback from other owners. I must say that I totally agree with the majority of owners, its a fantastic product. The cooker is easy to use, easy to clean and delivers a reliable pot of rice every time. I have no idea what would make a cooker better, but for the average person, I doubt you will need anything more than this...you can have TOTAL confidence that you made the right choice when you hit the 'add to cart' button."
1,Perfect Cooker This is one of the best electrical items that I have in my home. It cooks steel oatmeal as well as rice. All these cooked perfectly. It is a breeze to clean and is small and portable. I loved it so much I bought one for my married daughter in Minneapolis. AND she loves it too. I use it at least 2-3 times a week.
1,"Excellent cooker I've always cooked rice in a saucepan on a stovetop before but got tired of the pan bubbling over all the time. This cooker is great. It is capable of making quite small amounts of rice too. I routinely cook about one-half a cup of rice in it and it turns out great. Brown rice needs to be soaked for six hours or longer prior to cooking or it really won't turn out very good but that is usually recommended anyway. I use one rounded half-cup brown rice that has been soaked, rinsed and drained, and two-thirds cup water, letting it stand for fifteen minutes while still covered after the cooking cycle is complete. It turns out fluffy and perfect every time. Very easy to clean too, just a quick wipe of the inside cover with a damp sponge, pop out the steam vent and rinse it off, and wash the inner basin with a non-abrasive sponge or cloth. I couldn't possibly be happier with this cooker, I use it nearly every day."
1,"Yuki It's easy to use. It's easy to clean up. Functions are simple to understand. I haven't had it for long, so, I don't know anything about it's durability yet."
1,"I like it Before your first time of cooking, you have to hold the rice cook in your chest and wash the inside of the lid under hot water from the tap. I didn't do that until my third time cooking. The first two were terrible with my cooked rice filled with awful plastic smell. After I washed the lid with flowing hot water from the tap, I don't get any plastic smell in my rice any more. The manual should have that instruction. Also I tried to cook my porriage with the lid shut, it is also OK. So far I'm satisfied with it. If it has timing, it would be perfect."
1,"mu-sic , n.: Musiq Soulchild This is the first album I've heard from Musiq and my breath was taken away. The man of neo-soul created a great 3rd album. With songs like Whereareyougoing, Youloveme, Womanopoly, Thereason, there is no doubt that Musiq is music's prodigal son."
1,"Musiq does it again!!! When I first bought this album, I wasn't sure how I felt about it, unlike my immediate love for the first two. But recently I had the pleasure of seeing Musiq in concert and he made me go and reevaluate/rediscover this classic that I had been sitting on since it first came out!! The entire album from beginning to end is very well put together. Out of the 15 tracks, 11 of them are my favorites. Musiq, keep doing what you do best!!"
1,"I am not surprised!!! I love this main. He is the Stevie of our time. His music remains soulful and is entrenched with meaning. I love the beats and lyrics. He continues to explore more of what soul music is, and can be.The intro is bangin'. I love #5 and #10 especially. I can honestly put all 3 albums in rotation and be entertained for hours. Cop this album!"
1,"A Five Star Album Musiq has put to together one solid project with his third effort Soulstar. The album is incredibly self assured and focused. It is rare that I enjoy a CD on first listen, but Soulstar is worthy of such recognition. In addition the use of guest stars such as Cee-lo and Kindred on Momentinlife and Carol Riddick on Soulstar do not seem forced, but a well throughout and executed idea. As I said in the review over a year ago for Juslisten, It took a while for it to grow on me. Soulstar grabbed me on first listen, and I plan to continue to hear what Musiq has to say."
1,"Incredible A great movie, fast, moving, totally capturing. It makes you think, it makes you dance, it makes your heart beat faster, and most important of all it makes you realize how important ""a second"" of lifetime can be and how it can change everything."
1,"German ground hog day. A well done ground hog day type movie. A very well done movie, that keeps up the interest all the way through."
1,"BE SELFISH AND ANTISOCIAL. This film made my heart stop. I subconsciously held my breath in parts, for fear of disturbing its incredible movement and beauty. What an innovative succession of events! Just when you think it's over, Lola stuns you again. Watch this film ALONE. Pay attention. The first experience is key."
1,"WOW The best film of 1999 in my opinion. It made me think, it held me spellbound, it leaped off the screen, and it was totally fresh. I was very disapointed when it was not nominated for best foreign film by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."
1,"If you haven't seen this movie yet, turn off the PC and go.. Run to your neighborhood rental house and rent it! What a wonderful contemporary film."
1,"Captivating! The only thing upon which I can agree with the previous viewer is that the character of Manni is indeed a bit annoying--not too bright, and all too willing to blame Lola for his own predicament. This film is so taught, however, that it hardly matters.Run Lola Run is imaginative, mesmerizing, and take-your-breath-away exciting. The amazing visuals work perfectly with an outstanding soundtrack and a highly engaging storyline to create a truly exquisite film experience. Highly, highly recommended!"
1,"Startlingly Unique ""Run Lola Run"" is a masterpiece so unlike a movie - a movie in the traditional sense, that is, that it's difficult to follow at first. On second and later viewings, it can be viewed for the marvel that it is. It is ingenious in its subtle nuances of passing characters and seemingly throwaway moments that turn out to be so much more, and build the suspense and anticipation, as well as the opprtunity for brilliant twists, throughout the movie. The pulsating sound-track is a stroke of genius, and falls right in step with the relentless pacing of the movie. If you are intolerant of unusual or innovative filmmaking, do not see this movie. But if you have a genuine taste for the bizzare, the creative, the attention-grabbing, and the deviously intelligent, ""Run Lola Run"" is a movie for you."
1,"Direct Hit This is the best action movie I've ever seen. I've never been a big fan of techno music before, but it is used so effectively in this movie that I found myself drawn to the soundtrack afterward. If you can appreciate cinematography like a fast-paced music video, you will absolutely love this film - guaranteed."
1,"A good film...and an amazing work of art This film is one of the best films I have seen, in many ways, you can't describe it, but it is fast-paced and you will not be bored. The German language in the movie actually adds to the movie, it would not be so good if it was in English. This movie is so innovative. 5 stars from me."
1,"My Favorite Foreign Film I usually don't like foreign films but this one is great! This is a fast paced, high energy film. Interesting plot and 3 surprise endings. (Side note:It's nice to see Germany from a everyday person's perspective and not a travel brochure.)"
1,"Classic cult flim It was good. It is good. and the next I watch it, it will still be good. It's a what if i can go back a hour or two and change events before time run out."
1,"The most fascinating movie I have seen in years The people here have already summed it up quite well, but I must chime in anyhow. I went to see this movie in the theater twice (the FIRST time I have EVER done so with ANY MOVIE). Needles to say I loved it and am awaiting the dvd release.BUY THIS MOVIE YOU WILL LOVE TO WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.Don't let the German language version scare you the subtitles are easy to read and it makes you feel as if you are running through Berlin yourself!!!!!!!"
1,"Postmodern Kieslowski Very inventive movie and reminds me of Kieslowski, without the Catholic baggage, in that we see how randmom life isand how small encounters and slight changes in timing can significantly alter one's life and others (without our even being aware of it).This is an interesting ( but not new ) idea to think about, yet it is cleverly presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner in this film. This movie has all the elements of a classic cult film."
1,"SEHR GUT I really liked this movie. Visually, it is a very beautiful movie. The characters, even the minor ones, are intriguing. The plot is exciting and revolutionary. And finally, the soundtrack is wicked awesome.Franka Potente is an amazing actress,there is more evidence of this in the Bourne Identity. She has lots of charisma and pulls you into the movie. Manni actually wasn't too bad. He and Lola are both pretty weird people so its ok.Applause to the Germans, you've come up with a really good one here! Sehr gut!"
1,"A cross between ""Sliding Doors"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It was so fast-paced and interesting. Oh my god, you absolutely have to see it!!!"
1,"Brilliant This is a brilliant film. Lola the played by Franke Potente is a Red Haired (not natural if you know what I mean)freaky type who gets a call from her boyfriend Manny who is frantic telling her he lost a bag of money that he was taking to Renni a bald headed cimminal type. He states he has 20 minutes to get the money to Renni or he is a dead man. Lola tells him to stay where he is and she rushes out of her home to find $100,000 or is it in Deustch Marks? Anyway this is a very clever story that takes place in real time. So you may be thinking if the movie takes place in real time does it only last for 20 minutes? HMMM, you will have to see the film. The highest recommendation. I would watch it w/o subtitles first then watch it with subtitles. German film 5 plus stars No need to watch it before you buy it. It is easily worth the money"
1,"An exhilirating ride! Run Lola Run would have to be one of my all time favourite movies. It is one of the most innovative, and original movies I have ever come across. I could never really tolerate euro-techno until I rented this DVD. The music was composed by talented director/writer Tom Tywker and performed by his leading lady (on- and off screen) Franka Potente, who is brilliant and charismatic as Lola. The story is simple: Lola has 20 minutes tomake up for the loot lost by his hapless boyfriend Manni or Manni will be killed. There are three alternatives to the story, each detailing how one's actions could have consequences on others who cross their path. Many have compared this to other what-if flicks such as ""Sliding Doors"". But this film benefits from not having a terribly self-conscious Gwyneth Paltrow having another bad attempt at a British accent.The movie is fast, euroccentric, and you wouldn't believe that you'd been staring at the screen for 90-minutes. More exciting than a soccer match."
1,"Great Film I borrowed this movie from my friend to kill some time at work and though he had explain the plot; I still loved it! What he told me didn't exactly tell me what to expect. Espeically how well the music is cordniated with the film. The speical features include a great video; which is of the lead actress's song. The other features didn't interest me so I didn't check them out. If you liked the books that you can choose the outcome like go to page 8 or 16 you'll love this movie. I intially watched it in English Dub audio but the lips were totally off and the voices sounded so weird, so I watched in German with English subtitles. I didn't mind the subtitles. I do enjoy forgein films, so if you like them too, buying this DVD would be a great addition."
1,"A Perfect Film I dont think I can actually say enough about this movie to tell you how fantastic and perfectly grand it was to watch. I think having over 50 customer reviews with an average 5 star rating says it all! I bought the movie just off the basis of my friends reviews, and now the movie is on my top ten list of the best movies I have seen. The cinematography, the plot, the music, the actors....all were excellent. I couldn't find a single flaw or even a ""they should have done this..."" This one is just too good to miss."
1,Nice mp3 For me the PA-2 is great. i dont have any problems with it and it was for a reasonable price. There was one problem but that was due 2 my stupidity. So i just wanna let everyone no to get this product if youre lookin for a mp3 player!!
1,"SanDisk 128MB Memory Stick I purchased this product as a generic alternative to the more expensive Sony original. The two memory sticks are so similar that they may as well have been from the same manufacturer - I can detect absolutely no difference in performance between the two.The Sony memory stick format is useful but somewhat overpriced, so it is a real pleasure to find such a reasonable alternative. Strongly recommended"
1,"The one to start on! The basic text of the most exciting playwright of recent decades. The place to start when discovering the American drama as reader, actor, or teacher!"
1,"Great purchase The book arrived on time and in good condition. This is an excellent collection for both theatre enthusiasts, teachers and for a comprehensive sampling of what Shepard is so gifted at constructing."
1,"The best and most essential Shepard collection This collection features his finest and most mature work (Buried Child, Curse, True West) plus the best of his earlier plays (La Turista, The Tooth of Crime). They all showcase his great humor and startling use of language and imagery. Th more mature works deal, unflinchingly with american families. Tongues and Savage Love, which he did in collaboration with Joseph Chaiken, are wonderful, poetic meditations of existence and identity. If you are interested in Shepard as a playwright this is the finest collection of his best work. After this, I recommend seeking out the plays Fool for Love and A Lie of the Mind, for more of his ""mature"" work and then also Angel City as another prime example of the imaginative flights he took with his earlier work. In case you don't already know, Shepard is one of the most important American playwrights. Period."
1,"A great afternoon! Loved this book. I'm a newbie to golf, and this book was full of charm. It's not going to really teach you how to golf, but it will teach you to appreciate the intricacies of the game, and a great personality in it.Plus, it will inspire you to practice, because Hogan was a true student of the game. And that never hurts."
1,"Great Advice for Guys These guys make a great case for finding Miss Right or Miss Right Now on the Internet. There's lots of common-sense advice that literally saved me hundreds of hours in wasted time and thousands of dollars in wasted dating money. The ""Women of Internet Dating"" section had some very funny stereotypes and I even learned something from their astrology section. Following their advice helped me find my future wife in less than 30 days! This little book is worth it's weight in gold."
1,"In French or English, she's Queen Celine If you think Celine Dion is fabulous in English, you should hear her in French. Her sound is much more original, less commericial. 1F4T is a fantastic album. It has an organic, rock sound. You don't need to know french to love this album or any of her last few french albums (d'eux, s'il suffaist d'aimer, chante plamodon). I don't know any french and i'm not some obsessed fan. but i love the french albums anyway because they are the best of an incredible artist whose english output can be quite bland and uninspired sometimes.The track listing:tout l'or des hommesapprends-moile vol d'un angene bouge pastu nagesje t'aime encore (english version with french title is on ""One Heart"")retiens-moije lui diraimon hommerien n'est vraiment finicontre naturedes milliers de baisersplus the bonus ""ghost track"" not listed anywhere on the cd:valse adieu"
1,Celines hit Celine dion is magnificent on this album. Even though its french she's still great. She hits very high notes. Its Just an amazing album. Its very great. It Deserves a grammy award. Its Fantastic you should really bye it.
1,"10 stars! This album is brilliant! If you buy it, I guarantee it'll be the best album you buy all year!"
1,"""1 fille & 4 types"" est superb! Without a doubt listening, enjoying and understanding the passion that Celine pours into each one of her songs is one of the great prizes of speaking French. There are no power-ballads and not so many high notes in this album as it is a more intimate and personal. I love it, this is the perfect mixture of pop, rock and country like rythms. I love it, from ""Tout l'or des hommes"", to ""Le vol d'un ange"", ""Je lui dirai"" to her superb performance of ""Je t'aime encore"", every song is unique and wonderful. Well produced, mixed and arranged, no wonder it was an instant hit in Quebec and France!"
1,"Great tea in a really nice presentation. Bentleys has some of the best teas out there. This box makes a great gift for tea lovers. It has a great variety of green teas (papaya, pomegranate, blueberry, etc.) and each comes individually bagged for freshness. Just steep and enjoy!"
1,"Memories of Cab 804 and much more Taxi is an outstanding sitcom and having Bob James score the music is like finding 500 bucks in the back seat of the Sunshine Cab they call ""old whip and chill"" (no power steering, no heater)--just the best! Bob's music sets the mood and elicits emotions for all the scenes. And, ""Angela's Theme,"" the theme of the show, is like getting a 100 buck tip on a 5 buck fare-amazing! So, if you want to know more, just ""gimme a buck,"" and you'll find out! And meet me at Jim's Mario's for a beer. Or we can go to the Tidepool, where after having several ""monsoons,' we'll be three sheets to the wind."
1,Gossip Girl: The complete Third Season I purchased this item for my grandaughter to update her collection. She was well pleased with the gift which gave her many ours of relaxing enjoyment.
1,Gossip Girl Season 2 I think this is a great series. One can watch it and not really have to think too much - I find it very relaxing.
1,"i love CHUCK AND BLAIR!!! Season 3 was mostly about chuck and blair in a relationship and while i ADORE those two, I kept waiting for the next episode where there will be some HOT chuck and blair sex like in season 1 and 2 but alas, it NEVER happened! this royally PISSED me off but like the title of this review implies, I love chuck and blair and they are the ONLY reason I watch gossip girl. there were a lot of sweet moments and that was why i bought the dvd, also there were some slightly hot scenes between chuck and blair that were in deleted scenes. I LOVE CHUCK AND BLAIR FOREVER, NOW AND ALWAYS!!!!!!"
1,"West Point For those who want more than the Ivies ---- not only an Ivy-rated undergraduate education, but, virtue, leadership training, personal challenge, proving what you're made of, pride in giving something back to your family and America ---- the answer is West Point. EVERYONE has a good chance at the full scholarship. If this sounds like you, go for it.Recommended reading: ""West Point: Character Leadership Education..."", Norman Thomas Remick."
1,"Cheap, works. Need memory, want it cheap? Why buy Sony and pay more? Save some money and get this one, works just like any other."
1,"Great companion to ""Rites of Passage"" It makes no sense to purchase this workbook without ""Rites of Passage"", the companion job search book by John Lucht. If you purchase this workbook on its own to try and save money, you'll find youself going back to order Rites of Passage anyway.This workbook is extremely useful at helping you put structure around following the advice dispensed in ""Rites"". It forces you to put down your thoughts using a logical and organized approach. This leads you to constructing a far superior resume and cover letter than you would have done otherwise.A very valuable tool for someone seeking a new job in the $100K+ range."
1,"Encyclopedic detail and accuracy fleshed out into stories. Bill Dahl is often consulted by other authors to check facts before they publish their works. Now we get the direct line. This book can be read as a reference work or for entertainment, as all the names and dates are seamlessly and accurately included in the real Motown story: Who made the music, from the biggest stars to unsung virtuoso session men; when, where, and, how. A must for any fan of popular music. Oh yeah, lots of great photos, too."
1,"Get this card... your digital camera will thank you! The low capacity cards that digital cameras come with today are such a joke! By getting this card, I can spend more time shooting pictures, which is perfect for getting cutting edge images on to my web site. Oh yeah, get the Flashlink reader, it will save you so much time getting those images off your digital camera and into your PC!"
1,"My 8th Girzone read...LOVE IT! After reading my 1st book by Father Girzone I knew I was hooked. Yes, His writing IS simplistic but you must consider that he is reaching out to a targeted audience. His writing is easy reading for all! Joshua is Jesus come to help the children in a religious torn community. This makes a wonderful bedtime story as well. Need help finding Jesus in your life....find Joseph Girzone 1st!!"
1,"A deeply moving sequel to Joshua. Another beautiful story. Joshua, whom we soon realize is someone very special, returns in this book to a town torn apart by religious intolerance and violence. A parable for the situation in Ireland, as well as other places, it continues to answer that question ""What would happen if Jesus returned?"" This deeply moving book will make you laugh, bring a tear to your eye, and, most importantly, give you and your heart something to ponder"
1,"Joshua & Children This is an easy reading, but profound, story of what children can do to change the prejudices of their elders."
1,Great service Truly love the writing of Joseph Girzone the series of Joshua books. You get so wrapped up in them you don't want to put them down. Great service; had in less than a week. Thanks!
1,"Great Collection, Please read review All original hits and songs.This collection has gathered together two separate music disc's and slipped them into one cardboard sleeve. The titles are:1. Absolutely the Best of the Sixties2. The Psychedelic SixtiesThese two are complete with their own artwork and disc's. Great way to get both titles if you don't already have. I already did so be careful."
1,"A Depression-era tragic romance that's quintessential Altman Keith Carradine as Bowie and Shelly Duvall as Keechie inhabit the mouldering hamlets of the 1930s south so naturally and unaffectedly that your throat tightens. This softer, dreamier Bonnie & Clyde-type tale (filmed in 1941 by Nicholas Ray as ""They Live By Night"")stands, with ""The Long Goodbye"" at the pinnacle of Robert Altman's extraordinary 1970s body of work -- even above ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" & ""Nashville."" Shot like old sepia photographs by Jean Boffety, the film boasts extraordinary supporting work by Bert Remsen, John Shuck, the pre-""Cuckoo's Nest"" Louise Fletcher, and one unforgettable little girl. Why this masterpiece is all but forgotten is baffling: it's in a royal line of American movies dealing with average men and women trying to live in the twilight between decency and crime."
1,"The Shawnee Menance This book grabs your attention from the very beginning and holds it to the ending. A must read adventure of the life & death struggle that early Americans faced in the late 1700's on our own soil. We are anxiously awaiting Roy Hays' next book in ""The Kentucky Scout Series""."
1,"My son loves this game! I wanted to say that I just bought the Rugrats game for PlayStation 2 for my 10 yr old son. Although I have not played it, he enjoys it if I sit in the family room and watch him play. I must say, every time I glance at the TV he is playing some new adventure. He is hooked to say the least! He likes it because it has the real Rugrats Nickelodeon characters and I like it because it is not obnoxiously violent like some other games. Two thumbs up from a parent!"
1,best of brenda lee brenda lee little mis dynamite what a voice she used to visit australia to packed houses and is one of the best early rock nroll artists of all the girls this c.d. has most of her hits and a few extras on it its a pity she doesnt still perform as i am sure she would still pack the house wherever she performed another great record from amazon for my well played collection. jack darby australia
1,"Pricey, but they are the best. The bulbs are a little higher in price. However they are quality and stand up to rough use..You will get what you pay for.It was easy to find on Amazon."
1,"Great value, brute force First off let me help you novices out there a little bit. Don't buy a video card because of its price, its hype, or its look, do your research! This card is excellent, it is blazingly fast, (it beats geforce 3), and it is a steal... BR>A key feature in the radeon 8500 is the programmable pixel shaders. Let me tell you a little more about them. Geforce 3, 4 and radeon 8500 all share them witht he exception with the Geforce 4 MX. The newest games will use programmable pixel shaders and if you don't have a video card that uses this, then you can't play it. The radeon beats its competition while being half the price! but be cautious because there has been driver issues with ATI and what seems to be ""cheating drivers""Pros:blazingly fastcomes from a respectable companyexcellent image qualitycons:driver issues"
1,"Never cease to AMAZE me OK! Sugar Rush was never my favorite song, but this CD has increaced my enjoyment of this song like 50000%!1. Sugar Rush- Like I said, not my favorite A*Teens song2. Sugar Rush (Earthboun's Sugarcrush mix Short)- O my gosh! Earthbound has taken a slower song and made it one of the BEST techno song i have ever heard!3. Sugar Rush (Earthbound's Sugarcrush mix Long)- As i have said in other interviews, this song only gets better as it gets longer!4. Sugar Rush (M 12 Mix)- Can you say, ""The Best remix EVER!"" It's like dance style, and the best. I can't say that enough!"
1,"The Haunting Catherine Zeta Jones and Owen Wilson star in this creepy thriller! This is one scary story of a haunted house that wont rest! Its not like House on Haunted Hill where the house locks you in, this one is just trying to scare you to death while you reside in it! Watch this movie!"
1,Good Movie This is a good movie with a star packed cast. With many twists and turns you never know what is going to happen next. Love It
1,"Genuinely worthy of five stars I have had this book on my shelf for quite a while, and finally got around to reading it after watching a documentary on Columbus on the Discivery Channel. I got inspired to overcome my intellectual laziness, and how pleased I am I did! This book really deserves its reputation as a timeless classic, and the author, a giant of maritime history, did such a fine job that I now want to read his well known biography of John Paul Jones. The text is gripping and the author's insights abound. This is a fine book."
1,Great Piedmont Blues This is a great dvd if you like acoustic blues. The camera work is great and the tunes are classic.
1,"best group ever! Take a travel through your mind, body and soul as you listen to any of the albums by the Art Ensemble of Chicago. I highly recomend that you not only check Urban Bushmen out, but as well as all the other albums. I love the music because I can hear all the love and power behind the music that the Art Ensemble of Chicago creates. It's a definate must in everyones cd collection."
1,"A Romance of a Different sort. Excellent reading! This was my introduction to George MacDonald's books. Not a soppy romance as today's authors tend to write, but even one that men would enjoy reading for leisure! As I am a GREAT fan of C.S.Lewis' and Tolkien's writings, I was fascinated to find that both these author's drew a lot of their inspiration from MacDonald's writings. I have since read ""The Princess & the Goblin"", ""The Princess & Curdie"", ""The Golden Key"", and ""The Light Princess"". My husband is currently reading Phantastes and we have also bought Lilith, still to be read. I look forward to getting ""The Marquis' Secret"" if I can, as I really would like to follow the full story!!"
1,I LOVE this CD! It's got all of the great skating prorams AND its' the full piece of music. It's not some lame edited version. Love it!
1,"THE MUTHALOAD If you have a house full of sh*tkickers, and your beer is disappearing from the fridge, and they're starting to make bathtub gin in the outhouse, and your next door neighbor is with the County Sheriff's Department, don't put this CD on the stereo. You'll never get 'em to leave. And granny will tan your hide in the woodshed with a switch.Hmmmm... ON SECOND THOUGHT, TURN THIS UP REAL LOUD, SO'S THE NEIGHBORS WILL COMPLAIN, YA'LL.THIS IS HILLBILLY GRUNGE AT IT'S FINEST."
1,"Likable music that you enjoy as much as the kids do! We bought this disc after seeing Ralph Covert open for the kid's band ""Hi-5"". The kids love these songs. The adults in the house love the ""Big Rig"" song and the ""Coffee"" song just as much as the kids do. I can respect a song that hits that close to home: ""and tonight I think I'll have a little vino"".Buy this disc for your kids, but you can enjoy it, too."
1,"Soon to be your kid's favorite As a Chicagoan, I am so proud to boast about Ralph's World. These songs are witty, catchy and have great messages. My one year old daughter just loves listening to them in the car. When Tra La La comes on, she starts singing ""la la la."" My husband cracks up at the song about the eighteen wheeler every time. The only track we don't like it is Harry's Haunted Halloween Circus, but it is easily skipped."
1,"Positively WONDERFUL! My son is 4 and just absolutely LOVES the songs on Ralph's World At the Bottom of the Sea. He sings the songs all through out the day. His favorites include: The Banana Splits, Surfin in my Imagination, and Eighteen Wheel on a Big Rig, as well as the Coffee Song. Great album and not one that grates on parental nerves either. I enjoy the songs just as much as my son does. Two thumbs up!"
1,"Excellent CD! What a fantastic cd! Our whole family enjoys it and actually sings along when it's on. Our 1 year old even sings along to the Bean Soup and Rice song ~ he loves it! We bought it after owning Happy Lemons, which is another very ""happy"" cd....I really hope he makes more."
1,"Our all-time favorite CD... I'm amazed we haven't worn the darn thing out. Our three-year-old loves this CD (better than the first, haven't yet heard the third!) and we ended up buying one for each car, and one for all our friends...guess I shoulda bought 'em in bulk! I disagree with the reviewer who said this is for 4 years and up--Laura's loved Ralph since she was six months old."
1,"Excellent follow up to Big Game Hunter I played Cabela's Big game hunter ultimate challenge, and enjoyed it very much. I immediately bought this as soon as it came out. The graphics are even better than Big game hunter, there are tracks behind the vehicles, everything has shadows, and the hunter even leaves footprints behind. The new 'deer finder' arrow is a very cool new feature and gives the game a more arcadey feel. The mission based play of this game is very cool, and the range of levels and deer are just right. The models for the hunters are improved also. Lots of great gadgets and hunting gear are available to the player including a 'predator' style heat vision and a night vision scope ! All in all a lot of fun. A little easiser than BGH but BGH was kinda hard. You can change the difficulty to suit yourself. I am so glad that activision are supporting the genre on consoles !"
1,"Excellent Service The book was in excellent condition you can't even tell that it's been used. Also, it came very fast. Excellent Service and reliability! I would definantely purchase from this person again in the future!"
1,Great stuff I really like this book. It helps me to refresh my mind in a lot of stuff I had forgot! Good book.
1,"VERY HELPFUL THIS BOOK WILL HELP PREPARE YOU FOR THE MILITARY ASVAB TESTS. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AND IT WAS HELPFUL TO MY TEENAGE BOYS,"
1,This book helped me get a good grade This book helped me achieve a 95E-95M-80G-80A. Electrical and Mechanical were part of my background so I can not attribute all knowledge gained to this book. I am now a 2W151 at Nellis AFB and am glad to be in the USAF
1,"Awesome Reviewer This book is easy reading. My daughter used this to review for her ASVAB exams - and yes, she passed with flying colors. Hightly recommended."
1,"Better than the higher rated ARCO one I was pleasantly surprised because I had begun studying from the ARCO textbook, and I noticed that the explanations for arithmetic problems were not always the easiest to understand. Dummies gave me a thorough explanation for each problem, and its vocab section seemed to have more difficult words, which prompted me to study up on that section. Vocab was the least of my concerns until I saw the words in the practice exams in THIS book as opposed to the ARCO one, and luckily, I saw some of the same words on the actual ASVAB. I didn't study the other portions of the textbook, such as autoshop, and electrical, because my focus was the General Technical score, but as far as arithmetic and verbal, this was very helpful."
1,"A Very Sweet Story This tale is sweet and heartwarming, but be forewarned that it is VERY short. I read it in only a couple minutes. It is bittersweet and touching, not a ""happy ending"" story, but worthwhile reading."
1,"Beautiful Yoga DVD As Peggy Hall takes you through each exercise, you feel energized and at the same time more at peace with yourself. I have her other DVD's and really enjoy the pace of this one, especially if you want a bit of a challenge. Beautiful scenery too!"
1,"love it I've been doing this (2) times a week, along with swimming a 1/2 mile at the public pool for the past 3 weeks and feel so good. This video really works your body in all the ways you need for strength and flexibility in surfing. I can't wait to get back in the ocean soon, when it gets a little warmer ! And take the power and flow of this yoga, to help me improve my surfing. Instead of working so hard to catch a wave and paddle out, at my age of 57:)"
1,"Good Buy The toy makes an appealing ""crinkle"" sound, and it's a little bit smaller than other similar books on the market -- so my 4-month old grandaughter can handle it a bit better. I was extremely pleased with this toy (as was the baby)!"
1,"Haunting Deer Wheeler's Deer Wan is perhaps the best showcase for his dual talents of writing and playing. The melodies are stunning and Wheeler gives his sidemen ample room to stretch. He's assembled a Who's Who from the ECM stable: Richie Beirach, John Abercrombie, Ralph Towner & others. The rich orchestrations support the tunes with perfect touches throughout.The soloing on 3/4 in the Afternoon by Wheeler is itself worth the price of the CD. Wheeler's heartfelt take on the melody floats above his accompaniment, building a head of emotion as it reaches its final statement.Anything but 'wan!' Six stars!"
1,"Good Product I bought this product earlier this year to replace my old OE foot pedal cover. The product replaced the OE with no problem. it was easy to put on the pedal. I would buy again , if needed."
1,'The Greatcoat' is the finest short story ever written I have read 3 translations of this story and I like them all for different reasons. The story is very readable and has interesting interpretations on several levels. All the friends I recommended the story to loved it.
1,Great Book! I really enjoy this book! I love the Japanese art work in it. It's one of my favorite coffee table books.
1,"A pop standard This is another one of those CDs that you pop into the stereo and know within moments that it's one you will be listening to over and over again for a long time. It feels like a staple in my music collection by the second song.The production is high quality. The songs are thoughtful, emotional and well written. The voice matches the songs beautifully with power and feeling.This CD has it all: outstanding vocals, exceptional musicianship, intelligent lyrics and gives the listener an all around wonderful feeling.(read full review at collectedsounds.com)"
1,"Beautiful Movie, Great Deal Price!!! Been looking for this DVD for years! I'm glad I finally found one at an affordable price!! I had read that in the Korean Edition, there was a scene in the movie that was blurred, when Manon is bathing, and wondered how important that would be to the movie, or my response to the story, and IT IS NOT. The scene where Manon is bathing is like 2 seconds, or less! Now, I have seen both versions and let me tell you that in the unedited version (US Edition) you still dont see much more so why pay 70 dollars for something that is not crucial and you can barely see when you can own the Korean version DVD for half the price?...So my advise is get the Korean DVD, save your money and get yourself another movie instead! Enjoy."
1,"Please re-release the DVD already! Needless to say, I love this movie (and Jean de Florette.) I would just like to say that if anyone has bought the rights to it (Criterion?), kindly release it already, since these movies have been out of print for years now. Available used from $90. Get outta here."
1,Great for the price. I'm real pleased with the results of digital images shot using the SimpleTech 256MB compactflash as storage. It's speed seems to be on a par with my Microdrives or perhaps a slight bit faster.I think it's great for the price.
1,"Fast, high performance cf card. Got it in a well packaged unit, took it out, put it in my canon s110 and start taking shots. The pictures takes 1 or 2 seconds less than my other cards(Sandisk and PNY) to write. Able to take about 250 shots in HQ mode at max resolution. Download from a card reader is also super fast. Did not do any specific test but it is at least 20 or 30 seconds faster than the other cards I have when downloading 240MB of jpegs to my PC. Again, amazon is prompt with the service and I am a happy camper. Thanks again amazon for giving us outstanding service and products."
1,"You can't beat the bang for your buck 256 MB of storage. That's like 5 million photos or something. (I haven't had the chance nor the reason to fill it up yet...) Huge storage space for a really reasonable price. You really won't need another Flash Card once you've got this one. I've had no problems at all with this. Make sure to get a good Flash Card Reader too, so you can easily transfer your photos from the Card to your hard drive."
1,Well researched and informative I found this book to be an easy read. It sufficiently covered the topics indicated with what appears to be a very objective point of view.I think that this book should be a must-read for anyone on either side of the ongoing debate.
1,"I keep returning to re-read this book This is the most LUSH book I have ever read. The content is heady like the humid air of the rainforest. It is dense with wise, human understanding, the style straddling poetry and prose. I'll often re-read a paragraph in breathless amazement of what I've just read. I must take it in small bites - as if it's simply too rich, like a steak with bernaise sauce. But each re-reading brings joy."
1,"A linguistic masterpiece Marquez has such an eloquent way with words. He canalso spin an excellent tale as evidenced by this book.But, what I enjoyed most about the book was the strengthand depth of emotion which he was able to convey throughthe written word. This book pulls you into a magical andmorbid world and holds you hostage until the ending. It isan immense book, but well worth the committment. I wouldespecially recommend it to young developing writers. Thisbook will definitely increase your artistic perspectives."
1,"A mirage of life One Hunderd Years of Solitude left me disturbed.From the happy tale of two young lovers, who carveout a new village for themselves, to the incestousaccount of the last descendants of the family,the book has the power to unnerve the reader. Thestory rambles, so that you feel that time issuspended in Mocando. And yet as charactersgrow older, you notice that time is in fact movingin a circle. The same members of the family are reborn in theArcadia family, reincarnated as the 100 years passby. The forces compelling them to act as theydo, attract and repel you at the same time. Youtry and understand the events and thecharacters, but sheer incredulity and awe asthe story unfolds, leaves you stupefied. I amnot sure I love the book like I do ""Jane Eyre""or admire it like I do ""War and Peace"".But I am powerfully attracted by it, and I'd like toread it again - if only to marvel at a magicalfamily, banished to one hunderd years of solitude.<BR"
1,"Deeply moving and extremely interesting Recently in my college English class we were discussing books that we read in high school. My professor asked us to list the ones that we hated on the board and someone listed ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"". Many people agreed with her, but I must say I do not. I absolutely loved this book! I actually was not required to read it in high school, I was learning Spanish at the time and was looking for a book with elements of Spanish culture. It is long, and drawn out, and confusing and that is what makes it amazing. After finishing it I felt like I had lived it instead of reading it. I highly recommend it. If you are required to read this book in school give it a chance before you toss it aside because it is long, or it looks boring. It takes some time in the beginning to get into it but once you do, if you go into it with an open mind, you will not regret it."
1,"A Victory of Literature A professor suggested Marquez's novel to me a few weeks ago. He has a doctorate in English (creative writing is his specialty) and suggested the novel to a graduating Master's student that felt undereducated. I found the work to be profound, enjoyable, and magical. Marquez is unparalleled in his art. Reviewing some of the previous comments, I am saddened by some of the negative comments. I encourage anyone to read the novel and to allow themselves to be pulled into Marquez's Macondo, from which you may gain new perspectives on time, age, personality, knowledge, details, worth, courage, fear, history, beauty, perception, magic, life, and love. I hope you will enjoy this novel as much as I did and praise it as long as the stars shall shine. This work is a victory of literature.-Foolish Buddha"
1,"A Sea of Latino Enchantment I have read this extraordinary book in Rabassa's excellent translation...and now wil read it in Spanish to compare....like many others, the book took several attempts on my part to make it through...but once I did, I was drawn into a world that seemed to breathe outside of town and yet not so far from our reality...here the world is seen with eyes outside of linear time. beholding things such as ice for the first time.. you will find even eferences to the Ascension with Remedios the Beauty rising upward lost beyond the reaches of the birds of memory...or the plague of insomnia, with forgetfulness and reality slipping away with the meaning of words...here you will find passions celebrated among butterflies and scorpions...it is epic, full of revolutions, passions, discoveries, magic, all flowing from the banana town whose solitude was to be wiped by the winds...."
1,"Perfection This is by far, the best novel i have ever read in my whole 29 years . . . I was dreaming through the pages of this epic story of 7 generations , , wonderful by all means."
1,"Boys with the tails of pigs This book frustrates me, but in a good way. Reading it, get this feeling of how difficult life is to understand. It's just such a great book-- it makes you laugh, it depresses you, it makes you think and it just leaves mesmerized. Go ahead and buy this book, read it, and you won't be left feeling disappointed."
1,"One of the greatest I have ever read This book makes me want to learn Spanish so I can read it in Marquez's original language.This story is an epic of a kind you've never read. No heroes, no great voyage - just a family and their town. It's a kind of Book of Genesis for the Buendia family, a family that you will know intimately by the end of the novel as if it's your own.Marquez skillfully blends the tangible realities of hard life with supernatural interludes that help make this book one of the most beautifully poetic that I've ever read. It's the kind of book that when you finish - incidentally having one of the most perfect endings put to paper - you will sit back and think about it for a while. You will walk the hallways of the Buendia house long after you finish this book and swear that you've known the many people that lived and died there. And you will miss them.This book is a masterpiece. Put this first on your list."
1,"Masterpiece This is my favorite novel by some distance. The novel is simultaneously the story of several generations of an extended family and the story of the entire human race from the beginning of history. It is full of magic not only in the sense that magical things happen, but also in its glowing prose and deeply sympathetic portrayals of its characters. The repetition and near-repetitions of names over the generations invite the reader to conflate information about different characters, demonstrating the interconnectedness of the family members. Maybe it doesn't matter if we keep their identities straight, and maybe we're not even supposed to. Let the plot swirl and let Marquez work his magic. Then step outside and notice how the world shimmers and glows."
1,"Beautiful and stunning fiction This is the best book I've read since The Triumph and the Glory. The quality of the writing is just superb. The characters so unrelentingly vivid they become as familiar as family. A very good book, I highly recommend it and cam just about guarantee that you will like it. Five stars."
1,"You will be amazed This is one of those books that you will make all of your friends read once you have experienced its magic. It will take your through a hundred years of deaths, births, tragedies, and joys of a cursed family. And the best part is the ending - a conclusion that will leave you breathless!"
1,"Not easy to read, but worth it It's a sophisticated read with MANY subplots (most of which include characters with the same name). It can be confusing at times, but it's a good book once you learn each character. I read this book 5 times since 2008 and each time I read it, I discover something new. Don't expect a book you can just read once and move on with your life. It's not that simple."
1,"Monumental, Mesmerizing! Most likely the greatest epic I have ever read. The story grips you, pulls you in, and commands 100% of your concentration. Marquez deserves two Nobel Prizes for this tale."
1,Could be the best Novel ever written This book blew my mind. I can be a bit slow and confusing (there are many characters with the same of very similar names) but the writing is of a caliber seldom seen. The story is intense and the people stick with you for years!
1,"A Very Important Novel One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read ( and I have read thousands).Marquez is a giant. His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece."
1,great book This book captivates you from beginning to end. I fell in love with the characters and enjoyed the colorful lives of each one. The symbolism and translation make this book one of a kind.
1,"MUST READ! This is a book that comes but once in a lifetime. Everyone should read it. It is an interesting journey that will allow your mind and senses to places they've never been before. Don't be scared by its number of pages, it is an adventure one should undergo at least once."
1,"One of the best novels of the past 100 years Marquez creates a unique fictional world, a town called Macondo in the middle of the South American jungle.The language is lush, the characters unique. Marquez finally trusts the reader to accept fantasy and reality as equal partners in an ongoing unfolding of life.This is the only novel I've read four times. It works like magic, like great wine, like a wonderful piece of music."
1,"The First Hundred Pages of ""Solitude."" I have ony read the first 100 pages of this book and the adjective ""engrossing"" is but an understatement. From the moment the family patriarch becomes obsessed with the magnets and alchemy equipment of the gypsies to the marriage of Rebeca, this literary trip has so far been an odysseey which leaves most everybody's family trees for wanting.Aside from the title theme of desolation is the less obvious but equally salient theme of discovery and its relationship to the science/magic dichotomy (I guess that this is the essence of this so-called ""magical realism"" phenomenon). Rarely has this subject matter been tackled with such perceptiveness and aesthetic. Though I have only read the beginning, I find myself wishing that the book were even longer than it already is.Thank you, Gabriel Garcia Marquez!"
1,"Magical Realism at its best I guess that is where this book is usually categorized in. Apparently, Gabriel Garcia Marquez popularized the genre. I loved the book and would put it in the top five of my list. There are people who I've talked to that thinks it was confusing or complicated. That was not the case for me. It's true that there were many characters (and it does not help that a lot of them are named similarly). But, I think each of them is distinct and was developed very well. The book is not about the town of Macondo...it's about the people who lived there. And, you will be able to relate to the book because of its very human characters set in an environment that is often very real but occasionally eerily surreal. That's magical realism for you."
1,"The best book ever One Hundred .... was the first book by GarcÃ­a Marquez I read, since then I have read all his work, but I will never be so impressed by a book as I was with this one, the moment I finished it, I began again. The last pages got me so much that I kept doing as Aureliano was doing at the moment, trying to skip some bits to reach the end and find out what was the mistery of the book. Is a masterpice that everyone should read at least three times. It might not be the most beautiful one I've ever read, that is for sure ' Love in the times of cholera', but it is, for sure, the most powerfull."
1,"Use of language I was surprised at how little was lost in the translation of this book. Garcia writes this novel as if it were poetry, he has a wonderful use of language that seems to braid mystical as well as humurous aspects into his writing. This is a novel that I won't forget and recommend readily."
1,"Beyond most.... This book seems to move beyond so many other books not only in its message, but also in the beauty of description. The intricacy and almost surrealism of the plot draws the reader in so intently its exhilarating. Also, the tone is calming as you learn of the Buendia family and their history. You will come away from this book with a sharper eye for the magical aspects of everyday life, as well as a few hours of absolute escape and bliss. Read it. You're not likely to regret it!"
1,"An exprience that lives with you for the rest of your life I read this book many many years ago when I was 14. I did not read it in English or Spanish. At the time I didn't know either one. I read it in Persian, but that did not diminish the effect it had on me at all. I guess the translation must have been good. I must have read the book some 12 times over the period of that year. And still, every once in while as I am driving my car, a passage from the book comes to my mind and takes me back to the magic that it was. I do not want to read this book again. I don't think that after getting accustomed to the reality of life around me my heart can handle such surge of emotions as it did then. If you haven't read it though, and you are able to pull yourself back to reality after finishing the book, I strongly recommend it."
1,"Wow Magic realism plus rich, beautiful latin culture combines to make a beautiful novel of a town's history. So many wonderfully impossible things happen that this was just a treat to read, even during the heart wrenching moments. I think it's one of the riskier books for Oprah's club, but I can't wait to see what people say. Splendid!"
1,"Keep trying to read this if at first you put it down My first couple of tries at reading this book didn't go very far. I never made it beyond the first chapter. Then on a visit to Colombia I was determined to read this book. I kept at it. Before long I was totally absorbed into the story, which is truly fascinating and amazing. Now I don't know why I could not get into it on my earlier attempts. I'm so glad that I persisted. So, the book that I originally couldn't get into, finally became one of my favorite novels."
1,"Stunning literary masterpeice This is a stunning literary masterpiece. It takes some patience to get into but once you are involved in the story, it is difficult to put down. God, after I finished reading the book it felt like I went into shock. The prose is gorgeous but it is the larger story, stories within stories, and metaphors that are so striking. Will stay with me for the rest of my life."
1,"Magical and All Encompassing A few writers in each generation are gifted with such writing talent that they create books that make you catch your breath. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of those writers. His gift with prose, the way he uses language, his storytelling ability is staggering. This is an engrossing read from the very first sentence. You will be captivated by the magical world that has been created and the all too human characters that populate the story.For reading pleasure, I would recommend the Harper Perennial Modern Classics edition of this book, which has those very convenient flaps on the front and back covers that make perfect bookmarks to save your page when you do manage to put the book down!"
1,"U will never read anything like it I read One Hudred Years of SOlitude like 6 times over the years, and it still holds its magic and atmosphyre. Just an unbelievable classic. It feels weary and long at moments, also distracting at moments but its originality and magical ventures arise and fill the soul. Must have."
1,"Amazing! This is absolutely the most wonderful book I've ever read. I read more than one book every week, so what can I say!! A must read, which you will not want to put down. There's so much to this than just the story.. Beautifully written and wonderously haphazard presentation!"
1,"Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez greatest novel This is the novel that made the author succeed and it's obvious why. A story which seems it's never going to finish, has an incredible ending (I read the last page like a hundred times already). A personal advise would be to get a chart of the family tree, otherwise you may not enjoy it as I have"
1,"Vacation from reality Garcia-Marquez is my favorite autor and ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" is a wonderful book, one that should be read by every intelligent reader. He deftly suspends the laws of reality and takes you to a world that will leave you with the feeling that you have just returned from a rejuvenating vacation. This book is not to be missed. The writing is at once mystical and cathartic, and it will leave you breathless."
1,"Very creative, very imaginative No wonder this book has become an instant classic. It is. This is probably the best translated book that I've ever read. Very confusing, at first, but very imaginative. More of a fantasy than anything else, really. Much better the second time through. I loved the characters and the setting!"
1,"100 Years of Solitude. The standard for South American Lit. 100 Years of Solitude is a must-read for anyone intrested inmagical realism and the beauty of South American literature.It is simply the standard by which all other Latin AmericanNovels will be judged, but putting aside the lofty complimentsfor a moment, 100 Years of Solitude is a necessary journeyfor any reader engaged in the human struggle and the cycle oflife.The novel's lyricism is as simple as a journey down a calm river, yetas complex as the idea of gravity pulling that water down theriver. It is this lyricism that sets Gabriel Garcia Marquezapart from the other story tellers of his time--and a storyteller is exactly what Marquez is, a story teller of grandproportions, that will keep you sitting at the fire with himuntil his epic story is complete."
1,"OmniMount UCL-LP Single Arm Cantilever Mount (fits 32""- 45"" flat panels) I wanted to locate my flat panel in a difficult location. Seeing this item gave me hope that I could finally accomplish this. Although quite expensive, the price seemed reasonable compared to what was available in local stores and their even higher prices.My unit I own a 46"" flat panel, but decided to take a chance that this item would be adequate. Ordered the item and waited with baited breath. Without any inquiry or such, the mount arrived promptly as advertised. Much to my surprise, the company and up sized my order, I can only assume because of availability, to the next size.It was constructed well beyond my expectations and installed easily. The flat panel is in its new location and given me much more flexiblity with the arranging of my living room.By the way, I don't have any doubt that if they had sent exactly the item I'd order that is would have worked out just as well also."
1,"Great! Being very new to the Atlanta area, I needed some help finding my way around and knowing where to shop for what. This book eased my transition, and more than paid for itself."
1,"Easy to understand advice about diabetes Type 2 diabetes is a national epidemic. Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are necessary to prevent complications (heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, blindness) in those with Type 2 diabetes and prevent the disease from occurring in those at high risk. Medical advice regarding diet often leaves patients confused and therefore unable to follow their advice. Kristine Napier defines Type II diabetes and the steps needed to control this disease in a way that is easy to understand. She provides advice and examples to help the reader incorporate her guidelines into their everyday life. Her 28 day guide of menus will help those get started and as always, Kris's recipes are easy to follow and delicious.

1,"More Morpork Night Watch Adventures! I love the Night Watch novels, I am reading the third at the moment, I can't stop! They are funny and surprising and introduce concepts from our world in such a way that parodies and makes a comment on society same time. This book has Leonard of Quirm (Discworld's thinly veiled version of Da Vinci) inventing a dangerous device which is ""running"" loose on the citizens of Ankh Morpork. A mystery for Captain Vimes and the Night Watch - Carrot, Colon, Nobby and the new recruits to solve - romance, intrigue and hilarity abound, I want more! Thank you amazon kindle for letting me download them instantly, this makes me very happy."
1,Max s Keeble s big move I jut enjoy this movie the boy that plays robe the actor is Josh Peck from Drake and Josh show. In my dvd box it had a big picture.

1,"Future Sound Of London, The - Accelerator Accelerator. If you don't have this album, you don't know anything about electronic music. It's a classic through-and-through. Although it may sound slightly dated, it still stands head-and-shoulders above most techno albums today. With impressive range, from the moody ""While Others Cry"" and the trance-forerunner ""Calcium"" to the nu-industrial of ""Central Industrial"" and the storming ""Moscow,"" Accelerator still is a great listen. This re-release also includes 10 mixes of ""Papua New Guinea,"" a title that should inspire devotion among all fans of electronic music. Blue States does its usual downtempo magic on the track, while Simian makes it sound like the carnival from hell. Hybrid (of course) adds some hard breaks, while Satoshi Tomiie makes some dark house. Some good mixes, but do they hold up to the original? What do you think the answer is?"
1,"The Canterbury Tales, Reviewed by Philip Moore Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's ""Canterbury Tales"", a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are ""The Knight's Tale"", ""The Wife of Bath's Tale"", ""The Miller's Tale"", ""The Reeve's Tale"", and ""The Parson's Tale"". Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor. The latter due impart to the corruption within the clergy and the condition of the people from their suffering of drought, famine, and disease. Chaucer's work brought to light a new age of literature full of wit, comedy, and daily life."
1,"A wondeful set of tales which define an era Clearly, during Chaucer's time, the english language was looked down on as inderior by the other languages of Europe. The Canterbury tales were important because of the use of the venacular language of england. It represents our first look into our language."
1,"The Hobo Philosopher I suppose that any freshman college student has read some of these Tales. I had a professor who read a few of them to us in the Olde English. It was really fun and you really got a grasp of where the English language was coming from - and poetry.I went on from my English class and read the whole works. They are good, classic short stories. You are really going back to the basics here. The stories are all easy to read and are about the everyday type people and their everyday lives. You get classic English literature, history, short story writing techniques, and the roots of the English language all in one medium sized book. Can't beat it. It's a bargain.Richard EdwardNoble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:""A Summer with Charlie"""
1,"Excellent The first story ""The Knight's Tale"" is on par with ""Aucassin and Nicolette"" (Andrew Lang), and The Friendship of ""Amis and Amile"" (Old French Romances, William Morris, which can usually be bought through Alibris as a used book put out by (...)) In my own opinion ""The Knight's Tale"" is the only reason to purchase or read The Canterbury Tales. It is unmatched if heard on audio book,Blackstone Audiobook, unabridged, read by Fred Williams, ISBN: 0-7861-2239-0.(I purchased mine at audio books on cassette.)"
1,great book Well written and beautifully illustrated. A good introduction to Chaucer for young and old. A very good winter read indeed..
1,"A Fine Edition of A Brilliant Play *****Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"" are timeless. The tales (mostly in verse, although some are in prose) are told as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from Southwark to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. These stories paint pictures of medieval life, theology, and culture.And this edition is most preferable to me. I highly recommend it!*****"
1,"Magnificent This movie is excellent on its own, but absolutely extraordinary when paired with its sequel, Manon of the Spring. I highly reccomend the two as a pair to anyone considering either."
1,"EXCELLENT FILM/A MUST SEE IN ANSWER TO THE FIRST REVIEW ABOUT THIS MOVIE, MOST PEOPLE (IN THE UNITED STATES) ARE REALLY IGNORANT OF WHAT GOOD FILMS ARE ALL ABOUT. THEY ARE BLINDED BY TODAY'S ""HOLLYWOOD"" INDUSTRY WHICH IS LESS THAN PERFECT, TO SAY THE LEAST...EVERYONE...: DO YOURSELFS A FAVOR: START WATCHING MORE FOREIGN FILMS..., MOST OF THEM ARE NOT PRETENTIOUS, NOT SHALLOW, NOT HOLLYWOOD..., EVERYONE MIGHT LEARN A THING OR TWO.GREAT FILM, FULL OF GOOD CONTENT AND MEANING!!!"
1,"A must-see movie Truly, this is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is a realistic story that has made it possible for me to see how one thinks and how one acts in life, and how everything has its reason in the end. Highly recommended movie, Cheers, Branko Miros"
1,"Tears for the Masses This book made me cry for alot of reasons. But mostly for the humanity. It the dozens of books that I have read on Titanic, none compares to this one. I liked the author to know that I hate him for it and love him for it just the same. He ruined my day with the harsh reality and changed my life with it's inspiration. Thomas Andrews would be amazed. Oh yes, he would be utterly amazed. -Jaime N. Rinne/Titanic Historian"
1,"Enlightening and spell binding I read Titanic in the early part of 1997. I found the book fascinating, especially to one who knew very little of the disaster and the uncovering of the broken ship. I have recommended the book as a must read to many of my friends. Skip the movie and read the book!"
1,"a pleasant reminder of the British Invasion Listeners of this cd will be reminded that, in the era of just three guitars and a drummer, the British Invasion provided a pleasant change from American sounds in the early 1960s. The sound quality of this cd is remarkable. On ""Don't Throw Your Love Away"" you can actually hear someone in the studio rustling some papers at the very start of the song. The opening drum riff on ""Needles and Pins"" will stir the blood of any Mersey listener. This album is nothing but pop....but pure, straight and beautiful pop it is with jingle jangle guitars and high harmonies covering songs that strongly hint of a lost era of innocence. Either you love this stuff ...or you don't!"
1,"Who Said Coyotes Weren't Interesting? Classic genre - underdog trying to make her dreams come true.. A sexy story that surprising ends well..Violet moves to the big city in the hopes of taking her writing career to the next level.. Reality check has her desperate for work in a city where no one ever listens..Coyote Ugly - possibly the sexiest club man has ever seen (a modern day Moulin Rouge) - Enter the young - innocent -inexperienced Violet.. Will she fit into the world of the ""Coyotes""??..Cameo appearence by country singing sensation LeAnn Rimes - Little unknown fact - LeAnn provided all the vocals performances for Violet.. Piper apparently can't sing - but boy can she act!5 Stars.. :D .. An Excellent Sexy movie.. :D"
1,"Coyote Ugly ROCKS!!!! I thought that Coyote Ugly was an awesome movie. Piper Perabo has great talent and should be given or sought out for more roles. This movie is a definite must see, as well as, a must have. The music for the movie was right on, although I would have loved to hear Piper's voice on more of the songs. She is definite STAR material... :-)"
1,"Love it I love this movie, we had it on VHS and then our VHS player died so had to replace it with this. Works great."
1,"gift for husband my husband loves this movie, so I bought it for him as a christmas present to add to his dvd collection"
1,"CoYoTe UgLy MoViE rEviEw this is definitely more of a chick flick than a guy movie! in all honesty though, its a GREAT movie. although geared more towards younger girls, i'm sure anyone could enjoy this movie! its just an all out great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone!"
1,Great Movie Coyote Ugly may not be the ideal family movie but it is excellent. it tells the story of young female musician whose only dream is to have someone like Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey sing her songs. After moving to New York on her own she is forced to find work in order to remain living in her apartment. She meets up with the Coyotes and finally finds her dreams through them. Excellent movie with a great cast.
1,"Nice show (Recommended) The strengths of this DVD are : 1) A nice storyline which shows how a country girl tries to survive in NY. 2) Nice music eg. Can't fight the moonlight, etc. throughout the show. 3) Girl-Appeal esp. the innocence of Piper Perabo and the sensuality of the coyotes. 4) Romance with a nice ending :) 5) various commentaries on the movie 6) music video of 'can't fight the moonlight'"
1,"GREAT! I thought that this was going to be a really stupid movie of only bar dancing scenes, but I was wrong there were bar dancing scenes but they also tried to put a story."
1,Great Movie I thought that this movie was very good and the girls very hotter than John Goodman in the Mojave Desert. Bruckheimer did a great job and the story line is really good
1,"It's Entertainment, Folks I am so tired of reading reviews from people who think every movie should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. This is one of the most entertaining films my wife and I have seen in a long time, and none of the people involved with its production have anything to apologize for. It unquestionably delivers exactly what Bruckheimer, et al intended, and it does not pretend to be anything else. If I wanted something artistic or meaningful, I would have looked for word ""Miramax"" on the outside of the box - a studio that has made many wonderful movies, but not the type of high impact, SIMPLE fun Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have delivered so well. Sometimes, it's just what the doctor ordered.Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, break out the popcorn, have a few drinks, and enjoy..."
1,Great movie to watch I can watch this over and over again. I had to wait for it to come on tv until I finally bought it
1,"I can't get enough of this 'garbage' Another collection of the hypnotic Shirley Manson tunes. This album is equally entrancing and rocking. I didn't think they could top there 1st cd but they clearly are exceptional musicians. If your a Shirley Manson fan (lover), you've got to get Version 2.0. She will take you away....(again)."
1,"Sometimes an album just clicks It sounds right, is the best way to say this. Sometimes an album just clicks, tracks in order, everything moving smoothly together. Such is the sound of VERSION 2.0, a big, liquid album with a song for every mood. Here is a group that enjoys playing together -- see them in concert; they have a good time -- and they spend the album playing with us, doing bleak, doing frantic, doing downright catty. Showing off? They have a right to. This is very good stuff."
1,"Excellent, excellent! When I read professional music critics' reviews about Version 2.0, I read these super technical descriptions and criticisms of the album which honestly, is a waste of time. Why don't they say the truth without further hassle? This album is excellent from the first track to the last. For even those who aren't familiar with Garbage or their first album but just want to rock, this is a great choice. It's excellent--EXCELLENT!"
1,Can't get better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Push It- makes the listener wonder what the heck she's talking about.Special-Interesting song about liking but now hating.Hammering in my Head-A fast techno song.There's not one bad song on this album and I would tell about other songs but... Anyways you cant go wrong!
1,"One of the best albums of 1998 Garbage returned in '98 with their excellent sophmore album. VERSION 2.0 is so slick, you'll slip on it. Shirley Manson [lead vocals and songwriter] vamps every song for all it's worth. She's slick, sly, and clever in every delivery. VERSION 2.0 is groove heavy with more electroica than their debut back in '95. Garbage became more of a pop band with this album. The hooks and melodies are awesome. Each track is seemless, timeless, pop mixed with rock and electronic influences. VERSION 2.0 is an improvement from their debut. Shirley's voicals are exellent. It's sexy and it goes very well with this awesome album."
1,"version 2.0-newer, faster, better after the fanstatic acclaimed debut album, garbage had a rough second album to make.well, version 2.0 is the perfect second album. More pop-electronic and yet with the same dark obscure feeling the first album had.shirley's voice is more adaptaded to the songs and they seem to be more a band than they used to. one of garbage's best caracteristics is that all musics are very good. here you can't say that one or two songs are below the average, because they're all excellent. please listen to this album, that confirms that garbage are one of the best (or why not, the best!) band around!"
1,garbage ROCK! This is my first garbage CD and I really enjoy it. The words are very powerfull and Shirley Manson's voice is amazing! I highly recommend this CD.
1,"Perfect! Well written! I saw Garbage in concert at The Night 89x Stole X-Mas in Detroit, and they were by far the best group there. This album is excellent. A definate buy!"
1,"warning: this CD is extremely addictive All I had ever heard of Garbage were a couple of their music videos until my friends persuaded me to buy this CD. Now I listen to it at least twice a week. I usually go for music with lighter lyrics, but I've fallen head-over-heels in love with all these songs, even ""Medication"". As much as I love the whole CD, I do have favorites: I listen to ""When I Grow Up"" and ""Hammering in My Head"" so much I'm bound to wear the CD out!"
1,"Better than words can describe Garbage has no doubt put out a kickass sophomore album!! I'm completely hooked on the song ""You Look So Fine""-it takes me to a different world. Special also is one of the greatest singles out there right now! I got it for Christmas and haven't hardly gotten through a day without listening to it. Once you hear Shirley's voice, there's no turning back, and if you do than there is something wrong with you! I enjoyed this album just as much as their first, but i appreciate this one on a whole different level. There's no trash involved with this garbage. Aside from Pink Floyd, there is no better!!! YOU HAVE GOT TO BUY IT!!!"
1,"One of the few cd's that you can just let play through Garbage has released one of the few cd's that can just play through, with every song having a certain flavor and enjoyability. Songs on this album range from dark and stormy (push it) to fast paced rock (when i grow up) and each has a pleasent variety. The songs lyrics are deep and meaningfull, and are easy to relate to, in my opion, version 2.0 is a groundbreaking and interesting album, that is sure to delight many a wide audiance."
1,"Great CD! I loved the first CD, but was doubtful about the 2cnd, since I'm used to the first CD being the better one. (Alanis Morissette) I got a pleasant surpise, since this one is just as sweet as the first one!!!"
1,"A great album There is no competition...this is my undisputed, absolute favorite CD (since the last release from Garbage). Version 2.0 is addicting, from the lively (and occasionally erratic)techno beats to Shirley Manson's breathy, seductive verbal catharsis (laser recodred for our enjoyment!), it leaves you yearning for more. This CD takes a person on a sort of emotional roller coaster. From ""Temptation Waits"", a celebration of dependance and obsession to ""You look so fine"" a melancholy longing for ""ever after"" (i.e. riding of into sun sets and such...) It's a trip and I fully endorse it (regardless of my insignificance). BUY IT ALREADY!"
1,Love this CD! I have loved Garbage for a long time now... and I have her first two CD's and I am so excited that she's come out with another one. Shirley is AWESOME! I love her voice.. and I don't believe that anyone else has a voice like hers. Garbage ROCKS!!
1,"You gotta love garbage After missing theirr recent Toronto concert at the phoenix (sold out in 20 minutes!), and reading reviews, I had to buy this CD. So I did... I liked the first album but I LOVE version 2.0. Everything from the clever Album title to the amazing mix of wonderful songs made me fall in love with garbage for real!!!If you're at all unsure about garbage, just buy this CD and see what happens.... But don't forget to get your concert tickets as soon as they go on sale!"
1,"Good I had never heard Garbage before I listened to Version 2.0 at a listening kiosk at Tower Records, but I was immediately hooked. It's like a modernized Pretenders on steroids. I'd definitely recommend it. END"
1,"So far, the best cd this year Garbage's higly anticipated second cd three years after their first is a must have for all Garbage fans. It has a faster and more up-beat tempo. Garbage has been nominated 8 times for the video to their great song, ""Push It."" I'm sure that they'll when all 8. I highly recommend this cd."
1,"woo! This album is a classic. I've had this CD for probably over a year now, and I *still* listen to it often.One of the things that makes this album so amazing is that there are no ""duds"". Every track seems to work and fit together. The amount of feeling Shirley Manson throws into the songs is amazing, and the melodies seem to only add on to that.Buy it. This is one of those albums that sucks you in from the first track, and doesn't let go. In fact, when you're finished listening to it, you'll want to play the whole thing over. :)"
1,"Huge Garbage fan anyway... ..but this is my go-to album when I want a perk-me-up and to listen to the best. So many great songs on this one. Love ""When I Grow Up"", ""Push It"", The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"" and ""You Look So Fine"". Music now just doesn't compare. Which is why I'm excited about the whispers of a new album this coming year. Can't wait."
1,"Undoubtedly THE BEST Garbage Album thus far! This is a great album by Garbage! I love the modern and hip beat of ""Special."""
1,"New Type of Funk new and exciting sound, very nifty beat. I really like this one folks, it has a new type of funk that sets it aside from all imatators. If you buy just one cd this year let it be this one, it all starts here."
1,"I have both Garbage CD's, and this is the best one I must admit that i don't care as much for the first Garbage CD as I do Version 2.0. This is by far my favorite CD. I like it so much that I listen to it all the time. I know the whole CD by heart(almost). My favorite songs on this album are Temptation Waits, I Think I'm Paranoid, Push It, and Wicked Ways. It realllllyyyyy RRRRROOOOOOCKSSSSS!!!!!!!"
1,"Amazing CD I had just heard a little bit of the song ""Push It"" and I had to run out and buy the CD, the CD has so much into it that now anything that Garbage has out, I have to find and listen to it. I especially like the song, ""The trick is to keep breathing"" Shirley Manson's voice is amazing, I can't think of any other way to put it. I recomment this CD totally."
1,"Garbage - The world's coolest pop group I just started listening to garbage about a month ago. Their latest album Version 2.0 is fantastic! The guitar work along with Shirley Manson's distinctive style of singing ( evident in Temptation waits , I think I'm paranoid , When I grow up, Push it ,You look so fine) is just too good. They are a class apart from all the stale pop groups around us . Garbage, to me is God!"
1,"great i lvoe garbage, every song on their albums are so good you can just play the whole cd straight. and shirley manson is so hot and butch vig si so cool"
1,"""Version 2.0"" is the greatest! Shirley Manson and Co. has done it again! The techno music combined with the raw but truthful lyrics makes this CD one of the best I've listened to. With the combination of slow and fast, moody and light, Version 2.0 shows Shirley Manson's talent as never seen before. The pulsing music stays in your head for hours and you can totally relate to some of the lyrics. This is without a doubt one of my favorite CD's!"
1,"First One's Better Not taking away from this album which is absolutley awesome but i missed the angry edge to shirley's voice, this album was pop where the first one was rock but still absolutley rocks, shoulda won da grammy"
1,most awesome CD ever recorded!!!! wow my friend got me started on garbage a few months ago and that was the start of another big garbage fan!!!this band kicks arse!!!!!!thank you Annie!!!!
1,"Great Graphics Card! After buying a new Pentium 4 system, I was tight for cash. Luckily enough I managed to come upon the Radeon 7000. It has one of the best image qualities I've seen and its performance isn't too bad either."
1,"A good season I've watched One Tree Hill since the first episode the first season. I have to say that I'm not as passionate about the show as I used to be; the characters Lucas and Peyton left and I thought that would ruin the show. However, that just lead to the show growing and getting to know smaller characters more. Season seven of One Tree Hill is amazing and the actors/actresses are great. It's a good show and the dvd allows for episodes to be watched without commercials. It's also the smallest and most compact dvd case out of all of the seasons (I have all 7). I would recommend this item."
1,"Better than expected When I found out that Lucas and Peyton were off the show, I was very disappointed.I did not think they would be able to coninue the show well without those 2 characters. But, with the new characters, the show is still as amazing as its always been. Very entertaining season, I could not stop watching it!"
1,Very pleased No problems with order! Received item within time frame. Haven't played the DVDs yet but they are new in packaging so any problems with DVD would not be seller fault.
1,"great flag-waving action movie This movie is by far one of my favorites but you can't take it seriously. In the movie, Chuck's protege ""Deke Slater"" nabs the terrorist leader Fidal Rasheed by sky-diving out of a stealth fighter over Afganistan and hang-gliding from southern Afganistan to the Indian Ocean in 5 minutes, where a nuclear submarine comes out of nowhere to rescue him. Chuck Norris seems to have forgotten that Afganistan is a landlocked country! The flag-waving (for both America and the great state of Texas) is hilarious. And Chuck Norris tries to take on a Yoda figure role by teaching Deke about using the ""mind's eye"" to sense his opponents and do things ""never thought humanly possible""."
1,"Don't miss this one! One of the last great films of that remarkable era of film-making--the 1970's--""Julia"" stands the test of time as a testament to heroism in drastic times of collusion much like our own. We know the bad guys but think we are too weak to stop them--to make a difference--but the story of ""Julia"" gives us strength to at least try. I was about to say the films of today do not have this power, but after experiencing the power of some of this year's extraordinary films like ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Syrianna"" I find hope in the modern arena. Keep the faith."
1,"Julia DVD Excellent movie about two female friends chronicled from childhood through adulthood. I highly recommend this film. As for the seller of this DVD, I received this item very quickly and was very pleased with the condition. I would definitely purchase from this Seller again."
1,"One of the BEST films from the 70's I must have seen ""Julia "" over 20 times,and I never get tired of it.Fonda and Redgrave are great,along with Jason Robards.Its amazing this is a true story about a period in Lilian Hellman's life,and what a heroic task she did for her friend,Julia.If you have never seen this movie,please make it a point to, about a time in our history we should never forget."
1,"Julia A wistful, compelling story about the power of female bonds and friendship. Fonda has never been better, Redgrave is luminous as the idealistic Julia, and Jason Robards conveys a worn assuredness as Hellman's husband, writer Dashiell Hammett. Zinnemann's handling of period detail in 1930s New York and Berlin is exquisite, and the film rightfully earned 11 Oscar nominations. A personal favorite."
1,"Wonderful flow What a great video! I just received it and went through the routine. The flow was wonderful. (I am not a surfer, have never surfed, I was just looking for a good video, and everybody recommended this to me.) But maybe now I'll be surfing by summer!"
1,performed as hoped The plug was exactly what I needed.We used it to blow out the line in winterizing our RV.and it worked.
1,Works very well This will keep my pipes from freezing and it isn't very expensive. I plan to use it at home and on vacation property. Buy it. It can be adapted to blow out at hose bib connections too. It will save on repairs.
1,"This is a psychological masterpiece. I am simply shocked that this novel, which is perhaps the best piece of American fiction I have ever read, is out of stock. It draws a far more realistic and detailed portrait of the ""hard boiled detective"" that so many other writers have simply slapped together, then lets us watch, with first fascination, then horror, as he slowly unravels. Even the minor characters are better drawn then they would be in a trilogy all their own, and the entire work shimmers with energy and power. This is a book that demands republishing."
1,"great book, hopefully wont need it I bought this book more for a just in case kind of need. I am not filing bankruptcy but if I ever need to then the book contains all the helpful information that someone would need. It has great examples and definitions."
1,"A crazy adventure Crewel Lye is about the journey of Jordan the Barbarian. Like all Xanth books, this one is comical and full of puns. Since Jordan's talent is full regeneration, it adds an interesting viewpoint through the eyes of a person who doesn't care if he gets killed(he'll just come back). I think that anyone who reads the Xanth series should definitely read this one."
1,Excellent fantsy My first Piers Anthony book. I can hardly wait for each of the Xanth books to appear.Best fantsy writer.
1,An unbiased history One of the best books you will find on the Army Air Force prior to and during World War II. This is one of the few authors that doesn't impose his opinions on the reader. He goes out of his way to give both sides of an issue or a personality. Even such controversial figures as Britain's Bernard Montgomery or our own Douglas MacArthur are treated with an even-handedness that is all too rare. Very entertaining and very informative.
1,"Ok massager I bought this foot massager because I needed a footrest for my ijoy100 massage chair. I used it couple times after a long walk in the mall,and it soothed my aching legs. My sister bought it two years ago, and she said it improved the circulation on her legs."
1,"IT ""s GREAT ( realy) hey i love it but im an old horror movie fan , if you lov the clissic horrors you'll lov this , it realy is great , i love it ,"
1,"Highly recommend :) I love this book because it allowed me to see just how much I have been limiting myself. I enjoyed learning the techniques to achieving your visualizations. The author makes valid points and talked about many specific subjects that I have been questioning recently and even experiencing, so that has helped me directly address the issues. Overall, I'd hiiighly recommend"
1,"Thank you for this book Just received this book today 11/23/11, will get to reading it over the holiday, since school is closed and I need something interesting to read. The notes in the book will help me to decide on new ideas for the coming year. Thanks."
1,Secrets of Native American herbal Remedies A very good comprhreshive book. It has a lot of common problems that you may come across with. A very good reference.
1,"Set me free! This will with no noubt be one of the classics. It's just perfect. The baseline is an sultry invitation to dance. Kylies gentle vocals do right to those innovative lyrics. ""There's a dark secret in me don't keep locked in your heart. Set me free!"" What can one do but dance to trance as long as this song stays on. The original verison needs nothing more. It's only just so short. And that la-la-la will go on forever!More eighties retro this one. The follow up ""In your eyes"" has more true disco flair."
1,"Kylie returns Years after her hit in the US (and with a steadily growing career in Europe and else where in the world) Kylie Minogue returns to the airwaves with a dance hit that is catchy and hypnotic. At first I was only slightly interested in this tune but the more I heard it, the more I like it. I'm looking foward to the entire cd and I hope it is filled with great dance songs like this one."
1,"It's Never Too Late to Review This Single. As someone who's been following Kylie since her late 1980s, Stock Aitken Waterman years, I was one happy camper when I learned that ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" blasted into the US Top Ten. After a disastrous cover of ""The Locomotion,"" Kylie quickly disappeared from the American spotlight while she attained superstardom in the UK. Over the years, she tried to win American audiences back, but with no such luck. Then, years later, came this single, a hypnotic slice of disco minimalism with its undeniable ""la la la"" hook. Having topped the charts in the UK and in a few other countries, it was poised for similar success stateside. After a long absence, we Americans should be so lucky that we have Kylie back ruling the charts again. ""I Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" is one of the best and most memorable singles of this, or any other, year."
1,"Oh...Oh....OH!!!!! Oh!!!! YEAH!! Kylie you did it again!!!!!!!!! Kylie Minogue is so freakin' HOT that everytime i see her i wanna get naked and ""Can't get you out of my head"" is so darn sexy.It's got a pulsating strutting groove that gets your blood boiling and makes you wanna get on the dance floor and do your thang.,This is primo pop dressed up in a super dance groove and it will get any party cookin guaranteed.Personally i recommend getting the entire ""Fever"" album which will have you on the floor panting for air from all of it's wet and juicy musical savage foreplay.OUCH!Tell Kylie you want the fever and prepare yourself to be cooked to a crisp with Kylie's hot sexy grooves."
1,"One of a Kind I had to read a book for a book report due in a week. I was beginning to feel hopeless before I stumbled onto this in the library. Langston Hughes is an amazing Writer and poet. This was the first of his novels that I have read and I think it couldn't have been more perfect. This book is so rich in its characters and Hughes shows no mercy in telling of the bittersweet culture that engulfs the world of Sandy and his family. After reading this book, the beauty of this people was more evident than ever before. With words that are lovely and flowing and thoughts that are deep and abundant, Hughes is a person whom I wish was still with us."
1,"Putting in transforming action The book is an inspiring, practical Biblically-based manual for moving fromcharity to transformation of community. It is enriched by practical examplesfrom real life experiences in low income communities and working with people with soundtheological underpinnings. It is inspiring;one feels hopeful and notdependent on experts, but that transformation, step by step, can happenwith committed people inspired by hope and small first successes. A mustbook for people working in low income communities, especially with faithconnections."
1,"Great for young kids I love this game! I bought one 15 or so years ago when my son was young, good first game as it helps teach turn taking. Little kids love it when the crocodile ""bites"" you! Even timid kids get into the game after an adult gets bitten a few times. Bonus that it's portable, no loose pieces, I purchased this one for my niece's three sons (under the age of 5) and have given it as a gift over and over, really fun game."
1,"Children Love Crocodile Dentist ! I bought this for my three children and they all loved it, it was well used for years. It was still in good shape after years of use so I put it in storage. I came across it, and I thought the students I teach might like it. I teach middle school. I put this on my desk and the students race to be the first in the class to play. They loved it so much, I went on Amazon and bought more! I have 5 on my desk, they are used daily by 100's of students, they are dropped almost daily. Students are not late to class. Students do not get tired of this quick fun and durable game. You should purchase this, it is perfect for on top of a desk, kids of every age love it!"
1,"Perfect Gift... this was a gift for a 4 year old - she loves it, and the best part is that she can play it solo as well!! Not the most edicational toy, but a great game to keep the kids busy."
1,"so far sounds great I actually ended up buying these to update two old cabinets i had come across. Thought they only needed speakers, turned out there was no crossover that was why the speakers were shot in the first place. Then a friend gave me a JBL set (bass mids and highs) from an old big screen tv for free so keeping the project as low cost as possible i baught these. They have nice sound for the price did't expect the results i got out of these, and i am picky about sound and i'm very satisfied. Plus they were easy to figure out how to hook up, all the terminals are marked."
1,"Awesome! I absoultely LOVE Mero! I just wish that they had more than one single out, because I can't get enough of them! I listen to this single over and over again without getting tired of it. It's a group of two guys, but it's not entirely pop sounding. It's just fun loving music to relax and enjoy."
1,"''and by will, I mean won't!'' This series is SO hilarious. I was so upset when I found out that they cancelled it.If you watched it religiously like I did when it was airing on MTV, (2004, I believe?) then you won't de dissapointed. In it's short 13 episode run, it had plenty of laughs. You should get this. Hands down. You'll have plenty of quotes that you can share with your friends for weeks to come."
1,Great show If you know this show that is probably why you are here and don't need me to tell you how good it is. If you are new then buy it! It is fun and never slows down. Unfortunately there is only one season.
1,Absolutely adorable! This horseshoe cat is aweomse! I would like to buy more for my Christmas presents. Very well made and good value.
1,"What a Gift This Book Is This amazing book begins with the author exploring with seven women and one man what the feminine consciousness is, why it's coming in now, what its role is and how it will help reshape our world. I can't tell if all eight of these people have reached enlightenment, but if not, they are well on their path, with each having their own spiritual journey and discipline. The book ends with those interviwed saying such similar things, concentrating on four areas: exploring the feminine consciousness, what's important about spiritual practices, the need to go beyond transcendence to transformation in everyday life (and in a balanced way), and finally where we're headed because of our bringing in the feminine consciousness and transformation. It is with heart-felt gratitude to the author for writing this book."
1,"Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band Gorilla Album Review (I couldn't think of a better title! :( This is probably my dad's and my favorite album that we own simply for it's ridiculusness. Some background:The Bonzos were the ""house band"" for Monty Python's predicessor, a silly British tv show called ""Do Not Adjust Your Set."" Since they were that house band, you can't expect their music to be all that serious. If you listen closely to the lyrics, the songs are downright hilarious. I do not reccomend listening to this while doing homework, though. I just finished an essay that would've nomally taken me about one hour to write, revise, and edit, but instead it took me about 1.5 hours because I was listening to Gorilla. It's good for leisure time, but not for homework. In short, I love the Gorilla album."
1,"AN ABSOLUTE 'MUST HAVE' FOR EVERYONE!!!! If you listen to this CD and you don't laugh out loud, Then JACK, YOU ARE DEAD!!! Better yet, just buy the entire collection on the 3 CD set called 'CORNOLOGY'."
1,Love it! I recently ordered the Chamae Rose 2oz bottle and receivd it promptly.Item as described and I will absolutely purchase again!
1,"Touching and Sincere Although I had some reservations about the movie, due to the whole Homosexual theme, I soon put aside all differences, and truly enjoyed the movie. It was extremily touching, and the ending was sad but sweet. I liked how Clay was able to put aside his somewhat unenjoyable relationship with James Whale, and remember him fondly for many years afterward.The issue that the movie deals with, has been something of a controversal subject for many years, and I enjoyed how Bill Condon was able to portray this problem senstively and emotionally. A terrific drama for not only Brendan Fraser fans, but also for those that only ever wanted to find love and acceptence."
1,"An intense and powerful Drama! I purchased this movie because I am a huge Brendan Fraser fan, but the movie is so moving that I somewhat forgot that Brendan was in it and became so captivated in the story, that I ended up watching it again a second time. It is wonderfully acted! I think it's Brendan's best work ever and Ian Mckellen is outstanding in this movie. For anyone looking for a movie that will move you and having you wanting friends and family to see it, this one will. It's such a powerful drama. One that I will watch over and over. I'm glad to have it in my Collection."
1,"a poignant story about loneliness and friendship Every now and then comes a movie that reminds you that entertainment can also be an intelligent emotional experience. This poignant story of loneliness and friendship has everything to go for it. Ian Mckellen's performance is once again memorable and Brendon Fraser is at his best. Script, direction and dialogues are brilliantly handled by newcomer director Bill Condon. It should appeal to everyone because it is a movie about life and death, loneliness and friendship. The widescreen edition is remarkable."
1,"""Gods and Monsters,"" indeed! What a surprising movie! First, you have one of the screen's great performances by Ian McKellen, and then there's the stunning revelation that Brendan Fraser has great depth and power as an actor and has been pretty much wasted in films up until now (except that he is terrific at comedy). This film on DVD is a marvel. The images are crisp and clean, the sound is clear and distinct, and the music score by Carter Burwell is one of the finest of recent years, subtly entwining itself into the psychological makeup of the characters and storyline. ""Gods and Monsters"" is a movie of rare depth and directorial eloquence. I cannot recommend it highly enough for thinking moviegoers."
1,"best screenplays have more stability One of the few recent films that I anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectations.Sir Ian McKellen once again performs well. The real surprise here is Brendan Fraser. Thanks to Bill Condon's amazing screenplay, Fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to McKellen's anguished and self-defeated character. Make a point to get this one. Best screenplays consist of strong dialogue, pacing, and narrative. The Oscars are usually accurrate about that."
1,Gods and Monsters I thought I had already reviewed this product. I love this movieI hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
1,"Fantastic Underrated film There is so much to love about this film it's hard to know where to begin. Ian MacKellan is brilliant as the director James Whale; Brandon Fraser is perfect as his ""monster"", and Lynn Redgrave is wonderful as his long-suffering maid Hanna. The three are the perfect ensemble and compliment each other perfectly.There are so many layers and dimensions to the story. Each time I watch it, I discover more to love about it. I heartily recommend this movie although not everyone will understand the deeper meaning. And it's definitely not for those who are homophobic, but those with an open mind will love it."
1,"Its a very gratifying film it befriends the audience at once This film is very sweet in sense that we get to know what Karchy goes through when he realizes America isnt necessary a place you can get away with telling lies when he meets his idol Billy Magic.Personally I would recommend this movie because it has great performances from Brad Renfro,Kevin Bacon and Calista Flockhart."
1,Excellent Reference Library Text for a PLS This book is simply excellent. It covers surveying subjects thoroughly and with great technical depth. It taught me to calculate state plane coordinate conversions by hand so that I understand what happens in a computer.This is the type of text that will elevate the PLS profession.
1,"excellent readable fun Martin Deporres Kennedy has a fine gift for storytelling. He pulls you into the story. I read this through in one sitting. The story is a vehicle for introducing theological ideas, often through debates between characters. These debates are very realistic, and may reflect actual arguments that the author haard or participated in. I would strongly recommend this for students. It would be a wonderful thing for Catholic high school religion teachers to assign their class."
1,"The Sultan of Swat This is a complete and thorough examination of the life and playing career of a baseball icon. The author has done a commendable job of separating the facts from the fanciful fictions that have grown up surrounding George Herman Ruth. While his home run record has been surpassed, I still think one can argue that Ruth was the greatest baseball player when one considers that in addition to his hitting abilities Ruth was an outstanding pitcher. He was shifted to the outfield when his managers determined that he could be of greater value as an everyday player rather than pitching every third or fourth day."
1,"This film is only for laser printers For those considering this overhead transperency film, only order it for use with laser printers or laser copy machines. It is not intended for inkjets and needs the laser fuser to ""burn in"" the image. It works great with the correct printer/copy machine."
1,This will make your install a breeze. . . My car is a 1994 Honda Civic EX. Save yourself a headache and get this if you have to replace your stereo. Plug and play.
1,"What a gorgeous watch!!! (for $65) I have been looking for a new dress watch for a month. (I am kind of a fussy person). I saw this watch and read the reviews . It made me considered about buying it. I decided to buy this one. I've got it today. I thought of two words on my mind. (everytime when I bought stuff online) ""Satisfied"" or ""Disappointed"". After I opened the package. I smiled all day long.Nice watch!!! Good price.!A few things want to mention you all, The watch is a little bit smaller than I expected (But it's not a promblem because my wrist it's so small(6"").it fits me perfectly)Don't be panic about the watch doesn't work at the first time. You have to let it charges for a while.(Good function,though! you don't need to worry about changing baterries)I love the lobster claw-clasp because I can adjust it myself. (I always got a problem about paying extra for adjusting the band)Well..I'd recommend this watch to anybody. Buy for yourself or as a gift. You will be happy anyway.Love it!!"
1,"great price, perfect product I have a tendency to burn out watch batteries, so this watch is perfect for me. No more replacing batteries every 3 to 6 months. Plus as a woman with a larger wrist I have a terrible time finding a feminine looking watch that fits me. This one I have plenty of room and it looks great."
1,"5 to the 10th Power In Stars They should really raise the star point system here, because anything by Mosby is worth the buy. I have the Mosby's Medical Dictionary for Nursing and Allied Health Professionals, and when I saw this book in the store, I was trying to figure out the difference, because of the color. This one offers just as many details as my previous book. This is important, because it is an easy read, and it is necessary for each household to have, for children to study off of, to the housewife that just wants to be informed. Mosby has been following me through nursing school, and anything they sell as a study aide will have a place in my home."
1,"A hidden diamond It is interesting listening to this album. Even though many of the songs date back 35 years and all of them are over 20 years old this album is like ABBA -it hasn't dated with time. Sure some of the songs have that 1970's feel, but many of them don't. The opening song has uses Thamas Arne's Rule Brittania tune. But the ""How do you do"" song is the classic, a song that even today sounds fresh.Sadly Mouth is now dead, (December 2004 of a heart attack.) and maybe that adds something to this album too.But the real star of this Album is Maggie MacNeal. Her music is as fresh and beautiful and up to date now as when it was first released 30 years ago. ""When your lady says Goodbye"" is a real classic of pigant musical beauty. One of the greatest tragedies of this album is that Maggie MacNeal has been all but forgotten today. Neither she nor her music deserve to be forgotten..."
1,"Provides valuable lessons -- especially for adults! I am a faculty member at a law school. When we considered revamping our curriculum, I gave the committee members passages from this book to read, where the Academy's approach is made clear. Universally, the response was: ""Yeah, that's how we should do things. But we have to pursue a feel-good approach now."" Heinlein understands that character matters, and that institutions should encourage responsibility, not undermine it. That, I suppose, is why he was never an administrator.... Nonetheless, this is not only a terrific story, but one -- like all of Heinlein's juniors -- with a point."
1,"Book that turned me on to science fiction I first read this book in 1970, a time that seems so long ago now it's hard to remember just what it was like. I happened upon it on my school library shelves, among the ""H"" books, among five other Heinleins. I read all of them, but this one was still the one that impressed me the most. Even though it's been nearly fifty years after its first publication, even though things didn't work out like Heinlein proposed, I can still recommend this as a good book to jump-start someone's interest in science fiction."
1,Beautiful Ring! This is a gorgeous ring. I love the unique design and how it sparkles and shines. I've received some very nice compliments too.
1,Good Product The quality was more than I expected for the price. Bought this for work and it's perfect for the food biz.
1,"My first vegetarian cookbook A friend gave me this book (the spiral edition) in 1973, and it truly changed my life -- I became a vegetarian immediately. This is where I learned how to cook and eat all kinds of food that I'd never seen before, especially beans. I am not crazy about the ""breakfast"" recipes, but the breads in this cookbook are great. I have over a hundred cookbooks, and I still make the lasagne with adzuki beans (complicated) and the potato soup (easy). Almost every page in my book is either stained or annotated or both.The only disadvantage to this cookbook is that many recipes call for dairy products and eggs -- things that I still enjoy after 29 years, but that I am not allowed to eat as often these days!This is a classic, educational cookbook for vegetarians."
1,"Not Just For Kids! This product is not just for kids, but very good for adult drivers who do not ordinarily have passengers in the car. I put all my ""junk"" in it which used to be jumbled on the seat beside me. When I am going to have someone else in the car, I just pull it out and put it in the back seat. So much nicer than tossing stuff from the front to the back to make room for a passenger! It looks so neat and holds everything I need."
1,"Great card for peripherals I've been using this card regularly since 2003 in different PC laptops. I got it as a gift with my 1st iPod and have used it for countless hard drives, including for audio recording purposes. Audio & video people take note this has the sought-after TI chipset. All in all it's been rock solid. My only concern now is whether it works under Windows 7."
1,"we are witnesses We are witnesses by Jacob Boas, is a GREAT book to read it gives you different views of teenagers that went through diffuculty during the holocaust. As you know, the person who was in charge of the holocaust was Hitler. All the teeangers talked about hope they always had the hope to live and to have their own family. They never talked about hate, they never said they hate hitler the only thing that they said was that he was responsible for what was happening. This was shocking to me because I would hate the person who had my family killed. Wouldn't you?"
1,"Caught the fever! I was introduced to this band by some friends. Not only are their covers better than some of the original recordings but Brian's love songs are amazing. Give a listen this cd, specifically I'm Gonna Stay and the title track, The Great Symphony."
1,"Inspiration & Motivation Right into the book one of the authors (Norean) talks about the necessity of getting out of our own way in the battle to lose weight. She had my attention from that moment on. Most of us know how to lose weight, it's our attitudes that need adjusting. This book is easy to read, with helpful information on every page. I read it with a Magic Marker in my hand, marking passages to read again. It was pretty well marked up by the time I finished the book. AND, it's got to be the FIRST weight loss book I've ever read cover to cover. I highly recommend it. It's written with compassion."
1,"The Heart of the Matter This book goes right to the heart of the matter - answering the question so often asked: Why do so many fail at weight loss when they know what to do? The narrative is authentic, ringing true from personal experience and case histories. Developing a new way of thinking is challenging and these authors, while providing encouragement, are realistic about the difficult road one must travel to change thought patterns. I found it very valuable."
1,AWESOME MOVIE A MUST SEE I Loved this Movie Plain And Simple It is A MUST SEE. Zoey Saldana has a huge impact in this film. I have multiple copies of this film in my home some how lol but it is well worth it. A must see buy it. Pop some popcorn and enjoy :)
1,"The Pacific Northwest's Best-Kept Musical Secret Mark is a phenomenally talented singer, songwriter, and blues harp player. Why the entire world doesn't know about him is a mystery. His clever, witty lyrics, powerful voice, and musicianship stand out on every cut of this CD. I already owned it, but bought this one as a gift for my sister who lives across the country, heard him live once, and was a goner!"
1,"Husband LOVES this magazine! I got this subscription as a gift for my husband. He loves it. He's really into staying fit and taking care of himself, like many other 20-30 year olds. And this magazine does a great job of writing about topics that are important to young male readers. A great buy. :)"
1,"Terrific new artist Merche (Mercedes Trujillo Callealta) is one of a number of fresh, young Spanish artists. As I understand it, she gave up a career in education to concentrate on music. As far as I am concerned it was a great decision. Her first album, on which she not only sings but also wrote most of the words and music, is a combination of great dance rhythms and a few excellent ballads. She has a strong, beautiful voice, and it is no wonder that her intitial foray into the music world has been a big hit in her native country. Personally, since I received this CD, I have listened to it again and again, and have not even begun to tire of it. Highly recommended!"
1,Excellent review of Mythology through early Christianity This book provided a fascinating review of early Middle Eastern mythology starting from Mesopotamian culture and proceeding through to Judaism and early Christianity. It also includes a discussion of the importance of myth and ritual as a basis for religious and socialogical structure. The area I found most interesting was the discussion of the influence of the mythology of early civilizations on Judeo-Christian belief and scripture.
1,"Fantastic eye openerThis I am so glad I found out about this book. Reading it was a major eye opener for me in understanding the early myths from the area where my own (former) religion originated. S. H. Hooke is an expert in mythology, and he does a fantastic job of showing the connections between the myths of the Middle East. For me personally, this helped me see how the roots of Christianity (particularly with ancient Hebrew religions) was inspired greatly by earlier myths. Whether it was the author's intention or not, it also helped me realize that the religion I once thought was real was, in fact, nothing more than a myth that was not unlike so many similar myths of the time and place.Jeff Mark, author ofChristian No More"
1,"Foster Parenting Abused children- a review This pamphlet serves as a wonderful resource to both those in profesional fields dealing with child abuse as well as those lay persons just entering this world through their consideration of foster parenting. As a researcher I was greatful for such a compact, to the point resource. As someone working with parents I was greatful for the open and easy to understand writing style of Eliana Gil. I have found all of Eliana Gil's works most useful and am greatful that this resource is available to those out there who may not be as interested in her works which are written in a more scholarly (although still understandable) voice."
1,Los Fantasma del Caribe are great!!! I really love Los fantasmas del Caribe they have great music and sound. I love all their material from Caramelo to Mas Y Mas. I completly recommend all their cds. They will have u dancing all night.
1,"Great Lego book One of the best Lego books out. Very high quality graphics and pictures. A nice collection of great projects. Full of interesting topics and tricks for Mindstorms. Covers RCX code, Robolab, NQC, and Visual Basic. RCX communication, Internet control, data logging, etc. Includes a CD and a useful parts list. Enough material to keep young minds and adults busy playing and learning."
1,"Word Biblical Commentary - Genesis Gordon Wenham has produced a first-class exegetical commentary of Genesis. The bibliographies cover a full range of topics and authors. For each section of the biblical text, he begins with textual notes which are quite valuable to those familiar with the ancient languages. Next he addresses issues of form and structure. Finally, he provides a verse-by-verse commentary. In the process, he addresses various approaches and viewpoints in an even-handed and fair way."
1,"This book should be on our shelves as Pastors I cannot imagine a less user-friendly layout than the Word Biblical Commentary Series. The series is uneven, and occasionally goes overboard in literary/source criticism. But one up-to-date, critical commentary on Genesis should be on our shelves, and this is about the best."
1,"Britney I think this C.D. is great. She has a wonderful voice. I love the beats, they are really good. Most of the reviews I have seen always compare the singer to Britney Spears though(Not just Stacie's reviews). I love Brit, she is my fav. singer. I wish that everyone would stop trashing Britney because she shows her stomach. Regardless of what she wears she is still a christian, no one's perfect anyways. As christians we must not judge, people seem to think that christians are judgmental and scrutinizers. Christians, think about what you say before you say it. There is no need to talk badly of others-just something to think about."
1,"Stacie can stand on her own. Stacie's voice is strong and clear. This album (can I still call it an ""album""? I'm dating myslef!) is superb. My young daughter loves it too and it is a joy to hear her singing the words. My only complaint is that the male voice in the background is really unnecessary. Her powerful voice can stand on it's own. Overall, it's superb and outstanding!"
1,"I LOVED it! ^__^ I really loved this CD! *___* There wasn't one song on this CD I didn't like, but my favorites were: Ride, 0.0 Baby, So Pray, Holdin' On, and Everything.But I give every song (...Except the interludes...) 5/5. ^__^"
1,a great cd for teens this cd is a great christian cd that appeals to teans and still shows somewhat of a christian sound. stacie has a great voice thats very mature 14.
1,"The best Christian CD ever! Stacie Orrico has managed to take Christian music to another level with Genuine! Anyone who dares to call her ""the Britney Spears of Christian music"" needs a wake-up call! Britney is awesome, but Stacie will put her to shame! Such songs as Don't Look At Me, O.O. Baby, Stay True, and Holdin' On both have a groove and a message. Then, there's the ballads, like Without Love, Everything, and Dear Friend, a song Stacie herself wrote for her anorexic friend. This album is filled, not with artificial things, but that which is genuine...no pun intended. Although Stacie has tapped into the teen pop phenomenon respresented by such secular artists as Mandy Moore, Christina Aguilera, and of course, Britney Spears, Stacie sings about real life issues, such as peer pressure, idolizing someone else, temptation to do wrong, and even marriage and dating. Stacie is the coolest Christian singer ever. Rock on!"
1,good movie If you are a Chuck Norris fan like me you will enjoy this movie.I remember watching this movie yrs ago remembered the movie but not its proper name until amazon suggested movies to me.
1,Great Service Fast delivery and in wonderful condition. Would buy again anytime from this person. Thank you.
1,"Classic It's a classic for a reason, folks. Extremely amusing and spot-on accurate. A very humorous account of the universal quest for meaning that has surely depressed the mess out of us all at some point or other. Style so good you forget to be jealous and just enjoy.A short review is not an insult. I strongly suggest that you find out about this book from one of those professional reviewer sorts. If you do that, you'll buy it. Alternately, just check your local library, get it if they have it, and prepare to get sucked right into reading this as quickly as you possibly can because it's just that damn good."
1,"Powerful Self-Talk, Change Your Self-Talk, Change Your Life I found this CD program to have very simple yet powerful ideas that I have already implemented in my life. Michael Russ speaks about the way to make changes is to change the way I talk with myself. Very cool!This is clearly one of the best programs I have ever heard, I think Michael Russ will be one of the up and coming stars in the self help business."
1,"Retrospect Awesome book, written many years ago but still is relevant to us today in 2012! Hudson Taylor was a man of Godly wisdom! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book of inspiration and mission work."
1,Really makes a difference Limbsavers reduce the kick of large calibre mil surp rifles. The slip-ons eliminate the need for stock butt modifications if you can put up with an additional inch of pull. Highly recommended.
1,Good flavor to meat. The bisquettes are very good and added flavor to the meat.I would recommend them to anyone wanting to use them.
1,My Name Is Buddy CD Adorable songs about Buddy the cat who goes on a trip with just hissuitcase. Great old songs. Kind of jazzy with blues undertones. Thestories of Buddy's journey are timely. Very enjoyable for people wholove Cats and jazz & blues. Love it!Linda
1,"Great Latin entertainment The best ever, buy and enjoy hours of music by many popular latin singers who have performed over the years. Thank you for the tribute of Celia Cruz befor her death. Buy today."
1,"Fun little guy Picked up my Tachikoma from AX '06. To address some questions: Arms and legs do not have a wire frame inside so it will not hold a pose. Eyes do not turn. Tightly stuffed so it will hold its shape. Go ahead and order it, it's too fun not to own."
1,Hard to find but works great I've been using these for years but for some reason they are no longer available in any of the grocery stores near me. I like them because they offer enough friction to clean tough stains (especially when used with BarKeeper's Friend) but they don't scratch my stainless steel pots the way steel wool used to. They also work great on my stainless steel cook top. I bought a case which reduced the price per item and spread out the shipping.
1,"great stuff We can't find these in stores anymore, which is a shame, since nothing else works as well."
1,great stuff These are just the beat scrubbies I'ver used. They don't scratch and they last forever. None of my local stores carry them anymore.
1,"This is a winner for fat burning & weight loss I did a lot of research, and this product has the best ingredients, and the highest amounts of brown guggul. I have only been taking it about a week but I have lost about 3-4 pounds. It doesn't contain any stimulant like caffeine, so I don't get that jittery feeling. The suggested usage is 1-2 capusules twice a day, the bottle doesn't say whether to take before or after you eat, but I take it before breakfast after my morning coffee. And I have no nausea or anything. I take 2 capsules twice a day, it does raise your body temperature, and has increased my metabolism. I haven't changed my diet or exercised and its working. I will be ordering this again when I run out. And this company had speedy delivery, I received my order within 3 days."
1,Great music to listen to. Highly recommend. This is a great CD with wonderful music to listen to. Larry Carlton is a very talented musician and I'll look forward to buying more of his music.
1,"see this flik Voodoo-like anti-hero, super hot gun toting anti-heroin, oh yea! If you haven't seen this flik your F^&-ing up."
1,"Clean,clear&sounding better then the LP!! Yes, this is the cd from Japan. It definitely is a much better sound then the USA out of print cd that sell for big bucks. Crisp and clear w/solid bass and much better mid & high frequencies all around. The cd does not come in the standard cd case, so you will have no problem finding it amoung all those standard cases. It does have a seperate sheet with the words and a full replica of the old LP cover. I would recommend purchasing this cd made in Japan before getting an out of print US reversion. I got this cd for only eight buck$ more then a mint LP, which I would have to put on a disk to listen to. Oh, you can pay alot less, for this cd, if you buy it on Amazon.com. Enjoy! (-:"
1,"Blistering, compelling rock I bought this because I'd heard the opening track ""Down in the Desert"" and thought it excellent. I was stunned to find the whole CD is supreme...this is surely one of the best kept secrets in all of rock. Thin White Rope are a combination of Television and Sonic Youth and Nick Cave and Pavement and better than all of them. ""When Worlds Collide"" is one of my most treasured CDs and one of the greatest compilations in the history of rock music."
1,"simply first-class! Truth be told, I wasn't expecting a whole lot of sophistication from the uneducated peasant culture of overwhelmingly rural Haiti. Imagine my surprise, then, to discover that I was being treated to a marvelously tightly integrated ethnographic study-cum-anecdote chrestomathy. In addition to some uniquely Haitian elements, there are, of course, the to-be-expected plethora of archetypal folkloric motifs as catalogued by Aarne and Thomson. The stories were generally brief and worked quite well, and Wolkstein's detailed notes about the physical setting and orator of each tale make the reader feel as if he's actually taking part in a rural Haitian storytelling session under the full moon in the sweltering sugar cane fields. Bravo, Dr. Wolkstein!"
1,This book was Phnomenal This was Ann's best book yet. The charatcters and the story were very well-written and woven into real history that I felt like i was relly there. The medical aspcet of it was interesting as well. I was also intrigued by all the body-snatchers and read more about them . The author presents a fair argument as to whether the bodies should have been left alone or used for mediacl science and I thought that her un-biased nature was commendable. This was a great book and I think this was definately the best yet.
1,"A Very Suspenseful Book! This book not only kept me reading and reading, it also was suspenseful and thrilling. Emily was a truly wonderful character and all of the other characters had colorful personalities as well. If you like suspense and romance too, get this book today! You'll absolutely love it."
1,"Outstanding performancw I'd like to see this on stage, this performance certainly enhanced my interest in this work."
1,Just right for the job This repair kit has an excellent selection of lots of various screw sizes and had just what I wanted for my glasses. The cost was not expensive and delivery was fast. I have to use a walker or scooter so going to the store to fix my glasses would have been a big chore. This kit enabled me to do everything at home quickly.
1,Great product This kit has everything you would ever need to repair a pair of glasses from screws to nose padsI received the kit real fast in about 3 days I was surprised at how many screws there were the screwdriver is easy to use and the nose pads so many this was better then described on amazon store page
1,"Great Tool Kit for Sunglasses After my Gucci sunglasses lost the part that holds the screw I could not find a tool kit that coantain the part and I didn't want to throw my glasses away. I am so glad I found this kit in Amazon. Not only did it have the part I need it, it also has a small screw that attaches to your keychain so you can have with you at all times just in case your sunglasses get loose."
1,"The Best of Bizarro is awesome Well, this is a great collection. The artwork is great, but it's the clever conceptions that make these cartoons so funny. There are no stock characters or favorite themes, every panel is original and fresh. Highly recommended."
1,"Why pay more? I actually purchased a pair of these about a year ago for my home WIFI network from a different site. Since that site no longer has these in stock, I got the next pair (this time for my church) from Amazon. I have had 0 issues with these cards - can't remember a single time where I lost connectivity honestly. Don't think I could ask for more, especially at the price point. Great buy!"
1,"Super G 802.11BG Wireless Pci 64 Bit Xp Compliant Turbo Mode I ordered this just over a month ago, and I recieved it in the time frame that I was told. It is great! My computer works great with it and it was really easy to install! I have never installed one before, but I wanted to try and do it myself and not have to get someone else to do it! It was so easy to do and once installed, I downloaded the disk and it was ready to go...it was really quite simple,and I am far from a computer expert. So if I can do it, so can you! I'm so glad I got it and I will probably be purchasing a couple more in the near future for my kids' computers too!!"
1,"Installed on 2 desktops - Easy as pie I wanted to get rid of those pesky wires, so after some research I bought one of these to see if it would work in my desktop. The day it arrived I followed the directions and it was picking up my wireless router signal within 5 minutes of opening the package. Needless to say, I bought another one the same day for my wife's desktop and they have worked flawlessly for a month now. Both are XP systems."
1,"Works great if................. I recently installed this card on an old HP 64 bit desktop that I was upgrading to Windows 7. As the included CD didn't have a Windows 7 driver I went to their website, using another PC of course, and downloaded the correct driver and then let Windows ""find"" it during installation. I didn't load any of the manufacturer's software at all, I let Windows do everything and its working perfectly. I get instant connection when I power up, the signal is strong and I've yet to drop the connection. The desktop is 2 rooms (thus 2 walls) away from the gateway and directly next to an HD TV, which I use as its monitor, and doesn't pick up any interference. Oh, one more thing, once everything was working ""automatic update"" downloaded and installed an even newer driver."
1,"Easy install, works great I moved to a location where wireless internet was all that was available and so I needed a wireless adapter for my desktop PC. This product was quick and easy to install and enabled me to be on line immediately. The price was very reasonable and the product works as described."
1,"Great wireless adapter The computer I installed this in, is in my sons room across the hallway. Without a wall, it would measure probably 50 to 60 feet (maybe a little more) Since I have installed the product it has held at excellent signal. I can't say how well it would work further as I have not tried. I only ran into 1 hiccup after installing. When I turned off the computer and turned it back on, it did not automatically hunt for my access point. So I added my access point to the settings and that fixed that problem. I am very pleased with this product."
1,"Super G 802.11BG worked out of box I installed the Super G 801.11BG wireless card into an older Dell desktop with 2 OS's on separate hard drives. One OS is ubuntu and the other is XP.With the ubuntu OS,the card worked out of the box without any more tweaking,with the XP OS,I installed the software that came with the card,and it worked without any more tweaking, and still works with ubuntu after upgrading from 8.10 to 9.04.Highly recommend this wireless card and I really like the antenna being on a cable instead of attached to the card on the back of computer."
1,"Wonderful Resource The stories in ""The Mishomis Book"" give an excellent background for the Anishnabe culture. I have heard Anishnabe Elders refer to it as a children's bible for the Anishnabe.It begins with the origin of the Anishnabe People. It continues through many of the stories that establish the mores and society of this culture. All of these stories are written in a way children can understand.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the culture of the Woodland Indians. It has been a beginning point of understanding this culture for me and, I am certain, many others."
1,"Wonderful story I had to buy this for a college course, and I love it so much that I won't part with it now. My kids are reading it and I think it's a great way to introduce them to Native American tradition."
1,"Classic and Essential! Since 1980, I have been recommending this reference to over 23, 000 participants in my business writing workshops. I describe the book as invaluable, comprehensive, beautifully organized, and continuously updated. The Gregg Reference Manual is one of two essential tools for business, government and corporate writers: the other is a fat dictionary. The Manual is full of wisdom and articulates sound uniform rules with nicely nuanced exceptions. It is simply my writer's crutch."
1,"Complete and easy to use I've used this book for years, and I think it's terrific. Why? Four reasons: First, the information about grammar and usage is so mainstream, so consistent with the majority of other important references (The Chicago Manual of Style, for one). Second, it is accurate and reliable. Third, the outstanding index makes it wonderfully easy to use; you can look something up, in everyday terms, and readily find a reference. Fourth, the rules are short and the examples clear; once you've found the rule you need, you can read it, grasp it, and 30 seconds later be on your way.As a full-time trainer of writers and editors, I have used this book with everyone from grammar-challenged support staff to highly educated professional editors. With some classes, I've also used the optional worksheets (sold separately). I can't recommend Gregg highly enough."
1,"Thank you, Peter! Your book is great! I've found this book totally different from any other tutorial stuff. In spite of my past programmers expirience in database I've started studying OOP from scratch more than one year ago. I had several books of Java-programming (Deitel&Deitel, Mike Morgan, Peter Norton etc.). I've got prefer this one. Author give to readers the pretty excelent refferences. I would say that this book ought to read whether you beginers in OOP or not. This book will compel you work. It is inexhaustible source for Java programming."
1,"Great book, great price I learned a lot from ""Just Java 1.2"" and really liked the readable style. The author knows how to get detailed technical points across. The diagrams and pictures really helped too. The CD has a LOT of Java material on it."
1,"Great for bi-wire I use this on my Mirage OMD -15 , since the speaker has 4 post on the speaker and suggest bi-wiring I needed something that would be able to be run into the same plug into the receiver and all four plugs into the speaker while not splitting the wire. Even though I am not running over long distances I like the fact that I can run 4 16 gauge AWG solid copper wires out of 2 plugs."
1,"Reviewing the review I am bothered by the review from dn@microtek.fr. Everyone has a right to his own opinion, but I think this is just vicious anti-Christian retoric. Mr. Tozer is a prolific writer and has several 5 star ratings. Please see the ""All Books"" list before judging this book only by what this man says."
1,"The Best Sherlock Holmes -- And That's Saying Plenty! I have read and enjoyed many a good Sherlock Holmes story (e.g. ""The Red-Headed League"" is a winner), but at the very top of the book stack I would place ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"". Who could ever forget the atmosphere that Arthur Conan Doyle evokes by his use of those misty moors!In teaching English (Literature) to a class of 7th & 8th grade boys, I was at first a bit hesitant to introduce this novel as our text. Would a group of squirrelly junior high boys find anything of interest in a book written in 1901? Answer: I needn't have worried. They loved it (and so did I)! The fog from the moors drifted right into our classroom.First-rate mystery tale with one of the most famous fictional characters ever created. ENJOY! (But keep an eye out for a frightful luminescent hound next time you're walking home at night - just in case)."
1,"Top Rate Holmes.......... Ah, to settle in with Hound of the Baskervilles was pure delight. I had read this many years ago in an almost obsessive pursuit of reading all things Sherlock Holmes and have only recently taken up my obsession again with the wonderful series by Laurie R. King featuring Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell. I digress, back to Hound of the Baskervilles. One of the best mysteries in the series. What more could you ask for? A spookylegend about a gruesome phantom dog, murder most foul, the English moor and an ancient creepy mansion. In this story, Dr. Watson has never been more delightful as Holmes' foil and confidant. The mystery evolves to an exiting climax which leaves the reader fufilled but wanting to get their hands on the next Holmes case. Well done!"
1,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would approve I'm new to audio books. But, I'm afraid I've already been spoiled. I wonder if there could possibly exist a better combination of author and reader. Holmes sounds just the way you'd expect the great sleuth to sound. Deliberate, never rushed and always a gentleman.The story is carefully woven and the presentation of the characters by Timson is masterful. I've listened to it over several times and each time I appreciate a little more the complexity and the detail. The Musical interludes are brief and sparse, but definitely compliment. If you like Sherlock Holmes, Timson is the right reader for the job. I'm buying the big collection now."

1,"Enhanced with music and sound effects The first in Scenario Productions' ""The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes"" series and taken from the Archives of CBC Radio, this superbly presented radio adventure theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is a multicast presentation of a classic Sherlock Holmes story. This two audio cassette audio book has a two hour running time and is enhanced with music and sound effects for the perfect ""theater of the mind"" listening experience.

1,"kindle book this was good copy, I enjoyed it. Smooth transaction, no problems at all, I will buy more in the future."
1,"This book is awesome! I read this book and this is definitely my favorite of all the books I have read. This book is very, very, suspenseful and a little spooky. This was the first Sherlock Holmes book I have read and it got me hooked on Sherlock Holmes. I couldn't put this book down because it was so suspenseful and it was very entertaining. I would recommend this book to anyone."
1,"Nice, basic version Nice, basic book version of this classic Sherlock Holmes story. Comments/vocabulary in the back is a nice touch for those trying to learn from literature. Not deluxe, but worth the low price."
1,Great Laser Printer I had this printer working within minutes of opening the box. Very fast with quality print. An excellent value.
1,"SAILOR STARS ROCKS!! i dont own this, but i ahve all the MP3s and i just have to say that this cd is awesome!!!"
1,The Gratest Ever!!! This is the absolute best of Sailor Moon right here. Not only is Sailor Moon Sailor Stars the best season ever the sonds are the GREATEST!
1,Couldnt have been easier! I purchased this system a year ago and have been dreading having to change the filter. I HATE changing filters on anything because it's never as easy as the manufacturer claims. I just changed the filter and it took me about 2 minutes. Super easy! I love this product! My skin isn't all itchy when I take a shower anymore!
1,JOHN WAYNE!!!!!! What else is there to say about a John Wayne movie that has not been said. Good fast service and good movie.
1,"One of the Duke's best westerns John Ford and John Wayne teamed up to do many films during their days in Hollywood and this western adventure is among the best horse operas ever made. Set in picturesque Monument Valley, a favorite Ford outdoor setting, the movie tells of life in an army outpost in Arizona and the unease of officers and enlisted men under the command of a disgruntled, by-the-book lieutenant colonel. Henry Fonda is excellent as the martinent who alienates his men and clashes with Wayne's Captain York throughout the film, their differences exploding during a peace parley with the Apaches which ends in a rousing cavalry-Indian engagement near the end of the movie. Ford's regulars, led by Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen and Hank Worden are among the cast members, and Shirley Temple and John Agar provide the romantic angle in the proceedings. The black and white cinematography by Archie Stout is striking and Richard Hageman's wistful score are among the film's top notch production values."
1,"Classic Western John Ford was one of the greatest directors to ever step on a movie set. He was proficient in many genres but won his most acclaim for his Westerns - especially those starring John Wayne. Fort Apache ranks among his best offerings, having not only great direction but also two super stars at the peak of their powers. Duke Wayne and Hank Fonda play contrasting characters who share one thing in common - the call to duty. The scenery is glorious and the pacing sublime in this highly recommended film."
1,A FUN EVENT! Hey not many people I know watch the apprentice but pretty soon everybody I know will play the computer game of it! It totally rocks! You have to try it. Donald Trump is amazing. I love the game. And I got it from amazon for a really cheap price. Amazon has the cheapest prices you could imagine.
1,"Small but very nice! I bought this for a little Valentine's day gift for my 2.5yo. He has good fine motor skills for his age, so he can handle the tiny size. He's not into coloring the pictures in yet, just lots of enthusiastic stamping, counting, making animal sounds, and naming the animals and colors, which this is great for. I do think that if your child wants to color the pictures in, you'll want the bigger stampers. But this set is so cute, easy to store, and the 4-color stamp pad is nice. A lot of fun in a tiny package, and definitely worth the 6 bucks!"
1,farm animal stamps looks nice. i purchased this as a gift & it has not been used yet. so i can't really rate it.
1,"Fun Series, but I'm biased OK, first I'll admit to a strong bias. My day job is to limit orbital debris creation from NASA satellites, so any series that recognizes the importance of my daily struggle is an automatic win with me.That said, I think the show is interesting, and something I could see watching on Saturday mornings for fun. They've included enough interpersonal relationship stuff to keep it interesting, but with the backdrop of nerdy space facts. I love to destroy these kinds of shows on technical inaccuracies, but I find that harder to do with this series. The writers seem to have made the effort to actually research their topic a little bit, and tried to stick to facts. There are a few inventions to fit the story lines, but for the most part they try to be reasonably accurate.The interviews in the bonus tracks are pretty good, and I use them in my classes on orbital debris."
1,Extreme Trains: The complete Season One My husband loves steam trains. This was a Christmas present for him. He has spent many enjoyable hours watching it.
1,"Hello, my name is...and I love trains! I stumbled upon this series while looking for train shows for my 6 year old son...he loves the show so much we have almost every show to date and will definitely buy this dvd. He has even begun to say ""Hello, my name is Kieran and ever since I was little I have loved trains.""I have to agree Matt is awesome...he is grown kid playing with real life trains....I learned so much about trains and the history about them that I can't wait til next season....Trains rule at our house! We are train hunters...no matter where trains are we will find them."
1,"A must for the Railfans, kids, and transpotters An avid fan of trans, and model railroading, I love this show. It's the favorite show of my 4 year old who watches an episode at least daily, and knows more about the operations of railroads than most adults because of this show.The camera work is well done, and captures the hard steel and movement of a train. Matt Bown is a great host who adds excitement and his love of trains with the audience, giving great descriptions of the technical aspects of railroading. You'll walk away from the show with a greater understanding of trains and a deeper love for them as well.The extras are nice, as there are some scenes from nearly every episode that never aired. I would liked to have seen some audio commentary though."
1,"Bighorse Warrior Comes Alive I've met the author - Tiana Bighorse Butler. Her pride shines through as she tells the stories of her father. Written in Navajo english, the reader is taken into the traditional navajo way of life. Wonderful stories give an honest perspective and a clear understanding of warriors in that point of time. Buy this book!! Compelling reading that you'll never forget!!"
1,"ELEGANT AND EASY Barry Tarshis has given us a remarkably well done guidebook to that often complicated language we call ""English"". It is a priceless helping hand for everyone - students, writers, professionals, and just plain folks. Bravo Mr. Tarshis!"
1,"An excellent and enjoyable resource After reading ""Seduce Me! How to Ignite Your Partner's Passion"", I immediately made arrangements to purchase an initial order of 50 copies for our medical office. Through our patient-centered obstetrics and gynecology practice, we treat thousands of women annually and receive questions and concerns about sexual libido daily.I found this book to be very informative, presenting scientific biochemical data and psychological insights in a manner that any of our patients could easily comprehend.Beyond that, the recommendations offer clear and fun solutions, addressing both sexual and relationship issues. I would estimate that 1 in 4 women I see daily ask me about problems with sexual desire and fulfillment, and I am very pleased to be able to provide ""Seduce Me!"" to them as an excellent and enjoyable resource."
1,"Genious Allegory of the Christian Life - Timeless! This book is truly a literary classic! Although written over 400 years ago, this allegory of the Christian life is still relevant today. It still speaks to incredible depths of the Christian experience, the struggles as well as the joys. You'll feel the emotion of ""Christian"" as he encouters a number of characters, all named for their particular life experience.I have read this book 4 times in the last 10 years, and plan to again this year. Everytime I pick it up my relationship with God is strengthened. I have also refered to it many times in conversation. What more could you ask for in a book!If you're not comfortable with the old english, then try a modern language version. Either way you won't be disappointed. I guarantee it!"
1,"Prompt and Utter Distruction My opinion about this book is it joins a long list of similar books that pick out parts of the decisions that were made in 1945 about use of the atomic bomb and criticize U.S. leaders who made decisions under the press of time and circumstance and in dealing with a Japanese military, which totally ran the country. In such a situation, someone like the author of this book (and there are many others like him) can go back and question the decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan from the safe distance of more than 50 years. In my review of the handling of the atomic bomb in August, 1945, with very minor exceptions, the leaders of the United States made the correct decision based on all the facts.uwcharlie"
1,Great History Book I bought this book for school.. I have not read it yet but it arrived in perfect condition.. Very fast shipping.
1,"Assessing NAFTA This book contains a comprehensive assessment of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Authors from all three countries probe different aspects of the deal; they provide an overall assessment as well as detaailed examination of some of the critical issues and sectors that will be affected.In addition to assessments of NAFTA from Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the book examines specific issues, namely, the enviroment, agriculture, investment provisions, rules of origin, the trade in automotive goods, dispute settlement, energy, the textile and apparel sector, and the financial sector. -- from book's back cover"
1,"Hardcore Fun for The Entire Family If you enjoy movies that make you uneasy yet you keep watching because of a voyeueristic mix of repulsion and fascination, then look no further--here's the one you've been looking for.Brando was considered a legend, and this movie is proof; ""acting"" is too small a word to describe the performance he gave here.Pain. Confusion. Lust. Grasping at redemption as it slithers through your fingers--it's all right here, folks.This movie is a carousel of torment. There's an anonymous person riding next to you, and both of you have to laugh at it all, just to keep from crying."
1,"The genius of Marlon Brando I remember seeing this movie for the first time about a billion yrs ago and thinking, `So THIS is what being a superb actor is all about.' Brando, playing an expat in Paris who is in despair over his wife's very recent suicide, never once seems to be acting, never seems aware of camera or audience, never seems to consider how others will view him or his role or this movie. Unbelievable.The film was shocking when it was first made in 1973, especially for the graphic and (at that time) `unusual' sexual scenes - and it still makes viewers squirm a bit, but his odd and almost voiceless relationship with Maria Schneider is not self-serving on either end. It's dispassionate and anonymous sex, meant as a Band-Aid on a wound too painful to be dealt with in any other way.Super, super, super."
1,"to paraphrase Inigo Montoyo and Freud, sometimes a camel hair coat ""[doesn't mean] what you think it means"" Ohmijesus, arriviste in Paris lets go of one branch to grab onto what she thinks is an established man of importance. Brando who raped faerie queen Vivien Leigh in A Streetcar Named Desire has his bereaved, many-varied way with badly cloaked Toxic Ambition. This is why men break up over the telephone or via email or better yet just VANISH. This is a precursor to Fatal Attraction. I think this movie is supposed to be annoying, off-putting and unattractive. His dead wife is the daughter of a French Resistence member. Could this be important to the movie?"
1,"Great bindings, good intro critique We all know about Shakespeare, so a review of his writing is not required. However, I would like to say that the Everyman's Library series are worth getting. Unlike omnibus editions (such as the Riverside Shakespeare), these are actually portable so you don't need a table to hold them up while you are reading. The Everyman's Library series have good hardbindings, are conveniently sized to carry around, and have illuminating and extensive introductions. The typeface used is old, but the letters are large and easily readable (something that is a concern with some other editions).Tragedies, Volume 1 contains: Hamlet; Othello; King Lear; Machbeth"
1,"Don't buy the wrong one! This review is not about the product -- Everyman Tragedies Volume 2, which is wonderful -- but a warning to use care when purchasing. My first time through, I clicked into the ""New"" options from $0.73, and was directed to several well priced books. The only problem is, they are not the volume advertised on this page. Instead it's three plays in an unattractive volume from something called Ann Arbor Media. So be careful!"
1,"Brush Up Your Shakespeare Editions! None of the other reviews here refer to what is actually being offered on this page: the 3-volume set of Shakespeare's plays (Histories, Tragedies, Comedies) published by The Heritage Press, commonly known as The Heritage Shakespeare.This set became an instant classic when it was published in 1958, and if you're interested in a beautifully printed, edited, and illustrated edition of the plays at a reasonable price, you cannot go wrong with the Heritage."
1,"And I even didn't like this singer! But now I do! Marco Borsato wasn't one of my favourite singers here in Holland. But that changed when I heard several of the songs on this album. As soon as the CD got out, I run to the store and bought the album. There are several slow songs, but also some songs with ritme. Marco Borsato is on his best at this CD and I think it is even better than his new album Luid en Duidelijk. A ""must have"" Cd for every Borsato fan!"
1,"Finally - a PRACTICAL guide Mark's book is an excellent, easy to understand read, which I found extremely helpful.Most books on TOC deal with a lot of theory, or case studies. This is the first book I've read that goes into incredible detail on how to implement TOC using the author's years of experience in this field.A must-read if you are plannig to implement TOC."
1,Tubas by a Waterfall in the Canyons of Your Mind -- This is more entertaining than anything should be allowed to be. Avoid operating heavy machinery while listening.And don't listen to it while asleep or you'll wake up on the floor wondering how you came to be so elevated.
1,"what a great story I liked this. Better than the first one, I think, although I have to go re-read that one. I especially liked the way the characters are developing into more complex people. The scenes at sea are wonderful, but I have to say that I'm glad she didn't leave them in Scotland. Too much Scotland these days in love stories. Don't people realize it's wet and cold there most of the time? I'm looking forward to the next installment back on the ny frontier. Give me mosquitos over scotsmen anyday.I also have a theory about the reviews here that call this book boring (there are about five of them, I think). There are three reasons that come to mind to call this boring: somebody glued the pages together on you, you're brain dead, you've got something against the author. I suspect those reviews were all written by the same boring person. A vendetta? Sour grapes? Oxygen deprivation? Who knows."
1,"Not as good as the first but still excellent I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one, but I usually think the first book in a series is the best anyway. All in all this is an excellent series, recommend!"
1,"review I felt the first book in the series started off a little weak and definitely grew in strength as the novel progressed. However, I enjoyed ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" from start to finish and went on to purchase the other titles in the series right away. My only complaint is that this book did not have a Kindle edition."
1,"what a story The kind of book that makes you turn off the phone and ignore the kids. Those two reviewers here who said ""boring""? I'm wondering if they read the same book. I suppose they need a nuclear explosion or the like to keep them happy. What I like is, interesting characters in challenging situations, and you've got that here in abundance.The first one was very good, but this one is even better. More tightly written. Miss Donati has come into her stride. Bring on Hidden Wolf!"
1,"EUEKA BITTERROOT 11 I just got this to replace a little 2 people tent as my daughter is old enough now to go camping whit us. Yes It is very roomy for the three of us but I can for sure use the extra space. We camp at a lagoon 35F at night to 55F at noon. No condensation, good wind protection and resistance. Very well constructed. You will need help to put on the canopy on windy situations. It's a very good option between a 3 seasons and a 2 seasons because of the protection and waterproof and the big windows and height."
1,"Euphoric About Eureka Bitterroot Tent We have owned this tent for seven months now and can attest that the manufacturer description and majority of other reviews are spot on (thus far)! While we have yet to put it through any rough weather tests, we have found the tent to possess a practical design, spacious interior, a height that makes it comfortable for standing, well made, and easy to put up and take down. The only suggestion I would have for Eureka is to include metal tent stakes instead of the cheap easily breakable plastic ones."
1,"perfect campground tent You certainly wouldn't want to take this backpacking, but for use at a campground, this tent would be hard to beat. I purchased it from a gold box offer shortly before Memorial Day, and just got back from a camping trip. Everyone was jealous of this HUGE tent. I am 6'5'' and could stand up comfortably in the center of this tent.It rained 2 of the 3 nights we were out there, and one night it POURED. Despite the usual loudness of the rain on the fly, this was a pleasant experience. No rain got into the tent, and thanks to the ceiling vents and well designed fly, we stayed cool and happy the entire night.Easy to set up, easy to take down. Easy to shake off after a rainfall to pack up immediately.1 adult and 4 kids was no problem, everyone had PLENTY of personal space. I imagine 4 adults fit in quite comfortably.Eureka hasn't let me down, and if you are in the market for a HUGE tent, this is the one to get."
1,"STEINER: Virginia City/The Lost Patrol The powerful and melodic music from Virginia City really stands out against today's soundtracks of rolling drums and string chords. Oddly, the volume on my disk is rather low. Enjoy some of the very best movie music here!"

1,"ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES EVER WHEN THE MOVIE STARTED I WAS NOT SURE ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE PLOT ABOUT, AND THAT REALLY WORKED GOOD FOR ME. AFTER A VERY SHOCKING SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT, SIX WOMEN DECIDED TO EXPLORE A CAVE AND THEY FIND WHAT TRUE HORROR IS. I WAS SHOCKED AND STUCK TO MY SIT FROM THE BEGINNING TILL THE END OF THE MOVIE. THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD AND WELL DONE, DIRECTED AND EDITED. VISUAL EFFECTS ARE OUTSTANDING. I WON'T TELL ANYTHING ELSE TO AVOID TO SPOIL IT WHEN YOU WATCH IT. BUT TRUST ME, THIS MOVIES IS SO GOOD THAT NOW, I WILL FOLLOW CLOSER ALL WORKS BY DIRECTOR NEIL MARSHALL. SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THE MOVIE HAS WON 3 IMPORTANT AWARDS,1- British Independent Film Award ""Best Director: Neil Marshall""2- British Independent Film Award ""Best Technical Achievement""3- Empire Award ""Best Horror Movie""AND HAS 4 OTHER NOMINATIONS... THE MOVIE IS A TOTAL SUCCESS, THUMPS UP FOR NEIL MARSHALL"
1,Warning! Do not buy this film if you are afraid of small dark cramped spaces underground. This movie will scare the bee-jabbers out of you. Other than that -- it's a good thrill ride.
1,"Best horror film...ever. Before this film no other film has even come close to scaring me. Those films mentioned above are like watching the Teletubbies in comparison to this film. I even consciously considered getting up and leaving the cinema through this film because I thought my mind just couldn't handle the tension any more. The action simply never stops once it starts. And, I won't spoil anything, but the first gory scene of the film: that kind of stuff shouldn't even be allowed! I never thought the line could be moved so far."
1,I LOVE THIS MOVIE:D This is a great and powerful movie. It starts out slow but then it gets going. It is a great movie and everything about it is great. If you are into horror and monster like creatures then you will like this movie.
1,"I wish their were more like this First no spoilers here but I will say theier is a build up in the movie,but when it hits the fan,it really hits the fan.I havnt had that feeling in my gut in a long time,not since the first Alien film,they felt similiar to me.This movie is not for the faint of heart although not as gorry as some previous movies when its used here it is very effective,this movie will make you feel unsettled,this is for sure the best creature film i've seen in years,bring your nerves.Sum it up I wont be in any caves for sure anytime in the near future,and yes go ahead and buy this no need to waste your money on a rent you will want this in your collection.Instant Classic"
1,"Terrorific Extreme Adventuring When watching this movie, I feel like I'm in that labyrinthine cave so far underground--just as I find myself on the mountain and in the crevasse when viewing Touching the Void. I found the troglodytes very believable as well. The character development was quite adequate. The acting was fine. I found nothing that detracted from the experience except the very last 10 seconds (which I won't give away). I find this movie to be an engrossing terrorific adventure."
1,"Awesome Movie I only have one word for this Movie ''Awesome'' , the movie have anything one horror movie need, you need see this movie. 5 star for this."
1,"Intense horror/suspense Simply spine chilling!!! After a bit of drama in the beginning to set the relationship between these friends, the movie erupts into an action/thriller that had me biting my nails (something I haven't done for years). This movie is 'otherworldly' and may scare some would-be spelunkers away from dark, creepy caves forever, but it's worth the risk if you love horror. If you liked 'Dog Soldiers', you'll 'bite into' this one. Grab your popcorn and hang on because once the creatures take the stage your eyes are glued wide open. (o.k, so I viewed bloody scenes from between my fingers the first time). I watched it twice and still jumped at a few things I knew were coming. Very well-written. The cave/climbing shots and immense fear factor never go over the top, but they sure do raise your blood pressure a few notches. Excellent horror film! I believe this director is really on a roll.P.S. Be sure to check out the beautiful mountain scenery.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
1,"Brilliant! The best horror film to come out in 10 years, easy. If you are in any way claustraphobic this film will be hard to sit through. The cave is terrifying in itself, which is quite an acheivement considering the modest budget. As the women descend deeper into the cave I felt as if I was watching A Stanly Kubrick or a Ridly Scott film. The buidup to the real threat is fantastic, and theaters will be filled with screams when the movie hits the U.S next month. I think the American studio cut the real ending off so they can sell the 'unrated' DVD afterwards. They know they have a hit on their hands, so they will milk it for all it's worth. This version is a must have for any horror fan that doesn't want to wait a year for a proper US release."
1,"GREAT !! This is a great movie !I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this, but I'm very glad I took a chance on it. It has beautiful scenery, good actors and it's really quite scary ! Iv'e been in a cave before and went much farther into it than expected for a guy who doesn't like confined spaces. This movie captures the feel and fear involved in exploring the underground. If I ever do go into another one, I will be watching for the freaky creatures that live within the caves of this movie. These guys(or gals)natually freak me out! The way they look, move, and sound are great. There is plenty of suspense and alot of scary scenes.I was a little ""put-off"" by the ending,which I guess is the prelude to ""Decent II"", which I haven't seen yet. Over all, it's worth renting, or buying. It's a classic !!"
1,"Great Little Printer This little printer prints fast and clearly. I always thought a laser printer would be out of reach for me, cost-wise, but Amazon's price was quite reasonable (in fact it's still the lowest I've seen, a month later). Most of the things I print are in b&w anyway and I love not having to wait while my inkjet printer grinds out a page. I recommend this printer wholeheartedly."
1,"Perfect UPDATE:July 22, 2007: The old review stated that I have not changed my ink cartrdige, which was in August of 2005. I still have yet to change it. It has been almost 2 years. Since I am in school, I print hundreds to thousands of text. I am surprised that there is still no fade to the text. My printer has still not jammed and is still printing at quick speeds. I am fully satisfied with this printer and am glad I did not invest in any other printer. I recommend this printer to anyone that wants a cost efficient and very reliable, black and white printer.This HP Printer has lasted me throughout my freshman and sophomore year of college. I have not yet needed to change my ink cartridge: I've printed most likely 1000 pages of text. I've never had a hardware or software issues. When I recieved the product, there was no usb cable, as most printers do not include them (quite lame). I recommend this product to any person who does not need color. Great product and great price!"
1,"Best little printer ever!!! Would not sell for 300 even though bought for 80 because this printer is amazing! I have used for maybe 3 years and only replaced the ink cartridge once and print all the time. Quality Prints, Quiet and Nearly Instant prints. What else could you want?IFind one of these. You won't be disappointed."
1,"A great workhorse I couldn't be happier with this printer. I'm a writer and a writer who doesn't particularly like reading off a computer screen. I can't see the flow, and make easy notes, or get an overall vibe of the thing while reading off a screen.Plus, I'm also starting a PhD program in the next month and so printing is a necessity.I don't need the absolute fastest, and I don't need the absolute best quality. What I need is a solid, laser printer that fits into my decidedly narrow budget.This fit perfectly and it works perfectly as well.I'm very pleased."
1,"I am so pleased with this computer. This is a great computer and at such a reasonable price. I haven't had any problems with it whatsoever. It's fast, doesn't jam and I print several pages everyday...unlike the ink-jets, I don't have to replace cartridges frequently.It arrived in a timely manner. I will shop here again."
1,"I get a plenty of 'smooth use' out of this lit'l thing at my small business. I'll keep it simple...I get a lot of 'smooth use' out of this lit'l thing at my small business. Great, no me arrepiento (no regrets)! I wish I could find a laserjet 'all in one' in this 'price effectiveness' range as well."
1,"The Printer that Could My first laser printer cost over $1,000, was frustratingly slow, and had good but not great print quality. Fifteen years and about as many printers later, I now have this little 1020 for less than one-fifth the price. I set it up in exactly two minutes. It runs dead quiet (nice in an office environment of so many fans and hums). It has great first page response - and when I'm done typing the letter, I slap the envelope in the manual tray, print it, and I'm done. The print quality is as good as it gets. It is not the fastest printer in the world, but it is more than competitive in this price bracket. And small? Smallest footprint of any laser I've owned, which is also important to me. I can't say enough about this printer - finally, someone got a small printer exactly right for small business."
1,"Flawless This printer has been working flawlessly. This is the second one I have purchased. We decided to put one on each of our computers. No problems whatsover. If you want B&W laser prints without any problems, this printer is perfect and well priced."
1,"Wow fast delivery! Really nice printer, it's black and white ink, but does the job better than my higher quality printer,"
1,"Great little machine! I don't normally go out of my way to write reviews, but I do appreciate reading them before I buy....so here's one for those considering buying this for their ""second office"" application. I've had this printer for 3 months now, and it's great for my home office (where I work when I'm not in my office office). Footprint is tiny, no problems with paper feed (like prior top-feed printers I've had), print quality good and crisp, and printouts appear instantly. Good work HP."
1,"Great printer for the price I bought this printer to replace my HP Laserjet III, which was approximately 18 years old and only needed service once. The printer was delivered a few days earlier than I expected it. Even though the USB cable didn't come with it, I looked around at home and found that I had a spare one. I preloaded the software supplied with the printer and it was fully functional in under 15 minutes.I'm more than pleased with my selection. I hope this one lasts as long as the HP III did."
1,"Miracle Man This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It made Padre Pio very real, his life, dedication and suffering. It was a lengthy film but worth ever minute. I highly recommend it to any one at all intersted in the mystical side of our saints and the Church."
1,Inspirational How one man's faith kept him through all of life's challenges. Very well played out and very well done!
1,"Excellent Movie! Movie arrived on time and in great condition. This was a birthday gift for my grandaughter and she was really happy. I watched it and I just loved it, a great movie."
1,"One of my all time favorites This is the kind of movie I like watching more than once. I have a deep admiration for this man who was able to follow Christ ways in such a heroic way, the movie does a great job also showing the issues within the church which true saints are able to endure and still love it.Very accurate in biographical data, I have to warn you that the dubbing in English (it lacks the proper feeling which can lead you to think that the acting was poor) is poor, the spanish one si really good.The music is beatiful.It's a work of art, highly reccomended, specially if you don't understand what a saint is and what are the merits that make one.The acting is really good, specially considering Father Pio had a complicated italian personallity :-)"
1,Padre Pio Miracle Man This video was FANTASTIC. It was over 3 1/2 hrs and I was rivited. It is a great story and pretty close to article I have read about Padre Pio. Would recommend this highly.
1,"Nothing short of incredible. This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Nothing else needs to be said, whoever watches it will understand."
1,Great story This novel was a very quick read. The characters were well developed and so was the story line. I loved the way it ended it gave the story a close. I recommend this novel to anyone.
1,"Drama, Drama and more Drama This book is a page turner. It will have you guessing about the ending. I wonder who did Ms. Spencer get the male outlook from, but whoever it is is real. The ending is a shocker, but so is the middle and the beginning. It will keep you laughing."
1,Strange Exciting Twist WHEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE is a fantastic book to read on a slow Saturday afternoon. I enjoyed it because I could never have anticipated the twist and turns the story takes. I think Ms. Spencer is on her way to becoming a very popular writer.
1,"Out of sight!!!! An excellent book of ""Cat and Mouse"" (so to speak). I thought this was an excellent book. It was easy reading, interest....A real page turner with a twist."
1,Dont Stop Now....... This was a very exciting book. I finished it in 2 days. I cant wait for the next book.
1,"couldn't stop reading Well my bookclub enjoyed every page of this book she was a new author for us and we got our money worth. Boy Adrian was something else but we knew something wasn't right about her and to do a man like that you are what you are and she didn't have to bring Greg into her life like that, but his mother was a for real women and I'm glad the sister got her head on straight. You will enjoy this book I passed it on and everyone say the same thing I couldn't stop reading."
1,"It may have been predictable, but I couldn't put it down I dont care what was wrong with this book. If I couldn't put it down then that says a lot! I read the other reviews where people were disappointed and all that, but it takes work and commitment to even write a paragraph let alone a book. Camika, don't let those other comments hinder you because I've yet to read their work. YOur book did have flaws but who's book doesn't? All I can say is the book grabbed my attention and I had to finish it no matter what. That's the definition of a good book. I don't like sappy endings either and yours allowed me to come up with my own conclusions. I'm sure Random House is helping you with everything else. I'm forever in your corner because you've done what most of us only dream about."
1,"I laughed, got mad, cried and even screamed. This book was an emotional rollercoaster for me. I bought it and read it in 3 days. By the time I finished I was breathing hard and mad at Adrian. She knew better. Maybe she didn't. I need a sequel!"
1,"Poitier's best ""Lilies of the Field"" is a great movie. Even though it's in black and white, this movie puts the viewer right in the action. If you've attended Catholic school, you can really identify with the toughness of the German nuns. All characters are believable, and the acting is first rate. I heartily recommend this movie to anyone."
1,"Classic This is one of those movies every movie buff should see at least once. This is a feel good movie to watch when you feel life is being too tough on you. I always liked this movie, but it is surprisingly realistic since I met Helga, a 79yo Berliner visiting the States. Mother Superior is NO caricature, they really do come that way."
1,"Amazon order Would buy again from this seller. Item arrived quickly, and in condition described.Thanks so much!"
1,"A Heart-Tugging Look at the Value of One Man at Work A great movie. I don't understand why they don't show it more often. Sidney Poitier's character in this movie harkens back to his performance in ""To Sir with Love."" Also gives a nostalgic look at the American West. If you don't buy this excellent movie, make sure to rent it sometime. You'll enjoy it!"
1,"A really good movie This is a classic, great movie. It's one that is watchable on a repeat basis. Low key but very meaningful. The movie is in black and white but that actually seems to add to it in the same way that the H. Bogart movies 'Casablanca' and 'Sahara' effectively use that medium.The price is right. It's a keeper. Buy it and sit back and enjoy a great performance."
1,Lighthearted Comdey Good movie with comedy thats subtle and not forced or over the top like modern movies. I know most people will not focus on the humor of this movie but it's what I like about it.
1,"Ghost is Back Ghostface a.k.a Tony Starks a.k.a Pretty Tony a.k.a Ironman is back. Although he is with Def Jam now his style has not changed. He is still the real MC we all have come to know and luv. This is real hiphop right here, not your everyday average, Ice and bling type rap CD. All the beats are bangers (a 70's type feel) and the lyrics are straight fire from start to finish. This needs to be in heavy rotation this summer, since alot of people slept on BULLET PROOF WALLETS (another Ghostface album).Wake up cause real hiphop can not be denied.Put away your Nelly, Chingy, and CashMoney CD for a second and listen to this joint.Instant classic right along with Supreme Clientele (another hot Ghostface album)Since the face been revealed game got real for real"
1,"Classic Hip Hop in 2004!! I'm been rocking this one heavy rotation since it dropped.La, La, La, Holla- if you hear me!!!!Holla is one of my favorites, so are Beat the Clock, Biscuits,It's Over, & Be This Way. I really like it all except Missy's verse on Tush (just hit skip after Ghosts 2 verses)."
1,"The Ironman of Hip Hop! This album is the defifnition of a classic. All the elements are there. Tight beats, tight lyrics this is an excellent product. Ghost has elevated the game. Others rappers need to take notes. Get this joint!"
1,Ghostface is the most consistent in the game. Another hot one from the most consistent man in the Wu. Damn that! One of the most consistent in hip-hop period. Hasn't disappointed yet. And this is hip-hop you can feel. Not this old manufractured crap you see all over MTV every five minutes. Ya'll aint ready for Ghost. Keep it up man and tell the rest of the Wu to step it up. I still got love for them.Wu-Tang Forever babythetza
1,"Classic example of the genre I would have to agree with the other review in that this nearly 45 minute performance is flawless for the genre. No audience noises or any indication that it's live... which ranks it up there with any studio output from Main. Beautiful sounds that do more than drone, they lift you. The recording has many layers of guitar sounds that are typical of Main's output of treated guitar for gentle outer space travel. Excellent recording quality too. If you're thinking about getting this one, don't wait as they are out of print and supply is very low!"
1,Great book This book was in excellent condition. I love it. It is a little bit of history with good ideas for today.
1,"Common sense from years ago It is not a book, as such, just several wonderful hints that are great to see in this day and time."
1,"An excellent movie, deserves to be better known It just needs to be said that the movie is what you could expect of having a master, Hopper, playing a character by another, Highsmith, while directed by yet another, Wenders. If you already read Ripley's game, see the movie to find an amazing picture of that odd world depicted by Patricia Highsmith."
1,"Chopped Version of Last Hero In China I agree with Michael Van about the clipped version "" Deadly China Hero"" as I own ""Last Hero in China"" which is the movie in its orginal presentation and with Subtitles. This is actually, if placed in order of sequences by year, the Fourth ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series before OUATIC IV/V came out. Nonetheless, you have to watch this movie as it has, as usual, great martial art scenes. I own all but OUATIC IV and most of Jet Li's DVD's that are available. The 6th version of OUATIC is ""Once upon a Time in China and America"" also starring Jet Li. Though this may be the 4th Jet Li did as Wong Fei-Hung, you do not have to see the three previous OUATIC's. Order is not important with this version of Wong Fei-Hung but the tales of this Martial Artist (a real actual Chinese Hero) is. Get this DVD and try to get ""Last Hero in China"" also. In fact, get every Jet Li movie made. You will not be dissappointed. This man is our replacement for Bruce Lee."
1,"pop up splendor A wonderful book for tiny hands and eyes, moveable parts and simple words, bright, clear illustrations, a must for car and engine obsessed little ones."
1,"Hot Stuff! I bought this item and have been really happy with it! Having my coffee become lukewarm was a real pet peeve, but no more! Every sip is now just the perfect temperature... not hot enough to burn my tongue, but definitely hot, not warm. A caution... if you forget to put your cup on the warmer and your drink does cool down, the warmer is not hot enough to heat it up.Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer"
1,Perfect! Love it.... Now I can enjoy my entire cup of tea or coffee and take my time... Hot to the last drop!
1,"Very Very Good so far this is the best. Please don't expect this heater can heat up your coffee, this is only keep your coffee warm and stay the temperature around 60 to 70 degree."
1,Great item Just what I needed since I drink my coffee really slow and with this cup warmer it keeps my coffee warm to the last drop.
1,"AMAZING, WONDERFUL DEVICE! Sometimes it takes me forever to get to my coffee, and by then it's cold. Cold coffee sucks! So I microwave it 3-4 times a morning and it progressively tastes worse and worse. Well I tell you: it's all the microwave's fault! I just finished the last sip of a coffee that I poured over 6 hours ago, and it was just as warm and delicious as it was 5 hours and 50 minutes ago (see, I really am slow)! Now that I have my Mr Coffee warmer I am a happy, more efficient worker. I need to get another one for my home! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!"
1,Hot Coffee All Day Glad to have found this nifty little device. Works as advertised. Keeps your beverage hot without over-cooking it. I think this would work well with a big mug of soup as well. Can't tell you how many half-consumed mugs of coffee have been saved by this. It's great to pick up my mug an hour after I poured the coffee into it and take a hot swig.
1,"Great Coffee Warmer I bought one of these coffee warmers to keep my coffee warm at the office. It really does the job. Note you cannot pour cold coffee into a mug and expect this device to heat it -- that isn't the purpose. If you set your warm coffee on this heater, get up go get something out of the printer, get distracted talk to people, come back to your desk 15 min later your coffee will still be warm, maybe even hot depending on how hot it was when you poured it in there. I love it. I bought one for home too. The success of the coffee warmer is also dependent on your coffee mug. I find it works best with coffee mugs that have a large surface area at the bottom. I would definitely recommend this product -- I already have, I love it."
1,"Works Great This little warmer works great. It will not really heat a full cup of cold coffee, but it will keep hot coffee very hot, and will heat up a half cup of coffee very well."
1,AWESOME! I use this at work. Turn it on before you go to get your coffee in the breakroom. Best if the cup/coffee is already warm.
1,"I like it! I like this product enough to specifically turned my computer on to write a review. It worked better than expected and kept my beverage warm. It's a mug warmer so, no, it doesn't bring your beverages to a boil (I seem to have read complaints that it doesn't heat up their beverages, though that could be for a similar product.) I think my tea was actually a bit hotter than the original temperature when I pulled it out of the microwave and put it on the warmer. I am just very happy that my tea doesn't turn cold within 5-10 minutes."
1,"Hot Coffee This is the 4th mugwarmer that I have bought - still using the other 3 in different places. Had a hard time trying to find one in the stores, so I was thankful to find one on Amazon.com. I selected this one because it was a good price and seemed more substantial than the others. So far it works great - no complaints at all. My other mugwarmers are white. I like the black color because it seems to blend better with my nice wooden office desk. I would recommend it!"
1,"Mr Coffee you are a legend! I shipped this product to the southern most tip of Africa because nothing comparable was available locally.I fitted the power converter necessary to cater for our 220v, and I now have seriously hot coffee available 24/7.To even boost the heat retention more, I'm using an enamel cup with a lid to keep the heat in.Nothing compares.All in, the shipping + power converter cost more than the cup warmer, but it was worth every cent.Very happy customer.Tam"
1,Must have for the office! This has got to be one of the best office companions ever! It really does work! It does its job of keeping my coffee/tea warm. A very good buy and must have!
1,"coffee mug warmer Ok, so I never finished my coffee before I got this since it always got cold. (Nothing like cold java on a winter's day with the a/c on in the office.) So, I gave this gadget a shot. If you are a coffee sipper like me and don't gulp your coffee in 2 minutes, this is the perfect product for you. It keeps hot cocoa, coffee, and tea and even cup-a-soups at the perfect sipping temperature.The only drawback is that once you are almost done with your drink, you must remember to turn off the switch. Can't blame the manufacturer, though. I forgot to shut mine off and a couple of hours later, my half a cup of coffee became a shot of espresso. Not so yummy."
1,"GREAT GREAT GREAT! I finally found a cup warmer that actually keeps my coffee hot! I have a very narrow threshold of how hot I like my coffee (piping hot, if it gets even remotely cooler, I can't stand it). This unit keeps it at nearly the optimal temperature.To further optimize my coffee temperature control, I bought a Titanium coffee mug from REI (very thin with great heat transfer) for about 30$. This set-up is perfect. I can walk away from my desk for any amount of time and return to a perfectly hot cup!You do have to start with a hot cup of joe to begin with though."
1,"Love it for my desk at work I got this for my desk at work so I could nurse my coffee without it getting cold. I love it. My coffee stays warm, and I see no signs of burning/damage on the bottom of my mug. My dad uses one at night for his tea while watching TV. A great gadget, especially for people who are hard to shop for.UPDATE: I've had this item for a year and half. I use it about 3x a week, and it still works great."
1,Just what I needed at the office I wanted to cut down on the amount of coffee I drank and realized one of the main reasons why I top-off is because it cooled down. Once I got my mug warmer I can now happily sip my cup of coffee throughout the day and it keeps it at just the right temperature. Not blazingly hot but just under that. I've been using it 5 days a week 10 hours a day for 2 months and it has been a solid performer.
1,"This has made my dreams come true. I am constantly having to make trips to the microwave to heat up my tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. I'm a slow drinker, I can't help it. I don't like to gulp my drinks I like to enjoy them. Sometimes for over an hour! And I have high temperature standards. I like my beverages borderline scalding. That being said, I had doubts that this little gadget would keep my beverages HOT (not warm). It does a great job. Other reviewers are correct in that it will not reheat cold beverages but if you put them on the warmer when they are already hot enough to your liking, it will keep it that way for hours. Highly recommend for any slow drinkers out there. Should have gotten one years ago.Update: it's also useful for keeping a small teapot with tea in it warm for hours. I have a little ceramic tea pot that holds maybe 3 cups of liquid. If you make sure the tea is extra hot when you put it in the pot, it will stay pretty warm for a long time."
1,"Best of stays warmer coffee cup! Mr. Coffee had a very good warmer coffee on my mug cup. Before I bought it, I was usually my mug cup of coffee only warmer less than 10 min to become cold coffee, I was put it in a microwave to reheater mug cup then they went become cold after 15 mins. Now, I use a warmer heater which is stayed warmer till fill it up a coffee will stays warmer an hour, hour, hour forever is excellent it so much. I love it so much better than life without warmer."
1,"He Loves it! I gave it to my boss for Christmas, his coffee was always getting cold because he's too busy to drink it right away. Now he always has a hot, hot cup of coffee.He Loves it!Kathy"
1,"Why in the world isn't this writer/director world famous? This is a wonderful movie, and to think it is a debut film. Man. I had seen ""The Magdalene Sisters"" twice,and loved it so much that I looked up the director, found this movie, and ordered it on Netflix. It startsoff sort of slow, but gathers speed and intensity, and winds up a home run. This writer/director shouldbe working. His NOT working robs me of pleasure. Mr. Mullan, if ever you check these things (and I knowfamous people sometimes do), for the love of God get off your rump and get to work. If you drink stop. Ifyou drug it, stop. If you're just plain lazy, get some gumption. If you've been this good on your first twofilms, you could be a world-beater.Get back to work. Please. (And the actors are great, down to the tiniest part. Just dynamite stuff all around)."
1,"The accent rocks! This movie makes great audio. I can't wait for Scottish Independence so we can see kilts in the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony parade. But until then, England should include a Scottish audio option on all their movies and television program(me)s. This movie comes with English subtitles. The first part is reminiscent of After Hours and the ending is a peaceful one."
1,Thank you Jennifer! This was the first book by Jennifer Crusie that i have read and i just loved it. i had got hold of this book on a very 'bad day'. I was very depressed. it was not easy to make me laugh but this book did it. i laughed out loud... and it felt very good! As from now Crusie is my favorite romance writer. Thank you jennifer for writing this book!
1,"Magick for REAL people!!! This is a great book...It's filled with a hundred spells from various cultures, religions and traditions that work independent of any specific culture, religion or tradition. What's wonderful about it, is that Draja focuses on making magick PRACTICAL. How refreshing! A lot of the spells are simple to perform and require items that are easily available to most people. There are a few spells that i find to be rather peculiar or overly time-consuming, but they're an interesting read at the least. He provides practical spells for most of the situations that people encounter in their daily lives...money, health, jobs, luck, relationships, etc. He does have a slight paternal tone in telling people not to alter the spells, but i take that to simply be a guardrail for the novice magick user. It's a great little sourcebook for spells and as inspiration to help you create your own. Definately a ""must-have"" for me! =))"
1,"Definite ""thumbs up"" An excellent little collection of spells. Not wicca or CM, so if you're looking for those you might be more pleased with some other selection. But it's good solid folk magic, largely of a mixed African and European flavor.I wouldn't say the book is indispensable for the advanced or intermediate practitioner. It's largely addressed at the beginner. But it's a pleasant read, well organised, and contains more useful practical spells than most books on the market these days.I definitely class it as a good value, especially at the price."
1,Good deal Purchased this for my 2000 Windstar; price was about 40% cheaper than local parts store for same item. Have had no issues at all with this.
1,"Kare Kano RULES! This is one of the best animes, I believe, so far in the history of anime. Kareshi Kanojo No Jijou (His and Her Situation) [...] It opens with the begining ""warning"" music and then leads straight to the opening song. Then it has several tracks of BEAUTIFUL instrumental music. The next actual vocal song you hear is the ""S.O.S"" song. I think that's one of my favorites because of the situation they played it in on the show.(When Arima huged Miyazawa) KAWAII! Then you have more breath taking music. The next ""song"" is a song (dunno what it's called) about monsters that all of Miyazawa's new friends sing. My favorite part is when Tsubasa shouts out. I crack up every time I hear it! Then you have both versions of the ending theme song. But if you have a chance to get this CD, it's totally worth it! Not to mention the cover artwork is very cool. It features evrybody. *-* Ja'ne! ~Aya-chan"
1,This is a great little CD I was really pleased after purchasing this CD. Had heard Derryl in person a couple of times and thought he was good. His CD shows his versatility and there wasn't one tune I didn't love. He is also a great performer.
1,Fantastic combo of Rocksteady originals & U-Roy toasting This double CD is fantastic value. The second CD is the best rocksteady compilation I have heard so far: lots of Paragons classics. The first CD is about the best intro to U-Roy you could buy and as he is the granddaddy of DJ toasting a good place to start. As there are nearly 30 tracks on each disc this adds to the value. The only doubt you might have is that it can sometimes be a bit wearing to listen to a whole disc of a single DJ's toasting. But hey! You could play the rocksteady disc all day long and never tire of it!
1,"Sturdy Bench I am 6'1"". This bench is a very good fit. It feels sturdy and stable when lifting. There is a good span between the uprights to ensure your hands don't hit when replacing the bar. It was easy to assemble. I have decided to remove the leg lift, but it was not in the way. The padding is comfortable and seems durable. I would definitely recommend this bench for a daily workout."
1,"Great bench for the money I bought this bench for my husband as a gift. I'm pretty impressed with the sturdiness so far. It took me over 2 hours to assemble by myself and there were a couple errors in the instructions but nothing I couldn't figure out pretty easily. Overall, a fantastic bargain. He was thrilled."
1,"Useful and Engaging Review Book As an educational consultant who advises kids about finding and applying to New York City schools, I frequently recommend this top Sci High prep book. Arak, the author and a longtime Princeton Review instructor, writes engagingly, and explains to students exactly what they need to know to improve their scores on this competitive test. As a classroom teacher as well as a graduate of another selective public school (Hunter), Arak knows his material. eglickman@abacusguide.com"
1,"Yoko Kanno,you're the greatest!!! I just got to say that one of the reasons Macross Plus and Cowboy Bebop succeded were not only because they are great anime but because of their great music score.Yoko Kanno is a master in composing any great song.She uses an unique and unrealistic language in most of them though(That's the reason I like After in the Dark and Pulse so much,it's all about emotions)U just won't believe it till u finally listen to it.I haven't been able to buy it though,I can't find it anywhere(Amazon.com got it though ^^)but I'd listen to every single song on the internet and all of them are great."
1,Thanks Thank you for answering my questions and sending the product in a timely manner as it was described to me.
1,"Brink of time= best vgmusic i have ever heard The brink of time add on cd to the chrono trigger osv was better than the original itsself. The orchestration by yasunori mitsuda was simply amazing, he truly is a master of vgmusic. I would in all ways say he is equal to or better than N. Umetsu (final fantasy). This is a truly captivating cd."
1,"Best season yet! My daughter and I have been watching all the seasons together. After season 8, we were feeling done with the series but couldn't quite let go. Are we ever glad we didn't! This was an action packed season and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,"Great show This show lasted for 10 seasons! It was a little silly, but I believe that was intentional. Tom Welling will forever be my favorite Superman! He's the perfect choice. The package arrived on time and in good condition."
1,"Love it. Buy all seasons for $9.99 each and save about $50 compared to buying the ""complete collection"". Just search each season and look for the $9.99 version. It's the same as the complete collections, but cheaper."
1,"Smallville Rocks!!!!!!! The condition was awesome, the price definately nice and all the inserts were there. I would definately trust these guys as far as condition goes. Very timely shipping as well before the stated recieve date. Thanks!"
1,Great Customer Service! Amazon's customer service was beyond wonderful when contacted for this specific item. They worked with me to make sure I was treated fairly and to make sure I was happy. I will definitely continue to shop with Amazon for this particular reason!
1,birthday gift I am always satisfied with this show. I get a season every birthday and Christmas for my brother. Thankfully I'm almost to the end of the list. He really loves the extra footage and interviews.
1,"Wondertwin Powers... Activate! Awesome episode if you know who the wonder-twins are. They even had the monkey, mistakes, and really good intentions. I kept waiting for one of them to say how they wanted to be ""super friends"" with Clark or Chloe."
1,"<3 Smallville <3 I love my movie. I can't wait till I own the whole collection, which should be very very soon. You could say I'm Smallville obsessed."
1,Smallville I've got all of the Smaville seasons and have enjoyed them all. I'm disappointed that the show is ending. I like the characters and the plots.
1,"Golden Earrings One of the better WWII romantic movies, one of my 3 favorites. It has excitement, surprise, romance, mystery. Everything that makes a great war story!!! Miss Marlene & Mr. Ray are at their best!"
1,"Delightful! If you enjoy acting and song, this is a must! Marlene's superb acting delighted me through the whole movie. She was enchanting and endearing as this Gypsy character. The gravity of the war times was made easier to watch. If you've not seen this please do settle down for a very enjoyable fun time with these wonderful characters and music."
1,"Quick Delivery. Quality Replacement Part. The replacement battery cartridge arrived a day early, was in great condition, and contained APC batteries as described. As a busy Network Administrator, receiving the correct replacement part as described and a day early is the best case scenario. Thank you."
1,"Excellent music and movie The film has a nice flow and plot. The music is great. It is all geared toward the Italian familia. I love Cher, Nicholas Cage, and Olivia Dukacas in it. They gave great performances. I already loved La Boheme prior to seeing the movie and bought the CD of the movie soundtrack. Anyone wanting to see an enjoyable movie and listen to great music should put this high on your list. It is entertaining and holds your interest, unlike a lot of other movies. It used to be a 4-star movie and is now rated a 3-star movie - but a high 3-star. It is a classic that will be viewed over and over. The music of Puccini will live forever. Once you see the movie, the music flows from scene to scene in your mind.A must buy CD."
1,"Good experience I received this is great condition and early! No problems whatsoever. Also, the price was very reasonable. I would order from this vendor again."
1,Brilliant This is my 10th time screening this incredible movie and now I have the option of buying it in DVD. Bravo toCher and Norman Jewison and Ms. Dukakis
1,"Moonstruck is terrific Moonstruck is one of the best gems that's been on the screen---ever. Cher, Nick Cage, Danny Aiello, Olympia Dukakis all put in great performances in this Brooklyn romance, set in today's world, but timeless in it's tale of love. A true romantic comedy with some pricelss one liners in it. And all the time, the wonderful music of Puccini in the background. A must see. END"
1,"Sophistication Under The Moonlight Yes dear viewer, Moonstruck provides the most sophisticated elements of a good movie could offer. A great story, excellent performers and the fabulous music of Puccini. END"
1,"Humor and Melancholy and Surprise A full cycle of emotions while watching real artists deliver their craft. Cher is beautiful, humorous and devilish while themen in her life complicate it and compliment it."
1,"Struck by Moonstruck I am a Cher fan. Always was and always will be. That said, I haven't always been a fan of her movies. But this one regardless weather Cher is in it or not is a true classic in every way possible. I must have seen this movie 50 times over the last 12 years and still never tire of it. I use many a catch fraise often from the movie that have become part of my everyday language. This story reminds me of my childhood as I came from a typical Italian family and we all acted very much the same way and lived in the Jersey side of NY in a 3 story house with a view of the Hudson. This movie is dead on the character, the vibe and the humor! If you haven't seen Moonstruck, you don't know what you're missing. I might add, this is one of Nick Cages finest performances!Rich"
1,MOONSTRUCK This movie is funny and well written. If you like to laugh and love a love story buy this movie.
1,"Chao Bella... ""When you love 'em they drive you crazy because they know they can"" is just one of so many truthful, poignant, memorable lines from this intelligent, warm, grown-up story. This isn't just a movie, it's the tradition of story telling at it's finest. The music, settings, and characters tell such a fine, truthful tale, I swear I can smell the food in the kitchen, dining room, or restaurant - you'll see what I mean when you see the movie!"
1,"ONE OF MY FAVORITES I never grow tired of seeing this movie. I am not sureif it is because I am Italian and can relate to so many of the scenes and actions, or if it is the excellent acting that Cher,Nicolas Cage and the others put forth in their roles.A love story that grabs your attention from the first act and holds you glued to your seat throughout the movie.Tender, sweet and loving, yet tinted with such true to life raw emotions. Outstanding.This is one movie that no one should miss seeing! Excellent!"
1,"movie I am a Romantic at heart, love a good love story. Been a Cher fan since day one and she was on TV."
1,A hit with seniors I recently took a bus load of seniors on a bus trip. The trip was 3 hours long. We usually have a movie to show so the time goes faster. I picked Moonstruck. It was very funny and very light hearted. It was quite a hit. The seniors were mostly Italian and they really enjoyed the movie. Some of them missed it when it came out quite a few years ago. It's the first time they showed appreciation of a movie by clapping. I was very pleased.
1,"Perfect This is perhaps the most romantic movie I have ever seen. But don't let the word romantic turn you away-this movie is hilarious. There is something in this movie for everyone. Cher and Olympia are great and both deserved the Oscar. It's not full of fluff or trash-it's the perfect date movie.also reccomended: Moulin Rouge, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, About a Boy.*"
1,"A modern day classic ""Moonstruck"" is one of my all time favorite films. Frothy, romantic, and poignant, this film is one to watch over and over again. All of the characters are loveable and endearing. I feel like I am part of the Castarini family every time I watch it. The script is absolutely perfect. Every line is quotable. One of my favorites is Rita's wry, ""Cosmo can't OWN the moon!"" Puccini's gorgeous melodies from ""La Boheme"" make the perfect musical backdrop for this contemporary masterpiece. A gem!"
1,Lots of Fun to Read Growing up I heard a lot of folk tales about Paul Bunyan. I was very amused by those stories. This book puts them all together for me. Very enjoyable to read. Lots of fun in these pages.
1,The Holy Spirit DR. Graham brings The Holy Spirit alive. It is a easy read in a descriptive and understanding language.The book goes in to detail to explain how the Holy Spirit can be experienced in your life.
1,Great - awesome- enlightening. Indepth discussion of the Hoy Spirit and how He is applicable in our lives and how He is not for Great - awesome- enlightening. Indepth discussion of the Hoy Spirit and how He is applicable in our lives and how He is not for the future but for now
1,"No leaks for a big boy I've had a lot of trouble finding a paper diaper that fits my 29 1/2"" long, 23lb 7 month old boy, he's a wiggler, jumper, tosser, turner, and roller, but these seem to fit really well. We've had no poo up the back (even when he poo'd while jumping in his bouncer) and no leaks overnight, both of which were problems before. I haven't had any rashes from chemicals, dyes, or perfumes which was also a problem with other brands in the past."
1,"I LOVE Pampers Baby Dry I am the mother of 4 ranging in ages 1-16 and I have always used Pampers, they are the best. I have tried them all and none of them compare to Baby Dry. I don't have a problem with leaking, they don't tear easily, they have a nice sent, and they are affordable. What else could you ask for?"
1,"Great diapers! I really like these diapers! I had fewer leaks with these than with the Pampers Swaddlers, and while I like the contoured fit of the Huggies Pure and Natural, I loved the super absorbency of these. They hold a LOT! My baby is a heavy wetter, and we almost never have a leak with these. Even though they are not as stretchy, I find that they fit just fine compared to the Huggies, and for the price difference and absorbency, I would choose these."
1,Easy Purchase....Great Savings! Thanks to Amazon I no longer have to run to the store to get diapers they just show up on my doorstep! And the savings is great!
1,"Great Buy I have tried Huggies, Pampers and Loves, so far Pampers by far were the best, and for this price of only .17 cents per diaper its a Great Deal! I have priced around and didnt find a better deal for this size. Very Happy"
1,"great price and condition Just noticed I could buy open box pampers for cheaper, this arrived just the outside was opened, but who cares we any how dont keep the box, the pampers where closed in original package."
1,Pampers are the best disposable diapers While I prefer the cruisers it's really not a big deal because the baby dry work just as well they're just not as cute.
1,"excellent diapers It doesn't leak, stay dry for a long time, and above all, has a thinner layer that provides flexibility to my daughter's movement. Strongly recommend it."
1,"Love these! Great for my twins! We have 5-month old B/G twins. I love these diapers. They are thin, yet they protect very well. We haven't had diaper rash yet and will hopefully stay that way. But I do rinse them off almost every time they poop. We tried huggies and they just didn't hold up - too bulky and too many leaks. So go with these!"
1,"Pampers work! I find pampers work better for longer leaner babies, toddlers than for chunky babies. Less leakage. Huggies work better for chunky babies."
1,Very fast delivery and cheap! It was so fast delivery only for 3 days and with free shipping also without any tax.It's cheap then everywhere.
1,"I love pampers No leaks, no blow outs!! I also love them because it's easy to tell if she has wet or not, other brands are so thick it's kinda hard to tell."
1,"Good price when you subscribe Awesome value, better price than Costco SAMs club. We just subscribed using the trial feature and tried it out. Value buy, enjoy."
1,"Good for babies who move around I love pampers it's durable. I didn't like it when my baby was 2,3 months old because when he poops it leaks in the back. After he started sitting down and walking it is the perfect diaper for him"
1,"AWESOME overnight protection LOVE these diapers!! My 8 month old daughter was leaking through her diapers until we found these!!! No more wet sheets in the morning!!! AND, you CAN'T beat 222 diapers for 30 bucks!!! LOVE AmazonMom!!!"
1,"Great - Be sure to get a larger size! We think that these are great diapers. Virtually never have a blowout.What we learned is that the weight recommendation on the box should generally be ignored. The size 5 packaging says 27+ lbs. Our baby started wearing these at around 16-18 lbs.It's really very simple. When the diaper gets full, there's no more room...thus the blowout.With our first child (using the size/weight recommendations), blowouts and ruined clothing were a regular occurance. With our second child (ignoring the size weight recommendations), blowouts are a rarity."
1,"wonderful diapers great value, great diaper, my 21 month old daughter leaked in every other brand except PAMPERS, i love pampers brand, however i did have to buy a size 5 in the Pampers and in other brands she could wear a size 4 but i wont buy any other brand now."
1,Questions? I subscribed to getting diapers once a month. My question is how can I go in and change the size? My daughter is a size three now but will be in a four pretty soon.
1,"Good price gr8 shipping time Pampers is the best brand available as compared to others pampers is the best but buying pampers from amazon made my life easy.i dont have to rush to the stores to buy the same box with a higher price,and absolutely loved amazon when i saw the box delivered after 1 day."
1,"Best Diapers! This is absolutely the best way to get diapers. Auto ship: 2 boxes per month. In a science fair experiment at our elementary school a 3rd grade student compared Luvs, Huggies, a local store diaper, and Pampers. Pampers won out and this is one item that I stick to!"
1,"good product Good as diaper lasts long. Good during travel and keeps dry, no body rashes. Good for boys under 8 months."
1,"Love the product and the service! We couldn't be happier with the Pampers products in general. We've had some nasty ""messes"" on our hands and these keep everything well contained AND are thin for our little man to move around comfortably."
1,"No leaks, best diaper on the market! I've been using Pampers Baby Dry diapers ever since my daughter was born 2 years ago. These don't ever leak on us, and blow-outs non-existent. They feel soft and seem comfortable. I've heard about babies getting rashes with the Dry Max line, but these seem great for sensitive bottoms."
1,great service it was fast Service and cheap for the amount of diapers I can always pick Amazon for these kind of deliverys ......cool
1,good excellent experience with pampers. i always use pampers only to my son since his birth. pampers is a nice product
1,"Got what I expected Received the diapers as expected and had no issues. Ordering online was convenient and price was good too. Pampers Baby Dry feels soft. When wet the diapers feel very gel like, don't like that feeling though."
1,"Great deal on pampers We prefer Pampers diapers & these (at least at the time) were a great deal. No complaints. Don't think they last 12 hr though, but none do."
1,"Love these diapers!!! I've been trying different brands and so far Pampers baby -Dry are my favorite. They are soft, durable, last through the night without leaking, and overall, just very convenient. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,"i loved this item i loved this item but i gonna move out of the country , so i had to cancel. My baby never had problem with these diapers.thanks."
1,"Love these diapers These diapers have been my go to with both my children. They do not leak overnight, and do not cause any skin irritation like other diapers. If you are looking for a quality diaper, order Baby Dry diapers!"
1,"Cheapest I can find - even compared to the wholesale stores! Great product, arrives on time in a perfect box each time. Can't beat the great price!"
1,Great Product We use Pampers and this product was great for us! It arrived quickly as Amazon promised and was by far the best in affordability. Would recommend to a friend.
1,"""caterpillar"" flex tabs delivered by Amazon 5/07 Just for those worried (like I was) about getting old non-flextab diapers from ordering this product: I ordered a 160-pack, size 4, in May, and they were the newest version, not the old ones with non-flexible tabs."
1,"perfect diaper ive been purchasing diapers for years.these are perfect they are soft,absorb well even at night.they work better than the new cruisers.i have bought these and cruisers,the old ones worked well.the new ones leak everywhere especially infront.i have never had a poo leak from these diapers.unless your child has diarrhea there shouldnt be any leaks.these are also a better value than the cruisers."
1,"Best diapers! Best diapers ever! Believe me, with my two kids I tried a lot! Good leakage protection, thin (what is very good for summer)."
1,"Very Good Pampers diapers are the best diapers. I would not recommend any other brand of diapers. No matter what stage and/or size your child is, this brand works the best."
1,GREAT DIAPERS. I love them on my 14month baby she was using these before bit then started using pamper crusiers but they were a tad bit more expensive when these do the exact same thing. there great hold alot. PAMPERS ARE BETTER THAN HUGGIES.I TRIED THEM AND HAD A HORRIBLE EXPIERNCE. MY BABY WOULDNT HAVE THEM ON EVEN ON 20 MIN WHEN SHE WOULD BE LEAKING. THESE DIAPERS LAST HER GREAT ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT REAL FULL (: BUT NO LEAKING. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THEM
1,PAMPERS I only bought pampers because I heard they are the best.. however im rethinking that due to all the poop explosions my daughter has in them
1,Good quality diapers This is a good quality product. The leakage is almost none. We have been using it for quite some time now and are very satisfied.
1,"Pampers Baby Dry work for us! Pampers Baby Dry are the best diapers around for daytime use in my opinion. We tried many other kinds before and these were the only ones that would hold in all of my daughter's pee. Wish they were cheaper, but otherwise they're great!"
1,Deal on diapers Recieved diapers in a good time frame. Recieved deal with diapers on sale and no shipping.
1,"Great Diaper Diaper works great - my son is dry till morning. Thin diapers. Only bad is on two occasions, we have had the tape break on us ."
1,"great diaper pampers is the best! We tried other brand (maybe the no. 2 brand), but we came back to pampers and would not try any others."
1,I love this brand! I love using baby dry on my five month old.. they never leak and my baby sleep from 8pm and I dont change his paper until 5:30 am. I love that they fit just fine not to big not to small. I love these pampers so much that I usually buy a convenience pack instead of buying them separately on the store. I recommend this brand to any mommas out there. Plus they have gifts to grow~ you enter a code and you earn points and then you could buy stuff for free.
1,"Great diapers I don't know why people complain about these diapers vs the Pampers cruisers. the only time I have leaks with my 8 month old is when she has an excessively large BM....not that often, and Cruisers wouldn't do much better. When she was littler, I wasted my money buying the swaddlers line for my daughter. The truth is, she doesn't know that difference, and would rather have me put the savings toward her college education."
1,diapers and wipes Had no issues whatsoever and the products came as scheduled in great condition. Much better than driving to the store for diapers and wipes and here I am saving money. I wish I knew about this sooner!
1,Satisfied Love pampers and this is a great way to buy them. Price is great and I don't have to walk down the diaper isle every week!
1,great price and great product Great price. better than any other shops around here. Great product too.All my family and friends love this product as well.
1,"Awesome overnight diapers! To be honest, when I first read the box (when my son was a newborn), I thought to myself, why would I ever keep my baby in one diaper for 12 hours (ewwwwww!) but the second he began sleeping through the night, I figured it out (hah!).These diapers are great and we have never had a morning blow outs, despite our son sleeping 12+ hours a night and definitely releasing a lot of substance into the diaper during that time. Moreover, he tends to roll several times at night and gets up and plays actively in his crib for a while (before we realize he is up) and even so, with all the movement, bouncing and a full diaper, there haven't been any leaks.We've put him in other diapers overnight and he's blown through all of those."
1,Great diaper at a great price with Amazon subscribe and mom club Not much to say. They do what they are supposed to. Earlier we tried the discount diapers and they didn't fare too well. Dealing with a few blowouts and peeing through some diapers at night we came back to pampers. You really can tell the quality after using discount brands. I am sure others have the same feeling for other brands but Pampers works well for us. Awesome delivery and price with Amazon Mom and subscribe and save.
1,great These diapers are great for my 2 year old. We haven't had any leaking issues and they are much softer than the huggies she used to have.
1,"Diapers Cheaper than purchasing in the store. Comes to my house, and it is always a better price. What's not to love?"
1,pampers I love just being able to buy diapers for the month from Amazon and it saves me a lot of money and trips to the store.
1,Best there is..better than the new Cruisers Pampers Baby Dry have been our choice for our 2 year old since he outgrew the Swaddlers. We liked the old Cruisers too and we used to switch back and forth between cruisers and baby dry. But I'm not very fond of the new Dry Max Crusiers. So we have started using Pampers Baby Dry exclusively and have been very happy.
1,"love it I love this diapers. They can hold pretty good. And no rash ever. My baby is turning 6 months, only the first box of diapers I did not buy from Amazon. Good deal,A+"
1,The best! I have tried multiple diapers and these work the best. They have the best fit and are great for overnight sleepers.
1,a good choice It's a good choice. Help me to save some money.It's good enough to keep dry for about 5 hours or up and it's much cheaper than the rest of pampers.
1,"This was a prompt and cost effective answer for busy moms This was a great option for diapers.It easy, quick, and they come right to your door!"
1,"fast shipping. I notice so many people complain the shipping problems, I just want to tell my experience, I ordered it on 22,Oct,2004, and received on 27,Oct,2004. What a fast shipping!!!"
1,good choice I used a coupon 2$ off. good price. I look forward to better offer next time ro so. maybe... df
1,"I love Pampers Baby Dry Pampers Baby Dry diapers are amazing. They absorbe everything and do just what they say, stay dry. None of those little jelly beads like in other diapers. They hold up to their name. They also smell wonderful with that fresh baby powder scent. Thisa is a great purchase and a great deal."
1,diapers I save from .04 to.07 per diaper (depending on sizes I have autoshipped and mr mom deductions) as opposed to walmart's price. This adds up to a minimum savings of $7.68 per box up to well over $10 per box on smaller sizes. I have 3 in diapers.
1,Very Comfortabke for the little ones Pampers are the best for your little ones. The diaper absorb the moisture very well and keep kids skin dry. Surely recommend it.
1,They did what diapers do... What can I say...they performed their duties as expected. I like the Pampers diapers and will continue to use them.
1,"What a deal! I have tried many types of diapers on my five children and Pampers are by far my favorite! They provide the best leak proof coverage and are slim enough that people have thought my older kids were already potty trained. With 30% off through Amazon Mom, these diapers are even cheaper than Parent's Choice. And they are delivered straight to your door! You can't beat that!"
1,"Subscribe & Save Really Works!!! Love the Baby Dry diapers w/o dry max! Cruisers have the new dry max which broke my son's little bottom out with sore like blisters. Glad Pamper's is still making this on w/o dry max!Best part about his diaper box was the price! With subscribe and save program and signing up for amazon mom I will get 30% off diapers and free shipping. This price simply cannot be beat, even at membership clubs!Great job amazon! Diapering baby just got cheaper!"
1,Good one .. Quality as usual good .. very goodBest thing is cost - Lowest anywhere when you take advantage of 10$ off of 49$
1,"no issues here I have used pampers since my 10 month old was born. Initially I used the swaddles sensitive, which was great because they had the strip that changed colors when the baby is wet. But now I use the baby dry and have been very happy. Pampers came highly recommended to me, and I highly recommend them to other Moms!"
1,"Absolutely the best for my baby, but expensive After trying several brands only pampers are working for my baby since he has very sensitive skin.I wish they were cheaper but they are definitely the best!"
1,"The Best Diapers for our Munchkin We love these diapers. They keep our little munchkin very dry. At seven months, he's never had a diaper rash. He's been sleeping through the night since two months and ends up with some VERY wet diapers by morning. So to never have had a diaper rash, I am super impressed. As for ""blow-outs,"" I can't comment. Our poor little guy tends to be constipated... But as my sister would tell you, there may not be a diaper out there that can handle some babies' blow-outs.My only advice to parents that think these are too leaky is to try another size before switching. My son is so tall that he'll have to go up a size before the weight guidlines indicate they'll fit. We know it's time to go up a size when he does have lots of leaks."
1,"Very happy with Pampers Baby Dry We have tried a variety of different diapers on our newborn, and these are our favorite. Our baby has never had any issues with leaking or blow outs with these diapers, and they hold so much that we don't have to worry if he sleeps through the night. We definitely prefer these over the Huggies diapers, and I believe we even like them more than the Pampers Swaddlers."
1,"soft and very nice i love these diapers, also they are at a great price. they leak at night sometimes if the baby pees tons of times, which is very normal."
1,"Only disposable that's ever worked for us! I mostly use cloth diapers during the day, but for overnight and going out, I go with disposables. We're on our 3rd baby now, and over the years Pampers has been the ONLY disposable diaper that we can rely on! Have tried cheaper brands sometimes - they're cheaper for a reason! Pampers has consistently given us a diaper that we can count on not leaking. Store brands, Luvs, Huggies have all failed us multiple times, just leak really bad or tear easily. I am rarely brand-loyal, but Pampers is now the only brand of disposable I'll buy. Pampers is a good quality disposable for the times that you need it (I still recommend using mostly cloth and more natural products though!)"
1,"great diaper I have been ordering this for my baby girls. Once tried other brands, but never satisfied until using this one. This is a high quality diaper. Amazon is a great place for shopping diaper since it is free shipping."
1,Keeps Kids Dry We have 4 boys and all of them have used Pampers as they are the only ones that we have found that do not leak for them. The price is wonderful on here as well using Amazon Mom and Subscribe and Save.
1,"Excellent diaper I'm now a mom of twin boys and I have an older daughter. I like other diapers as well but for different reasons. I've used Pampers, Huggies, Babies R Us brand, Seventh Generation, Luvs, Target Brand, and many more.My daughter has always been a bit larger in the hip size and I recommend both the Pampers Baby dry and Huggies. Now, that she is older and almost potty trained we still use these in size 5 and they fit great and hold everything in. She can even put these diapers on all by herself! I like the fact that you can get size 5 for $.14 a piece via Subscribe and Save and using Amazon Mom for free shipping. This is the best deal!"
1,Baby Dry stays DRY overnight!! Pampaers is my go to diaper and the Baby Dry keeps my baby dry thru the night! Extremely pleased with the product and the pricing on Amazon Mom!!
1,"great price, quality and to the door service I have shopped around and this is the best deal for the top quality diapers out there. The time of the free delivery of the diapers from Amazon varies with my two orders. The first time it took a couples of weeks and the second time it arrived in a couple of days. So you should plan ahead to order these big package diapers. But in my opinion, it is well worth it!"
1,Love Pampers Diapers I love pampers diapers. we tried all brands including some store brands and these were by far my favorite. my child will always be a pampers baby
1,love Pampers baby dry is the only brand that works for my baby... them keep her dry and we have never had leaks!
1,"Great diapers I have been using these diapers for my daughter for almost a year now. They are excellent and I almost never have any issues with leakes. I use them both daytime and night. With Prime shipping, they are at my door so quick. Its very convenient, and the box lasts for a month!"
1,"convenience, convenience, convenience i love subscribe and save!!! i never buy diapers or wipes at the store anymore! and of course, great value!!!"
1,"Best diapers for us I haven't really strayed from Pampers since my son was born - each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand, they didn't work as well (tabs not restickable, not as absorbent, etc) and we went back to Pampers. I discovered Baby Dry because we were in Mexico and that was the type of Pampers they had in the Costco there - baby dry is great - they are thin and super absorbent. Amazon is the best place to buy them - especially if you use subscribe and save."
1,"Great Diapers for my Little Guy! This product is a good value, and Pampers Baby Dry work best for my son. They don't leak, despite the fact he is a super wetter, and I love the Caterpillar Flex sides. Cute Sesame Street designs as well."
1,Never disappointed My daughter is 2 years old and we have always used Panpers. I may spend a little bit more but it is worth it for no leaks - ever!
1,"AL We always love these diapers, they move well with our 14 month old and don't spill. The large pack makes the price per diaper significantly less, and with shipping right to your door who could ask for a better deal."
1,Fast shipment at a good price The convenience of ordering diapers and having them delivered free in two days (with Prime shipping) makes me doubt I'll ever go back to buying diapers at the store.
1,Great price!!! I always search for the cheapest name brand diapers and this is it!!! With the economy the way it is and the bigger the baby gets the less diapers you get this is great!!!! Affordable and they work great!!! I was using the cruisers but I needed to cut down my expenses so this helps some.
1,Pampers > Huggies We only buy Pampers because of multiple incidents with Huggies and blowouts. The Pampers just feel like better quality.
1,Great diapers! These diapers have great absorbency.I do not change her diaper in the middle of the night(she sleeps 11 hours)and there are no leaks and no diaper rashes.
1,love it my baby stays dry and happy all the time i only use pampers especially the 222 count which is a real value
1,Love pampers!! I am a mom to 7 kids with our 8th on the way. We have used pampers for years. We trust that they are the best and know from experience that it's worth the money. They are gentle on skin and leak proof! Don't waste time trying any other diapers I have tried them all and nothing compares to pampers quality!
1,awesome! I save a lot of money It is better to buy in bulk like this than the small one. I saved a lot of money and didn'y worry to run out of diaper anytime soon.
1,"Best diapers ever! Since our daughter was born, we used only Pampers diapers. They cost a little bit more than the ""generic"" ones, but you get what you pay for. They fit well and no liquid ever ""dripped-out"" of them. Go with Pampers and you cannot be wrong."
1,"Pampers are best Have tried all diapers. My boys leak out of all except these baby dry pampers, didn't try the cruisers since they are more expensive. It should say something since all the hospitals I work t use pampers. Swaddles are best for new babies and baby dry from then on out. Amazon has great prices. Love when you have amazon mom and the extra coupon from parenting magazine"
1,"super light I just got these, they are super thin, but seem to hold alot! I like how light weight they are."
1,Baby Dry is the Best! I bought a bag of these at the store because they were on sale and used it. It is the best diaper ever! I started using it when my baby was 8 weeks old and she slept for 8 hours! Prior to that we were using the Swaddlers and they were getting soaked after just 4-5 hours. Our baby is almost 11 weeks old now and she's sleeping 11 hours a night and these diapers lasts her that long. These are the best. I have ordered more and will swear by these diapers now!
1,"Pampers Baby Dry Newborn Size These work great, I have been using them for my baby boy who was born 7 lbs and is now 10 lbs. The only time we have leaks is when we dont change him at every feeding.The only drawback of these pampers is they dont have the wetness strip. That being said after 2 months of diaper changes I can tell without the strip when he is wet."
1,"diapers I bought the pampers brand due to the deal you get thru amazon, and Im happy with them. This is my first baby, so I really do not know much about diapers, they keep everything in most of the time. I swear she shoots stuff sideways sometimes so it leaks thru her legs but I dont think thats the diapers fault! lol A diaper is a diaper I think!"
1,Jessica B. very good product! good price for the amount too when compared to the stores. this products ships in a short amount of time too.
1,Great Diapers The baby dry diapers are great. My daughter has been using them since she was 3 months old (now 15 months) and has never had any rashs or leaks in them. I will not be ordering these from Amazon anymore. They have changed the discount on the MOM program so that it's not worth it anymore.
1,"Pampers purchase on Amazon I have used pampers for my son ever since he has been born. Great product and I love the rewards program they have as well.I always buy my Pampers through Amazon, I have yet to find them cheaper (even at Sam's Club). I also love the easy of having them sent right to my door."
1,Pampers Are the Best Hands down pampers are the best diapers. Never had a problem with leaking or skin breakdown on my baby.
1,"pampers are the best these are much better then huggies , first off huggies run smaller, they dont hold as much for as long eaither, the design seems nice but the over all quality is good just isnt as good in my option for the price dif. ,"
1,"Best diapers we've used! We've tried Costco's diapers and to a limited extent, Huggies... From our experience, Baby Dry are the best at catching leaks and offer the most value."
1,"It does the job! The main thing with diapers is that you want to get a great deal, and this was one of the best ones we saw. Very pleased."
1,A Pampers Household We love Pampers. They are all we use in our house. I can trust that they will make it through long nights and keep my baby from getting diaper rashes. Love them!
1,"Well worth $1 I needed a copy of ""Leaves of Grass"" that includes the 1855 prose preface. The formatting of this Kindle book is perfect. I know I could read it on my computer for free on some websites, but I wanted a version for my Kindle. This Kindle edition will not disappoint you! I gladly paid $1 for a more ""portable"" option. I prefer reading on Kindle than the computer screen."
1,nice This is a good app that works well with the system and we have had no problems with this app so far.
1,"Love it Love it....Love it! I have been trying to find the book, but I guess an electronic copy works better since I will forever own it on my kindle!"
1,"Review of Walt Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"" This thick soft-backed ""pocket"" book has 490 pages. It could be called The Complete Whitman. It contains hundreds of poems.I am a senior citizen who had not read any Whitman for more than 50 years and am enjoying it very much. His descriptions of the 19th century's people, places, and inventions are eye-openers. He was actually a feminist before there was such a concept, and also an abolitionist. He truly believed in equality and democracy. He was a nature lover and wanted to protect the environment.Of course, there are parts I could quibble about, but that would be foolish. Whitman was a man ahead of his time."
1,"A ""MUST READ"" (or re-read) This beautifully told story belongs in every library, and then....lend it out as often as possible! It's a ""classic"" of the ""Holden Caulfield genre, and although I don't know, I'd imagine it's now, or has been, studied in High School English/writing programs."
1,"This movie grew on me. After first watching this movie years ago I thought just another John Wayne ""B"" movie. The more I watched it, the more I realize it was a very good story and very well acted."
1,"Absolutely breathtaking! Several vignettes of various lives taken from a seemingly magical summer eve in a masterfully described Finland countryside. This ain't no ordinary prose! While reading this book, I experienced emotions usually felt while listening to my favorite music, looking at a desert sunset or drinking a fine nut-brown ale. The words jump off the page, straight into your mind and create the most vivid, colourful images imaginable. Track down a copy of this book, it's definately a masterpiece!"
1,"Samsung comes through again. Sure its a more expensive product, compared to other comparable, or supposedly comparable products, however, you get what you pay for. In this era of mass everything and relatively shoddy quality it is good to see that Samsung, at least from my experience, walks the talk in product quality.Very good viewing, very good set up, no problems, no drama, ahhhhhh, the price of luxury i guess!"
1,"A Powerful Tale on Life, Friendship and Tragedy If you're a comics buff who's only into superheros or manga or whatever popular subjects featured in mainstream comics, this book is probably not for you, regardless of the glowing reviews here. Otherwise ... read on.I utterly enjoyed the book. The story is so intense, yet the illustration is minimalistic and poetic. Because of the frugal use of text, I had to revisit some pages just to interpret what exactly happened. But I'm telling you - less is more! The book has the rare quality and artistic appeal of a Criterion Collection classic film. It also reminded me of Art Spiegelman's Maus. If Maus has been studied in schools, Hey Wait should be, too. I hope, through word of mouth, this book as well as others by Jason will get more attention in the States."
1,wow it really does help... alot this stuff has really extended the life of my skate shoes... and it also has worked to repair some old slippers that had come apart. this is great buy for any skater for sure.
1,"Great Product with a Short Shelf Life This is a terrific item to keep just about any sensible shoe and sandal bottom from wearing out too quickly. I've had great success with it.Unless you are going to doctor-up a lot of needy shoes, athletic ones in particular, at one time, buy the smaller Shoe Goo size. Shoe Goo stored over an extended period of time loses most of its potency."
1,"Shoe Goo Review :) Great product! When my sneakers start to lose their soles, I reach for the Shoe Goo. Makes a permanent repair that stays flexible. Saves me from buying an expensive new pair of sneaks."
1,Very good product! I bought this goo for my son to repair his skating shoes; his shoes get damaged quite often. He used it to repair one pair and it did its job!!! He's happy!
1,"Fantastic shoe repair My entire family has used this product since the seventies, and it is JUST AS GREAT as it originally was. You can repair shoe soles for your favorite running shoes, slippers, any rubber-soled shoes. You can put rubber on the bottoms of walking canes for stage, real life, etc. This is like rubber cement repair, only one hundred times better. Do you get the picture?"
1,"Interesting for the stories if not the recipes! I bought this for my daughter as a gift, but when it arrived, I had a hard time parting with it!I especially enjoyed all the history in the book, very facinating, and have made quite a few recipes from it, all turning out wonderfully.Beautiful coffee table book as well."
1,Such a great album This is just such a classic album. Aloe Blacc finds the right mix of electro-funk and classic hip-hop to make an album diverse in sound. Highly recommended from a hip-hop head.
1,Very interesting This book has informed me of things I have never known. I watch a lot of crime shows but Mark and John go behind the scenes and explain how the actual process works. The difficulties of solving a crime and making sure you have the right person. Very interesting read. Could not put it down.
1,"Douglas and Olshaker Kick Ass Again This is a great book that any person interested in psychology should have. I know detectives and psychologists who delight in the interesting way that Douglas makes the wisdom of the FBI available to readers. The United States has spent millions of dollars in researching the psychology of criminal behavior, so it should be of no surprize that so much quality information exists. Douglas and Olshaker are doing an excellent job at disseminating this information in a fascinating way. Researchers in other human behaviors should take note of the massive work done by the United States into the criminal mind."
1,Great Book! One of the best books I've ever read and everyone should read it to clear up any misconceptions they have regarding any of the cases mentioned in the book. I refer to it often when one of the cases pops back into the news or I hear a new theory regarding any of the cases.
1,"At last! After so many years... This album was originally relased on Virgin records about 1976 and it was playing all over London for about a year. Delroy was working as Bob Marley's road manager at the time. The backing band ISUS consisted of the solid drum and bass from what later became ASWAD. First time I ever went into a studio in London - I was 16 and it was with Delroy who was recording with The Cimmarons a song called ""Walking Down Lonely Street"" :o) - that was 30 years ago! Anyway - I just ordered this and it's worth it for the first track alone called ""Jah Wonderful"" - a tune that stuck in my head to this day. Delroy! Those were the days!"
1,"A cult classic of a song This song has the whole package. It's catchy, fun and infectious. The type of song that everyone is listening to. Cassie definately has enough potential to go far in the music industry."
1,Simply amazing This book was advertised as used. I don't know what they used it for but it had never been opened. I'm finding it to be very useful as a guide on how to fully use a table saw. The drawing are excellent and the jigs that I've made so far actually work.
1,"A FABULOUS ACOUSTIC TRIP AROUND THE WORLD YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY ""ACOUSTIC JOURNEY"". IT TAKES YOU ON A MUSICAL TRIP TO DIVERSE PLACES AROUND THE WORLD AND DELIVERS A MASTERFUL INTERPRETATION OF EACH WORK AS THOUGH IT WERE HIS OWN. MY FAVORITE TUNE ON THE CD IS ""BLUE CHILI"" AND DIMITRI'S TANGO. ""BLUE CHILI"" IS LIKE A SLOW BLUES JAM WITH SOME JAZZY STUFF THROWN IN AS WELL AS SOME ROCK N ROLL RIFFS. ""TANGO EN PARAISO"" IS A WONDERFUL TROPICAL GROOVE THAT MAKES ME WANT TO ORDER A PINA COLADA AND SIT OUT BY THE POOL. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO JUST DIGS GOOD MUSIC."
1,"very pleased bride I loved the dress! Ive orderd the dress on two seperate times. The first time I orderd it was to see about the sizes, because I read in the reviews that some people felt it was too big/small. I found that the dress really runs true-to-size. Then I orderd the rest of the dresses for my bridesmaids. The dress is made really well, and will hold up. You dont have to worry about it loosing its shape on the bust area because it has parallel stays. Also it is fitted thru the natural natural waist, so again we didnt worry about the other measurments. Honestly I have seen the dress in bridal stores for twice the price, and im glad that I didnt pay the extra price!! The shipping from PacifiPlex was awesome as well. It tells you to expect it in a week or so, and both times it has shown up in under three days!"
1,"Beautiful bridesmaid dress Big thank you to the seller for a very beautiful bridesmaids dresses! The price was reasonable, delivery very quick and customer service was excellent. My bridesmaids will look absolutely beautiful in those dresses next spring at my wedding!"
1,"GREAT bridesmaids dress! I bought this dress in royal blue at a little shop in the mall for $90. I had a TON of compliments on it during the wedding and felt like I looked great. Because of the boning in the top and flare out bottom, I didn't feel like I needed any kind of girdle or nylons to control my tummy or rear. I just found this dress an Amazon for $40 cheaper and I since I already know how great it is, I am going to buy it again in black for another wedding I am in later this year! TIP: I would recommend buying one size down from the size suggested on the sizing chart. According to my measurements, I should wear an XL but the L fit me just perfectly with a 38"" bust and 31"" waist."
1,"Bridesmaid dress on a budget!!! The dress is for my bridesmaids and the style is perfect for a back yard wedding. The satin look doesn't make it look cheap. And the price fits in the budget of all bridesmaids; some in college, just bought a house or have multiple people in my bridal party. I had been looking at some Alfred Angelo dresses in the 148-190 price range.There is only one minor set back. For my wedding design I wanted to replace the bow and ribbon with one of another color and there is no easy wash of removing just that ribbon, it's sewn in through all layers around the zipper. But we found a solution without taking the whole dress apart. We are going to attach the new ribbon to the one already there in the back. (Just in case someone else has the same idea).Overall very worth it!!!!!"
1,"A Pocketful of Promises for Women I bought this delightful book for my wife, who planned to pass it along to a group of her friends who share special books among themselves. It was so good, I read it myself! And I found it to be spiritually uplifting. Highly recommended!"
1,Inspirational Message The word of God set to music. An inspirational message in every song. Lift your spirits.
1,"Wonderful duel I recomend everybody to purchase this film. I am admirer of these both great english actors. The movie is full of surprises that take place in a aristocratic english cottage. An amazing garden full of statues is were the movie begin. Inside the cottage there is a world of fantasy with puppets moving everywhere, that seem watch impassive the duel between the two only characters of the film. I do not miss any other actor in the movie, they both are enough. Only great actors as them can get it. John Addison's score is as elegant and playful as the film requires."
1,"Sleuth the movie Sleuth is a 2 person movie with Sir Lawrence Olivier, and Michael Caine that treats the viewer to a twisting story of ingrigue and humor and suspense, a cat n mouse drama that is well worth owning"
1,"Perfect Just exactly what we were looking for, the fact that this item can be moved to size I am 100% pleased. This got the job done"
1,"A serious masterpiece The other reviews are good. Trouble right now is that the DVD is becoming unavailable. This import is spoken in English, don't worry, and subtitles can be turned off. It's the full wide screen. The end credits are cut short before the music stops, which spoils that mood, but not ""in the middle of the credits"". There's a bit of nudity with Rees.The title may mislead people into thinking it's a cheap gore film. No, it's a literate masterpiece, and based on a serious novel."
1,"Perfect for listening in the car and for any lending library general or business! Joel Fotinos, a VP at Penguin Group, narrates this fine audiobook offering the blueprint for Napoleon Hill's wealth strategy to listeners who would understand 'cosmic habitforce', sharing wealth, and more. It's an outstanding guide to wealth-building and riches and is especially lively in audio format, perfect for listening in the car and for any lending library general or business!"

1,Did the job. Needed to add a front license plate following my relocation to Texas. This little item solved the problem. Installation was less than five minutes.
1,"It truly is BEAUTIFUL! Perhaps the Beautiful South's best-known collection of tunes, ""0898"" carries their signature stylings of rhythm, melody, and groove. From classics heard everywhere on the radio like ""Old Red Eyes Is Back"" to the more eclectic ""We Are Each Other,"" this album lets listeners slide in and enjoy some great music while the catchy and poignant lyrics beat a path through their brains. ""0898"" is a wonderful CD to pop in on road trips, on lazy summer afternoons, or after a long day on the job--it will soothe your frazzled nerves and let your mind wander through landscapes of vivid imagery and imagination. Check out their other work for even more entertainment and endearment...you'll be hooked! =) Simply put, this album is BEAUTIFUL!"
1,"also my favourite cd Today I bought this cd again, since I only had it on tape, and it broke the other day. I never cease to be amazed by the genius of this album, everything feels right about, and such a richness of sounds.. it will probably never show up in official lists with ""top 100 of all time"", but it has made and will stay my number one.. its great for in the car, when exercising, at home.. everywhere, sheer bliss"
1,"Excellent price and excelllent shoe! Stride Rite's are good shoes and these are priced so low. I don't know why and I won't ask. When I got them, they were nice (looked just like the picture) with a square toe. The size is right on, they are cushy inside, and the bottom is not slippery. My toddler likes wearing them even when he does not have too."
1,"What more could you ask for? I bought ""Buddy Guy & Junior Wells Play the Blues abum"" when it first hit the rack.Then again about a month ago. It had the same effect as it did back then...I put it in the cd player, sat down and didn't get up until I'd heard every song on the cd.It is Buddy Guy and Junior at their very best.Rickey Noel Mitchell"

1,"great reference book Lots of information I refer back to it often! Really like this book a lot, has become one of my favorites."
1,"Great Guide I really love this book. I began reading it the first day I got it. I am happy I purchased the book, because this gives me a great explanation on when and when not to perform spells. This has everything I was looking for. I wish this was a larger hardback book with more illustrations of the moon's phases. I use this book in combination with other spell books. I would recommend this to all who are new to crafting. I hope to find more books similar to this."
1,"A must see How could you not love this movie? It has Lena Horne, and Cab Calloway just to name a few amazing artists. The music numbers blend seamlessly with the story line. This is a star studded cast of anyone that was anyone back in the day. Incredible, I still love it to this day. I have seen it more times than I can count. It is neat to see all of my favorite people back when they were young. Way cool."
1,Good Entertainment! This is another one of those old movies that I had to watch more than once to appreciate. This is largely because of the singing and dancing in the film. At times it was too much and at times it was awesome. Before watching this film I'd never seen Cab Calloway perform or watched a whole film with Lena Horne in it. Both entertainers did a great job. If you're interested in classy entertainment from early black actors this is the film to watch.
1,"Great sequel! If you liked Patton, then you will need to get this DVD to show how his remarkable life ended. A great addition to your WWII collection."
1,"Bruce Didn't Invent Happiness, 'Just Made It Easy to Find This tape can be the key to opening up a whole new happy life for anyone who wants it. That is exactly what it did for me when I learned the Option Method 17 years ago. On this great intro to the Option Method, Bruce DiMarsico dispells the mystique around unhappiness by exposing the notion that the experience of unhappiness is always based on what someone believes... often erroneously. Questioning the belief(or judgement or assumption) can effectively vaporize the unhappy conclussion. Hearing one of Bruce's original lectures on Option rekindles the fire in me to spread the word to other happiness-seekers. Do yourself a favor... get this tape and let yourself out of YOUR prison of unhappiness. If I can do it, anyone can!"
1,"A Truly Helpful Way To Be Happier Now! This timeless tape is filled with humor, wisdom and wonderful liberating questions to help you get to the real cause of your emotional pain and self-limitation. I had the life-changing privilege of studying with this inspiring teacher in the early 1970's, followed by the joy of teaching others how to change their unhappy belief systems for over 30 years. I cannot imagine what my life would be like had I not had that opportunity, so I am especially glad that everyone can now hear these simple, powerful ideas from the man who originated the Option Method, himself, Bruce Di Marsico."

1,"Swept away to France If you liked Salvador's"" Chambre Avec Vue"" you will love this. If you don't know Salvador imagine a male combination of Astrud Gilberto, Blossom Dearie, and Jane Birkin. I dont know of a male contender for his soft minimal jazz voice except perhaps Jo Gilberto. The song selection is all French ballads, played and sung with a quiet jazz, simple, sort of bossa nova delivery. No French marching songs, clever novelty songs, or over-the -top Piaf theatrics; strictly light, fresh, crisp and airy as a nice bottle of Chablis. Romantic music, not especially for having sex, more for sitting beside your lover and listening. During the week of the recent bombings in America I listened to this CD almost constantly. It was very reassuring that, yes, there is beauty and love in the world."

It will sit in amongst the cd's that I even now listen to on a regular basis from many different decades.Classics never age.
1,"AMAZING I love this album and I love Laura Shay!! This album takes me back to 2006 when I was young and in love..this album is my soundtrack for that year! Whenever I listen to a song I get goosebumps as I'm reminded of those sweet times!! I highly recommend this not because I have so many fond memories but because it is a beautiful work of art. The lyrics, the music, it is one word which is amazing."
1,"Great for the Serious Pie/Pastry Baker I bought this book because I loved Rose's Bread Bible and I wanted to make really good pies and pastries. Before using this book I had not had a lot of experience making pies, I had made a couple apple pies and pumpkin pies, but they were all kind of blah. Not anymore!! Even with my little experience Rose transformed me into an awesome pie baker!! After I made my first pie from the Pie Bible, people were telling me it was the best pie they had ever had in their life! Now, I have to warn you, her pies do take a while to make. In many cases it's an all day (or multiple days) affair. However, I promise you, if you diligently follow her instructions, the results will be worth it!"
1,"The perfect companion to The Cake Bible Just when I thought that The Cake Bible was the ultimate culinary experience, Rose Levy Beranbaum strikes again. I just bought a copy for my mother who taught me to love and bake my own pies from scratch. She lays it all out for you, step by step, and never leaves you hanging. Not only are there wonderful decadent recipies for pies of all kinds, but also for savory breads as well. How do I feel about this book? To paraphase a famous saying -- you can have my Pastry Bible when you pry it from my cold dead fingers!"
1,"Be an Instant Pastry Chef!! I have used this book on several special occassions. I don't even have to do a trial run before I present the final dessert, because I am confident that every recipe in this book will turn out just as promised. Easy to follow instructions, and ingredients that you find at your local grocery store---what could be better! By using Rose's recipe book, I have become the automatic dessert maker in my family....especially when it comes to pies."
1,"Real Treasure The book is a real treasure to any baker: all the details, all the step-by-step, it gives confidence and explains the secrets of pastry. I just love it!"

1,"A pail of oysters. [Hardcover] Vern. SNEIDER This is a fictional story, but the tale might as well be real to a Taiwanese. The story starts in near Lukang when KMT soldiers steal the god from a family and he is sent to bring it back. Much of the story focuses around an American newsman stationed in Taipei and how he learns Nationalist Taiwan is not what it seems. The true story behind the fiction is that Sneider met Ed Paine, an eye witness to the 228 massacre and Paine hooked Sneider up with his interpreter. The history is fuzzy, the places are not where they should be, but the story is more an allegory of 50's Taipei with the dreaded race track and deaths. This book is now considered rare following years of KMT student spies stealing it from libraries. --not my review, but Maowang from Forumosa"

1,"Amazingly ... amazing. When i read this book for a class project i was amazed with it when i realized it was written in 1962. I read it several times as it is not the most easy of reading , but once i did so i thought it was maybe written in the eighties with a backward-looking viewpoint. When i learned the actual date of publishing... i was stupified. Must read for any of Bucky's fans."
1,This CD is really nice to listen to and it soothes the soul! I listened to the CD one time with my mom and then I couldn't stop listening to it. My favorite song is Friendness!!
1,"The Santanic Mill The Satanic Mill by Otfried Preussler is a great book to read. It is about a begger boy called Krabat who gets called to a mill in a dream. The mill is also a Black School. He met a female singer, and they both fell in love. Krabat wanted to leave the mill, but to do that the Singer (the book did not give her name) had to pick him out while he and all the other miller's men were in the form of ravens.This book is very creepy, mysrerious, and unpredictable which, I think, is great. There are several things to focus on, so it doesn't get boring. It's very nervewracking, too. All in all, it is one of the best books I have ever read. I give it a five-star rating."
1,"The German historical experience with the Nazis told as a folk tale Ottfried Preussler, a German WW II veteran, wrote about his book: My Krabat tells [...] my personal story, the story of my generation and the story of all young people who get in touch with power and its temptations and who become entangled.""The story is based on an old wendish (west slavic) tale of which it takes over only a small part but is also a parable on totalitarian systems, how they are run by means of force and seduction and how the individuals can get away.It is interesting to see that the miller is described not only as the demonic master (which he is) but later on also as a human slave to the haunting journeyman and thus serves only as a cog in the wheel in the evil system."
1,"A bit more durable than Gates I purchased this as a replacement for my E-powered MTB. I had a Gates belt before and it stretch out pretty quick. It didn't break, but the stretching bothered me. I installed this Goodyear belt and am able to push more power through the belt without me having to keep adjusting the tension."
1,"Ian Richardson version of The Hound of the Baskervilles I highly recommend this 1983 version of the Sherlock Holmes mystery. Richardson suits the role of Holmes very well, bringing a confidence and intellectual flare to solving the case.I can't be critical of much in this movie. I enjoyed it immensely on vhs and now, again, on dvd. It's well acted, well scripted, and well produced. I think Ian Richardson is my favourite Sherlock Holmes - although I don't think he played the role as many times as other actors. Again, he brings such confidence in his ability, that as a viewer you don't really think he's not going to solve the mystery.Thumbs up. Enjoy."
1,"Moving, enlightening, mysterious, and for the serious only This session begins with the shimmering peal of a gong, and you enter into the somber, mysterious and intense world of 1964 John Coltrane. ""Love Supreme"", a poem of great tonal color and emotion, hailed Coltrane's religious awakening and a new period in which he embarked on a mission to uplift people. Prior to the recording of this album, Coltrane's faith was tested by the bombing of a black church in Alabama, and the death of Eric Dolphy and the tumult of the 1960s---civil rights, change, new music, new worlds. All of Coltrane's recorded work from ""Love Supreme"" forward was groundbreaking on every level. This is not for listeners who are new to Coltrane, or those who wish to hear the mainstream Coltrane of the Prestige and ""Blue Train"" period. This is for the more serious listener seeking a different and more challenging experience with sound, and with history."
1,"Trane was spiritual... The negative reviews are from people with poor taste and poor ears. As for the review in 'trying-to-write-Ebonics' -titled ""What's the hype, dog?"" by some idiot from Garden City, MI United States - white guys fronting as black guys is very easily discerned by the knowing. Know that, playa-hatin' white boy!Now - to the album. This is very pure music that comes undiluted from the soul of a highly evolved and empathetic human being - who knows the depths and ecstasies of the human soul - and who has the genius to express every shade of his gigantic wisdom and understanding.You don't need to look up a jazz encyclopaedia and throw words around to understand this - people who do that are usually trying to show off because they lack soul.A healer plays these sounds - a medicine man. Coltrane is truly a Bodhisattva."
1,"A study in spiritual ecstacy. For all those seeking the ultimate jazz experience this is THE album. Man seeks for meaning by finding the beautiful aesthetic. Coletrane has helped all of us to find that moment and to think the moment was recorded. A Love Supreme stands right at the border between beauty and chaos. While many later avant garde works and even the later works of Coletrane run past that border and become difficult to listen to, A Love Supreme remains in the realm where the listener is allowed to enter the experience of the artist. A Love Supreme is the ultimate jazz album THE CLASSIC!!"
1,"Classic Coltrane John Coltrane's expressionistic existentialist masterpiece is released in a superbly remastered edition with essential additional material. This album is the turning point for Coltrane, away from his past material that was closer to hard bop and into the realms of free jazz. This was just before he picked up the atonalities that would be trademark of his later recordings but gives the listener a chance of what is to come. Spiritually rich and expressionistic, it is one jazz's greatest albums. If you own the original album, it is worth the purchase for the additional disc. Outtakes of the album with Archie Shepp included, it also has a full length concert of the only time the album was performed publicly. By this time, Coltrane had picked up the dissonance of his later albums and to some listeners will be less satisfying but for those who appreciate Coltrane in all his complexity,is well appreciated. Highly recommended."
1,"STIMULATING/STARTLING MUSIC I enjoy jazz...I'm far from thoroughly versed in the style though; I have a few key discs in my collection, that's it. A Love Supreme is one of them. A lot of good music sets a mood, but Coltrane's disc really talks...it's amazing. Where some musicians can hint at an idea, Coltrane rattles off a spiritual epic. If you're looking to add some stimulating, startling jazz to your collection (we're not talking Kenny G here...), this is your disc."
1,"The Pinnacle of Modal Jazz John Coltrane is at his best on this recording. Some people dislike it because they believe it is excessively serious, but to me it is deeply emotional and even joyful. It really takes an open mind (and concentration) to enjoy this CD properly, but it will more than reward the listener for the energy he expends.Musically, it would be absurd to attack this recording; the writing, improvisation, and interaction are flawless.One word of warning: If you are someone who listens to music for simple entertainment or background, this is not the CD for you. Listening to this CD in the background would be like reading yourself to sleep with James Joyce's ""Ulysses"".It really boils down to how you see music. Some people just don't think of music as being a deeply expressive artistic outlet, and that's fine - but they won't enjoy this CD."
1,"TRANE!!!!!!!! All that needs to be said about ""A Love Supreme"" is --- BUY IT! If this disc is not in your collection, you are missing out on one of the most vital pieces of music ever recorded. No matter what your musical tastes are, I guarantee you will find something of interest in Trane's visceral and evocative performance. A classic of sheer beauty and emotion. Peace."
1,"It sounds great, and ... ... I wonder how much the awesome result is due to the Rudy Van gelder re-mastering process rather than to the DSD-SACD new teach. I wonder sometimes if the music major are trying to sell us the n-th remastering and try to make us re-buy our music collection again and again. It would also be nice to compare the same re-mastering hi-rez DVD-A and DSD-SACD.BTW I am astonished how much better it is compared to my vynil (I did not buy the red-book CD waiting for a hi-rez re-issue :-) )5 stars to the music (I'd vote 6 starts if possible ...) and 5 stars to the sound"
1,"master takes john coltrane----LONG winded---from the first ""breath"" of this swAn song we all know as "" a love supreme""safe playing taken to exremes----maybe the best Long composition in jAzz ma tazzthe live stuff just hits hard"
1,"TRUELY A ""CLASSIC"" John Coltrane was truely ahead of his time! Vacuum tubes were still the state of the art when this album came out! Yet, the Fidelity is pretty amazing... Jimmy Garrison down-shifting on the Bass on the first cut ( ""Acknowlegement"" aka ""Love Supreme"" )with Elvin Jones and McKoy Tyner rounding things out, just Blew My Mind! If you DON'T ""feel"" this one, you have NO SOUL!"
1,"I'm just a guy who said this record wasn't all that? I beg your pardon, you don't say. this record is not for a party, it's for your ears. This is pure joy. the guy that gave one star does not like jazz. listen to this late at night after your girlfriend broke up with you. this is life affirming it's hopeful it taps into all your emoticons and beyond. if i knew you i would just make you a copy but it's cheap enough. check it out when you are screwed up or to impress a lady. either way you will score."
1,"Unhelpful, but true This album may serve as an acid test - if you don't like it, you don't like jazz, and never will. The flawless interplay of the four voices in this work builds upon all that came before and anticipates all that came after. Those who don't like it - and these are few an far between - are usually aggressively drowsy conservatives who listen to Coltrane wishing listfully that his genius had not arrived on the scene to disturb the sanguine haze that was American music in the late 50's. A Love Supreme created a new musical idiom in which the depth of human sentiment could be commiunicated. A towering accomplishment."

1,Awesome This film is about civil rights. Ads don't do it justice. Very good film! I enjoyed it years ago and am glad to have foundit nonlinear.
1,"helped with bypass recovery My husband was recovering from bypass surgery and could not slide forward to get out of chair, bed etc. With the silk Pajamas he could get to the edge of the the seat and then stand with the aid of the walker. Amazon was the only place I could find this product. That was 6 weeks ago. He likes them so well he won't wear anything else, They have been laundered many times and still look like new"
1,"Review for Intimo Silk Pant I have ordered this same pajama pant before, and they wear well. The size is also accurate. Color is true to photo."
1,"Valeo WW2 2-Pound Wrist Weights These are super soft, like a silky terry cloth. These are a bit on the small side for a medium-large framed woman's wrist. However, these are perfect for a child's wrist or even ankle. These are used in my child's therapy, and they fit perfectly on an 8 yr old's wrists and ankles. Very comfortable."
1,wrist weights I have small; tiny wrists so the weights fit fine and they are a great enhancement to my daily workout. In fact I wear then almost everyday all day long except when I am sleeping.
1,Just a lovely as picture I bought this pillow and I was very nervous that it wouldn't be as lovely as the picture. I'm not one for buying this without touching it but I was pleasantly surprise. It is absolutely lovely and I'm very happy I made the purchase.
1,"the best music for the best videogame This Cd contains every track you hear in the video game. If you liked the game, you'll love this cd, just to hear it is like playing the game all over again. A MUST HAVE FOR ZELDA FANS."
1,"Ocarina of Time This is a great cd! It includes all the wonderful music from the 1999 award winning n64 game, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.There are 82 tracks to this cd, some that last a few seconds long... some that last a few minutes long. My favorite is the ""End Credits."" This is the song played after beating the game and is truly beautiful!! I love it!!"
1,"kool first of all, the music on zelda ocarina of time matches the setting you are in. for example, listen to the water temple music. most people get an image of a watery or icy place. the game's songs impressed many people im sure. the game is already great by it self, but the music just takes it to the next level."
1,"Wonderful I loved the compositions from the game and I think Nobuo Uematsu is a great composer, fitting perfect music for perfect environments.However, I could not abide the repetative synthesised instruments that accompanied the music on most occasions. I recently bought the original FF8, thinking they perhaps implemented real instruments..but no luck.Then I saw this! Absolutely amazing... A single pianist plays 13 of the greatest FF8 tracks, with clever re-arrangements, you can listen to this, fully imersed in the Final Fantasy atmosphere. My highlight must be the card game theme, shuffle or boogie...an excellent take on the 12 bar blues. Anyway, yes, buy this! Also you get it in Japanese packaging...which is always good, for some bizarre reason the have a little plastic see-though sheath which the real case goes in...lovely."
1,"Frommers South Africa My family and I took five books about South Africa with us, and this is the book we used and relied on the most. It proved to be the most accurate with what we experienced once there, and the book itself was the easiest to use in its layout and organization."
1,"Great planner book This book, as all the Frommer series, is very good to help you plan a trip. The recommendations are often the same as you will find on Tripadvisor which increase my confidence level, but in the book you get really detailed information with contact numbers and websites. They have maps of each area with the interest point marked on it, this is a great planning tool; you can really figure better in what order to schedule visits. Yes, other boks have more photos, this one definitely does not but that is why it's a good planner, it has INFORMATION. Those pretty DK books are nice to look at but useless to plan with. I would like to see them update more frequently but reality is that the information does not really change that often, so all in all the book is great."
1,"Loaded with information I am preparing for a trip to South Africa in May to join my daughter that is studying abroad in Cape Town. I anticipate that the information packed in the pages of this book will be very helpful in making contacts with hotels, adventure planners, and restaurants. With the help from the chapter on Victoria Falls, we anticipate having a successful trip through Zimbabwe as well."
1,"Loved it all! As a fan of the horror genre I am very often forced to sit through a book by a well known author that although has the major affect of scaring me out of my wits, rarely gets deep into my own personal life. Mr. Marano has succeeded where others have failed me!From the moment I picked this book up, I just couldn't put it down until I finished the story.The story of two Princes of Hell each trying to take over the world was as gripping as it was frightening, and left me wanting more from this author. His style of prose was just amazing.Of course the real good stuff is the emotional roller coaster you get the privilege to be on from almost page one!This book takes you everywhere, from sorrow to hopeful, and taking little pitstops at each emotion along the way.With characters I could really feel for, the struggle for Earth was just a beautiful mix of great insight and moments of pure suspense.Pick it up if you can, it's a great read!"
1,"Great buy! This was a great buy. It seems it's shrunk lines in my forehead to a nicer size. It's also a great moisturizer for anything, I've used it on my lips, nose, eyes. Nothing irritant about emu oil competitors prices much higher for no reason. You won't be disappointed."
