0,"Buyer beware This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!"
0,"The Worst! A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book."
0,"Oh please I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all."
0,"Awful beyond belief! I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"
0,"Another Abysmal Digital Copy Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon."
0,"Batteries died within a year ... I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power."
0,"should be titled ""Hollywood Debacle"" The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid."
0,"Nothing you don't already know If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!"
0,"Doesn't work on a Mac It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!"
0,"TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk."
0,"Not! If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated."
0,"Very poor quality. The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid."
0,"Bad Deal!! I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future."
0,It Drew Air This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book.
0,"Buyer Beware!! I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!"
0,"ADDONICS PORTABLE CD DRIVE - I am disappointed in its performance I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon."
0,"I got fooled... I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!"

0,you will not be able to buils a timber frame house This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder.
0,Dont like it This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
0,"Not professional quality I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others."
0,"New Wave 80s I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the ""Starlite Singers"". The description of the record says that it is by ""various artists"" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it."
0,"Buyers Beware!!!!!!!!! This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!"
0,BEWARE!! Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ....
0,"Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for."
0,"""Uh oh he's been using Brand X"" An embarassment. Steer clear of this one folks. Just when you thought these guys were the last real ""fusion"" types about...Since when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions? Where the hell is Phil when you need him, oh yes, Tarzan. The star is for the Bruford and Wilding/Bonus tracks, and well does one really want those?"
0,"Molly Myers Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme."
0,"Just a few. These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!"
0,Stiff and Smells like drying paint You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.
0,"False Advertisement The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied."
0,The product I received this time is like fake one I have been used this product for many years. But somehow the product I received this time is like fake one. It's very thin. I have to used double amount.
0,"Has No Range I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product."
0,"Don't buy from Eforcity -- slow, disingenuous What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon."
0,Does not work! It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it.
0,"Extremely Disappointed with this video I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know."
0,"A long promo for the Thomas center(s) Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money."
0,"My Son finds it annoying My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD."
0,"Too bad.... Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad."
0,"Doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again."
0,"Do not waste your time....lousy This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is ""the best ever experienced"" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier."
0,"this album is garbage,straight bfi material cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this game.the beats where alright but the rappers a terrible.none of the have a goog flow to accomidate the beats.try again cmr.maybe next time."
0,"THIS IS A ONE COMPARED TO JUVENILEZ 400 DEGREEZ ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!"
0,The worst rap I ever Heard This is what is in the dictionary under wack. I can't belive that this many people bought this (...) The hot boys are just a fad like bellbottoms. (...) If you think this is what rap is about u just plain stupid and I'm glad this hot boy stuff is almost over wit. When some of my friends play this crap in the car I just rather get out and walk.
0,super wack just like No-Limit Cash Money has no shame at putting out garbage music.wack beats and no lyric ryhmes.who is buying this crab? all the stuff sounds the same and it's not that average.it's all bad.
0,"My Daughter Hates It I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat. It tastes awful, and it's just not meant for a young child. I got it after a recommendation from another mom, and it was a bad decision. I'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow."
0,"2/3 of a great book, then... blah I listened to the audio version of ""Cruel & Unusual"" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the ""who"" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, ""great book, bad ending..."" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?"
0,"I guess it was a mystery In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia."
0,"Soooooooooooo NOT Funny This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage."
0,Nasty People! Nasty Film! Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film.
0,"UNFUNNY PEOPLE I used to enjoy Sandler's movies but this one is just....jeez, how to put it? Well, UNFUNNY.All characters are if not stupid, shallow and egotistical...Don't care how 'dramatic' was this supposed to be, his misogynistic prick persona is the worst ever. Just, don't watch it, really...You'll want those minutes from your life back."
0,"I wish Adam Sandler wasn't in this. I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However, having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it's true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude ""jokes"". I have to say we didn't make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing."
0,"Not what I expected... I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie. They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up! When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it. My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while.If you're into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight, then you're going to like this film. However, if you're looking for humour like Adam Sandler's previous films (i.e. Happy Gilmore, etc) then you can forget about it.I give this film 1 star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film. :/"
0,Absolutely NOTHING Funny ! This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"The L O N G E S T movie... EVER! Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny. This however, just, well, wasn't. I really do believe that this movie had potential, but there was so much going on, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 movies out of it.It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD."
0,Seth Kept this movie from getting a 'ZERO' star rating!! A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian.
0,Stupid.... Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!
0,"Sandler's worst! I normally love Sandler's movies but this was just horrible. None of it flowed right, jokes were horrible vand stupid and just all around made no sense. Don't waste your time and money on this."
0,waste of time I must say I never liked Adam Sandler. There were so many more talented people who just never got a chance to be on the screen. I still don't get what's with Adam Sandler.Besides that I decided to give it a shot. It took half hour when I stopped watching.
0,Moron How can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performs?This guy is just a moronic retard.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM.
0,"Winning Cast, movie fell short This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw. When in fact, it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre."
0,"ACTUALLY NO STARS for rating pf Funny People movie Save your money. Your time can be MUCH better spent. This was one of the worse movies I ever sat through. Actually, I drifted away close to the end and was thankful I didn't waste that time. Its AWFUL."
0,Not Funny People Not worth the time.Pros: there were several good one-liners; introduced me to new comediansCons: excess foul language; adultry;
0,"Unpleasant and disappointing This is a nasty, mean-spirited book that exhibits contempt for the Torah and Torah values. When I picked up this book at the local library, I assumed that I would just love it and want to buy a copy for my college-age daughter (who is also a cat-owning Rabbi's daughter). But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and ""show"" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant. Warning: this book is not suitable for children!"
0,"Self-Serving Message This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children."
0,"Not what it looks like on the cover. As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book."
0,"Drivel Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the ""little dog"" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!"
0,"Fraud,not as advertised This DVD was entiled ""Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985"" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. I consider it to be a total fraud and misrepresentation."
0,"If you can't say anything nice, Well, that's no fun. Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story"
0,"You have GOT to be kidding This could be the worst novel I have ever read. It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists."
0,"A wildly implausible thriller This book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. I found all the other character two dimensional and all the ""intrigue"" regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence. Has Cornwell done better? I don't know and, after reading this, am in no big hurry to find out."
0,"No one will edit this, because I'm Patricia Cornwell At least, that's how I felt about this book, which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels. I recommend the first three books in the series. I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling. However, not having a fireplace, I filed this under G."
0,"A Piece of Crap! Noisy, crude five point vibration pad.NOT! a massager, a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless, no, worse than worthless!"
0,"No theory what so ever The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no ""objective"" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice"

0,"Unsatisfactory and very outdated I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's."
0,"Capitalism straight, in small unpalatable doses If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice."
0,"over-simplified diatribe Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free."
0,A historical gem whose title obscures its intent Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.
0,"More politics, less economincs I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view. The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter. After skimming a few pages I threw it away; I didn't even want it in the house."
0,"This book's title is misleading. This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase."
0,"Straight to the trash can! Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!"
0,"It wasn't very good! This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review."
0,on order I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.
0,"poor fit After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper."
0,"Upset I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down..."
0,"Squeem I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable.I returned it,"
0,"Pass The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. I am very dissapointed."
0,"Broke the 2nd time I wore it, great until then I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved."
0,"Uncomfortable! It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50.."
0,Waste of time for me I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me.
0,"itchy I washed it before used it for the first time. The next day I wore it, I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach. And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that."
0,"CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!"
0,"Poor quality and lousy customer service The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. I'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. The threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. They've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks."
0,does not fit me! So according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 28-31my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp!maybe it's just me but i am terribly disappointed
0,Too small Usually a size XS to S but this girdle's small did not fit true to size. Had to return back to Amazon.
0,"Awesome! It's pretty awesome for such a price! It definitely gives you great posture, I was sitting up straight like no other! although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise it's wonderful!^^^^^ was my review when i had it for 15-20 days, now-- after ordering it on Jan, 21, 2012-- it's SO useless. I've washed it with care, it smells like rubber, and it's pretty nasty. I'd rather pay $$$ and buy something that works the way it should."

0,"WARNING: This is the worst book ever written As most people readers know, Jack Higgins has written many fine action-packed books. However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review."
0,"Worst of theYear...or, maybe the decade Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it."
0,A Waste of Time This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it.
0,"Good story- Poor writing Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books."
0,"Disappointment on every page I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead."
0,"This is not the Jack Higgins I know This is by far his worst effort that I've read. He's not my favorite spy author,anyway. This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher's contract or obligation that Mr. Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry. The characters are not at all fleshed out, and the story line is too contrived. I would advise not wasting time by reading this book."
0,"Cartoon Arab-Scottish Villain I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further. His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish-Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible, pointless heritage. But, what do you expect from a middle-aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket.... depth?"
0,"Can't believe I read the whole thing Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can't believe I read the whole book. I guess I kept waiting for the action to start. It never did."
0,"I'd rate it 0 stars if I could have... Very few books contain their own review. This one does:""Stone said, 'It really is like a bad movie, Harry.'""'You can bleeding well say that again. . . .'""This book reads like a 7th grade reading-level condensation of an outline of a screenplay: The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long; very few words greater than two syllables are used. No complex thoughts, no character development, no suspense, and little description. Pure formulaic twaddle."
0,"A bad book, poorly written. The plot is not believable, there is not a shred of character development, and there isn't even any descriptive atmosphere. It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel. I shall not buy any more of his efforts."
0,Poorly Written The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again.
0,"Can't believe the publisher had nerve to issue this book A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to ""speak Irish"" but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing."
0,"Two Hacks I don't know who is worse- Higgins or Macnee. The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next. Completely implausible. Macnee's narration is so overdone it is laughable. Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky. A real stinker. Wayne Schwartz, Los Angeles, CA"
0,"Worst ""Live"" recording I've ever bought! I bought this CD for one song only, ""Steal Away"". I knew it was going to be ""live"", but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a ""muzik, lounge"" sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then, the only other song I recognized was ""Hot Rod Hearts"", again, done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most ""live"" recordings. I was very dissapointed, and I still don't have a decent recording of ""Steal Away""!"
0,"A thorn in the side of literature. Hawthorne's use of symbolism throughout the book is undeniable, yet his obvious alcoholism takes over as the underlying factor present at all points. He relies on ambiguity far too often without the build up to a climax. The climax(es) happened before the book started and only happened to a select few who read this book. Read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, or virtually anything by Aldous Huxley if you want some entertainment."
0,"technical problems with cassettes This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left. Most auto systems have that capability. However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound, it can be difficult (and maybe impossible) to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time. Unfortunately neither the packaging nor the website will warn you of the problem. You therefore should think before buying. Once you have opened the packaging you may be unable to return the product."
0,"Classic? Really? I will never understand how ""Classics"" become Classics. So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics. Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense. The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was, but it doesn't. It is better than Dickens, but then again everything is."
0,"Duller than dirt I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students. I don't know who suffered more, me or them.To be fair, as one of America's first novels, it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job.On the other hand, it is excruciating to read. There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad."
0,"Who Chooses Classics? I don't see how this book gets so much attention as being ""one of the best novels ever."" It's very short, and very boring. It's written in old english, which adds to the difficulty, and even if you can understand it, you finish the book and say, ""Ok, so what's the point?"" There is absolutely no point to this novel. Entire chapters of the novel are void of dialogue and appears as a wall of text, and the description is so vague that you can't even tell what a character is doing half the time."
0,"""Hallelujah!"" is what I said when I finished this book This novel was the most boring book I have ever read. I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long-winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance. Even though there is much symbolism to be found, when is one supposed to find it, while they are sleeping? Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece. How did this book become a ""CLASSIC""?"
0,"Landscape book I guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape. I didn't think it was necessary, it's just a book right?I guess it's supposed to be easier to read in bed. I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red book.If you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns; first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom. This just seems really irritating to me."
0,"Ugh. I read this book for AP English and had to do a blue-book assignment of it. The word ""ugh"" summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through ""dost thou"" after ""dost thou"" isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book ""The Classics Reclassified""."
0,"Avg. Rating too high I've bought this book, underlined every hint of symbolism, found all evidence of romanticism, followed every quote involving thematic oppositions, and noted every example of Pearl's rebellious nature and social alienation, but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding. The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace."
0,Received a different book I ordered a specific ISBN No. and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different ISBN No.The picture seen online is not the one that I received.
0,"Oh my... This novel is absolutely awful. Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs, at zero. Where to begin... perhaps with the run on sentences, the failure to create significant rising action, the flat two dimensional characters... This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant. Post-modern society does not really care about, ""Baby daddies,"" and the revelation which is made at the end, and beginning, of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury. Unfortunately, Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster."
0,"I read to pages of this novel and I had to stop! I have yet to actually complete this novel. It is so dog-gone hard to understand. On top of this, I have an essay that is due: TOMORROW! Is there no relief?!"
0,"I don't get it. I was assigned this book when I was a sophomore in high school (22 years ago). I couldn't get through it; the Cliff Notes version help me pass the test. I found it turgid and laborious reading.I graduated in the top 10% of my high school class. I have a master's degree. Despite my academic success, I don't understand why this book is a classic. I don't understand why Hester didn't just pack up Pearl and her stuff, move to another town and tell everyone she was a widow. That would have saved everyone alot of grief, especially young readers like me."
0,I hate this book. This is the worst book I have ever read. The attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period. I hurled it across the room at one point in agitation and disgust.
0,"get it away I usually have nothing to say but good things about book I read! But this book, it does have it's interesting points but I just don't get into it. I rather would burn myself at the stake that read the remaining chapter I have to finish for my English Class. What did I have to do to deserve this? I stood there reading the book with my book in one hand and dictionary in the other, I ended up reading Chapter 9 about 10 times because the information wasn't getting to me. And the way the author addresses the reader, I want to scream. I'm sure in the 1850's this was a wonderful book because of the message it stated back then, but more than 100 years afterwards, people seem to lose interest. And the fact that they make HS students read this book is just plain homicide. STOP THE ASSIGNING OF THIS BOOK! DON'T PUT YOUR STUDENTS THROUGH TORTURE!"
0,"Don't pay for this on the Kindle Unless you have the correct size font, you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle. It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text, the next line has a single word, then another full line and so on."
0,"Awful I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word ""Classic"" stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was ""meaty"" (whatever that is), ""deep"", and ""powerful""; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle."
0,"I HATE THIS BOOK I'm sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better, if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language. I don't know about the production of narcotics in the 1800's, but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasn't on a natural high if you know what I'm saying."
0,Don't READ THIS BOOK!! THIS BOOK SUX! Who cares about Pearl anyways! Someone shoot me in the head before i die of boredom!!!
0,slowly falling asleep The book is boring if you try to read it without a good look at the movie first but it gets easier to understand once youre in class failing every single test your teacher gives you on it! Then she decides to explain what's going on to you later. It was boring and I fell asleep everytime I went to read it.
0,"one of the worst books I've ever read typically, I will force myself to read even the worst books (for class, for ""fun"", because I think I should), but when I read this book for a [...] English course, I quickly realized it was one of the worst books ever (not to be taken lightly, seriously), certainly not worthy of a classic, boring, endless details that no one cares about... blah blah blah. Terrible. I was bored. It might have been too difficult for a 9th grader, but I wouldn't read it now either.on the other hand, my brother loved it."
0,"I only gave it a star because I had to. This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good. If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown, they can actually write!"
0,"paralyzing fear The pain brought on by this archaicly verbose peice of literary kindling is so great that, while reading, I was greatly tempted to gouge out my eyes to prevent any future encounters with Mr. Hawthorne's ""work"". Please, for the love of all things sacred USE CLIFFNOTES!!! It will save you from years of therapy. I am scarred for live. My soul will be tormented after death and i will be forced to walk the earth in search for reconciliation."
0,"This book is a wast of good paper Oh man, where do i begin with this one? First of all, I want to say that a 1 star rating is flattering this novel beyond all means. The Scarlett Letter is one of the most boring pieces of junk that I have ever been assigned to read. I realize that there is a ton of symbolism in this novel, but if you can't stay awake to find it, what's the point? Also, it really helps when Hawthorne decides to use 15 letter words in each and every sentence. Only person that I would recommend this novel to is an insomnia patient. This one ranks right up there with A Tale Of Two Cities (another ""Classic"")."
0,"Painful This was one of the most boring books i've ever read. Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel, that was a mistake. I'd pass on this one if i were you, if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online."
0,"Incredibly confusing; have a dictionary on hand! This is probably the most confusing and worst book I have ever read! The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely won't know hat you are reading. From my point of view as a high school (with mostly A's and good at English) student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students. The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all. Long setences also makes the book drag on. If I didn't have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start. This book had me in tears because it was so difficult. I had to ask my English teacher to explain this to me. Read this book at your own risk, but i do not reccommend it to anyone."
0,"Ick. Three words to describe my feelings of this book...I HATE IT.Hawthorne's writings are dull, dry, and other words that mean bad that start with D. The character's a boring."
0,"The Next Best Thing to a Sleeping Pill! This book literally put me to sleep. I could wake up at 2 in the morning and find the book in my lap, and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class. I mean, some of the sentences are about 15 lines long, and the plot, if there is a plot, is incredibly slow. If the author would just tell it like it is, and not drag it out for pages, the book would be only about a third of the length that it is. Boring, boring, BORING!"
0,"How Can Sex and Sin Be So Boring? Throughout this entire book, one part of my brain was in a state of wonder, trying to imagine how anyone could make a book about scandal, sin, adultery, public shame and cowardice so dull. To finish the book was a test of will, and was accomplished because I hate to leave things undone.There are many fine, engaging, interesting novels, both of our age and of Hawthorne's. I can't imagine why one would want to slog through this one."

0,"1996 edition of book is outdated The book WAS good in its time but EVERYTHING related to traveling in this area of SE Asia, especially Laos, has changed drastically in the past three years. Frankly, a 1996 edition should be sold as remainders at about $2, then someone who wanted only info about the people or the temples could get ethnographic info only! I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most published info, except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong Khai,Thailand, who does visas to Laos, was wrong and very outdated--especially the most important things like availability of visas and safety of bus/road travel. Real traveling info from books like this that are so old could be very misleading!"
0,"Disappointing This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style."
0,"Arrived broken! Well, this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" kind of reviews. Didn't pay much, didn't expect much, but basically functional would've been nice.

0,"Nauseating! If you are adamant to watch this movie despite all the negative reviews, please do it after the Holliday season. This is the most depressing, sad, pathetic, sarcastic and cruel movie that I've ever seen in my life.Through all the movie I felt that I am going to cry and was depressed for the rest of the day. Basically it is a movie about a guy that lost his parents during his childhood, twins with serious genetic disorders and a single mom. How somebody could find it funny is beyond me.If you want to kill the Holiday spirit and get into a deep depression than this movie is perfect for you! If not - skip it."
0,A very disappointing movie Its sad that a animation that is clearly made to attract children was made with such rude humor and disrespect towards others. How this animation could be recomended for anyone is beyond me. Shame on you Adam Sandler that your ability is not used for more postive purposes.
0,"Parents - Don't Let Your Kids Watch This Movie Someone I know bought this in a discount rack, thinking it was what it pretends to be -- a children's holiday cartoon. Nothing could be further from the truth. I could not believe what a disgusting piece of filth it is, full of perverted sexual innuendo. Movies like this should not be marketed toward children, and no matter what the rating, that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a children's holiday cartoon. It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it (and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever). I can't give this as strongly negative a review as it deserves! I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give it none."
0,"i want my money back Most likely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! I went to see this movie with about 5 or 6 friends, when it was over, we all wanted our money back! The movie is not funny at all. Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy, there are alot of sad parts in it, but they label it as a comedy. All this movie actually is happens to be is a fairy tale for little kids, huge waste of money. If you want to see a real adam sandler comedy wait for anger management or rent happy gilmore."
0,"Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams Movie! This movie was terrible!""WARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLE!""Well it starts out with Davey, a drunk who is crude and mean. Then when he gets into trouble he's doomed to community service with the town migiet Whitney, (No offence to little people out there, that it not my intention to offend anyone). Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack, and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isn't any better.Well Davey does all he can to offend Whitney. That is until his place burns up! So he moves in with Whitney and his sister, and they set some ground rules. Then as the movie goes on, they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion, and when he cries it's all the sudden a big deal! And for some reason the deer in the woods talk, and help Whitney out. What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa Claus?I hate the music in it, the voices are annoying, and the characters are mostly unlikable! So warning to parents, keep your children locked up from this totally bad movie!"

0,"Nightmare Before Hannukah I love Adam Sandler. Well, I used to love him, before he made Eight Crazy Nights. Not only was this cartoon not funny, it was downright trash. I would not recommend this ""feature"" to anyone. ""Eight Crazy Nights"" was short on story, long on time, and wearing on patience. I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I'll never get that time back. So now I sit here, typing away a review I doubt anyone will read, wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie! HUMBUG! Watch ""Ishtar,"" you'll get more out of it. Oh, and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star. I did this under protest."
0,"Okay. There is a movie worse than Stargate. Let me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies. I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Sure, they're not great films, but they've given me plenty of laughs. So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies I've ever watched, you'll know it isn't because of some bias against Mr. Sandler.This may be the worst movie ever made. It is cloying, stupid, unfunny, weird, and pathetic--in a bad way. I could go on about the awful story, the grating voices, the cliches and schmaltz, or the bad songs. (Yes, Virginia, this is a musical. The worst musical ever unleashed on film. No, I haven't seen every musical; but you don't need to in order to fully understand the depths to which this film sinks.)Don't see it. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't send any signal that they should make more cr*p like this."
0,"Worse Movie I've Seen In Ages I gave this 1 star because they wouldn't let me have 0 stars. The movie is just plain horrible. The 12 year olds in the audience enjoyed the juvenile, flatulence and other bodily function humor. But, this was the same audience that was passing gas in the theater and laughing at themselves. It will be a long time before I waste money on another Adam Sandler film."
0,"Sucks Yeah well this movie was just terrible. Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible. I mean this is a stupid movie, one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him. It's almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more. The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler's character but once again it fails, we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge. This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film. And one last comment, Why the hell is this a double disc DVD? All of Sandlers good and/or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment. This movie sucks."

0,"Why so expensive??! Why does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows? Especially considering these don't even have the original soundtrack. The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show, and it's missing from this way over-priced version. As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy."
0,"Spun Out The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are (1) Elvis' opening production numbers (including a nicely staged ""Adam And Evil""); (2) Deborah Walley's ""girl drummer"" role; (3) the Deusenberg; and (4) Elvis' closing production number, the medium walking blues ""I'll Be Back"". Everything else is redundant."
0,"The Road To Love Is Full Of Danger Signs... Three lovely young ladies all want Elvis' gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that's so bad it ROCKS! I just love the title song sequence where Les and the guys 'provide' Elvis with ""...lots and lots of girls."" And who was that chick, the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King? She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before! Elvis looks embarrassed. Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way."
0,"Piece of junk! This would be a nifty little contraption if it wasn't for the fact that you can't change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.I have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus. I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder. Oh, and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort."

0,"This is a Bootleg,Don't buy. I would like to recommend to anyone who have thought of buying this box set, to stay away. I've been a die-hard Metallica fan since the 80's, and i have never bought a bootleg album w/out hearing something off of it. I'm also in the Official Metallica Club, we are notified weeks before anyone else that a new album is coming out. They never mensioned this one, so then again i'd advise you to stay away from this item. The Garage Inc. CD is great. I've got all the versions of it except this one. I of course don't plan on getting it though. Who in their right mind would pay almost $140 for an item not even licensed by the band. I hope everyone who was thinking about buying this reads this first, so you all don't get ripped off."
0,"Don't buy it ! This pepper mill does not work well at all, it takes a lot of hand crunching to get the pepper ground and the refill 'twist off' plastic cap on the bottom on mine does not even open.The lip of the plastic cap hits the side of the pepper mill plastic body not allowing the refill cap to come off ! I used it until it ran out of pepper and that's it. Writing the manufacturer to get a refund. Shoddy construction. Get yourself a good old-fashioned wooden pepper mill."
0,"Hard to clean We had to buy a new lunchbox for our son after 2 months (a different brand, machine-washable) because this one is way too hard to clean.

It is very durable, but we can't get rid of the smell or stains with a reasonable amount of effort."
0,"Just horrible I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off, I bought it without hearing anything by them before, but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So, why did i personally find this so painfull?Well, the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off, the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons, but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell, being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan, was I recomended this? It's bland, it's week, and the dubby bass, boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually, forget it. The whole package. It is just lame."

At this moment, we do not have any working one for your computer."
0,"Not even a day... I bought this to replace the supposedly same power adapter that I purchased last year. This is NOT the same adapter as pictured for the item (I see that a customer has added two pictures of the true product). I was not concerned with this difference but would have preferred to have a light indicating the power is on. At first, it seemed to power my powerbook G4 fine, but later it started to cycle as charging and not charging, thus making the screen brighten and darken. When I shut the computer and let it charge, it did charge some, but I'm concerned about ruining my battery (which is also a replacement). It simply does not work when you are using the computer..and I'm ALWAYS using my computer! I will have to find an alternative to this product. I thought it was bad enough that the one I got last year quit working, but this is ridiculous."
0,"Does not work with ibook G4 This product does not work with my ibook G4. As stated by some earlier reviews by other customers, the charger toggles between charging and not charging. Occasionally, if it is left on, it will continuously charge. I thought about keeping it, but it is unreliable and there are other third party options for $10 more.This one is going back to Amazon."
0,"Bad Product: Cycling on and OFF Nice form factor etc...but bad function. Product appears to charge my Powerbook G4 12"" when it is off or asleep, but when working it cycles on and off and emits a faint buzzing sound from the brick. Try another product."

0,"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IBOOK G4 I'm sure this product is great for G4 Powebooks and G3 iBooks, but nowhere in this product description does it say that this adapter is NOT for use with iBook G4s. I tried this on my iBook G4, and the computer kept switching back and forth between battery power and the power supply from the adapter. I'm returning this to Amazon tomorrow, but am upset that I wasted $20 overnighting this adapter because I absolutely need to use my computer this weekend. I wish they would update the product description to make it explicit that this is for Powerbook G4s and iBook G3s ONLY."
0,"note to self: read reviews before buying I'm now on my third charger for my Powerbook (my dad says I'm rough on equipment). Let me tell you, the Macally is NOT it. Like others, it fluctuates between charging and battery every 1-2 seconds and the brick makes weird squeaky noises. After not having a computer for a week and being so relived to finally get this charger, I was almost in tears to find that it is a piece of crap. It charges when the computer is off or in sleep mode, but that's not going to cut it. If you have a Powerbook G4, don't waste your money on this."
0,"Defective product, bad service I purchased this adapter to replace another PS-AC4 that worked for about 18 months before going belly up. This one lasted two weeks. I called MacAlly and quickly got an RMA number, then I overnighted the defective item to them. That was ten days ago, and I'm still waiting for the replacement to arrive."
0,"Faulty Product - Horrible Support I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened. No power- nothing.When I unplugged this adapter the negative metal ring from the plug stayed lodged inside of my computer, I had to remove it with needle nose pliers.I had to call the company 5 times before getting a rep on the phone as I was continually placed in automated limbo for about 15 per call. The rep actually admitted to me that this happens alot because the rings are too small and fit to tight in the computers.I was really looking forward to saving some dough. But this adapter was surprisingly worse the the original that came with the computer.They are sending me return authorization."
0,"Bate and Switch We ordered the Macally PS-AC4 power adapter and received an entirely different product from a differnt comany. As noted by other Amazon shoppers we received th Inspire M8482. This adapter is differnet in the following ways..instead of the 10'cord with a velcro wrapper, it has a short cord that leavesthe transformer hanging from the input of your computer. This will ultimately break the DC connection from the board..this is not repairable. Their is no led power light as advertised leaving you wondering if it is on. It is clearly a cheap knck off and we are taken for idiots who might not recognize that. I am mad! I just went through a similar thing with Overstock. Months of emails, calls and waiting on hold...for a grain of satisfaction. It is insulting to think that these big companies have so little respect for us!"
0,"They are selling defective merchandise -- look at recent reviews! I too have the same problem most recent reviewers have had: when I plug the charger in, it cycles between charging and not charging every two seconds. The computer doesn't end up charging.In addition, the version I have doesn't look like the picture on the Amazon web site, and doesn't have the power LED.Clearly there is an epidemic of defective chargers. And we, the customer, have to go to the hassle of obtaining a return authorization and sending it back.I notified the seller. I am also going to notify Amazon to research this topic, and take the product off the site until they can resolve the issue. Other than this charger, my experience with Amazon has been exemplary.I strongly suggest that if you too have bought one of these chargers and have had trouble with it, please post here."

I tested it with a multimeter, and found that it had an open lead.I contacted Amazon (even better, through their web site - no waiting on the phone or waiting for an email), and they shipped another.This second one had the same problem as the first.I contacted Amazon again for a refund.The product was junk, but the service was excellent!"
0,"Cheap, Doesn't charge, dangerous, power cord This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15"" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the ""brick"" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better."
0,Macally Power cord Macally is a terrible company. NOT worth the money you save. I recently bought a power cord thru them that emits an electrical current thru my computer.

0,"Works great... for about a month Everything the other reviews say about this product is largely true: the cord is thicker and more durable than the Apple adapter, the brick doesn't get as unnervingly hot, you can deal with the fact that it's not powerful enough to be used as a power source... but one day it just mysteriously stops working. I bought this to replace my broken Apple adapter and was generally very pleased with it, but about a month later I went to plug it in one day and it just wouldn't work. My laptop showed no connectivity, the little charge light on the brick didn't go on, and after tinkering with the thing at length I couldn't get anything to change. If you want a cheap, temporary replacement charger, I guess this would be fine. But for anything long-term it might just be worth shelling out $80 for something that at least lasts a year or two."
0,Terrible product. Broke twice. Don't buy!!! Don't buy!!! This charger does not work. It broke twice before Amazon told me they would not send me another. The customer service was excellent from Amazon.
0,"Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4 This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned."
0,"Stopped Working Day 3 Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear."
0,"sparked, then didn't work We plugged this on only to have it spark and not power our ibook G4. It went back the next day."
0,"Another defective one... This product would intermittently charge my computer, charging about half of the time and not charging the other half. It has 3 1/2 stars as an average from so many reviews because you get exactly what you pay for with this one - a cheap alternative.I was happy with the first one I bought. It lasted about a year and a half with heavy use. I thought I'd try another one but odds are you'll end up with a defective one of you buy a few of them."
0,"Disappointing and dangerous Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. What I got was never quite up to speed, but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in, the quick charge wasn't a must. Unfortunately, after a scant 8 months, with very little movement or unplugging (I've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time), the power cord has given out. There seems to be a short between the wires, with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire. Needless to say, I'm not going back to this product!"

Halfway through the show, the singer was having serious trouble hauling his fat *ss around the stage. He sounded like an exhausted pig, gorging himself at the trough.

0,a real pain I bought this item 2 months ago because it was small and cheap. I use it daily. The grinding mechanism is already tired. Now it takes a lot of patience to actually get the desired amount of pepper/salt and it's getting on my nerves. So I'm browsing amazon for a real and efficient mill set.To be fair there is one thing I like in this product: the magnets that let you stick them to the cooker hood.
0,Don't waste your mony Don't waste your money on these. They don't grind well at all. I just bought celtic sea salts and got rid of my table salt and was very disappointed as these just don't grind the salt or pepper. I have to go buy another set and hope they work.

0,"Bill James it ain't No doubt the worst of the many attempts to cop the ideas and success of Bill James, Pete Palmer, etc. over the past decade. Cute names and sophomoric humor aside, there isn't a great deal of meaningful analysis here, and if you take the time to go back and look at the previous year's addition, you will see that these guys are wrong a lot more often than they are correct. Their arcane formulas and measurements totally miss the point of something as simple and palatable as Runs Created, and the result is a dull and confusing mass of EqA's."

Me, I love Archie's music from 62 to 70, this music is CRAP. Strangely, Things Have Go to Change was amazing - Archie you had it in you to be greatImpulse wanted a hit LP this was never going to be it!!!! Archie was misled or not up to say NO!!!!!!"
0,"Slick, over-produced bluegrass I hate to disagree with so many people who love this CD, but I find very little to like about it. I found the ballads weepy, the upbeat songs cliched, and the singing/musicianship professional but uninspiring. To give you an idea of my tastes, my favorites are Nashville Bluegrass Band ""American Beauty"", Steve Earl/Del McCrory Band ""The Mountain"", Ricky Skaggs/Kentucky Thunder ""Bluegrass Rules"". In my opinion, ""The Grass is Blue"" does not approach the artistic standards of these and many other current CD's. Once again, no offense is intended to the many people who are so fond of this CD. The bottom line: I plan on making the day of somebody who wants to own this CD by selling my copy to a used CD store."
0,"Band saves CD As usual, Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She's attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it doesn't work."
0,"Only for the ""Waltons"" I love ya Dolly, but this music is the WHACK, or it is to this city boy! This is a Cd only the Waltons could love!"
0,"Disappointing One truly great song (the first on the disc) followed by 11 weird takes on Mexican folk music and depressing moans. The brilliant arrangement and accompaniment of the first song ""Mi Cara de Pared,"" a sexy, mournfully loping tango, led me to expect greatness within, but alas, Lhasa is a one-trick pony, one with a potentially great voice, which is reduced to strained yodelling on the subsequent uninteresting numbers. It's almost as if she were undecided what category she wanted to present herself in - is it world music? Latin? Pop? Rock? Unfortunately it seems to be none of the above. If I want Mexican folk songs, I'll call Linda Ronstadt. The arranger and producer (name forgotten) should have waited to present the CD when he had more tricks up his sleeve and the singer had better songs. A great disappointment - but that first number is a killer."
0,worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
0,My review The Castle in the Attic was about a 10 year old boy named William who lives with his mom and dad in Pennsylvannia. And he has a baby sitter that stays with him for 13 years and desides to go back to her home in England. William doesnt want her to go so he takes her picture of her husband who died in the world war 2. She finds out and is said for him and gives William a go away gift which was a huge toy castle with a led knight.
0,"This is NOT a VHS tape, It's a music CD. This was sent to me by mistake. So free it was but not a bargain.I dislike this imported 2 disc, 40 tract album very much. The is from the 30's I would think. With high quality headphones this stuff is to hard to listen too.The sound is very thin and hissy. Fidelity is low and overall listen-ability is very weak. This big band stuff without the big band sound. Song after song, it all sound the same, very boring material with sound to match. Just a throw-away."
0,"waste of money!!!!! Oh man, this is horrible! I'm a Lara junkie, and I'm completely embarassed by this horrid game. The PC controls are a joke, you just seem to spin in circles when you're just trying to make a simple turn. I feel completely ripped off by the folks at Eidos for releasing such a bug filled game. Game locks up at the worst possible moments, cut screnes are too long and dull, just let us play the game without the need to watch a movie every level...put all that energy into fixing the movement controls and lock up issues. Please, don't waste your hard earned cash on this!!! Maybe Eidos will get the message."
0,"Robocop dressed like Lara Croft I was expecting Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness since last year, with a similar performance as Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, but now when I receive the game, I saw this little girl that walks like with an umbrella inside of her pants.The graphics and sound are great, but Lara rotates like a robot and when I try to make her run, she doesn't agree with me and moves extremely slowly.I have a 2MHz PC with 500Megas RAM and GeForce4 Graphic Card, and there is no possibility that only this game needs to practice Ctrl-Alt-Del each 15 minutes in order to play it.I'll find the way to sell my game and suggest Eidos to make a research in order to define how many of the customers are really satisfied with this game and determine if a refund to the customers is the better way to maintain the good image of Eidos until today.It's a shame."
0,Do Not Buy This Game Inspite of the two patches offered by Eidos the game crashed very often. Lara's movements are hard to control and choppy in stairwells. You will be nothing but disappointed if you spend your hard earned money on this game.
0,Don't waste your money I bought this game at a reduced price and still feel like I got ripped off. The controls in the PC version are an absolute nightmare and make what could have otherwise been a decent game horrible. Sometimes you feel like you have no control whatsoever. Good thing two successful movies have been made about this game otherwise EIDOS would've been out of business with this horrendous offering. In fact I'll think twice before purchasing anything with the EIDOS name or CORE DESIGN name attached to it.
0,"This [stinks] I will have to assume this game is going [to stink] Why would it's release be pushed back a third time? I am tired of waiting. This game must be so bad that Eidos/Core must feel it needs some severe refinement before release.On top of the release date changes, neither Eidos or Core have bothered to put the news up on thier sites. ..."
0,"Bad Eidos, Bad! Oh. My. God. I remember when Tomb Raider first came out, and my husband and I got it on the original PlayStation. It was great, for 1995. We got Angel of Darkness for our computer, and WHOA! It looked like Eidos had REGRESSED! The animation is choppy, jumps (basically all moves, in general) are hard to control and judge, and I read on a review for the PS2 version that you'd better come to love the phrases ""save successful"" and ""load successful"" because that's what you'll do, over and over and over! It's completely ridiculous how bad the game looks and plays. Holy cow, and the Glitches! At one point in the church, if you move Lara to JUST the wrong spot then the game gets stuck on the two boxers in the ring fighting, and you have to reboot the computer to get out of it! This game wasn't even worth the discounted price I picked it up for. Don't buy it, it's a trick..."
0,Angel of darkness is correct This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
0,Come on here people... This control sceme made Tomb Raider 1 unplayable. This control scheme kept me from passing the TRAINING levels of TR: Last Revelations. This control scheme was horrible but barely useable when I played Resident Evil. This control scheme caused me to die like a thousand times on the first level when I played Fear Effect. This control scheme is still compleyely horrible in this game.Would someone please tell Eidos to change the controls in any future Tomb Raider games. I really want to like this series but every one of these games has been unplayable due to the control scheme.
0,"Do not buy this Brand!!! I was originally pleased with the make of the washer but the connector between the washer and hose broke, when i ordered the replacement parts it took them over 1 ""YEAR"" to get the replacement parts to me. That is not a typo and i find it ignorant that it took that long to replace a plastic part that they should have had mass produced with plenty of spares. Do not buy, the customer service is horrible and the machine breaks easily, not to mention to get it fixed takes a year."

0,"WARNING - Does Not Help This is one of those books that copies all of the information from other books and tries to call it their own (an does not give all the information needed to do the few examples). If need information on bookbinding, the best I have found is Hand Bookbinding: A Manual Of Instruction by Aldren Watson (also available here)."
0,Waste of money This looked like it would be lots of fun but it's very hard and uncomfortable and doesnt vibrate very well at all. Dont waste your money
0,"Just in case anyone is as stupid as I am This may be the best product out there ... I wouldn't know because I had no idea what I was ordering. It didn't dawn on me when it said pneumatic that I had to have an ""air supply"" ... plus it doesn't have any grinding points. I just wanted something to etch my name on the metal prints of my artwork. So back it goes and I'll look for something that's simple enough for me to understand what it is and how to use it."
0,"I am not impressed with this product! I bought this bag holder to use in my yard to collect leaves anddog droppings. The construction is very flimsy and the little tabs that hold the bag in place are VERY VERY hard to get off!. After several months, it now can barely stand up by itself and I have to constantly tighten the wheels and other screws. It would be nice if it was better made and sturdier and if it had a cover to keep out the flies...It seemed like a great idea, but the products is not well made."
0,"Cheaply made product I often struggle when trying to empty the clippings from my lawnmower into a garbage bag and I had hoped that this product would make that task easier. I was disappointed, I must say. The frame is very thin and unstable. The assembly instructions were hard to understand and the product was hard to assemble with only one set of hands. I am not pleased with this product at all. It seems as though it would collapse if I were to use it for my intended purpose. I do not recommend this product at all."
0,"flimsy poor instructions, had to modify by creating new holes in the metal. The rubber bag clamps were too difucult to remove so replaced with wood clothespins. Don't bother with this thing."
0,mismached The item as pictured was not sent. Instead a holder was sent that had no provision to hold the leaf bag nor did it have wheels. Not worth the ;money
0,BUYER BEWARE This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
0,don't waste your money The worst item I have ever purchased it is so flimsy you can only fill it to half full putting it together nut and screws stripped out and had to go to ace hardware to buy new bolts and nuts save your money
0,"I would rather chew my leg off than have you read this book. Please let me begin by agreeing with most reviewers that Aldous Huxley was a brilliant man, one of the most forward-thinking men in modern history and (on the whole) a wonderfully gifted writer. That being said, this book is absolutely, unequivocably horrible. It is 354 pages of plotless, repetitive socio-preach. Mr. Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" is, in my opinion, one of the best novels ever written. ""Island"" does not rise to that same level, though, and I would not wish it upon anyone."
0,Software is Horrible! This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
0,"Wrong title and director There are two mistakes about this DVD. The English title for this Italian movie should be either Bread, Love and Dreams (original: Pane, amore e fantasia) or Bread, Love and Jealousy (original: Pane, amore e gelosia). The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them. Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932. Both Italian movies are very good, but the one star is because of these mistakes."
0,"A Rookie Game Everyone knows that a good strategy game involves somewhat of a steep learning curve and an advanced difficulty level. This game is simply a click and attack real time strategy that does not involve any heavy thinking. In fewer words it's the bunnie slope for youngsters that are just discovering the thrill of these games. In conclusion I feel the word strategy is innapropriate altogether! True strategy players will want to return the product, rookies will like it because they'll feel moderately challenged by it."
0,"Very Disappointing. I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade, but sadly they have not. Having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out. Now that Kim is in her 40s, you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past."
0,"Don't Bother w/the Muffs...just Noise. Bought this CD thinking it would be similar to their cover tune, Kids in America.Was I wrong, this is worst cd I've has the displeasure to listen to.Old chic, lead singer does nothing but scream throughout all the tracks. The tunes are simplistic, lack depth and show no inkling of creativity.If you like endless screaming to nonsensical lyrics then this rubbish is for you."
0,"Promising, but a let down. Sorry, i just didnt get it. We all know the lessons provided in this book. Seems too repetitive. There are plenty of other self help books that are more useful than this one."
0,"Simplistic, humorous book on life. This book really wasn't for me. It's the same tripe as 101 other books of the genre. Although, it might be useful to the right person. I'd happily recommend it as a gift for a teenager, or anyone who doesn't usually read books. The book reads a lot like the ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" series, with quirky quotes and anecdotes, but very little substance. On the bright side, after reading Chomsky or Neitzche, McWilliams is a comic relief."
0,"Total disappointment I was totally disappointed with the book for two reasons. One, it had a different author than the one I ordered. Two, it was tremendously boring. A waste of the little money I did spend to get it."

0,"Poor quality and high price... are these knock-offs? I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34. I already had some Wranglers. The waist was way too small, the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way. These were made in Mexico, just like the ones I bought at Target, but the badging was different, a rubber badge on the back right pocket, not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist. Were these knock-offs? Not sure. Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $15.99 each (they were Original and Legendary Gold, not Cowboy, but still, half the price, pard)!"

0,"Unbelievable I'll have to reserve a higher rating until I finish this saga. I think I will have to agree with the previous reviewer that gave a low rating.

0,"Lousy workmanship This product does its job, but not very well. All the end pieces, except the shovel, and the handles have to be attached to the rods. The poker, the main tool used, does not fit on the rod very well, and will spin loose when trying to move a log. My husband said he will weld it on so it won't move. Would recommend a different product, probably something that is constructed of one piece."
0,"Disappointing I purchased these fireplace tools with great anticipation of beautiful, warming fires. The tools are cheaply made and if you don't put them into the holder the right way they get stuck and it's difficult to remove the handle. Do not recommend."
0,did not like This set is very small. Not happy at all. Bought it because other people gave good reviews. We have a wood burning stove. The poker is not long enough to safely move logs around.
0,Disappointed I was disappointed in the CD because I am a fan of the trio and this one had too much input from other musicians. I guess I was looking for unadulterated Steve Newcomb (sp). My error.
0,"Wrong Country for the product Had to call the MFGR'er to be informaed that the model I was sent does not fit on any GOLF with US Specs,it was manufactured for the UK version of the Golf, which has less ""plumbing"" and emmission gadgetery.For my model, the only option is the replacement filter (square) that fits in the filter box."
0,"Mathematical nonsense Mathematically speaking, this book is all nonsense. For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice."
0,"Too blunt for me! All I can really say is I didn't even finish the book. I love romances but this one wasn't for me. I found it too much to read about sexual desire and how the body responds to it, that was too much for me. I would say this book should say blush or some kind of note to let people know its not clean romance."

This is the first book I have deleted before finishing it. I read to 35% and just could not take any more! It was not funny at all, it was super annoying and predictable."
0,"Too old to matter This book really should be removed from circulation. While basic MIDI information is in there, it is so out of date it just makes it hard to read. Examples are of obsolete or vintage gear and has no real relation to todays musician.Illustrations are all cheesy and look like bad microsoft clipart. Photographs are all poor and dated. The section on MIDI and a personal computers lists atari and commodore as possible good choices - get the picture!If you are looking for charts of Control codes etc, - they are in here, but you can find those anywhere. If you are trying to get information on MIDI in the last decade or so, buy a different book."
0,"very poor construction For the price this very simple apparatus should function flawlessly. Its one job is to hold sand. I wish I noticed out of the box that one of the edges of the bottom where it meets the frame was bowed out enough to leak sand (salty looking sand) all over my desk. Annoying. I scooted as much sand out of the way as I could to duct tape this edge on the inside. When I have the time, I'll probably dump out the sand and tape all the edges because I don't trust it.The hassle this has caused is definitely not zen."
0,"do not buy this piece of c--p do not buy The Great Indian Wars. the same hollywood movie stock played over and over, sometimes without even turning down the borrowed movie's audio. i couldn't concentrate on the narration, and that was a shame because the narration was very well written. the narrator also had a fine voice and read his stuff superbly. i felt sorry for him, being assocaited with something that went so bad through no fault of his own. someone ruined this ""documentary"" with the choice and use of the visual footage.i even tried turning off the picture and listening only to the narration but the silly dialogue and old-western music score made trying to listen only to the narrator sheer torture. i only wish i could have given this film a rating it really deserves. MINUS FIVE! the fact that they used 2 tapes when the entire length is only 96 minutes proves to me that the intent of the producers was only to flim-flam the public into thinking they were getting a lot for their money."
0,"The Great Indian Wars 1840-1890 This is without a doubt the worst video I have ever watched.The videos picture could not tracted without jumping lines and wiggling screen it was painful for me to watch.The movie itself was out of focus.They used old black and white movies"" indians meet the cavalry "" to illustrate the action and pencil drawings of the indian chiefs while they spoke of them. There was one man speaking with a monotone voice.After five minutes it became very boring to watch.The movie was put together very poorly and hard to watch the pictures had very little contrast, and hard listen to.It was so bad I could'nt retain any of infomation,my mind kept wandering off.

Previously I had a Viewsonic 17"" LCD monitor which was pretty bad too. The Soyo has a bad stand that is supposed to be adjustable, but I could not do it and had to prop it at an angle with a book. The User's manual is nearly incomprehensible. The speakers have to be the worst sounding ones I've ever heard.

0,"I do not recommend this vacuum We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner."
0,"Very poor vision of Wolverine I have seen an episode of this show and all I could say is WOW, what a travesty. This show is completely not Wolverine. First Logan is Canadian not Japanese, short not tall, older looks middle aged even though much older not like a teenager. Voice acting is poor. This show is the William Shatner of Wolverine, extreme over acting and over dramatized action sequences. This is supposed to be Marvel Comics Wolverine not a Wolverine DragonBall Z. If they want to make a good Wolverine Cartoon keep it on par with the comics both in the character models and story, and use voice actors that have worked in the past, and if you really want to do Wolverine Justice make it a Mature rated cartoon and show Blood in the battles."

0,"JUNK! (says China on product) When will people stop digging for the lowest possible price? I would have paid three times this price to have a quality product. After three pumps the check valve that holds the air in the rocket failed. You would push the pump in and all the air would get sucked out of the rocket when you pulled the pump back out. Then the mounting nipple snapped off when releasing the rocket from the clamp. Never worked once! Would like to find one that works, but they all look the same."
0,"Can't get it to work I used to love these rockets back in the day when I was a kid, so I got one for my 11-year old son. When it arrived, it looked like the ones I had as a kid, but was obviously of cheaper quality. Then again, it cost only a few bucks. Problem is, when I put the water in and then snap close the end of the pump, all the water leaks out! This happens whether the rocket is pointed up or down. The rocket is totally useless and we had to throw it away. Too bad, those rockets sure were fun a long time ago..."
0,"Memory Lane?? I bought 2 of these hoping to show my kids one of the toys I had growing up. Wow, these are straight CRAP. Why would someone produce a product that SUCKS this much?!! The clip that holds the rocket to the pump doesn't hold the rocket on. The O-ring is a dried, hard, brittle piece that doesn't seal. Then, when you get past ALL that crappy-ness, the pump shaft will either pull completely out, bend like a pretzel while pumping, or leak water into the pump itself! I got three launches out of 2 of these. I was more disappointed than the kids were. Boooooo!"
0,"Ron Not as pictured. Doesn't seal well for the launch and so it is pretty much worthless. I had the one pictured when I was a kid and was pretty excited to order and now left with disappointment. Order what you see and you may get something else and cheaply made. Maybe should have bought this back in 2006 when it got better reviews. Amazon, please take this off your site!! It indeed is less than a quality product and your company is deceiving those who buy."
0,"Junk Wanting to share my water rocket memories with my kids, I decided to try this rocket out in spite of all the bad reviews. I agree, it is junk. While the whole thing is cheaply constructed, the biggest problem I see is with the pump. The valving is so defective it simply will not pressurize the rocket. Even though I was very gentle with the pump, it came apart after only a couple pumps and the rocket never flew. I'd love to find a good one of these but this one is not."

0,"NOT WORTH THE MONEY This is totally different from the ""classic albums"" series of DVDs that have come out which I love. This is a ""classic album under review"" which basically has a bunch of fat old guys talking about how great AC/DC is. The clincher for me was the fact that they had an AC/DC tribute band on to play the guitar riffs from this album. A TRIBUTE BAND?!?!? I'm sure that was great fun for those guys to do, but I think the people watching would rather see the actual band playing the songs. This DVD went on WAY too long and only had little snippets of the band playing live. Way too much filler for me and not what I thought this DVD was going to be. I do not recommend it."
0,"Come on............. We know Back in Black was one of the best albums in history...do we really need some ""experts"" to tell us this ??I'm a big AC/DC fan I would not buy this...."
0,"Unbeliavable.... So they release a DVD to say how good ""Back in Black"" is (as if we needed to be remembered of that...) and they put a photo at the front cover with SIMON WRIGHT in the line-up, instead of Phil Rudd! Wright joined the band THREE YEARS after the recording of ""Back in Black"".This fact alone is a very good omen of the real intentions of this product: to make easy and fast money and offering nothing new about this classic rock album. Useless."
0,"BIG THUMBS DOWN I rented this thinking it would be an interesting subject on American-Chinese tradition here in the U.S. But I was wrong, it was a total disappointment. The story and its sub-plots are too contrived. The script is very formulaic; even adding a twist at the ending was typical and intentional - just so for audiences who likes a twist in their movies. Any viewer wouldn't get involved watching this film. Basically this is about a group Chinese-American siblings who has hang-ups with themselves and among each others. Set in the affluent neighborhood of San Francisco, it portrays an embarrassingly rich family by showing the amenities of the matriarch's sprawling extravagant house. Tennis, a dip in the pool, jacuzzi anyone? Jeez! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
0,"Beware The set is cute to look at, but as far as actually using, it is terrible. The glasses are fine, but the shaker is so hard to use, I actually took a chunk out of my finger trying to get it open to refill it! I've never used it again."
0,Not good! I purchases this set for simple craft projects...mainly to cut card stock and cardboard. I tried hammering the punches with my 12 oz. hammer and it didn't go through the card stock. Got my husbands big beefy hammer...it still will not punch through thin card stock. I am very disappointed in this product. Glad I didn't pay a lot...complete waste of $
0,Dull and dirty Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we'll see
0,"Broke within the first week I bought this binder for my son who started middle school. Withing the first week, one set of rings did not close properly and now my son has to carefully go through his notebook so the papers don't fall out. Everything gets stuck at the point where the rings don't completely close. Poorly made product."
0,"Probably the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen I have a relatively high tolerance level for bad flicks, but this one is beyond tolerable. If you check the credits after the movie it appears as if the producer hired his family and friends as the actors. Summary (no pun intended): Horrific acting (I could have acted those scenes better than the so called actors; Frightful script (who talks like that anyway ""The zombies are breaching our stronghold, I would advise that we seek an alternative egress route in order to address the impending conflict""; Brain Blending effects: Nothing like a karate kick to the face that missed by about 6 inches yet knocks the zombie through the window. My review is more interesting than this movie. Give me a camcorder and an Amazon makeup kit (shameless plug) and I could have done this movie. There is nothing redeeming about this... NOTHING!"
0,dont waste your time or money. lower then low budget with horrible dialogue and acting. Two six year olds could have done better with a couple of kindergarten actors
0,"Too small and stained I ordered this for my average sized 8 year old. I purchased the medium (size 8-10) and it is way too small. It's too short, tight around the shoulders, the boot covers don't cover her foot and the mask won't go around her head (not even close and again she's 50%ile in both height & weight for her age). This size would be better for a 5 year old! And if that isn't bad enough, the cape has a dark (non-removable) stain on it! I'm hoping I can return it w/o paying for shipping considering this item is damaged."
0,"Bad thing The fabric is very common, the finishes are really bad, the mask was broken the first time, the layer has no seams, the fabric also is leadership, not what I expected."
0,"Item was nice color This rod was too flimsy in my stall shower to stay up more than 10 minutes with a curtain. We put it up at least four times and it fell down. I returned it. Color was nice, it was extremely thin."
0,This DVD is not as represented in the description. There are only 8 out of about 24 episodes from the Baking With Julia series on the DVD. Amazon would not guarantee me a full refund if I returned it since I took off the plastic.Even though I had not viewed it. I didn't notice that it was only 8 episodes till after a tore the plastic off and looked at the back of the dvd. Definitely is not work the money.
0,"Sent damaged product I received this DVD in a well packed box with another item. The other item was in perfect condition. However, this DVD's case was broken in several (at least 4) places. As I said, the box was well packed and insulated. The DVD had obviously been sent in the damaged state it was received in. Most disturbing is the fact that the damage to the DVD case was so OBVIOUS. Pieces are broken off inside the celephane wrapping that you can see and, when you pick it up, you cannot miss feeling them.The DVD itself skips in several places.Unacceptable and unethical behavior on the part of the sender. They had to have known they were sending me a severely damaged DVD case. It had to have been damaged at the time they packed it in the box.As a result, I was not able to give it as a gift as planned."

0,"Sorry, not convincing at all Well, as a vegetarian and resident of a country seeing exploding diabetic population ( India) I find this approach to diabetes unconvincing.ONE, the emphasis is on animal foods. This has three difficultiescultural prohibitionsbiological concentration of alien hormones, pesticides and antibioticsand last not least, the cost factor of such a diet.TWO there is compulsive testing of blood sugar levels.THREE it encourages dependency on the clinician.Where's the sense of freedom in all this?In my counselling sessions I use sprouted whole legumes, leafy vegetables, NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS, resistence exercises, meditation, family support. It all works fine."
0,Not Really for Diabetes II This book is mostly for those with Diabetes one.This is his second book.His first book was a good one and full of useful info for both types of Diabetes.If you are a Diabetic type I then this book is for you.If you are a Diabetic II then buy his first book.I am a Diabetic II and this book was really a waste of my money.
0,Misleading Blood sugar is only part of the equation. Following this type of diet causes high acidic levels which causes illness. This diet is nothing new. My grandmother followed this kind of plan back in the late 40's because they thought ALL carbs were bad. Today we know that the brain needs glucose to function. Carbs + high fiber leaves lower net carbs. And diabetics need a balance---in fact all people need a balance of healthy whole foods and exercise and fresh air. One more thing; my grandmother died of a massive heart attack on this kind of plan. She was only in her 50's.
0,Core Sports Performance A complete disappointment and waste of time. The narrator couldn't seem less interested; almost as though bothered by the project. Look somewhere else for a sports hypnosis cd.
0,"Not authentic The title of this video mentions Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, what is being taught on this tape is not authentic Argentine Tango. Not even close. It's ballroom tango. There is a huge difference: in music, style, steps, posture, etc... Don't be fooled by ballroom instructors trying to teach Argentine Tango. The only authentic instruction available on the market comes from authentic Argentine instructors from Buenos Aires."
0,"Nice Title! It's rather amusing that some harmonica band (or whatever the hell it is) decided to give their album the same title as one of the greatest rock albums in history (Styx: Pieces of Eight). And to Mr. ""Please push sales"" who wrote the other ""review"": I bet your cover art isn't QUITE as good as the incredible Hypgnosis masterpiece of the Styx album. ;-)"
0,"Save your money! I received this software as ""bonus"" with Photo Explosion Delux. It's terrible. Was easy to create the slideshow and it looked great on my computer. Tried it on 2 DVDs and it didn't play. Tried to re-record it on a CD-RW and it still didn't work! It did run on my husband's laptop, but out of 6 computers I tried it on at work it only was recognized on 1! Very frustrating software. SAVE YOU MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER."
0,"Poor quality of wrapping I received my ""new"" product a few days ago but it wasn't in brand new conditions. The box had been worn around the edges and you can tell it had been rewrapped in a different plastic cover. When I pay extra money for a brand new item I expect it to be exactly that."
0,"Sipder-man ""The High Definition Trilogy"" [Blu-ray] only works on PS3 I agree the comment from reviewer GWIRTH ""ginnyww"". Somehow these Sipderman blu-rays are not norm. They can only play on PS3. No luck with Samsung blu-ray players, not work with Sony blu-ray players either. Manufacturer needs to check what's going on. I also checked two sets of Sipderman blu-rays, one set from Fry's electronics, another set from Amazon, same problem, so that is not random disc defects."
0,"WANT REFUND! The movies do not play in my xbox 360 console, which is my only source of a DVD player. i would appreciate a full refund considering i had to wait over 3 weeks just to get the DVDs that don't work."
0,this is not a region 1 set I bought this set for my husband and brother for Christmas last year then we ended up buying a different set for the movie cash for the new movie. I went to sell this set at used movie retailer and they informed me it was from overseas and possibly a bootleg. WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!
0,"Not a real collection boxset. I like the movies and I want to add this trilogy to my DVD collection. However, this set is not a collection boxset that I am looking for. They are 3 separate spiderman movies in their own packages, and bundled together in a newly design cardboard box and called them ""Trilogy"".The worst is that they are the unsold inventory which they applied white stickers to cover the barcode in the back of each box. I felt cheated by Sony Pictures. They should have done a better job by creating a real boxset in a nice package with some additional materials.If you are looking for a nice collection boxset, please skip this set."
0,Perfect if I Lived In Europe Received DVD's with no issue. The problem was that they were formatted for a region other than the United States. This is strange to be due to the fact that they were shipped from an American address to an American address. Amazon refunded my money with no issue.

0,Cable not what it is sold as Cable is sold as having the ability to transfer video from a camcorder to a PC.It doesn't do it. I spoke to the company and they told me that there is no cable that does that. I asked them why thet advertised this cable as being able to do it and he told me I should have known better. They then charged me 15% to take the cable back. You would be smart to shop elsewhere. They don't know what their products do and they charge you for their lack of knowledge.
0,"what a rip off, sony's using customers as cashcows, get the cable from apple instead for only $29! I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called ""Thin Fire Wire"". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.Shame on you Sony."

0,"Break too easily My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past."
0,"Not a scholarly book The book was written by progressives as an attempt to rewrite history about the Christian heritage of the Americans who signed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. This is not a scholarly work. It has no footnotes for reference. It was debunked by scholars the next year after it was written. It is an interesting reading to understand the effort that the authors and the people they represent would go to to advance their political agenda. It is a very unfactual book that distorts truth. With this understanding, people should read scholarly books to understand the Christian legacy of these people."
0,"Brain washing I would like note that if you look at the footnotes for this book as to where they got there information, they do not have a shred of evidence to back them up. They simply state they they have forgone the traditional footnotes and that we should believe them just because they have a PHD. I know that if I were writing any type of paper for these gentlemen in college they would fail me if I didn't show where I got my information. Furthermore, There is a man in Texas who has the world's largest collection of artifacts from our founding fathers and he has loads of evidence which point to the extreme opposite. In fact he has a copy of bibles that were printed and distributed to every family in America through funding from Congress. I would encourage anyone who sees this to watch the documentary called ""MONUMENTAL"" by Kirk Cameron, exposes the truth about our constitution writers and points out the damage that books like these have caused to our society."
0,"Baseless, made up propaganda This is a book that is used in colleges across America, but contains almost no primary source quotes, no footnotes, no endnotes, and thus no scholarly support for any of it's assertions. Did the author even bother to read the founders' letters, speeches, published works, etc? Probably not, bc actual quotes from those who founded this country would really get in the way of their made up speculation, hearsay, and biased opinions masquerading as historical fact. Pathetic."

0,"I can't belive LJS wrote this I am a huge LJS fan, I have read almost all of her books well over 10 times except this one. It was so boring I really disliked to book. It didn't have anything to do with the NW until the book was almost done, and Gillian was so pathetic and whimpy. David.... I really didn't like his character at all."
0,"I can't believe she wrote this! LJS's other books are great, but this one was so boring! There was absolutely nothing dangerous about Gillian and David being in love, and that's the whole point of this series! Also, it's kind of unlikely that someone could just cut her hair and wear makeup and then suddenly be popular. I didn't like Gillian at all. She's superficial, not to mention being Little Miss Weakling. David was an idiot because he fell for her as soon as he saw her with short hair and makeup. Let's get realistic! He cheated on the SATs and Gillian still wants to support him. Plus, he's BORING! LJS's other books are all 5 stars in my opinion, but I hated this one."
0,"Left-Wing Propaganda This old chestnut of a book should be put out of its misery. It's written with style and a tone of authority, but careful reading shows that it is hopelessly slanted. On every significant point which involves historical uncertainty or controversy, the authors unquestioningly accept the left-wing/labor point of view and cynically disparage or totally ignore any other interpretation. This is Labor's ""untold"" story because no other reputable historians have ever had the nerve to write such an openly propagandistic book. Academic labor historians who think this book is so wonderful are merely showing their left-wing ideological colors. There are much better and more objective accounts out there."
0,"No stars but they all think they are and have stuff to say. You can be a rock star and not have a clue as to what haiku is. This book has been around. It has been the brunt of jokes in the haiku community. I can't say I know how to write a decent haiku but if you google, you WILL find some great haiku poets. PLEASE - if you don't have this book, keep it that way. It may have been a year but not a haiku one."
0,"Definitely NOT haiku - poetry? Maybe... This is indeed a book of 3-line poems passing itself off as haiku. This is not harmful certainly UNLESS an unwary reader picks it up and assumes that it is, basing all future opinions of this delightful poetic form on The Haiku Year.""There are those who regard haiku as a kind of 'do your own thing' poem, and never consider its foundations. But the haiku, as soon as it goes beyond the beginner's efforts, becomes a matter incorporating traditions and established values, aesthetic and otherwise, and can not be written well outside them."" - Robert Spiess"
0,"The only stars is the rocker You make it in rock and you think you can do it all. This book proves you can't. It is a truly poor excuse for a collection of haiku and it is particularly offensive because there are those who will buy it thinking it the real thing. Do yourself a favor and buy Higginson. You can look at this in a few minutes in the bookstore. It might be good for advanced classes in ""don't let this happen to you!"""
0,"It's the end of haiku as we know it... This is what has become of haiku in English- and it is all bad. Haiku in America in general is vastly misunderstood and each of the verses in this volume show it. Some have three lines, some do not, some have kigo, some do not. By the looks of this, one can deduce that these ""poets"" gleamed their knowledge of haiku from Kerouac (another haiku fraud) rather than Basho. This is just an experiment really, conducted by a circle of friends who jotted down their thoughts and sent them to one another. Please, please avoid this title if you really care about or want to learn about haiku. Amazon should allow ""0"" stars when rating items such as this!"
0,"poorly written nonsense The author apparently has some theory relating to unexplained phenomena, but you'll never figure out what it is from reading this book.

Of course there's no support for the claims.Don't waste your time on this book."

0,"Bogus...bunk...B-A-loney I enjoy reading about ""unexplained phenomena"". I really do. I love ""real"" ghost stories and the like. However, I prefer an author to take a very scientific stance, exhausting all possibilities. Keel does not. He's a ""true believer"" and that's the problem.Somewhere in the book he supposes that this mysterious Mothman could have been a man on a hang-glider. ""Wow,"" I thought. ""That could almost be construed as logical."" However, he IMMEDIATELY debunks that theory with a statement to this affect: ""But hang-gliders were not very well known at that time.""*shaking my head*Whatever...the man needed to become familiar with Occam's Razor."
0,"SHAME ON YOU MR. KEEL !!! Let me just start by saying that the "" MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole.

0,"Boring & Unbelievable Story Normally, I prefer books to movies, but Mothman Prophecies was not only boring, but unbelievable. Non-fiction! The story was a product of the author's imagination. Perhaps in 1975, when the novel was first copywritten, it was spectacular. To those who are thinking of purchasing this book, (especially after viewing the movie) I'd say pass it up, and purchase the VHS or DVD."

Holy mackeral. i've never seen such bad writing. Someone else mentioned incoherent, tell me about it! This was all over the place. I had absolutely no clue was was going on in this book.

I bought this book to delve further after seeing the movie, and ended up more confused. Go to the movie--forget the book!"

0,"Broke in less then a month I bought this tent on 6/6/2005 for my 10 month old boy and used it once at the pool the rest of the time it sat in my dining room. I went to bed one night and it was up, but the next morning it was halfway down. When I went to see what was wrong I saw that one of the rods had snapped off in the metal holder and cannot be fixed. This could actually suffocate a baby if noone was in the room or the baby could hurt themselves if they found the broken rod. I was very disappointed because the size is great. I also agree with the other reviews it is hard to put together because the rods are so tight you have to have alot of strenth to get it set up. Please don't buy this we are going to return but it's such a hassle to spend 39.99 plus tax on something and it breaks in less then a month."
0,"Where was the editor? Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy.Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues)."
0,"Beware of packaging Sorry I know this is supposed to be a review of the item, but I want my complaint heard by anyone that might buy it. The hat itself is great, if you buy it at the store. New Era hats have large bills and a tall crown, but as long as you don't have a tiny head it will look fine. My complaint was that they shipped me this hat in a dvd box. Seriously. The hat was completely flattened, leaving two huge creases on either side of the logo. Ruined hat if you ask me, and will be returning immediately. You're probably better off buy this item in a hat store and spend the extra few dollars, at least they will have treated it right up to that point."

0,"Repetitive and monotone I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly."
0,"Disappointing I had hoped to read a colorful story about life in the Caribbean, and was not expecting the story to be happy and uplifting. However, I was disappointed to discover that the most prevalent topics in the book were the character's bodily smells, excretions, and sex life.

0,"Worst book I've ever read This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality.

0,"Puzzling After all the hype, and comparison to Camus' ""The Stranger"", I suppose my expectations were high for this book. I found ""Autobiography of my Mother"" completely benign. In some parts, pointless. Unlike Camus' protagonist in ""The Stranger"", Xuela's world-view is too fully revealed to be cleverly wrought and too self-perpetuating to cause empathy with the reader. A self-pitying character, Xuela is hard to empathize with because she decries her father and the white ""conquerers"" for exploiting people and destroying the aboriginal population's culture; yet, Xuela also takes advantage of many -- emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, Xuela just comes across as bitter and codependent and the reader is not compelled to sympathize with her situation. I also found nothing sensual about the book -- the author's placement of masturbation description seemed to come out of nowhere and appears simply awkward. Overally, the book does not deliver compared to the hype"
0,The autobiography of my mother It's not a book I'll ever read again. It was very boring. Glad I didn't pay that much. I give it a star.
0,"Pseudo-nihilistic garbage. A waste of paper and ink. What's the point here? It was never fully explicated, and the narrator does not inspire enough interest to carry this woefully inadequate plot - and I use that word loosely. Jamaica Kincaid needs to go back to domestic work"
0,"Do I have to give it a star? Even that single star is more than this book is worth. My Engligh professor assigned this book to me during my sophomore year of college (along with Nectar in a Sieve, a far better, though not terrific book), and what little I remember of it was that it was just awful (and offal). Her writing is repetitive and choppy, perhaps descriptive but disgustingly so. Do we really need to know the ""wetness between [her] legs"", or that she cooked her menstrual fluid into some poor soul's dinner? I couldn't stand the book. If you want quality, read something by Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King (his descriptions of a girl coming of age in Carrie are much better than this book). Drop the book, throw it, burn it, whatever. It's just not worth reading. How many trees did we lose to its production (and, more importantly, how many talented young writers were rejected because this woman was published). It's just a book not worth reading about a story not worth telling."
0,"Don't buy this book Jean Giorno assigned rights to this story to the public domain. Unscrupulous, evil American publishers are acting contrary to the author's intent and prostituting this work by cracking down on English language versions (including online versions), even new translations from the French. Don't give your money to greed heads who are 180 degrees in conflict with the principles of this book."
0,"Reading an RFC is more fun and more informative too! The editor and publisher of this book should be ashamed. It is an extended rant by the author that has no business being bound in hard cover. The Pine Mountain Group recommends excerps from this book to get up to speed with SNMP. I wonder who at PMG is friends with the author. This book will teach only members of the ""network management community"" anything. Anyone seeking entry into the network management community will need to find another door. By reading no more than 20 to 40 pages a day I managed to go through the entire book but I am afraid that I did not add anything to my understanding of SNMP that was not already there from studying for my MCSE. This book was a profound disappointment. It is at once dense, superficial, earnest, and sarcastic. The shame of it is that this author could educate profoundly if a good editor enforced some discipline or a co-author came in to help with communicating with those who are not the author's peers."
0,"Not just disappointed, angered. It's hard to believe that this book was released by a major publisher. It is rife with misspellings and grammatical errors. The thin index is almost useless, as a close examination reveals it to be mostly a list of the author's friends and their nicknames."

0,"It's Garbage. Koontz can write. But he sucks as a story teller. Books are supposed to have a COMPLETE story in them, no? Well this one has no ending. No end at all. These 2 detectives are clued in to the fact that Dr Frankenstein exists, and is creating his ""perfect race"" to some day kill off all humans. That's it. You meet the original, now educated and ""at one with the universe"" Frankenstein's monster, you meet the main characters, and they have some conflict. That's the whole ""story"" in this book, which it really isn't because the basic elements of a story are a beginning, middle, and end."
0,"Don't bother Definition of a bad book: a book that doesn't make you want to get to the next chapter. I kept trying to see if this would eventually grab me, but after maybe 10 chapters or so of plodding prose, I gave up. Thank goodness it was a library book."

0,"Nirvana is awesome; but home demos of great songs played with terrible quality and instruments isn't Although it does not mention it that the songs on the CD are demos in track listing, almost single song on this CD is cheap home made demos with terrible sound quality, with the exception of a few acoustic and live performances. If you want to buy Nirvana's greatest hits and enjoy the studio quality sounds and recordings of the ones of the best bands in alt rock history, this is not your album and do not be tricked like I was."
0,"Completely Useless I don't quite understand why Courtney is allowed to put these things out, and even more surprised that the other members agreed to it (since they have to). Everyone who already put out the 50 bucks for the box gets a whole three song bonus, songs which don't even sound like anything special. Nirvana was an awesome band who made some of the greatest music of all time, and this CD does reflect that. It's a good CD, but it's useless. It's nothing we don't already have. If they're going to put more Nirvana stuff out, it should at least be stuff we haven't heard. Just buy the three songs off of iTunes or something and save yourself the money from buying this CD."
0,"Tasteless Trash If I could give this half of a star I would. I am a big fan of Nirvana, but this was a total disappointment to me. The tracks sounded awful. I felt like I was ripped off in every sense of the way. I took it to a buy-trade-sell place and not even they would offer me anything for it, which shows you the poor quality of this album. A word of advice; DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
0,"$ Scam The songs on Sliver are easily some of the best of the box but the completely ignored some of the best, also. Its said for me to watch the ""Nirvana Corp."" aka Courtney Love to do something like this. Ultimately, if you don't realize that this is a shtik for $ then you must be confused. Nirvana released a best of cd and then a best of the box? Im just guessing but i think this is what the record company was saying:""We'll throw a couple new songs on it and we'll get some true fans to buy it just to have it.""It's been released for the cash. And this is something I know Kurt wouldnt have approved of. Hopefully someone takes this into consideration before buying it. yea,its good for the collection but its sad to see this is happening. I bought it for the cover art and stuff just to have for the collection nothing more. If your looking for some music get the actual box set."

Take everything you liked about ""Friday"", ""Booty Call"" and ""CB4"", leave them out of this movie and this is what you get. 90 minutes of [stuff]. It is low budget beyond low budget, and you get a headache from listing to fake, incoherent characters who look like they were picked off the street of some ghetto. And those who like to see booty-there is basically none, just one scene which lasts about 15 seconds and features a silent, unattractive ""dancer"".. If you are a fan of these movies, rent it first, you'll see. If you buy it, you will find a movie devoid of beautifull black women and good looking guys, but which is filled with stupid humor and a story which will put you to sleep."

0,"Poor support from Plasplugs About four weeks ago, I purchased at a Home Depot in Florida the Plasplugs ""Master Tiler"", model number: DWW180US-BX.I am using it for a porcelain tile installation. The original blade worked ok for the initial cuts, but I need to replace it for the proper blade type for the tile. I had bought a porcelain tile replacement blade from a blade mfr when I bought the saw. When I got around to replacing the blade, I found out that the Plasplugs machine uses a different ""arbor"" than everybody else. The replacement blade was worthless to me.I then called the Plasplugs US office to order the ""high glaze"" blade. Much to my chagrin, I was told the ""all blades except the standard have been discontinued"".I just bought this saw four weeks ago! I think it is very irresponsible for a manufacturer to behave in this matter.You can be assured that I will avoid any Plasplug product in the future."
0,"Not very good I cannot recommend this tool. When I first used it, I couldn't cut the tile. I then noticed the blade was spinning backwards! When I turned the saw off, and then on again, the blade didn't spin at all. Finally, I realized that I had to ""spin"" the blade manually as I switched on the saw to get it to turn correctly. Not what I expected from a $[$$$] tool. Once I finally got it working, I was still disappointed with the performance. Cutting was very slow, and not very accurate. ..."
0,"Very poor This is a very good concept, but poorly executed. On my particular saw, the tilt section of the table didn't fit flush, so it made the right side of the table useless. Once raised to the 45 degree position, the tilt section was wobbly, as one of the flimsy plastic props did not even touch its rest. The blade ran neither true nor parallel to the fence. The blade retaining nut had to be tightened about every 10 cuts. The blade actually flew off the shaft a couple of times. The tile caught on the plastic end caps of the fence, which stick out. I could easily stall the motor with ordinary 1/4 inch ceramic tile. Can't remember all the other thigs wrong with it, I was in too much of a hurry to return it."
0,"Buy Something Else! The first tile I cut... I knew I had purchased the wrong saw. Maybe to use the rip fence it would work ok, but to cut tile freehand, it was useless. The blade comes up through the table, like a table saw, with the blade spinning through 1 inch of water in the bottom of the tank. The blade picks up the water and sprays it all over the inside of the clear guard over the blade. This makes it impossible to see any lines marked on the tile. It is impossible to make an accurate cut if you can't see your cut lines. Using the saw without the guard is not an option, unless you are working outside, and don't mind getting drenched. Bad design. I'm returning it and spending the extra money to get something good."
0,"PlasPlug Master Tile Cutter Bought at Home Depot for $199. It is a toy, not suitable for serious work. Flimsy contruction, difficult or impossible to adjust. Recommend getting a brand name."
0,"spend the additional money and get an MK My main complaint is the fence, getting both sides square to the blade and locked down will take you about five minute's and even then don't put to much pressure on the fence as it will ether bow or one side will move. An MK is much faster put the tile on the carriage push the tile to the blade make sure the kurf is going to be on the correct side of your mark slide the carriage back set the fence (if you'd like) turn the saw on and cut. I renovate older home and many times the walls are out of square so your cut tiles are going to be getting bigger or smaller as you go God help you if you get into this position with the Plasplugs tile saw...."

0,"Expensive experiment that didn't work I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well, this is pretty convenient, just swipe. But it did nothing for me. I wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts. However, my skin remained the same. And while it doesn't really have a scent, there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because I have quite a sensitive nose. I switched to using them on my back and got the same result, which was nothing. So it was an expensive experiment that didn't work. It may work for someone else but it did nothing for me. Most disappointing. I have since switched to the salicylic gel peel, which hurts a whole lot more, but gets the job done."
0,"Horrible product, wish I could give it negative stars.... This is just a horrible product. If you want to waste $72 on a product that will ruin your skin, look no further.

If you want to have to deal with a company that just doesn't care about anything except for making a quick buck, buy from MD Skincare."

0,"Unbelievable! I am amazed at the high ratings this book received. It was, undoubtedly, the worst book I have ever read. It might have been better with good editing. There were many unimportant characters and many horrible descriptions that could have been omitted. Who really cares about the dogs, many of whom have no relevance to the story. Who really cares about the detailed description of the decor of a room. Yes, I did finish the book that, by the way, had no ending. Toward the middle of the book I actually started editing it.

Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on ""Tess.."""
0,"The book was boring, because of its victorian ideals. Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards."
0,Disappointing I was really disappointed in this book and surprised that so many people think it is a wonderful story. It was such a depressing story and reflects all of the worst things about the way women were treated in that time. I don't think this story had any redeeming qualities and very few likeable characters (even Tess was quite irritating at times with her pride getting in the way of asking for help to make her life a little easier).
0,Buyer Beware This was a VERY used paperback of Tess sold as new with library stickers on the binding as well as the front cover. Amazon is definitely not trustworthy anymore.

My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction.

0,"A waste of paper. This book is one of many written during the ""Bubble Era"" by ""gaijin"" (primarily Americans) who really knew next to nothing about Japan, yet somehow found a publisher, usually Japanese. Another of this quickie genre published about the same time was a book for teaching profanity to Japanese studying English.""Learning to Bow"" may by an accurate account of the author's experience living in Japan and teaching in the JET program. However, that's all it is. It's full of cliches, sweeping generalizations, and offers no insight into living in Japan or understanding the culture. What could the writer possibly know after only two years?"
0,Upsetting I may not a good reviewer because I stopped reading at page 50 but I believe this is not at all a good book to read if you want to learn about Japanese culture. As a Japanese born and raised in Japan I find this book extremely humiliating.
0,"Sarcasm and fabrications I was very disappointed in this book. I have lived in Japan for 6 years (and still do), married and taught on the JET Programme. As a former JET I was disheartened as this book does not paint an accurate picture of life in Japan as a JET. Granted people's experiences differ from prefecture to prefecture and from school to school, but Learning to Bow's anecdotes and observations about Japan are far too extreme and at times border on lies. Also the frequent use of sarcasm and satire is not in anyway humorous and portrays the author as ""god's gift to English teaching"". For anyone curious about life on the JET Programme, teaching English in Japan or life in Japan in general, I do not recommend this book."
0,"Highly overrated It is extremely meandering and never seems to end. It's all about atmosphere and erotic cool and Prague, etc., but at some point a car chase would really liven things up.

0,"the ubearable pain to watch This movie is the lamest peice of pseudo-intellectual crap I have ever seen. It is painfully self-serious and a major bore.

0,"Is This A Movie? I didn't too sure about this. It was on special movie channel so I gave it a listen. All that happened were people in not many clothes (was the movie at the Beach??) looking sad most times. Also there was a hat. While I watched all I kept thinking was about other things like drinking water that were more exciting. I notice near the ending that the man in the movie was the angry man from the gangrene movie - I almost lost him because he was so different! In the other movie he was mean; here he was just bored or looked like he was looking at something very far aways. He didn't talk much but was a doctor so I guess he is smart. There is a car crash in the snow near the end, but I don't think that was a learning part. The movie is like watching the home films from vacations when you are at boring cousin house, or shows on the public channels. Drink water for more fun - or watch with pillows!!! One sleepy star this time! (wait: there are pretty girls in here, so be careful watching!)"
0,"Please read Kundera's book instead Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera's book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera's novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: ""The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential."""
0,"One Great Big Sleeper I am sorry, but I just can't agree with the reviewers who praise this piece of work. It was so boring that I had it running while I did other things around the house (that was after I actually watched the first 80 minutes). I guess I just don't relate to guys who are constantly ""bedding"" every girl that walks past them. Where is the art? The depth? The complexity? Sorry, it was lost on me. I totally agree with the reviewer who said it was about two sad-looking people. I mean the guys is a heel. What happened to being faithfull. Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially. Where is the depth? Lewis is a fine actor, but the material is not the most exciting or throught-provoking. There, I've shot my wad and now I am gonna list the movie for sale for someone who can appreciate it more than me. Bye."
0,"Either you get or you don't..I didn't. This is written by a 43 year old male who is a true film fanatic. I love all the great directors- Spielberg, Hitchcock, Wilder, Kubrick, Landis, Scorsese, etc. etc.""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" was one, if not the most tedious films, I have ever had to endure. Why is it so talked about is beyond me unless, there is nothing definable to discuss. The scenery was bland, dialogue uninteresting and unengaging, even the shots were dull.It's the first film I ever returned to Amazon...ever.When I took Cinema History in College, the Professors I had kept talking about this film as a ""must see/ will change your life"" sort of thing. Curious, as we never saw it in class (must have been the explicit erotic nature it has at times). Now I think they wanted the girls in the class to see it on their own, because they may have wanted to discuss it with them personally after the class was dismissed, if you catch my drift.I would pass on this one-big time."
0,Lacking The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology.
0,"So If I'm A Jerk Do I Get To Live In Perpetuity, Too? Okay, folks. Let's get real. This movie/book is essentially about the insipid sexuality of three spoiled brats with soulful eyes, zero body fat, and no moral compasses. Worst of all, there's no search for the compasses. Why is this exhibition of unbridled existential selfishness so popular? Because the protagonists are European-and ""misunderstood"" quasi-intellectuals to boot. Translation: culturally paranoid Yanks just eat this kind of lean cuisine right up. If you're the type who likes being hungry 15 minutes after eating, don't miss this movie or ""The Sheltering Sky,"" mind-numbing fare featuring filthy rich American ""seekers"" ransacking the blistering desert (or desert tray) for spiritual bargains that won't make them too heavy with self knowledge."
0,"Repeated book material & out of place reviews Man Kzin Wars IX has four stories. The lead story by Poul Anderson is OLD, a repeat from another in the series. However, neither the Amazon entry nor the book itself make note of this; the publisher's dishonesty here is a real shame. The other three stories vary in quality, but at least two are good enough for this to be worthwhile in paperback next year.The one star rating reflects my poor opinion of repeated material with no warning. It probably would rate 3 stars otherwise. BTW, I am an old Niven fan, have read all his SF multiple times, and have read all of the Man-Kzin series.Amazon's automated machinery, or a hurried employee, has mixed in a bunch of reviews here that apply to other books in the series. It's too bad, but I've seem them mix up numbered series before. (See World Radio TV Handbook which is an annual series; they were selling the 2000 edition at a small discount to those who bought the 2002 edition!)"
0,For Simple Minds I bought this book because of the reviews and am shocked at how one can become an author by simply stealing life experiences and stories from other peoples lives.

0,"Shallow I found Dharma Bums suprising. I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better."

0,"Wait for Special Edition I made the mistake of buying this version. But luckily I didn't open it once I got home, so I was able to return it today. I'm not going to fall for the same money trap again(Avatar). I'll just wait a few months and get the Special Edition one with all the extra features.Now me just ranting here for a bit. But what the hell Paramount, I know times are tough for everyone but do you have to do this to us. Trying to rip off the loyal customers is not good business."

0,you pay less at the theater Its just thye movie with no special features.I made the mistake of buying it. Had i known i would have never bought it. Avoid wait till the special features come out.
0,"If you're 16+ don't bother These transformer movies are horrible. The special effects are the only good thing about these movies. The actors, especially the main actor have drab storylines, stupid dialogue, and the transformer voices are poor. Unless you're a kid, this movie is not for you."
0,"no speacial features This is a good movie. Just stay away from this version. I was excited and bought it on release day only to find out that it is just the feature film. I was really disappointed. I would never have purchased this movie if I had known that it was the feature only. Yes, I know, in my excitement to get the movie, it was my own fault for not looking carefully at the back of the box, although, nowhere could I find that it says feature film only. I used to download movies illegally. I stopped and started buying them legit again because the special features are really enjoyable. When the companies charge full price for the feature only (which i can get from netflix anyway), I feel cheated. Maybe everyone should start downloading illegally and really send hollywood or whoever a message that if they want our hard earned money they need to work a little harder for it. This is just my rant."
0,DONT BUYYYYYYYYYY!!! Dont give money to these filmakers that later on down the road release a better version of the same movie..If you want extra features this version WILL NOT have it on the disc!! Wait for the deluxe version!
0,"Not even rental worthy Ok so I heard that this was better than the last Transformers (didn't see that one), so I thought it must be ok. It's got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, not sure why Shia LaBeouf is an actor...think Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, but without the charisma. If you are into cartoons,explosions and superficial story telling then it might be palatable for you....otherwise you'd be better off watching the grass grow."
0,Love 3D hate the Price. who is on crack that they think any movie is worth 42 dollars 3D or not. This is just another scam like with cell companies and internet providers charging for data like there is some limited amount that isnt self imposed. The technology is not so overwhelming in RD to cost 4 times that of dvd and twice that of blu ray.Dont get me wrong love 3D and this was one of the best 3D movies I have seen but honestly 42 dollars just is taking advantage of consumers in a market that has no where else to go. If this disk was 30 bucks Id by it hesitantly but thats the problem with blu ray they charge way to much for the theatre experience. Sad too cause this movie and captain america are ones i would have bought but i refuse to let them think this is a good going price for the gimmick.
0,sucks i just got one word this movie blows one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time the first part of the movie put my wife to sleep. any body who reads this it is not even take the time our the money to by this movie
0,"Not really a good movie This film is like a teenager with short attention span. Storytelling is like facebooking.Too many plots to cover, horrible pacing, no depth."
0,"AVOID at all costs!!! If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. They are doing the same thing as Avatar. This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features. Not so much as a trailer. They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd. ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time. Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned. And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a ""movie only"" release."

0,"Even Amazon Prime can't Save Optimus Prime this time Ugh! What a steaming pile of predictability this movie was. At least I didn't pay to see it and was able to read a software tech manual while ""watching"" this. The plot is thinner than the paper it was written on and the acting, well its typical Michael Bay which means you can see more believable productions at you local high school. It was easily an hour too long and the special effect have been used hundreds before. I think the saddest part was hearing Lenard Nimoy as Optimus Sentimental, I mean Sentinel. Gratuitous sci-fi pandering at it's lowest."
0,"Be careful when searching for ""3-D movies"" I used the search window using ""3-d movies"" as the criteria and this movie popped up along with dozens of other 3-d movies, but when I received it, I realized I had not read the description close enough to see that this movie was NOT 3-d. Amazon-please don't place 2-d movies selections in with the 3-d ones! I had to pay $2.98 to return an item that shouldn't have been offered in a search of 3-d movie selections. Ouch. All in all I love Amazon, but I'll be more careful in the future. My bad."

0,"Bleh It takes more than special effects to make a movie. The first film was good, the 2nd one mostly decent, but this was unadulterated, predictable, garbage, full of bad acting eye candy. The heroine of this tale couldn't find a coherent sentence with a conjunctive map. Should have stuck with Megan Fox. At least she had some real attitude."
0,"1 was a sin, 2 was an atrocity, 3 lacks a word to describe its awfulness When I saw a review giving this movie 0 out of 5 (the 3rd time this respected source has ever done so), I should have listened. If 2 had plot holes, 3 has plot chasms. There is no story. A few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film (plot, charisma, fan service). Michael Bay really needs to stop raping people's childhoods (a la South Park George Lucas style).Go watch the '86 animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is The Dark Side of the Moon (and I'm not talking Pink Floyd)."
0,"Kiddie Fodder... Crap, crap, crap. Bad acting, big explosions, and video game CGI a good movie does not make. Like a 2 hour Hasbro toy commercial. This film made Star Wars Episode 1 with Jar Jar Binks seem like an Academy Award worthy film. And I'm a Superhero/Godzilla/Monster geek...this is just awful...terrible. At least the first one was semi-watchable--and where's Megan Fox? That would have been the only redeeming quality in this junk-fest...I mean alien robots who change into cars and trucks??? It's a movie based on a TOY for God's sake! A bad toy made into an even worse film. Avoid like The Plague."
0,Movie is horrible... Bad acting and a cheap love story make this one of the worst Transformers movie to date. I wish the Transformers movies would focus more on the actual transformers of the movie instead of a bad love story. I remember Transformers the animated movie was all about the transformers and didn't try to focus too much on the humans and their problems. The fight with Megatron was epic and Unicron was an amazing villain. And the rivalry between Skyscream and Megatron made for an interesting plots on the decepticon side. The exploration and fights on the distant planets was fun and exciting. My suggestion to make this movie great instead of bad or mediocre is to fire all the bad actors and do a movie strictly about the transformers and their backgrounds. Or simply remake the animated movie into an actual motion picture.
0,"epic fail very disappointing. The plot for sam was really lame, the woman they got for his fiance was the worst actress ive ever seen. pretty sure its because she is a model and doesnt know the first thing about acting. the movie was ok as an action movie but if you buy this expecting something on par with the first two movies you will be sadly disappointed."
0,Avoid.. Falsely advertised Very disappointed with this purchase. I bought this based on product details on Amazon which listed special features and extras - a major reason for my choice. There is only the movie on bluray and DVD. Please correct item details Amazon.
0,"Dear Mr. Bay, Please stop ruining the Transformers franchise I love to see the Transformers in movies but I will never get the time back that I spent watching this movie. Good actors in a crap movie do not make a good movie. Fantastic special effects do not make a good movie. A well written story and characters that you care about make a good movie."
0,"Redefinition of LAME I had low expectations and they still weren't met. My only satisfaction is that I didn't have to pay to see it on Amazon Instant Video but I'll never get my time back. Seriously, this movie has redefined LAME; bad acting, bad editing, bad script. If it weren't for the two little fuzzbots, it would have been a total loss. The ""stars"" who did this film must have had a bad round of luck in Vegas and desparately needed the money. Don't waste 2.5 hours of your life on this, especially when there is so much other less crappy stuff to watch!"
0,"Please, if this is the way this franchise is going... STOP! This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see. I found it to be a total waste of my time. Unless you are a devoted Transformers Fan that must see or have all things Transformers stay away from this movie."
0,"instant video is mislabeling it's movies as 3d I did a search for 3d movies on Amazon instant video and this movie came up, but when I purchased it I was disapointed to see that it wasn't 3d. I am writing this review without watching more than 5 minutes of the movie so it's not that the movie is bad. Amazon needs to re-label their 3d movie selection."
0,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon This is a disappointing film. The first two films managed to include a story with the special effects. This one didn't really bother. Mind numbing, and in a bad way."
0,"Another 'video game' type of movie, Whyyy? Lots of loud noise and quick movements. Just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy. Please...for the love of God, do not make another sequel. This movie really sucked!"
0,Not 3D THis company advertised this as a 3D movie. When I received it it was only a Blu-ray. They told me I would have to ship it back to them to prove it. I was very upset and they are horribel to work with.
0,"Ugh! The nicest thing I can say about this movie is it is really bad. There's talent to burn in the cast but they should have burned the script instead. The script is so terrible it makes ""Never Too Young To Die"" look Oscar-worthy. Rosie Huntington is like a blonded Megan Fox but without the charm or gravitas (which Ms. Fox isn't exactly awash in either so you can tell how wooden her replacement is). The movie is actually painful to watch for teh first 2/3 but at least some of the action scenes in the final third are cool enough to make it not a total loss."
0,"Bad movie? You're soaking in it Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague."
0,"Ouch In a word- horrible. I am a HUGE fan of the first two. Watched the cartoons as a kid, and i really couldn't wait to see this movie. It was horrible. Rambling, incoherent, and unfocused. I missed Megan Fox every minute that pouty, big-lipped female was talking, and fell asleep after 20 minutes."
0,"Yes, but no cigar Why did I buy this thing? Well, I saw a preview and it was great. Make no mistakes, is a good movie if you like machines beating up humans without the humans being make into jelly.The opening was the best in the world. If they had only kept it that way... But no. It desintegrated into pieces. The FXs were fabulous, but you can't make a whole movie out of that.Sorry fans. I was disappointed, but then I'm not a kid anymore, so that's probably the reason."
0,Horrible Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.
0,"Not a good movie at all...stinks!!! Well the critics got this one right; Michael Bay was a good director until he got big and lost his perspective. Dirty old man syndrome? Yes, what a joke. I was looking forward to intelligent Sci-Fi and got crap. The reference to Obama in an unreal world was stupid (I came to get away from real world politics). The treatment of the woman in the movie was degrading (glad the other actress bowed out...what a tear down}. It was a shame that the very good actors that came back to do this film had to deal with a totally self-involved director. The animation was excellent but the story was trash. I am soo sorry I spent any money on this film."

No rabbit holes running deep here, just peoples pockets that are succorred into buying the bare-boned Optimus...I hope this truly helps you out, seriously.."
0,"Don't buy this movie I am glad I watched someone else's movie before I spent money on this lousy thing. I will always be on my do not buy list. Rose what's her name is not worth seeing in the movie. It would have been better without her all together. And she didn't hold a candle to Megan Fox. I did like the FIRST TWO movies but this one is a total waste. Boring from the word go other than some things about Kennedy and the early space program. It would have been better as a cartoon. If they come out with another one, I will not be spending any money on it. This one was so boring during the middle of it I about fell asleep.I would not waste the money on it, just borrow someone else's movie and save your money for a good movie.Oh and I might give it a 2.5/10 but since this is on a 5 scale it only gets a 1 and I would have given the other 2 movies a 4/5."
0,"The movie itself is ok, the streaming for it was crap. The movie wouldn't play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn't fast enough to play the movie.My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon's customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.This is the first time I've had problems streaming with Amazon, but it was awful. Every 10-15, the movie would stop and pop up the error message. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck."
0,Not a good movie. Not for children. Not recommended for children and not even teenagers.Poor story.Nothing new or interesting.I was expecting something better.Dissapointed.
0,"garbage Man, I wanted to like this movie. I'm a big sci-fi fan. I do not think revenge of the fallen was as bad as people say it was, I even enjoyed the first transformers, but this. Oh-my-gosh. What a piece of garbage. I rate this down there with Avatar (the movie version of the nickelodeon cartoon, also a fan, huge let down).I am very forgiving of sci fi movies as I do not expect much in the way of plot/story line. I am a big fan of cool special effects, but this was so corny, cliche and chock full of redone and rewritten old jokes and plagarized scenes, that even I could not take this. I am becoming angry even now, while writing this.20$ for this piece of copro-cinematic excrement is $19.50 too much!!!!"
0,"No Special Features First, the movie has incredible special effects, but the script and acting are horrible. However, the real problem with this package is that the disc does not have any special features!"
0,"Terrible movie with good special effects The plot was terrible. The acting was terrible. The effects were as good as the other ones. If you want to see pure action without any story, then enjoy. Otherwise...it was a complete waste of time."
0,Digital Copy Doesn't Work Bought this after the Digital Copy expiration date had elapsed. Nothing on the Amazon site indicates the expiration date. The package has this warning on both the outside and inside. Amazon offered a full refund. That's a stand up company in my opinion.
0,"garbage Transformers the Movie (1985) was awesome. But these Transformers look like a pile of garbage throw together. The CGI animation makes everything look like synthetic barf. The Transformers movies need a reboot, where the characters actually look like they are supposed to. And without the worlds worst director Michael Bay. Disgusting. Don't let your kids watch this atrocity."

0,"I Am A Fool For Having Suffered Through This Dreck Two dimensional characters, dropped plot-points, flat dialogue, bad acting and an overall story that makes a 1962 comic book look Shakespearean. Michael Bay you ruin everything you touch. And I'm worse for having seen this."
0,"Wort. Movie. Ever. Transformers 3 is seriously a terrible terrible movie. yeah wow cool, special effects that i have seen time and time again, ridiculously long battle scenes that are so incredibly boring they literally make me fall asleep EVERY time i watch them, Terrible story, terrible plot, terrible rendition of classic characters. Why I even gave this movie a third chance is beyond me."
0,"no 3D version I`ll make it short and come to the point quickly: I think its a shame that Bay is starting milking the cow too by NOT putting the 3D version in this set. Pirates 4, Thor, Tron and so many others included a 3D version. I won`t buy this release and wait (let`s see for how long) for the 3D release. I know many of you hate 3D - I love it on my 65"" panasonic and was soooo looking forward for this. just my personal opinion..."
0,"Makes a great drinking game! Here are the rules: 1) Every time a character says or does something that's supposed to be funny but comes off completely lame instead-take a swig. 2) Every time the movie veers off into some completely random direction that has absolutely nothing what-so-ever to do with anything, take a swig. 3) Every time a transformer does a somersault or twist in the air in slow motion before attacking-take a swig. Follow these simple rules and you'll be bombed 15 minutes in. Seriously. While watching this movie I kept thinking how many millions of dollars were spent to provide us with idiotic jokes about red coffee cups in yellow rooms and effeminate assistants with Russian accents. Every time I see one of these movies, it saddens me. Given the insane visuals-tight, more serious stories could have really made this series into something amazing. Unfortunately that's not the case. At least there's no leg humping in this one. That's something I guess..."
0,"Fun movie, but not worth buying at this price--my bad! if you are like me and like to go through specials features and ""making of"" documentary, this is not the BD to buy. This is the second time I make the same mistake. The first time I bough Avatar BD when it came out, and it only had the movie nothing else. It is a waste of BD room space to make such releases without having a single special feature. Wait for the Special Edition, full feature, BD release! The movie was fun, but this BD should have been price at $10.00 USD which is the price one pays these day to see just a movie. I will have to wait for the Special Edition, and give my copy to my young daughter who lives with her mom. As I said, the movie is fun, but not the price of this BD, and this will be the last time I make this mistake. I need to be more patient and not fill these mogul movie makers' pocket with our HARD earned MONEY. What do you think? Any opinions?"
0,"Terrible This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart."
0,"Yawn 30 minutes into it and I'm bored out of my mind. Woe is me ""hero"", terrible acting, yes it's an action movie, so let's see some action, don't try to wow me with dialog. If you're looking for something to grab your attention, this isn't it. Thankfully I didn't have to pay for the movie."
0,cool robots bad acting sloppy story The Decepticons play the Autobots like a used violin and demostrate Cybertron's AI still has a long way to go.

The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth, it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark."

0,"Laughably stupid I gave this movie 1 star for only one reason Kelly Carlson is beautiful,other than that the movie goes as follows,marine gets dishonorably discharged and seems to be ok with it,wife gets kidnaped,he gets beat up,knocked out several times,gets burned,blown up,by the most overdone explosions and walks away without a scratch,this movie is pure hollywood,it was a waste of money and time,you really have to wonder if the producers ever spent any time in the military,I have never met a marine worth his salt that had to go telling everyone (Im a marine), every soldier I have ever known that talks like that was always in some bar fight or some other altercation with someone,It was a laughably stupid movie"
0,"One of the worst movies ever Hey Im open to wrestlers acting in movies. The Rock is doing it, Hogan did it for a bit. I did enjoy wwe's other movies but this...this was just plain bad. Cena has to be one of the worst actors to ever get a starring role in a movie released in theaters. Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back. WWE could have easily found someone better. Skip this movie. In fact do someone a favor, buy the dvd and destroy it so no one would have to witness this horrible movie. I would give it a 0 if I could. Nothing about this movie is good"

0,"Typical action film with strange attempt at humor This is a typical action film with lots of fight scenes and gun fights but little logic. It's amazing that hundreds of bullets can be fired at point blank range with no one getting hit and people getting hit in the face with fire extinguishers, pieces of wood and other objects without so much as a scratch. And then there are people surviving incredible explosions, again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably. They were not only not funny but were very wierd to me.I enjoy watching John Cena in action, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was fun to watch, but this movie just didn't impress me anymore than wrestling does. I think one star out of five was being too generous."
0,"Ha-Ha-Ha... If the cover for this low-brow action piece wasn't a hint, then you're probably one of the producers target audience. One of the things I think hurts hollywood is its irrepressible desire to shove the American flag down our throats by making these ""patriotic"" movies. We have the American flag, Iraq, marines... and wrestling!!! I guess if cow-tipping is a hobby you enjoy as much as practicing a suplex, then this movie is for you.As for a review, it stank. If you see it on the shelf of your local video store, leave it there.If you're a hollywood producer, please stop making movies starring wrestling ""stars"". If your name is Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, John Cena (The Rock is OK) please stick to your day jobs."
0,"new answer to the question ""What the worst movie next to Missing in Action I""? This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre. That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie. WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best - wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle. Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life."
0,"Bad... ...really quite staggeringly, breathtakingly bad - unless you're particularly fond of big explosions, that is, in which case you'll absolutely love it. If you don't, prepare for a totally ridiculous tale woodenly acted without much conviction. Not even Robert Patrick's nasty chief villain can save this monumental turkey. It has but one good moment, when a minor baddie, seeing the chasing ex-Marine, says, ""He's like a Terminator"", and gets an annoyed glance from Patrick, who played the liquid metal Terminator in ""Terminator II""."

Was that supposed to be funny?Who wrote this anyway? He should be tried in a criminal court for waisting my money and my time.The acting was also some of the worst I've seen. I will never be able to watch Terminator 2 again.Oh, the explosions were impressive. Maybe if you took away everything but the explosions it wouldn't be too bad.Thanks.

0,"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE PRODUCT Do not believe any of the so-called good reviews! This product is nonsense and simply DOES NOT WORK. I was able to install it rather easily. However, the flashy sophisticated website is NEVER updated! The play list are NEVER available! I am very dissappointed in Sony. Great concept, good looking product as usual fom Sony. Typical lack of performance. My experience is 180 degrees from the good reviews and I don't believe they are real or honest."
0,"Not Needed -- Free Alterative This was bought for me as a gift, but it is completely unneccesary. It's simply a case of a company using widely available technology to make some money off of peoples' ignorance... If I hear a song that I wonder ""...hmm, what was that?"" I simply log on to the StarCD website and choose the radio station I was listening to and the time. It uses the same data that this device does. The only thing this device does is record times. If you think its worth spending the money for a keychain timestamp-thingermajig, go ahead. Ill just jot it on my hand with a pen. (I have no commercial or otherwise affiliation with StarCD, I'm just an impressed user.)"

0,"THE WORST THING EVER CREATED I'm sure you can see by now with everyone else's reviews that this product is garbage. Well, hey, if you pay close to nothing, don't expect anything much in return! Just save yourself the money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... instead, put some gas in your car or something!"
0,"Don't do it! It's still in beta... Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you, it's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws. Here's what the other reviews (written by Sony employees?) and the literature don't say:* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL; you have to not only use another browser, but also set that browser as the default.* When you plug the emarker into your computer, it ""automatically"" loads your marks into the site...or at least that's what it's supposed to do. On 3 browsers and 2 different computers, I haven't quite gotten this to happen.* Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers' inadequacies, they (over)designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either. Simple HTML would have been fine, guys....Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0....this is the first time I've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true..."
0,"worthless Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing, I should have read these reviews first. All the bad you hear about this little thing is true. I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in, so I dont even have one station to mark. The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to ""enable"" itself. Whats the difference though, cant do anything with it anyway. This is typical Sony. My advice, check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area. Believe me, they wont tell you it will not work in your area. It, however, is a neat idea. Needs lots of work."
0,rip off no place in the ad does it say the use of this depends on the radio stations in your area must belong to their service for this to work none in my area of south west florida seem to least of all my favorite stations and it seems that the music you listen too must be of the lastest out or there is no info on it or where you can buy it so yes i feel like i got ripped off ... thank you sony
0,"SLOW very very slow Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on. The only song information I could get was ""information unavaiable check back in 24 hours"". They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours. This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours. So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site. Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker."
0,"CAREFUL! SONY rips you off! I can tell you that I used to have a small smart device called the iTag from Xenote and that worked VERY well. Plus..........it was FREE!! I used to use it in the Bay Area and the selection of the radios was great, the Web site very easy to navigate on. I could even get my info in real time which was great. Unfortunately, this start-up, as many others, had to close doors for the lack of $.... Too bad that those guys at Sony have too much money but do not care enough about their customers to launch a decent product... After the PlayStation 2 fiasco launch, they keep going on...... :-("

0,"Does what it says, BUT. . . This product works exactly as advertised. Click the button and find out what the song is. The website isn't set up very well, and it's slow because of all the annoying flash stuff, but with broadband it's definitely usable.Unfortunately, it's only usable for the rest of September. Emarker.com is shutting down, and that makes the eMarker useless. Thus, the 1-star review.

0,"It only remembers the time, not the station. Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a [$] clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you"
0,"Terrible I bought this thing to get the names of songs on the New York spanish stations. I checked it, double checked it, called customer service, and STILL I got incorrect song information. Maybe its the radio stations fault, maybe its E-marker's fault, all I know is that it DOES NOT WORK."

0,"Don't buy this Junk Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk."
0,"Out of Business These eMarker guys are out of business, so not sure if this thing even works any longer."
0,"Ruined by neutering the artwork I adored these books growing up and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for changing exactly what made them classics. I would have forgotten about them years ago if it weren't for the haunting illustrations. I took them camping, to slumber parties, they were fantastic and terrifying: which was the whole point. To be scared.I have nothing against the new artist and his work in general, but this is not the place for it. To change what made a book a classic for it's 30th anniversary is insane. I can't imagine what they were thinking.If parents are afraid their kids can't handle these books in their original form, they have simply to not buy them books that are meant to be scary or maybe, you know, flip through the book before you hand it to your child. Which is a sad thing anyway, I've seen nothing good come of raising children in a nerfed world, but still.There is no excuse whatsoever to censor such an eerie, memorable, and nostalgic children's book."
0,"Not the Nightmare-fuel from my childhood Don't waste your time or money. Buck up and spend the extra for an original Stephen Gammell illustrated version. If you're buying it for a kid who may in fact be a total wiener, then by all means get this one. But then, why are you buying the little wiener horror stories?Stephen Gammell's version will help develop a child's hippocampus and exercise their innate terror response. This one is lame."
0,"These are not the Stephen Gammel illustrations!! I was extremely disappointed when I found out about a reprinting of Scary Stories with a new illustrator. Like many adults I grew up reading these books by myself and with friends. The best part of reading these stories was turning the page to see what sick illustration was next. They creeped you out and I know I am not alone when I say that as an adult, they still creep me out. That's what is so fun about them to this day. I lament that this generation of readers will read a version of Scary Stories with watered down illustrations because uptight and squeamish parents have tried to ban these books from libraries. I have the originals and I will keep them for posterity."
0,"A watered down version of the original I'm sure the editors at HarperCollins thought by changing the powerful (and controversial) imagery of this book, they'd sell more copies. Nothing like compromising art and expression to sell out.1/5 stars for this homogenized shadow of the original book."
0,"Worthless Edition. Without Stephen Gammell's artwork, these are pretty close to worthless.Why would they EVER replace the original, incredible artwork? The reality is, Harper Collins, that Stephen Gammell's artwork MADE these classics.The artwork now is unoriginal, not the least bit frightening (or artful), and does nothing to complement the stories.Huge mistake. Someone should be fired. At least five people should be fired... and blacklisted.This is an atrocity.Prospective buyers: go buy the other versions! Oh, that's right, they're extremely expensive. I wonder why, Harper Collins? You fools.And again for good measure: you fools."
0,"How Dare They... How dare they censor the original?? The Stephen Gammel illustrations were incredible! The art was what made these books great! The writing is still good, but the new drawings are just nowhere near as good as the old ones! Skip this one and buy the old version(s)!!"
0,"Missing what made the original versions great: The art! Alvin Schwartz's stories always played second fiddle to Stephen Gammell's art. Without it, this book is not worth anyone's time or money. Avoid it and seek the originals."
0,"Also displeased with the new art. As another child who was scarred by the terrifying art style in the original books, I was extremely excited to hear about the re-release of these classic stories. The books arrived today; lo and behold the original art has been replaced with bland, uninteresting art that would be better suited in an R.L. Stine novel.A wasted purchase..."
0,Artwork??? Did the National Socialists require censorship here or something? The new artwork isn't even scary... WTF You've ruined a classic. No one buy this BS.
0,"The art is a joke This isn't the original art for these books. They hired a cheap hack to make the illustrations ""less scary"". The original had a better artist and better illustration. Dont waste your time on this pussified version."
0,"Scary Stories that are no longer scary. The original books contained haunting, even downright frightening illustrations that still disturb me to this day. They made these stories scary. They were original, artistic, beautiful and downright horrifying, and have been replaced by bland, boring, and shamefully dull. If you want something that will scare you, find a copy of this book with the original artwork by Stephen Gammel."
0,"These are not the books you grew up with... Many of us remember being on a wait list at school or at our community libraries to borrow these horrifying gems. Yes, the stories themselves were spooky. Seeing some of our local folklore in print just added to the eerieness. The most important contributor to the scare-factor was the incredibly grotesque pieces of art that accompanied each story. This reprint features a new, popular artist; however, the illustrations don't have that same terror-inducing quality as before.For me, I think the reason is that there was a lot of mystery in Gammell's work, while Helquist's just doesn't leave anything to the imagination. In Gammell's work the picture is set up so that it is happening TO YOU. In Helquist's work, the perspective is such that you can see it happening to the characters. Just doesn't do it for me. You can google the images or check blogs to see for yourself."
0,"Do Not Buy This Edition Please do not buy this new edition of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The publishers have completely replaced the original dark, beautiful and terrifying artwork for pictures that are clean, kid friendly and safe. They have destroyed what made this collection truly special."
0,"This was just a mistake. Re-releasing this series with a new illustrator was a terrible idea and, frankly, completely missing the point of the originals. The stories themselves are a collection of sleepover tales and urban legends which, when taken alone, aren't particularly frightening. For those of us who enjoy this series, it was the original illustrations from the twisted mind of Stephen Gammell that made these ""Scary Stories"" truly scary; without them, the book is laughable. Helquist may be a talented enough artist, but he can't hope to duplicate the underlying terror of Gammell's illustrations."
0,"Bring back Gammell The artwork is the only thing anyone ever remembered from this series. Congratulations on putting out an edition that looks exactly like every other scary stories for kids book, instead of the ONE that literally everyone remembers from their childhood.Great way to commemorate the anniversary."
0,"""I Can Read"" book has better illustrations While the stories in the ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" book remain the same, the Stephen Gammell illustrations that haunted my imagination have been scrapped for more candy-coated pictures.How candy-coated? Upon searching for the other tales of horror by Alvin Schwartz, ""In A Dark, Dark Room"", which was written for Level 2 of the ""I Can Read!"" children's collection, I found those water-colored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the re-release of ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark."""
0,"Buy the original. I remember reading these books as a first grader. First Grade! I loved them at the age of 7, and I love them now at 26. Yes, there were some sleepless nights, but that didn't stop me from picking up the book the next day! As others have said, what really stays with you is the art. To have taken the beautifully terrifying artwork and watered it down because some parents don't want to deal with their child having nightmares is a crime against children's literature. One star for this edition. The original gets five.I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I've read that the new artwork is for the thirty year anniversary of these books. Happy Thirtieth Birthday to Schwartz and Gammell's masterpiece. For your present, you get your teeth removed."
0,"The description said Stephen Gammell as artist and it was not... I was very disappointed to discover that the copies, (I ordered the ""scary"" trilogy)while described as being illustrated by Stephen Gammell, were actually the updated versions with watered-down artwork by another artist. I am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork. This is the first time I've been disappointed with an order from Amazon, but it's a big one. You need to change your description to include the correct illustrator."
0,"Racism and Sex This would have been a very short book if all of the racism and sexuality were to be removed. I read it for an Appalachian Literature class, and I felt this book was so racey that I couldn't enjoy reading it. The vulgarity in it is also not necessary, and I feel that it should not be called literature because of this."

0,Scary I have always wanted to bellydance and got this as my first video. It was not at all what I had imagined and quite frankly scared me. Bellydancers were always something mysterious and beautiful and graceful. Atea is awkward to watch and comes off quite bizarre. Not anything to want to imitate and strive to be like.
0,"Frail White Women Wriggle About While the basic instruction is passable, the technique of most of the dancers, including the instructor, is mediocre to poor. What's truly terrifying is how frail and anorexic most of these women look. There's an unfortunate sort of L.A. starved-skinny bleached-blonde airheadedness to this production. Belly dance can be a powerful, grounded and grounding ethnic dance form; however this tape presents more of a ""wrap yourself in sequins and wriggle for your husband"" sort of vibe. Culturally divorced and ugly-American scary. Made me want to shave my head and get tattoos."
0,"Unreliable Since I have ordered for this product and inspite of the company debiting the total amount for the product from my account, I have not recieved the product till date. The company promises to deliver the product in 12 hrs but its approx more than 3 weeks since the amount was debited but till now, the product hasnt reached me. The company doesnt respond to email queries and its toll free number (the only other point of contact mentioned from their end other than email address) always sounds busy and goes to voicemail."
0,"Bill Nichols should not be allowed to write Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like ""situatedness,"" ""hyperrationality,"" ""reconceptualization,"" ""polyvocality,"" ""relationality,"" ""talismanic""(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: ""juxtaposition."" Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge. Don't buy ""Representing Reality"" unless you want to know how confused Mr. Nichols's reality is."

0,"Cheaply made boot Had these boots for a while. First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying. The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay haven't done that before, had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear, even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They don't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price!"
0,not good 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
0,Cheap Boots Oversize and they pinch my legs. I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad. Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots.
0,"VERY NARROW This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump,i don't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit,they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast"
0,"Horrible Don't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots. They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money. First off the boots had spots around the lower edge(where the boot and the rubber bottom meet) where there were huge holes where there was missing glue. Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house. They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on. They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards. The ""insole"" they put in the shoe is a joke at best. It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite. Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear."

0,"Not Quite A Piano Book I was looking for a piano songbook for childern to play on a piano. I should have realized it was not just the songbook from the price. It comes with an electronic toy piano. The songbook is play by numbers and this did nothing for somebody that is learning to play piano. Very disappointing. Age level is pre-school, before able to read."

I've been using this product for several years now, and I knew just by looking at this one that it wasn't right. The texture was incredibly thin, and the color was much lighter -- something that could only leave me to believe that maybe water had been added to it.Lesson learned -- spend the extra money -- you're paying for quality!"
0,"Stopped working after 6 months Bought this item in July and it stopped working in December. Specficially, the playback function stopped working."
0,"Not worth it! This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!"
0,"Awkward controls, below-par reliability Like Korean cars, this Korean camcorder does what it says, but it's not something you'll be proud to own. The controls are awkward... even Sony's compact minidv camcorders have better buttons. The video quality is sub par, and my unit, which I received as a factory-sealed gift, broke after about 6 months, a first for all the Asian electronics I have owned. For a little bit more money, you can buy much better camcorders from Japanese manufacturers."
0,"Good print quality - bad mechanism I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one."
0,"Envelope Feeder Never Worked I have a small business and it was important that the envelope feeder work well. From day 1, this has been a nightmare. Components of the printer block the envelopes/labels and they don't feed properly. If you use internet postage, you lose money with the misfed labels/envelopes. I'm very disappointed and am shopping for a new printer now, only a short time after purchasing this one."
0,"Hate This Printer! Annoying messages to reset it !!! I had had two HP printers. Both broke in the same places - where the paper shoots out from the printer; the wings or the ""arms"" which guide the paper from the printer - both broke easily.Also I get an annoying message on my computer that the ""yellow box marked !"" is on and therefore I have to exit out of the printer mode and reset the yellow box so that the ! is deleted. Then go back into the printer mode. This is so annoying that I am never getting an HP Printer again.If you look on the instruction book, the annoying message can never to resolved - only by resetting the message yellow ! again, and again!!!!!!!!"
0,"Unfortunately Cannot Do ZERO stars This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the ""publisher's review"", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me."
0,"Can't Believe This Was Even Published Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book""."
0,"too small to read My rating of one *is not a reflection of the story or the gorgeous illustrations; but, on the unreadable digital version. Shame on the people who will profit from selling something with an unchageable font size that is too small to read. It was obviously scanned in and formatted on landscape view with two hard cover book pages per one narrow digital page. The font and the page size can't be enlarged. I'm really disappointed with Amazon for not only selling something of such inferior quality and even more disappointed with them for highlighting this product as a daily deal. :-("

A trip that could have been very interesting to read about is instead a tedious catalogue of ""then we went there and then we did this.""

This is, unfortunately, an unchallenging and uninformative book."
0,"Don't waste your time I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc. (I sent it back for a refund.) However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg. There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a ""print-at-home"" job. If this is a ""print-on-demand"" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description. For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate. This is not worth your time - or your money."

The rest are bad (except for ""good ship lifestyle,"" which is okay.) The good part about the Cd is if I turn it on, my sisters step out of my room almost instantly. So, if you're looking for a way to disturb the peace, this is it."
0,"uhm, why was this popular? Is there anything less than one star? This might be the worst CD I have ever listened to. One of my friends bought it used, shortly after it came out. Note that fact for future reference: if it just came out, and people are already selling it used, it SUCKED. The lyrics are positively nonsensical, and there is nothing creative or interesting in the instrumentation, melodies, etc. There's one song where all they say is ""drip drip drip goes the water."" What the heck is that supposed to mean? More like, drip, drip, drip melts the plastic, since I left this in the trunk of my car."
0,"Not a very good printer Lasted six months. Never worked exactly right since I purchased it. I think it had software driver problems. Would work sporadically, then lock up and paper have to be cleared manually. Final straw, no matter what type paper it was fed, it would catch in the feed path underneath the print head for no apparent reason. Of course the paper still keeps trying to feed, so the machine just wads it into a mess. In addition to the software driver problem, I think it has a significant design problem with the paper feed as it often trys to feed up to five or six sheets at once, even the HP desk jet paper designed for such printers. I will say that when it did work, it printed well."
0,NEVER BUY THIS PRINTER!! I spent over 2 1/2 hrs. (after 1 hr. myself) on the phone with HP trying to install this printer. It never would work right. The HP tech said there is a problem in the software program of this printer. This HP DESKJET 940C is everyone's worst installation nightmare!
0,"A poor use of my money I bought a new laptop and wanted a new printer. This wone came highly recommended from the story. It worked great for three months (of course, the length of the warranty). It now only states ""paper jam"" and after hours of time on the phone and with the hints on the web, I am going out to buy a new printer - I would certainly not buy this one, again."
0,"Bad printer Do not buy this printer. I have had nothing but trouble with it- it jams every other time I print, and most of the time, it grabs 3-4 papers at once, and prints on all of them. I certainly expected better quality from HP, and this did not deliver. The printing is decent when it works, which is not often. I will be looking for a different company next time."
0,"I will stick with the pink or blue packets... Found this on sale and excitedly tried it this morning in my coffee and a fresh fruit and yogurt smoothie. I wasn't pleased with results in the smoothie because it didn't seem to dissolve properly, probably because of the cold. This resulted in my smoothie having a ""sandy grit"" texture but the taste was okay. It did dissolve properly in the hot coffee and tasted just fine.Maybe an hour or so later my tummy started gurgling and shortly after was my first of MANY mad dashes to the bathroom today. This started with the smoothie at about 8 AM and has continued throughout the day (it is now 4:15 PM). The info about the product states that it does not cause gastrointestinal distress but other reviews support my experience that it certainly does too AND it continues for long after the product has surely been flushed (pun intended) from your body."

0,"B-O-R-I-N-G This has to be one of the worst books i EVER picked up. Within the fist 50 pages, iwas bored out of my mind. I don't know why everyone think this book is SOOOOO good, don't listen to them. If you like BAD books this is the one for you! I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!"
0,"Waste of time;Stick to Robot novels. This book is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There is very little in the way of plot and character development. There is no climax in this book. The book reads like a historical record, similar to Tolkiens Silmarillion, rather than an actual story. If you like reading historical records, you may like this book. If you are looking for an exciting novel.... better luck elsewhere."
0,"zzzzzz..... I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book."

0,"Didn't Believe a Word of It I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation."
0,"One of the worst things I've ever read This has to be one of the most over rated books (and series) of all time.The dialog and character development is horrible. The characters have about as much depth as paper dolls. The language is about as colorful as a newspaper.The ideas behind the novel may have been new and interesting 50 years ago, (although anyone familar with Wells, Huxley, or Verne would debate that), but now they are just tired and beaten like a dead horse."

0,"A very bad book ...To my surprise and disappointment, I found ""Foundation"" to be an exceptionally terrible ""book"", totally undeserving of the praise it has received here. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged ""novel"" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature. In fact, the only time I should ever like to mention it again is as an example of poor writing, atrocious story-telling, and science-fiction that is totally wanting for any kind of inspiration. ..."
0,"An Example of What is ""Classically"" Wrong with SciFi. I only recently read this so called masterpiece. I even went do far as to order the special complete edition from the Science Fiction Book Club. Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech."

Robert Altman maybe have been one of the world's greatest directors,but COLD DAY was a low in his career.Sandy Dennis was brilliant as always but the ultra slow and moody film seems to go on forever.Seeing it on video years later again did nothing for me.Sometimes you like films better the second time around but not so for me in this case.It was no wonder that the film was largly forgotten shortly after its original release."
0,"A huge disappointment This book is nearly worthless. Large parts of it are just lists of organisms and there are frequent grammatical errors, typos, misspellings. It's clear it was written in a rush. The blurb on the back says ""lavishly illustrated"" which is a lie. All the illustrations, of which there are few, are not even B&W photos but line drawings, and not even very good ones at that. For example, The very first two, meant to illustrate two different organisms, are hard to tell apart. Save your money and buy something else."

Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble. I couldn't figure out who was coming or going. I was baffled the entire movie! The lines were HORRIBLE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!

Any rookie cop could point out a dozen giant plot holes."

0,"Great idea - shoddy construction - waste of money I purchased this as a replacement for an old roll up tatami mat that I purhased at least twenty years ago. These are perfect for taking to the beach but couldn't find them local now. The tatami is woven tightly so that it keeps the sand off. Saw this and looked like a good idea.These are really three separate tatami mats, each about 11"" wide by about 6' in length, joined by a blue canvas strip that runs the full length (top to bottom). It is colorful and handy, folding up in to object about the size of a large book with handles.Problem I ran into was that the strip joining two of the panels ripped apart first time I took it to the beach, rendering it useless for its intended purpose. Perhaps mine was just a bad sample but at $10 a throw, I will be asking for a refund."

0,"Another nightmare about the remove cassette message I have had this camera for 18 months and about 2 months ago, it started beeping at me to eject the tape almost every time I used it. I went on-line and found that this is common with this camera for some reason. I was able to prevent major problems by removing the tape after each use, but that no longer works. Now I cannot record or watch any tape without it forcing me to remove the cassette. I was very fond of this camera until it stopped working. I am very disappointed that I will now have to buy a new camcorder (a local repairman estimated over $200 to fix it). I have a friend who has the exact same camera and he has yet to have a problem, but it isn't worth the risk."
0,"I liked it at first It was a pretty good camera until it stopped working. One day I turned it on and it started beeping and flasshing an eject tape message. But you couldn't eject the tape and the camera would not respond to anything. I had the camera just over two years when this happened. Luckily I purchased an extended warranty at Best Buy. Best Buy sent the camera to Canon for repair. Canon would not repair it because it would be too expensive so, Best Buy gave me a new camera. And I was allowed to get a different brand, so I went with a Sony Handycam."
0,"BEWARE of ZR45MC Tape loading mechanism!!!! I bought the ZR45MC camcorder in Sept '02. I have been using it quite regularly. then all of a sudden I cannot load new or old mini DV cassettes. The moment I load a cassette, a message flashes on the screen 'REMOVE TAPE' and beeping sound is generated together with a flashing 'EJECT' message. Next step, I ship this to the Canon Factory service in NJ. They replied with an estimate of $160(on top of the $654 I pad for this!!).Also most importantly when I shipped from the Fedex office in Boston, the Fedex person made a remark that she has been seeing quite a number of the Canon camcorders going to NJ for repairs.To sum, I think this is a racket Canon has devised to rip off customers.So beware when you buy a Canon camcorder, ask the retailer about the tape loading mechanism, and if they have any maintenance plans that will repair it."
0,"Horrible... I used this camera for a year untill during a period of a couple weeks of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one."
0,"Nice camera, when it works I love the features and optics of this camera. I love everything about it, except that it really doesn't work and their service is terrible. Many people posted about the humming sound -- I didn't have that problem. But the electrical system was intermittent from the time I got the camera. I've sent it to them three times, and each time they repair it, or claim to. Now it is out of warranty and the battery still doesn't work. So I'll have to buy a new camera and hope that you don't make the same mistake I did -- go with a different camera."
0,"She can't sing! This album received a fair amount of critical acclaim, so I thought I'd give it a listen. Well so much for critics! Gainsbourg can't sing a lick. She makes people like Britney Spears, Jessical Simpson & Janet Jackson sound like Beverly Sills or Marilyn Horne. The producers must recognize this too, because her voice is mixed very low on most of the tracks. On top of not being able to sing, she doesn't compose and doesn't play an instrument. So why is there a CD bearing her name? You got me. Maybe cashing in on daddy's renown? The botton line is don't waste your money. If you want to hear some good French CDs, check out ""Hors de Toute Doute"" or ""Le Silence des Roses"" by France D'Amour (from Quebec)."

0,Not as good as Counterfeit CD... To put it bluntly... I hate this CD. I thought I would like it because I fell head over heels in love with Cirrus' Counterfeit CD. I listened to that CD for a week straight I loved it so much... then I got this CD. It's like a tribute to bad... BAD... 80's music. Not to bash on the people who actually like this CD but if you listen to Counterfeit first and then go to this one... you will be very dissapointed. It's one of the few CDs of mine that I would love to just toss in the trash and I rarely get a CD that I hate. It was worth all of the 69 cents I paid for it on Amazon.

Even the photos are same outdated photos that appear to be taken in the late 70's used in the 2001 release. Please, Taunton, don't insult your readers by continuing to regurgitate the same information with a shiny new label in an attempt to sell more books.

Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book.

The wood is slightly bowed, and though it does not impede play, I was expecting a higher quality of toy (this is Brio after all). The most disappointing thing, though, was how small the turntable is.

A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars. It's convoluted, drug paranoia with a created mythology about time and space travel that's all about shocking images of sex and death. It's not a story."

0,"Save Your Money! As an incurable Beatle-maniac, I looked forward to hearing some of the cuts on this cd. BIG disappointment!! All of the songs are remakes of the original versions, and bad ones at that! None of the original Peter & Gordon or Billy J Kramer versions here. To make matters worse, the remakes are not even faithful to the originals, in some cases not even sticking to the original melody as written, but going off on interpretive ""tangents""!! Example: I hardly recognized ""Bad To Me"" as done here. Save your money, it's not even worth the curiosity value."
0,"Don't bother A huge Beatles fan who stumbled across this at the CD gift shop at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I actually think this is (was) a great idea for a CD......but this particular production is horrible. They should have tried to keep the songs in the contemporary period they were written. Instead, they take songs which were simple tracks written in the earlier years and try to combine elements from Beatles albums spanning their entire career. The result can best be described as an atrocious mix of taking songs that you may have found on ""Please Please Me"", and remixing them to fit the style of ""Revolver"" or ""Sgt Peppers"". Oh, and it doesn't help that the band they used sucked too. I can think of about a dozen Beatles tribute bands out there that maybe could have done this properly....these guys are BAD. Don't waste your money."

0,The poorest of all the versions to date. I borrowed a friend's copy and listened to this version. Madonna has a beautiful voice but it is too light for this role. Antonio Banderas is woefully inadequate in the singing department. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this recording. Buy the original Broadway cast C.D. with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin. It is by far the best version.

Patti LuPone is a far better Eva than Madonna, and at least you can understand Mandy Patinkin, unlike Antonio Banderos. Also, Hollywood turned the orchestrations into modern rock 'n' roll junk, when the 1979 Premiere American Recording is the way EVITA should be. So don't waste your money on the movie sountrack, and buy the Premiere American Recording instead"
0,"HORRIBLE This cd is horrible Madonnas verson of Eva is terrible she should not have been allowed to screw up such wonderful songs as ""Dont Cry"" and other...i dont suggest this cd to anyone who wants to hear how the songs are suppose to be sung...if you wanna hear them the right way get Elaine Paige's version or Patti LuPone...(forgive me if i spelled her name wrong)......"
0,"Have not received my item in a month. My order was placed on August 28, but I have not received the printer in a month."
0,Magenta This thing is awful. Prints magenta only. Drives me crazy. I am going to go find a high building to throw it from.
0,"limitations of color printing This printer works great for almost any application, but do not expect to print on special paper. On even the soft gloss paper, the ink blobs and gives poor quality printing. The color photos print better on regular paper than on photo or special finish paper. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING, you will be disappointed."
0,"Disappointment I ordered this bed for a visit by my 4 year old granddaughter. We had to add air to the bed every morning. I had this experience with another brand, but hoped this one would be better. Definitely NOT worth the money."
0,SEVERAL LEAK VERY SOON The price is great. The bed looks good. I have ordered several over the last few years. I've only had 2 last 6 months or longer_ The most recent one I ordered had a leak so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement started to leak 32 days after receiving---2 days after the return policy. All I can say is if you need it- order 2; because it's likely 1 will start leaking pretty soon. Unless you only use it occassionally. I use mine every day.
0,"Utter Garbage Dear potential sucker,My first airbed by intex sprung a leak in about a week, so I obtained a refund. I bought this model next, and it lasted almost twice as long!I am now on my third. I should have learned my lesson, but my current intex airbed has been around for about one year, and currently has 9, count 'em, NINE leaks. Everytime I patch one, another springs.Intex also makes inflateable boats. They must get sued for a lot of drownings. No wonder they have no email contact. If you buy ANY intex airbed, you are buying utter garbage.Sincerely,SidWa State"
0,"Seams Came Apart After 5th Use I bought this to sleep on while I moved it to my new place and used it about 6 times before the seams on top came apart. I never realized how important the seams were until that dreary night when at 3am they started to come apart. I turned to my side and another came apart. I turned to my other side and the rest came apart (I weigh 120 lbs if it matters)which turned the bed into one giant ball. Since the seams are gone there is no shape and if you lay on it the air is distributed to the opposite of your weight...I ended up in a hammock type pose. I let some air out in hopes it would bring the top down but nope, instead I sunk further.I called the manufacturer, emailed Amazon for the contact info to be sure, emailed the manufacturer again and finally got a response. Although some models come with a 90 day warranty, this one did not so I was SOL.Never again. Buy yourself a cheap mattress instead, at least it won't break and the comfort will be about the same."
0,"Would not inflate RETURNED I've bought several air beds from various manufacturers. I bought one identical to this one 1 1/2 years ago. It was comfortable but lost air after 3 months. I justified this as the user may have not taken care. However, I now believe its the brand. This one would not inflate at all. I will not buy this brand again. I've had great life from a better brands."
0,"Worst airbed ever - Don't buy If I could give a 0 star I would.So I bought this airbed while I had a friend visiting so she could use my bed. It seemed to work just fine the first night. However the second time I inflated this bed and slept on it, I got the worst night of sleep ever. During the night, the air slowly came out of the bed (I have checked all over for leaks or holes but could not find anything). I woke up several times to a half inflated bed and then had to re-inflate the bed again only to wake up an hour later to the same condition. Needless to say, I am extremely unhappy with the product. Hope Amazon will let me return this terrible thing."
0,"Huge disappointment I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now ""popped"" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away."
0,Didn't Last I bought this for my 8 year old to sleep on in temporary housing during a corporate move. This bed didn't last two days and it came apart in the seam where we couldn't patch it. I would not waste my money on this product again.
0,"huge LUMP after a few uses... i only used this bed about a dozen times. it was never really all that comfortable and the last time i inflated it, a huge lump developed right in the middle making it unusable. there is no way to get rid of the lump and it is rock hard solid. it raised up about 3 inches high and is about 15 inches in diameter. its too late to send it back now so its going in the dumpster. i have since read other reviews of intex doing the same thing. i will NEVER get another intex again...i am going back to aerobeds!"
0,on website it says twin but actual size is single. i dont know why these guys are trying to cheat. i paid full amount and i was expected to receive a twin size airbed but when i opened it it is actual size is single sized matress! so this company is baad! will never suggest it to someone.
0,"Only good for a couple of use I bought this Intex bed for my son. He is renting an apartment while waiting for a room assignment in a dorm.The bed, although still inflates, now has a bulge in the middle, so he falls off the bed. Even though we tried deflating and inflating the same, the problem is still there."
0,worthless I bought this for my daughter to sleep on when she was home from college. She actually liked sleeping on it but 3 weeks later it developed a slow leak which I could not find. Therefore I had to throw it away. A complete waste of money.
0,Not good It only lasted for less than 3 months then there was 2 holes that I fixed but still there was a leak somewhere and eventually I just threw it away. I don't recommend this air mattress.
0,3 weeks and heard a big boom! Heard a huge boom and I noticed the seam had given out and then this huge bubble formed in middle of the bed and then it ripped a few days later. I purchased the product on or around 10-6-2011 and before 11-1-11 it was deflated!
0,"Terrible product, I regret spending my money on this I bought this air mattress two months ago. I used a couple of days and it worked fine. Now a friend is planning to visit so I decided to use it again but something went wrong, instead of a flat surface, there is a huge bump in the middle that would make sleeping on it uncomfortable if not impossible.Since this is a product you will use only a couple of days before putting it away until you need it again, the amazon returning period will be over by the time you actually try it and find something wrong with it. And the company that makes this mattress says ""this product does not have any warranty or service program"". I hope I can put this in the recyclables bin!I wish I would've spend a little bit money on a real mattress that won`t fail after a while."
0,"A total dud Opened the box, unrolled the mattress, plugged in the motor and then... the motor made a few feeble noises and shut off in less than three seconds. Plugged it into several different outlets with the same results.Intex customer service told me that there are NO WARRANTIES on their air mattresses and the only option was to return it to Amazon for a refund. I will not be ordering any products from Intex in the future."
0,"Angry I bought this bed while I decided to purchase a normal bed. I was at first excited but as the week, past the seam popped and the bed now has a bubble and un-usable. for the money you pay for an air-bed I stick with a traditional bed over and air bed. Least to say thanks the quality is poor! I do not recommend."
0,Crappy Air bed Airbed doesn't keep air overnight. If you try to return it you will be charged a restocking fee to restock an airbed that doesn't work so you will get no refund.....exchange it for another crappy airbed...My recommendation is....don't buy this crappy airbed!!
0,"NEVER BUY THIS AIRBED!!!! All these airbeds look good on pics. But the common problem for all these even well known brands is deflating. The tightly inflated airbed almost completely deflates by the morning, even if u find the leakage and seal it, by next day other leakage will appear. it is horrible feeling like u are on the boat during the storm when it is flat. Eventually after buying 3 airbeds from well known brands i bought spring mattress for 100$ and feel very good without needing in inflating it every morning!"
0,"Low cost defective product This is really a bad product. I bought it in hope that I could have one extra bedding when required. I used it on first night for myself and after 3-4 it deflated, annoyingly i filled the air back in night and went to sleep. In morning i was awake again because it has deflated. I thought i am doing something wrong, read the manual and searched online, found nothing. Next night it was the same story. Returned to amazon.(note: this was not my first product either, earlier I tried their queen bedding and it was similar story too)STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT will be my advice."
0,"Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is ""save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on"", that's what we're doing now."
0,"not 80in in length I ordered it because I have a 6ft 8in relative who spends time with me. The description says this airbed is 40in wide and 80 inches in length. The box housing the bed clearly states the bed is 39 in wide and 75 inches long. I am really disappointed because I have been shopping for this for over 3 months and only recently decided this was the right bed. WRONG!The goal is to provide comfort. /his won't, his feet will be hanging off the edge of the bed. Its going back."
0,Went flat in the middle of the first night. This airbed does not stay inflated. It went flat half way through each of the five nights I used it. It is junk. Don't buy it. If I had bought it at a store it would have gone back the next day.
0,Garbage Only used a handful of times and the bed already leaks air. Waste of money. I know it shows a one star rating but the true rating is zero stars.
0,"Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed, deflating within 3 months I had another airbed that lasted about 2 years before there was a leak and needed to replace it. This one had pretty good reviews and it was taller when inflated and would be easier to get on and off it. I did like the airbed and it was comfortable. We used it less than 5 times over the last 4 months and it deflated slightly last time I used it. I should have investigated further at that time but just deflated it until next use. I used it this weekend and had to pump it up again in the middle of the night and I think my time for warranty is over with."
0,Wont hold air after 32 days since online purchase thru amazon Product was defective from day on and lasted a whole 32 days and now will inflate but by the middle of the night you sleeping on the carpet.
0,"Short Product Life This bed was cheap and the quality was consistent with the price. The seams deformed about 6 months after use began and bulges formed that eventually made the product unusable. Don't purchase for long term use. The seam design is flawed, which is probably why most of the other manufacturers offer a quilted pattern. The return shipping and 50% refund potential make recovering any money impossible. I got some use out of the bed, but definitely wouldn't buy anything else from this manufacturer."
0,"nice sleep, but bottom seam blew Just a great item. However there are approximately 5 length-wise seams on the bottom to create stability. After two months, one seam ""disappeared, and now the bed rocks, because there is one large air space.I can probably live with it, just have to put some towels, whatever to stabilize it."
0,"Leaked We were among the unlucky buyers who happened to receive a dud. The airbed had a gash at the bottom, which we patched. But it also leaked at the seams and our attempts to patch that did not work. We returned it, unslept-on -- no easy task, since we were required to return the manufacturer's box, and of course we could not get the deflated airbed back into it, so we had to find a box big enough to hold both the deflated airbed and the manufacturer's box."
0,"Not satisfied The air mattress was good only for one day, after one day it started deflating and I have to inflate it every night before sleep. By the time I wake up on it the next day it has become like a water bed since it has deflated. I cannot find the hole from where it deflates."
0,This bed will not retain air. It was a super deal... But there is something wrong with it. It will not retain the air level that I want.I will be returning this item
0,"Not available. I don't really hate it, because my order was cancelled for some unclear reason. The order was cancelled several days after I placed it, so I'm no fan of Intex."
0,customer service is dead every person i communicated with was not only rude but were clearly annoyed by my need for help and completely unwilling to assist me . I returned the product that i was charged $103.10 for and was refunded $40.70 . thanks
0,"Just like all the other airbeds I filled it with air when it arrived. It lost air by the morning. Since the bed was cold when filled, I gave it another chance. The first night is was actually used, it had to be refilled in the middle of the night."
0,"not reccomended Would not purchase this item again. Used in spare bedroom for guests. Hardly used, until now. Hoping top have Xmas guests use. First to lay on it, and center ring pooped.Still usable, but uncomfortable. The second night used bed hissing sound and a large leak appeared. They provide plastic to repair leaks, but do not provide any adhesive. I have to eat it now because I had until 11/12/12 to return.I can get partial credit, not including shipping if I just had just kept the box and shipping label for 3 months."
0,"Get Out Your Magnifying Glasses! Although this is a good collection of Poe's short stories, the pages crisp and the typeface clear, THE TYPE ITSELF IS VERY, VERY, VERY SMALL! I am getting older, but do not need glasses yet and I can hardly read a word or two before my eyes begin to cross! I don't understand book manufacturers anymore. Either the typeface is illegible, the paper so poor that all the letters blot together, or the print is teenie tiny. Aren't books supposed to be read? Also, something strange, the chapters arent seperated. One story runs into the next without starting a new page."
0,"Blah Blah Blah....... Good God, was this boring! I couldn't even finish watching it before I tossed it. I usually enjoy reading or hearing how artists create, it fascinates me. And I love The Band that used to be. But this was boring as heck. Sorry, Robbie. Sorry, Levon."
0,ridiculous I find it hard to believe there are women really using this product ........turns out it's about the same diameter as the cardboard tube inside paper-towels. Seriously ???~~~
0,"Help! Hello everybody! I ordered this product but the first one that i received didn't work, and now i have the second one and it still doesn't work. It might sound weird, but i put batteries in it and it doesn't start working. What should i do? Thanks!"
0,PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE WASTE OF MONEY. FIRST TIME BUYING SUCH AND IT NEVER WORKED. MOTOR NEVER TURNED WHEN BATTERY WAS PUT IN. SUCH BLATANT ROBBERY!
0,"Doesnt work First off I am currently deployed and my wifes fisrt viberator that we bought, to help with the lonely nights, was supposed to be waterproof got some water damage and no longer works. She asked me to order her another so I looked around and found this one, it had many decent reviews so I decided to order it. When it arrived and my wife opened the package only to find that the item I ordered had a much larger cirmcurference, the one she had before was about 5 inches or so. She decided to try to use it because of the fact that there is not a return policy. When she attempted to use the item it did not work, she tried replacing the batteries and that only made the rabbit portion come on. It would be extremely helpful if there were some sizes and lengths to determine what exactly you were buying. So all in all I am extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone."
0,"Painful, no pleasure, and doesn't work. Smells horrible! First of all, no matter how much I washed it, it still smelled HORRIBLE! The ""rabbit ears"" are too long. The part it is supposed to hit isn't that high up. The worst part of all...the head of the shaft doesn't turn. It barely moves, so how am I supposed to feel anything? It is loud, and has a machine sound because of the ""floating beads"" which do absolutely nothing. Look into something else...this Rabbit is a piece of junk. I looked at a lot of reviews to make sure I got the right one, and I was mistaken. I don't know how other people gave this more than 2 stars.The vibrate is descent, though."
0,doesnt work Put new batteries in - product wont turn on at all - very disappointed !!! Save your money - many others are better - should have read the other reviews and then i would have been warned
0,"So Disappointing! I was so excited to try this item when I ordered it, but when I got it I was so disappointed because it didn't work. It didn't even turn on! I didn't try to return it because I was under the impression it is a nonreturnable item. I won't order this product again but will try ordering from Amazon again."
0,Disappointed again Had a very toxic smell and probably will be toxic if used. No matter how much it was cleaned it still had a very strong smell. Scared to use it because of its smell. The ears and shaft are very hard and not flexible at all. It will be tossed in the trash. Another waste of money.
0,DISAPOINTED I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AS A GIFT. I PUT BATTERIES IN IT AND IT WORKED FOR THREE MINS AND QUIT. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IT TO WORK AGAIN AND ACCORDING TO AMAZON POLICY I CAN'T RETURN IT! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
0,"Great Transaction!!! Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. 110% satisfied with their service..,"
0,Not a good vibrator I bought this item 6 months ago and was immediately disappointed. Metallic beads are a almost painful on higher rotation speed. And the the metallic rod connecting the top with the bottom broke after 6 months.Do not recommend this item.
0,California Exotics jack rabbit Piece of crap. All functions did not work when opened and stopped working during first use... horrible product. California Exotics should be ashamed of selling this junk. do not waste your money or shipping..
0,"Not worth the money What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews, but when I tried it, it did nothing. First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that's the part that goes on you clit. I'm almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I've tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all. This is not worth the money."
0,Nothing Nothing to to say about it thank u didn't enjoy it so why say something why rate it a waste of money
0,"Awful! I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the ""bunny ears"" cause more pain than pleasure. I don't recommend this product."
0,"Yet another disappointed customer Add me to the list of folks who received a vibrator-shaped paperweight instead of an actual vibrator. I tried two sets of batteries just to make sure, but it was dead. Also, as others have mentioned, the toxic plastic smell was over-powering, so I was a little bit glad it didn't work or I might have been tempted to try it and I may never have gotten that smell out of me. :o)Amazon, understandably, doesn't allow returns on vibrators, but the paperwork for a refund was done in under an hour and I should get it in a few days, so at least that part was easily done."
0,"jams LOVE the size--no complaints there. Rabbit ears hit in just the right spot. But, the beads on mine jammed up after a single use."
0,Broken Item Recieved this item and it was broken. Tried to contact the seller but could not. As per amazon's return policy this is a non-returnable item. Which makes sense. Unless it is sold in a non-working condition. Was very displeased I could not speak directly with the seller and that amazon was of no help. Had to go through the manufacture to have the product replaced which is still a work in progress. Will not buy non-returnable items from this site again. Leaves too much room to get a defective product like I did and be stuck with it.
0,"Broken I received this product in the mail yesterday, Put in the batteries and the rotating beads do not work. Complete waste of money."
0,"Looked good, didn't work This was my first purchase of a vibrator and was very disappointed. It was shipped very discreetly from Amazon directly, but it didn't work. I put in fresh batteries and it wouldn't turn on. I even tested the batteries, they were good, but this rabbit wasn't. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't take returns on this type of personal product. I simple won't buy anything made by California Exotics again. I'll try one of the other brands next time."
0,"Works really well right up until it doesn't It was a little big for me, but it worked really well until about two weeks ago. And then it just died. Mind you, this is two months after I bought it. I switched the batteries, made sure the ones I put in were working, but I suppose the motor died. I never even used it in water. I don't know about most people, but for $30, you'd think you'd get more than two months out of a vibrator."
0,"Very disappointed I don't know why this has such good reviews. I purchased it because of the reviews but it's since gone in the trash. It has an awful smell that won't go away. Like a burned plastic smell. It is WAY too big. The rotating beads do nothing for me. Even if you put your hand on the shaft, you have to squeeze to feel the rotation. Don't buy it."
0,"Misleading. Clearly, the producers of this DVD meant to mislead. The cover of the DVD shows the original album cover suggesting that it is a visual equivalent of the album. Please read the cover carefully. It is a quickly put together documentary of the times surrounding the making of the album. Too much time is taken up showning closeups of the of photographic stills that are already on the original album cover and liners.Much time is spent describing the breakup of the relationships.Some of the new performances of the classic songs are again, quickly put together and doesn't provide additional insights.Hastily produced DVD with a misleading cover to cash in on unsuspecting fans."
0,"Zero Stars Rumours is one of my all-time favorite albums, so I was dying to see this video. The one on the making of Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon was a real treat, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it is just them saying over and over again that it was difficult being trapped in a small studio together, while they were breaking up. The only thing I did not already know, that I got from this video, is that Mick Fleetwood seems like a pretty nice guy, but the other three are self-absorbed jerks. Listen to the album again and again, but I recommend not wasting your time on this pointless and thoroughly uninteresting video."
0,"A WASTE OF VIEWING TIME AND MONEY! THIS IS A BLATANT CASE OF FALSE ADVERTISING THAT I'VE EVER SEEN! I'M EXPECTING TO SEE FLEETWOOD-MAC PERFORMING ALL THE SONGS FROM THEIR ALBUM 'RUMORS' (WHICH IS A GREAT PIECE OF WORK!). INSTEAD, ALL I SEE ARE THE RECORDING TECHNICIANS EXPLAINING HOW THEY MIXED THE VARIOUS SONGS, WHICH, BRINGS ME TO MY MAIN BEEF...ONLY BITS AND PIECES OF THE SONGS ARE PLAYED. NONE OF THE SONGS WERE PLAYED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ALSO, THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE BAND MEMBERS SEEMED TO FOCUS ON WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH WHOM AND WHY THE AFFAIR ENDED. WHO CARES? I WANTED TO SEE F-M PERFORM AND WAS VERRRRRRY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY DIDN'T. AT LEAST I HAVE MEMORIES OF TWO OF THEIR CONCERTS THAT I ATTENDED YEARS AGO."
0,"eBay, here I come! Well, I am among those who expected the basic performances along with the documentary, based on the packaging and the song titles listed in the text.I'm glad so many people like it because that means I will have no trouble selling my copy.The sound quality didn't impress me, and the ""specially recorded"" versions of some songs told me only that the members have lost their voices. (offstage: ""Sacrilege! Burn him!"")Even the navigation was annoying - click,click, click, click to get to any one song.Bah!"
0,"Fleetwood Mac Rumours If you want to hear music, don't purchase this video. Each song is quickly interrupted with current interviews of band members talking mostly of their failed romantic relationships during the recording of Rumours. This should be labeled a documentary, not a music video. The band members do talk about the music, and there are nice clips shot at Sausalito, California's Record Plant showing how particular tracks were mixed. However, I believe using the Rumours album cover on the video packaging deceptively implies that it is a music video."
0,"too frustrating for the price Just bought this at the garden center. Looked solid. However, instructions are completely inadequate. I've programmed these kind of things before. I know it's hard to be able to create all the functions needed with just three buttons, but that's why you need to research what the competition is doing."
0,"1. Something Good I wanted to buy this song but couldn't figure out how to do it from the webpage. I don't have any problem buying Apple products, or ATT products or anyone else's products. But I could not figure out how to buy a song from Amazon."
0,"Like the sprial binding, not much else The spiral binding on this book is it's only positive.I haven't found a single thing in this book I would like to stitch. The graphs are done with colored Xs which make it difficult to distinguish between similar colors, and to imagine what the finished product will look like. The colors are not given in Anchor or DMC format, but in other numbers that you then have to look up the DMC or Anchor numbers in the back. Finally there are very few designs for each category. For example, there are only about four or five small pages of Christmas designs. Christmas is a very large subject to design from. Did they run out of ideas? Rather than this book, buy the Better Homes and Gardens 2000 Cross Stitch Designs. There are so many more designs for many more topics, and stitched pictures are given so you know what you'll be working on."
0,"Garbage. Product came with no documentation whatsoever, no installation CD. Attempted to install this on 2 computers.

Threw it in the trash."
0,"My First Negative Review -- Ever Others may like this book but I did not.For me, ""The Pro: Lessons About Golf and Life from My Father, Claude Harmon, Sr."" was a huge disappointment and may be the worst book I have ever read.I kept trying to like this book, but the writing and the message kept getting in the way. Self-promotion is hard to pull off, and for me the author did not successfully pull it off. Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he ""got his life together."" From cover to cover it rings with false modesty, and rationalization of a self-righteous, bullying bravado.My brand new copy did not find its place on the bookshelf with Bobby Jones, Dave Pelz, Jack Nicklaus, and many others. Rather, it has been donated to the recycle bin because we do not want it in our house for any youngster to read."
0,"Talentless hack takes a whack at jazz singing... Patti Page ""The Tennessee Waltz Gal"" should never have attemted to record a jazz vocal album, for one she lacks the individuality that it takes to be a jazz singer, number two how can anyone take seriously a singer who sings ""How Much Is That Doggie In The Window."" And three when she sings, she sounds like she doesn't care about what she's singing about, Page is definately not a lyrical singer. Even though Pete Rugalo(the talented jazz vocalist June Christy's regular arranger), who arranged this album, tried to make Miss Page sound listenable, it just didn't work out. Stay away from this CD or any CD that has the name ""patti Page"" on it."

0,"Spare us I purchased this CD for my wife for Mother's Day. After listening to it, it became very clear that Babs is way out of her league when she sings with singers the caliber of Il Divo (whom she refers to as ""swell"" by the way. Swell???). The continual platitudes such as ""children are like sponges"" etc. are boring. At 65 years of age she can at least try to come up with something new to say. As for her political persuasion, who cares!"
0,"Stainless Steel Outside - All Plastic inside!! This is one very attractive coffee canister with just one problem. If you're chosing this because you no longer want your food and beverages exposed to plastic, you might want to stay away from this one. The inside area is made entirely of black plastic. However, if plastic isn't an issue for you, this could be your baby.I am disappointed that amazon's normally satisfactory product description process didn't work here. This listing misrepresents the item by failing to mention the non-stainless interior which is a significant fact to many consumers. I returned my canister with my explanation that the quality was not as represented. I don't believe that they should charge their customers for any shipping or restock fees when they don't describe items honestly. Amazon rocks but this listing needs help!"

The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter..."
0,"Poor quality and Customer Service- buyer beware Received this as a gift from my husband. He had it gift wrapped and held it for the occasion. When I opned the bracelet, we were both very disappointed. The quality was very poor and bracelet did hand nicely on the wrist. He contacted the seller through Amazon to request a refund. They refused to refund or exchange the item. Unfortunately he had not opened the item when it was received, since it was gift wrapped. He held it beyond their return window, as he was saving it to be gifted. I called the vendor myself to explain and seek a compromise. They were unyeilding, explaining that they could not return the bracelet to their vendor or restock it, so we were out of luck. Beware of the return policy with this vendor especially if it is a gift."
0,"Buy your children this toy if you want them to hate you. This is a huge disappointment for my family, and has forever left a stain on the memory of my son's recent birthday. This piece of garbage cannot, does not, and will not stand up. And it does not stay together. And the elevator breaks easily. And some of the figures don't fit in the elevator.So there it lies, in pieces, in the corner. And here I lie, curled in a ball in the other corner, wondering if I am an inadequate father because I can't make a $40 piece of crap stand up.I hope whoever designed this goes back to creating torture devices."
0,"Don't waste your money This watchtower was never used by the manufacturer because the unit itself comes with 3 legs that could likely hold one pound of weight and this weighs several. The ""legs"" don't even lock in place, they just sit in groves so the minute you place the weight on it they collapse over and over. If you manage to get it to stand the minute your child touches it it will fall over. Otherwise it would have been a wonderful toy. It looks like the show and the body is sturdy and well put together. Too well put together to be supported by the legs provided. Don't buy it, if your child is younger talk them into the Spiderman playset, much more sturdy."
0,"A PIECE OF JUNK! Do not buy this toy - it has been a source of frustration and disappointment for all 3 of my children. Difficult to put together (and I have assembled my share of kid's toys), it will not stay together at all. It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design. The noises are also weak as are the features (i.e. the trip wire, rockets, the plane). Just a complete waste of money - it is only a couple of weeks old, and it is headed to the trash."
0,"Not for children to PLAY with! This item is not meant for children to play with! Strange, since it has to do with action figures of Super Heroes! But honestly, if your child does more than set this on a shelf, you'll soon be hearing screams of frustration. The elevator won't work! (ours completely stopped working in 2 days); The guns on the top keep falling off!; The whole thing just falls apart. No, this item is for the collector and I think Mattel KNEW that. They figured the few that were opened and did not work offset all the ones that would remain MIB or NRFB for collectors.This item is just like Mattel's HOT WHEELS JUNKIE SETS. Another sore point with parents. Hot Wheels cars are fine, but those sets that Mattel makes NEVER work as promised. And what's with the instructions that have little to no writing on them??! Some of the drawings are impossible to figure out. In Mattel's case, a word is worth a thousand illustrations!"
0,"Garbage! My 5 year old son received this as a birthday present, and it is headed right back to the store. The legs do not stay on, it falls over when touched, with or without the legs, there is a missing door, the elevator gets repeatedly stuck. As much as my son loves the idea of this toy, he has given up and resigned to playing with his other toys because this one is garbage, and a pure waste of money."
0,"Frustrating piece of junk - do not recommend! I bought this for Xmas 2004 after all the clever marketing hype. The rocketship theme looked very cool and rugged in the pictures. However, when my son got it it - it turned out to be nothing but a frustrating, unplayable toy. It falls down constantly because of poor design: the legs can't support the weight of the whole rocket when touching it), the elevator doesn' work (gets jammed all the way up) and it didn't even come with any character figures -these are sold separately! I may have to glue the parts together just so he could play with it some more time before we dump it.Do not recommend!"
0,Another lame mattel product Please don't waste your money on this one. My four year old son loves the justice league and thinks this toy is pretty great. The problem is the elevator for one never worked and the tower is supposed to be supported by three crappily made narrow suction looking thingys. The minute my son goes to open one of the towers sides the whole damn thing collapses. This happens everytime. I finally just took the three support things off of it and put them away. The gun launcher thingys on top also continue to fall off. Luckily my sons was purchased on sale for only $14 but it's made so cheap and frustrated my son so much that I still feel completely ripped off.
0,Watchtower is total crap!! Avoid this toy at all cost. It falls apart when touched. The elevator stopped working almost immediately. Total rip off.
0,What a waste! After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.
0,"I am returning it today.... I bought this from frys and am returning it today. Maybe it's only me, but mine had really bad quality and distorted images. I had 17"" LCD monitor from viewsonic and was replacing it because it has similar problem. Now, 19"" has same problem and I am done with viewsonic. I am not going to use viewsonic monitors again. Instead, I am going to try samsung ones."
0,"Hated it so much I returned it I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham, too. This book, however, drove me nuts! I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money. This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through. Clearly, this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the ""plot"" is terrible. Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it! Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - ""Remember Me"" is hysterical and a great, easy read. ""Cocktails for 3"" is painful trash."
0,"Very poor condition BUT? Good read! I saw D. Ebby 35 years ago on the 700 Club, wanted this book for all those years. It was brought to my attention by another minister of the gospel just recently. Saw it on Amazon and decided to buy it, it was inexpensive. The pages fell apart as I read the book, it was extremely frustrating but? So enjoyable and encouraging, I was glad I bought it. I am going to look for the same book in better condition, just to reread or give to another to enjoy."
0,"Very Disappointed I bought this book based on the other reviews saying how useful having the interpretations on the opposite page was. In reality it starts and ends directly with the play. No prologue, introduction or anything else. The reviews don't correspond to the item being sold."
0,stupid student review by gabriel c Romeo and Juliet is a story about to lovers that meet at first sight. The biggest problem they have together is that both of the families have been fighting and hate each other since they both have been born. It all started when Romeo been depressed ever day moping around and feeling sad all of the time because he loved Rosaline and she did not love him back. So one day Romeos cousin told him about this party and that Rosaline would be there so they left and Romeo saw Juliet there and followed her to her house and both exchanged thoughts about each other and decided that they will get married but secretly. So they had to come up with a plan to pretend that Juliet was died so the can get married and the planned failed and they both ended up killing themselves. Play was very stupid it sucks no one should read it because there is no point of reading this because all this play is taking up your time.
0,"the movie was better i just read this book. everybody like always talks about how great it is and everything. but i don't think so. like, it's been done before, right?? soooo cliched. omg."
0,"Misrepresented The customer reviews for this edition of Romeo and Juliet indicated that it was dual language, i.e., the original Shakespeare on one side of the pages and a modern ""translation"" on the other. This edition was original text only -- fine for what it is, but not what we wanted."
0,"Gimmie A Break! Not that I don't like Shakespeare's works, but his tragedies are terrible, especially this one. I can't understand the language real well, so I have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it'll be easier to understand. I just can't understand this love tragedy at all! Here are some things that confuse me:*How did this feud really begin?*Why can't this story end in happily ever after?*Why does Lady Capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody?*Why couldn't Shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand?*Why does everybody have to jump to conclusions?I simply can't understand why people love this play so much. It's ridiculous! If you want a true love story, try reading ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". This one absolutely SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"Good book -- but not this edition This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It's great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version."
0,"copy shop edition The stars are for the edition, not the book.The April 30, 2011 edition from CreateSpace (which probably actually is a copy shop) does not look like a book. It looks like a leaflet from Jehova's witnesses. It's flimsy, in a weird large format, and with no information about publisher, date of publishing etc. If you have any aesthetic sensibility you should get a different edition of this classic book.This type of product should either come with a warning ""not a real book"" or not be sold on amazon at all."

0,"Protect a bed mattress cover I purchase a Protect-A-Bed mattress cover at a mattress store, salesman said to wash it twice prior to use. He did not say to dry it with towels and sheets. Its supposed to be waterproof, one of our cats proved its not, contacted company, they asked if dried on medium with towels and other bedding, I said no, no one told me and not anywhere on package does it state needs to be protected in the dryer. Company sent another cover,this time on low setting which is mostly air fluff with towels and other sheets and it was scorched in 3 places. Both were scorched on medium and low heat, dryer is electric which is not as hot as gas. I'm getting my $90 back that I was charged at a mattress company. Not worth the money if you can't dry it because it has cheap plastic backing."

0,Poor option Why would someone pay for what they cannot have? Let the customer choose the color of the product they want to purchase!
0,"What...? When I first bought this it was because of the song ""oh, Yeah"" granted I heard the rest of the album and there were a lot better songs and I loved the eclectic sound. ""Love Devine"" sung by the women who sang the James Bond theme song ""Goldfinger"" was ultra cool. So they remaster it with all these bonus tracks but no ""Oh Yeah""? That totally sucks. It's not the best song on it but it's not ""One Second"" without ""Oh,Yeah"""
0,"I did not give it a good review at first however, they promised but did not deliver my money back. I would have like to have seen this book before I bought it. I never would have bought it in the condition I found it."
0,"A bit disappointed While there were some nice pictures and helpful information I was abit disappointed with the book in general. It was short (92 pages of large text),with no color pictures and just didn't seem like that helpful of a book for a first time mother. The book was first published in 1962 with an update in 1982 and I'm sure there have been quite a few new discoveries that would be quite informative for a first time mother since then. I felt like I was reading a high school biology book. OK for what it was but I'd not recommend it."
0,"Harmful self esteem advice for 10% of the population Avoid this book on the basis a dated and harmful passage on page 144 that states that homosexuality is ""related to a failure in identification"" and that parents of homosexual children should ""seek professional help at the earliest possible moment"". Their view of the cause of homosexuality is out of mainstream thought, and it implies that something wrong happened. The main reason for need for any counseling would be if homosexuality is causing adjustment or self-acceptance problems. This is not what the author's have in mind. Following the author's advice fails to honor your childs true nature, and certainly would be detrimental to the development of his/her self esteem."

0,"Fabrication... Squeezing the cash out of MAC... I've communicated with Charlie on more than one occasion.The man does not write nor talk like this book reads.End of story.However, his written word is legible, unlike what someone wrote in their review, some of it is a little hard to read because he's about 71 years old now and I would imagine his hands tremble a bit...But about this book...Waste of money.The ReVeReNd"
0,"WHAT??? GIVE ME A BREAK!!!! Hell, I'm not even going to read this book before I tell you all what I think! No reason to waste my time reading ANYTHING written by an animal like Manson.I'm kind of in to learning more about infamous cases like Manson's...but I'd like to hear THE TRUTH about what happened. And the criminals themselves usually do NOT tell the truth. They usually do have a way of detaching themselves, if you will, from the identity they had when they committed or instigated whatever the heck the crime was. So if I read on one of the reviews, that it doesn't sound like Manson...Gosh, why on earth am I not surprised!Hey...for a good laugh, I guess this would be OK to read...just to see how a beast like Manson operates.But I give this one star...like I said, consider the sanity of the source of information in this book...and do your best to not believe it unless someone in their right mind can confirm it.Otherwise, enjoy!"
0,"Pretentious Drivel People often rave about how great this album is -- I really don't see the appeal. At the risk of sounding simplistic, this CD is full of pretensious songs for pretentious people. Bad melodies, not catchy at all, very little edge. Awful. There is so much good music out there, I can't fathom why one would listen to this."
0,"huh? Why would I choose to listen to this when I already own every Black Sabbath album, and every Blue Chear album? I mean-it sounds like a cover band pretty much. But they will fare well in a music industry that does not favor creativity over a fashionable rehash. Such is life."
0,"CURVED, NOT STRAIGHT I bought these Trim Toenail Clippers because of ""NJMOM's Review"" above. NJMOM stated these clippers are ""STRAIGHT"" not ""CURVED"", WRONG, these clippers are CURVED!

0,Pet Groomer I believe the pet groomer would be better if it were smaller as it is difficult to hold. The pin brush head bristles are too hard. The large head makes the suction too strong for my dogs comfort. (I have 8 dogs from 10# to 90#)

We thought it was probably during shipping that it happened so we sent away for a replacement. The second set came, and two were in tact, the other one had a crack down the side. I just let it go and continued to use them...well....4 months later, they were stained, they ALL had cracks in them, down the sides, on the bottom (which means that anytime I put liquid in them they leak). They are practically falling apart after 4 months of use. KitchenAid can do better than this...I was very dissappointed!"
0,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY My son is a HUGE bat man fan. This was a must last christmas.. well we never could get it to stand up right and then bat man wouldnt slide down with out him pushing him the rest of the way. It came apart no matter how easy he was with it. And he lost interest less than a week of tring to make it work. He still wants a bat cave so we bought the older version (that has great reviews)instead this christmas so hopefully this one will be the one to make him happy and my pocket book.
0,"What a waste! This toy is a disaster. Who ever heard of a toy that you had to tape to the wall to balance. Every time it moves, it falls over or falls apart. This is the last time I will ever buy this type of toy. The worst part is the look of disappointment on my son's face the first time he tried to play with this. You people should be ashamed, it's like stealing our money at our children's expense!!!"
0,"This toy is not worth the money I sure wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this item! This is really the only toy my 6 yr old son asked for this Christmas! I couldn't believe how flimsy this toy is. There is no way he could even play with it. Everytime we tried to move it, it fell apart! I am very disappointed and do not recommend."
0,"This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration."
0,"Catastrophe Cave! The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son's birthday. It was a complete waste of money! The toy design is terrible! The batcave falls over when played with. The elevator doesn't function properly either. Because of all the malfunctions and collapes, my son lost interest within five minutes of play. If you want your child to have a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas go with something other than this toy."
0,"BATCAVE NO RAVE Couldn't wait to give this to my 6 yr. old son last year for Christmas since it was all he kept asking for. When he got it, what a disappointment it turned out to be. Putting it together was a real project & it kept falling apart. The heavier part of the item is towards the top so it had no real durability. The background that supposedly holds it up is made out of cardboard so that was a complete flop so forget about screwing it to the wall. He played with it for like 5 minutes & now it just sits in his room collecting dust & falling over. This year, he asked for the Transforming Gotham City. Maybe we'll try that & see what happens."
0,"Very Disappointed ... Well - this was my son's #1 request from Santa Claus. Despite the reviews, he brought it to our house. As expected, it is quite flimsy. It is sad to watch my 5 yr old struggle with the elevator while trying to give batman a ride. It is so pathetic how these toy companies take advantage of children, and (their parents!) with such poor quality merchandise."
0,"Worst Toy Ever = Batman Animated Batcave Do not buy this toy. If you are given this toy as a gift, return it for store credit. This is a flimsly and poorly designed stack of platic and paper. The secret door doesn't work, the elevator doesn't slide and toys get stuck in there. The suggested 10"" batman doesn't work with the zip line, bungee or even the elevator. The add says ""Using new adhesive technology, you can set up the Batcave on just about any wall"" so they want us to glue this thing on to a wall.Please don't buy this toy."
0,JUNK MY SON SAW THE NEW TV SHOW AND WANTED THE NEW BATCAVE. HE HAD THE ORIGINAL ONE BUT BOTH HIM AND I WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE SIZE. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU. IT IS BUILT VERY FLIMSY. THE PARTS FALL APART EASILY. THE ELEVATOR CANNOT BE USED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER BATMAN DOLLS TO PUT IN THERE . THE CARDBOARD BACKING FALLS OFF. THE STICKERS ARE A PAIN TO PUT ON. I SPENT 2 HRS ON X-MAS EVE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CAVE. MY SON HAS IT STUCK IN A CORNER. HE HAS MORE FUN LINING UP HIS ACTION FIGURES ON THE COUCH AND USING HIS IMIGINATION THAN THIS TOY. DO NOT GET IT. THE ORIGINAL BATCAVE IS BETTER. SMALLER BUT BETTER.
0,"Wrong Bruce, you idiots! Bruce BANNER turns into THE HULK, not THE BATMAN, morons! It's BRUCE WAYNE who turns into Batman. Maybe this toy would get better reviews if product specialists spent a LITTLE more time researching the list of who transforms into whom.Hulk SMASH stupid Batcave!"
0,"Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing We bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas and I am very sorry we spent our money on it. Putting it together was not fun, but the real disappointment came when it was done and you see what it is. I think it is unrealistic to think that most people will want to or ever allow this toy to be STUCK to the wall with an adhesive (it says not to leave it stuck there for long periods of time - you must remove it from the wall after playing with it - which means this flimsy piece of plastic is now laying on the floor). After playing with it for 10 minutes, the elevator gets stuck. The top keeps falling off, everytime I turn around my son is whining that this came apart or that came apart. I assume I will be super gluing it before long. I feel ripped off as a consumer. Buyer Beware!"
0,"POOR QUALITY I have been buying toys for my kids as well as my niece and nephew for 14 years and this is the worst quality toy I've purchased! In fact, I had better quality toys when I was a child. My 3 year old son insisted on having this for Christmas and he loves it despite the fact that we have it leaned against the wall to hold it up. It comes with adhesive but I don't want to risk damaging our walls. It is very top-heavy (the 3-level batcave is help up by a couple light-weight plastic tubes)and, though the idea of all the parts snapping in place is nice, I actually had to glue one part in place so it wouldn't fall in the floor. Speaking of pieces, there are a million of them! The directions could be written better also. I read the other reviews here after my son had his heart set on this toy and wish I could have talked him out of this one. Fortunately, he has enjoyed playing with it despite all its flaws but he got better quality $10 toys for Christmas than this one!"
0,Don't Buy The Batcave My 4 year old son received the Batcave for Christmas. I know it is about $40. It took my hubby 1/2 hour to put together - is EXTREMELY flimsy & my son got batman stuck in the bat elevator within the first 2 minutes of using it. Soooooo not worth it. What a let down.
0,"Unacceptable The Eurorack was purchased as a portable mixer to tie mics into a camera. The inherent noise in my particular mixer is completely unacceptable. At a very reasonable level using balanced connections the mixer unmistakably colors the sound with a clear sounding ""HISS"". Even when running on batteries and far away from any electronic device the HISS is incredibly loud! Totally unacceptable for my purpose. The unit is now stashed away in a closet, a washed up waste of time!However for those on a budget who desire much greater quality with fewer inputs I HIGHLY recommend a Mackie 402-VLZ3 Four-Channel Compact Audio Mixer. However sometimes fewer inputs are unacceptable. Whatever the case steer clear from behringer!"

0,"Terrible Picture Quality Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT buy this DVD. I think ever since the UFC switched to a different DVD distributor, the quality of their DVD's has gone through the floor.

I bought this DVD to enjoy watching Silva/Franklin over and over and over again, but I started getting a headache two minutes into it. Stay away from this.

0,"A waste of time This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like ""Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are."" The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of ""What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores."" What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."

0,Very Frustrating Piece of Office Equipment I have had the displeasure of working with this machine for over 4 years. Its incompetent feeder is only matched by the uselessness of the software it comes with. Save yourself the frustration and buy another scanner.
0,"ripped-off by seller American Electronics Mart sold me a ""refurbished"" Xerox documate 510 scanner that did not work from the start. I spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot to find out whether the problem was on my end. Then, because I missed the return deadline, they would not take the scanner back. They would not agree to pay the costs to me to ship the scanner back to them. Now, I have wasted $250 on a worthless piece of junk sold to me by these crooks. Don't ever buy anything from these creeps."
0,"JUNK - don't waste your money or time! My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago. We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently. It does not see heavy use. From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer. I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so, which I should not have to do, it helps the jamming and misfeed issue. Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website. When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually, but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads. So what would have cost $40.00 - bad enough - now costs $100.00 !! As if we haven't spent enough money and frustration on this thing. I am going to do my best to get rid of this thing and buy one that works!"
0,"Good scanner - poor software Don't buy this scanner, if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document. The ""SCANDIRECT"" software that ships with this product WILL NOT scan multiple pages into one document. When you feed 5 pages into the ADF (automatic document feeder) thinking you'll get one document with 5 pages ---WRONG.. you get 5 documents with one page each.Just UPGRADE your paperport software for a minimum of $100, and then you can use the scanner as it was designed. When I called to complain to XEROX about this, I was told that they had ""mated"" this scanner and the software (Version 9) before the ADF was added as part of the base scanner. Seemed pretty crappy to me. IT GOING BACK to the store tomorrow."
0,"complete nuisance I set it up according to the directions, clicked the scan button, and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process. Uninstalled it, then re-installed it, and the same thing happened. Complete and utter waste of my time. I gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box."
0,"Compatible ONLY with their software Bad Scanner. Only with their software are you able to scan in paperwork. Paperport causes more problems with the computers I have it installed on than any other product I know of. If you have anything greater than Adobe Acrobat 5 installed, you can't use Acrobat to scan in software. Stay away from the Documate line of scanners!"
0,Decent player... while it lasts After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative's players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn't expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.
0,"Poor substitute for an iPod Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better, iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap."
0,"A Possible Discontinued Item? What's going on Creative Labs? Is it a coincidence that I no longer can get any of your Nomad Zen Xtras (worst name ever) at Best Buy and now the 60GB Nomad Xtra is ""sold out"" or more likely ""discontinued"" at the almighty Amazon.com? hmmmmm...."
0,"Buy it! I've had my Zen for over 4 years now (hard to believe I've had it that long). I still haven't filled up the memory on it, I've never had a day's trouble with it, and it's easy to use. I'm starting to find it a bit bulky now in comparison to some of the smaller, sleeker-looking players on the market, but I still have the attitude ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". The zen is superb, it's reliable, it's solid and easy to use, and I just don't see the point in changing to an ipod purely for aesthetics. I love my zen, and I wouldn't be without it."
0,What a junk What a junk. Every time NOMAD thinks the file is corrupt the OS freezes. The only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode. So if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen OS you can't use NOMAD until you get home. After OS froze twice on me in the subway I returned the jukebox.
0,"Why can't it be rated ZERO stars? DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT--I took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended. Nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke. The software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other SOUND BLASTER products, which is very dumb."
0,"Many Flaws in Mellor's 'Nursery Knits' This book's patterns are seriously flawed. My attempt to follow the ""outdoor snuggly"" for a 0-3 month old baby resulted in a 32 inch waistline snuggly with legs that were too long and arms that were too short. In addition, the photos of the snuggly did not match the pattern's instructions. My cousin used the baby poncho pattern and had a myriad of similar problems. Do NOT buy this book!"

0,"Tallant's ""creative"" talent Voodoo in New OrleansThis is an old classic which, if you are interested in either ""Voodoo"" or New Orleans, you probably should read. However, you can ignore the old adage of taking what Robert Tallant had to say with a grain of salt; you will need an entire salt lick to handle this slim volume. It is colorful, exciting, and alas, mostly the product of Robert Tallant's fevered imagination. What facts he didn't get wrong, he completely fabricated.Plenty of scholars have already weighed in on the problems presented and alas, also created by this small piece of creative fiction. It's very entertaining, although occasionally offensive. Mostly, it should not be taken seriously.Eoghan Ballard (Ph.D. Folklore. University of Pennsylvania 2005)"
0,"If you want to know about New Orleans Voodoo, avoid this rag If you are interested in reading a bunch of ignorant, bigoted stereo types, by all means buy this book.Robert Tallant was not a writer to bother with facts when spewing his hatred and racism.His depictions of New Orleans Voodoo and it's practitioners are dead wrong.If you want to read about New Orleans Voodoo, try Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau by Martha Ward."
0,"Wow I actually give this ZERO stars. But had to give it a star due to Amazon's rules.The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson's involvment with Manson. That's just a part of it. And warning, that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know. I know Brian Wilson is the brains behind the Beach Boys, but this documentary was predominantly about Brian. This should have been titled: ""Brian Wilson and the Satan (featuring the rest of them)"".I've seen other Beach Boys documentaries (even made for tv movies) that were better than this jumpy compilation. I felt like I was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had ADD."
0,"What a piece of junk! Recently, I went and bought this CD Player, i was going to geta ... Sony one but ended up with this one instead cuz' it was cheap u know? Well, this one I bought didn't even have antiskip protection at all! It skips whenever I go and it eat batteries like crazy! I had wasted over 10 batteries within a month. What a piece of junk! I don't think this product differs either so I recommend not buying it and get a better product. In fact, I just going to get a new CD Player from KOSS which I think will be better. This is not worth your time, and the cd players ugly too!"
0,"DON'T BUY THIS ONE! I purchased this product just a few months ago and it's broken already.

0,"THIS THING SUCKS Not only is the heat (btu)rating false, (in my oppinion), but to me it doesnt put out heat at all (relivently speeking) the tip over feature has prevented the unit from opperating several times in the 3 hours since i recieved it.. furthermore.. i will never purchace a heater made of plastic.. think about it.. plastic melts and metal doesnt (at the advertised tempurature) the fan speed i would equate to a gentle breeze if that. the heat output is far, far, below what i would have expected based on the advertisement.. basically in my oppinion this product is worthless to purchase unless you are trying to heat a refrogerator box sized space 5 degrese in a 70 degree enviroment.. look elsewhere for your heating needs."
0,"OUTDATED 1)The problems in the book are very outdated. (for grammar section buy Cliff's or Longman)2)The problems in the book are less difficult than those on a real exam.3)The problems in the book were arranged in very boring manner.4)The CD-Rom is only for Listening. (for more computer practice buy Delta's Key for Toefl Test with CD, which has 10 tests or Cambridge Preparation for Toefl Test, which has 7 tests. Both books have CD-Rom simulated CBT.)5) The Essay section is fair. (for the best essay section buy Cambridge Preparation for the Toefl Test)Generally, there is no one book for the preparation for the TOEFL. Most likely you will need some combination of them.For instance,a) Delta for practice and reading. Moreover, you may wish to buy just Delta CD Rom without book and cassets for practice only;b)Cliff's or Longman for grammar;c)Cambridge for essay and for practice.Good luck!"
0,CD Was missing I dont find any CD inside the book. It was really matter of disgrace that CD was missing after shifting. While I was going for the purchase it was mentioned that the CD will be available but it was missing
0,"Hardly worth reading This book, while fairly well written, was quite a dull story, and was very depressing to read. Sherwood seems to have researched her subject well, but the book seemed to be unnecessarily vulgar in a number of places, and this made the book all the more unpleasant to read."
0,"Case doesn't fit phone properly The case I had didn't fit properly - the window obstructed the rightmost side of the display. You could shift it over, but it would always shift back.

Nothing to restock at Discount Jungle, send the piece of junk back to Sandisk!!!Save some headaches and buy something different!

0,"cheap After about 3 months things started going down hill really fast. After leaving it in the car on a summer day something went wrong with the with the power saver. I'd charge it over night and the next morning it would be dead. I'd listen to it for 5 minutes, turn it off, then turn it back on and it would be at half power. Recently the screen broke. That just gave me a good reason to get rid of it.Trust me, keep looking."

0,"Wow the battery life is bad! If you have ever had an iPod you will kick yourself for buying this player. Replaced my iPod Nano because the battery life was fading. Unfortunately, there is no way to get the advertised 35 hours of advertised battery life. You should expect 6 to 8 hours.It is crashy. It occationally corrupts the tracks when it crashes. The screen is average. Getting podcsts to show up as podcasts has been frustrating. Forget about video podcasts. You will be spending a significant amount of time formatting them. Of course, you should expect even worse battery life.The reason the iPod Nano is $130; it works!"
0,"Think twice about buying this player ! I purchased this player last August and it worked fine for 4 months, even though I didn't play it much. My intent was to use it primarily on plane flights. Suddenly and for no reason, I was unable to easily insert the earphones into the player. With a little effort, I was finally able to insert the earphone, but could not get any sound.I contacted Sandisk and was very disappointed with their response. The player has a 1-year warranty but it's very apparent that Sandisk is attempting to discourage replacing defective products by making purchasers jump through hoops to test the product and prove it is defective rather than immediately fixing or replacing it. If the player won't work as advertised, why should I be inconvenienced as a result.In addition, a senior service person was supposed to contact me about the problem, but has not done so. I would never purchase a Sandisk product in the future -- too difficult to deal with if there's a warranty problem !"
0,"Sansa View 8 GB This item is one of the worse I have seen in the Sansa family. I have had all the Sansa E200 series mp3 players and those froze at times when viewing video. Good sound when you use better headphones. The only thing that is good about this mp3 player is the large view screen. The conversion software always freezes after the video file has been converted meaning that you have to Ctrl<Alt<Delete to shut down the program. As a 'techie', I recommend that you don't buy this item. Oh! one more thing! Do not order via the free shipping that Amazon offers. It's just 'standard' meaning you could have you item delivered to you way past the scheduled mailing time or not at all. It's been a month now and I still haven't recieved my original order alhough Amazon was gracious to resend the item, but I had to get it sent to my job which amazingly got there much faster through the same type shipping.

0,"SECOND and LAST time around for Sandisk e series This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player. The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months. I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280. I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of ""reading"" and then back to the Sandisk logo screen. It will do that for hours and hours on end. My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off. The only Sansa product I've ever loved was the discontinued M series players -they're few and far between and highly sought after."
0,"Returned the View twice in one week I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles, so I decided to buy a View for my boyfriend. Right out of the box, the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck. We tried everything but nothing would happen. The customer service people could not turn it on also, so we exchanged that one. The next one we received at least turned on. We went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on. Thats where trouble came. For video and pictures, you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter. I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player. We tried different files, different computers, and different people and nothing. My boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck. I have transferred music, video, and photos to my sansa e280 with no problems, but this player has many problems."
0,"Did not work out of the box I got the View for Christmas for my daughter after her Sansa Fuze died after several years of heavy use. It would never charge right out the box using both the USB or the electric charger I have for my own Fuse. I went online and tried everything the sandisk site said-nothing worked. Got the online chat who informed me that I had to use e-mail to resolve the issue since the View is a ""Legacy"" item. Sent an e-mail and never got a response. Their customer service department needs a lot... of help. On the plus side, sent it back to Amazon who gave A+++ refund service. Thanks Amazon!"
0,"Worst mp3 player on the market.

This is about the worst mp3 player on the market. Sound quality is so-so. I cannot create or save any playlists. The worst aspect of this player is the battery life.

I for one will never buy anythign that has the SanDisk name on it."

They also told me the battery is not replaceable and after warranty you throw these units away.

0,"Poor Qiality Control Despite the many reviews from folks who had to return one or more Sansa Views before getting a functional one, I figured the manufacturer must have cleared up their quality problems to stay in the market. Wrong!!!!My brand new Sansa View 8 totally stopped functioning about 20 minutes into its first use. I'm very disappointed to have waited for my order to be filled and now must wait again for a replacement. I'm more than a month into my purchase and I have nothing to show for it but a paid bill.Amazon has not stepped up at all, either. The order was filled by a vendor whom I've never heard of before. Amazon refers buyers to that vendor's customer service and takes no part in satisfying the purchaser.Lots of room for improvement on the part of all three providers."
0,"Has one important major flaw Had no luck, even with latest firmware, getting the unit to resume any of my audio books. I tried changing the tags on the mp3 files but it did not work. The unit would go into auto shut off and then force you to start your audio book file from the start every time."

This woman adds fat, additives, and perservatives when there is not need at all. For example, she adds mayonnaise to store bought salad dressing, basically for no reason. But most of all, she is advocating that packaged foods are the way to go. That is simply not good. The human body is meant meant to take in the amounts of chemicals that are contained in her recipes.

Otherwise there are 5 other sample structures wwhich have no building instructions and that is it.I put this completely in the category of good idea but bad reality.

0,"didn't fit my ears Complete waste of money. All three sizes pushed my Jawbone ICON out too far from my face to make contact with my jawbone.I know my ears stick out ... I am not dumbo though. This was a waste of money for me, thankfully they were only 10 bucks.I went back to the ear pads that came with the ICON... Is stays in for a while as long as i don't move... Not quite battlefield worthy as JB claims..."
0,Terrible design I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear. They seem to be made of a very thick silicone that has a slightly slippery feel to them. I was really disappointed with these. Stay away if you have small ear canals.
0,Worthless None of the gels came close to fitting in my ear - I ended up using the little rubber ring in the kit on my Jabra bluetooth to keep it from slipping out. Highly not recommended...
0,"They do not honer their return policy and the product was not what I ordered. DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sent me Jabra EarGels claiming they fit the Jawbone Prime 2. They did not. Because I had them for 28 days, they would not take them back. Their return policy stated that you can return up to 30 days.DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,Waste of money This product ended up being a waste of money for me. They didn't fit too well so I ended up just using the original Jawbone ear piece with the these.
0,don't buy these were advertised to fit the habra stone. they did not. i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it. not even one piece fit. threw them away
0,"Not well suited for the Jawbone II When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic. They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it. Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset. The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear. I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so. I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all."
0,"Stick it in your ear! I own one of the Jawbone torture devices. I had an old Jabra with the mini ear gels and just for giggles swapped out the hard plastic stock Jawbone things with them. It was an amazing difference. The Minis fit very well and direct the sound into your ear channel. Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]"
0,"Thanks for nothing, Jabra Jabra directed me to these as a replacement for the lost pieces for my Wave. THESE ARE NOT what I need. Meh. Gonna be two more weeks before I get home to return them.I don't blame the merchant, blame Jabra for directing me to waste weeks buying, waiting for, and returning the wrong stuff. Swedish morons"
0,"useless For some reason the makers of this item thought it would be wise to make each size ear piece fit a different bluetooth. The small fits my Jawbone, but does not fit my ear. The large fits my ear just fine, but does not fit my Jawbone. Save your money and find a different product."
0,"Old and yellowed Ordered the EarGels, but they had been exposed to time and heat. They were yellowed and sticky. I threw them away - wasn't worth it to return it. Won't order from here again."
0,"Great effects...NO HEART NO PASSION The special effects of this film were wonderful--no debate there--but Armand Assante seems like he's sleep-walking through this movie. It LOOSELY follows the poem at parts and suffers from a severe lack of passion! Compare this film with the 1950's ""Ulysses"", which despite poor effects, had MUCH more passionate and inspired portrayals of the characters by Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn among others. Even the classic scene involving Argos the dog was ommitted from this modern creation. Ugh!On the flip side, Athena's portrayal by Isabella Rossellini and the actor playing the god Mercury are very fun to watch in ""The Odyssesy"". Still...not enough to do the story justice."
0,"absolutely HORRIBLE I have never been so disgusted (or sickenly entertained) by a movie before. I am one of the few who have ACTUALLY read the ODYSSEY. I did like the poem. After reading it, I decided to watch the movie. There were almost NO accurate allusions at all to the poem. The characters' acting skills were that of an elementary school kids, and the scenes were obviously fake. I feel bad for Homer, he must be spinning in his grave. The fact that got 4 out of 5 stars is most appalling. I feel sorry for humanity as it is, believing such [nonsense] is the work of Homer."
0,"WOW Watching this movie after having read the book is pretty much hell. The fact that they changed the whole plot from the book makes it seem like a joke. Then the ""special effects"" just made it even worse. Even if you haven't read the book and you don't know the real story, the movie was still horribly directed and filmed. There are no transitions, and the actors don't seem to realize they are all in one movie together. They all have their own accents and the only thing they have in common with the characters they are playing from the book is their names. The only reason anyone should ever watch this movie is out of complete boredom and a need to make fun of something."
0,"Uhh..... Were they stoned? This was the biggest piece of drunken hoopla in the WORLD! I can't believe people would actually take time out of their daily schedule to watch this! If you actually read The Odyssey, the movie is NOTHING like the real thing. I STRONGLY suggest that you read the book first. Well, anyways, no one is going to read this review thus rendering this review useless and something to clutter the internet even more than it already is. I AM THE ANTICRHIST!"
0,"Uggh Yes, yes the movie was bad, really bad, so bad that if Homer was still alive to see it, he would be doing something similar to the TV that Mr. N does when he watches Boston Public. But how bad it was is beside the point. Who really cares if some of the people in our class are writing Mr. N's ideas on here. If I were him, I would be flattered to know that people beleived strongly enough in my ideas to take the time to write about it on amazon.com. To everyone who wrote a review on this horrific movie, and didnt criticize other people's reviews, good for you. I hope in the future we can all express our disgust with this movie without having our competency as an honors student questioned by someone who won't even tell us who they are. But until then, Lizzie Mcguire is on (hehehe) so I must be going. I'll see you all periods 1/2. - Andrew"
0,"More like a NEGATIVE 3 This comes close to being the worse piece of garbage it has ever been my privilege to view. The acting...HORRENDOUS!!! CGI...poorly done. Do yourself a favor and watch the Roman version of the Odyssey...Ulysses with Kirk Douglas. It may be an oldie, but it's definitely an absolute goodie!!"
0,"I agree I totally agree with andrew...and by the way, people who dont know any of us and dont really know whats going on...please dont waste your time with this movie...you're better off watching old reruns of whos the boss...even though im deprived of cable and wouldnt know...most of you probably know who this is"
0,"Blech This movie was the epitome of, well, everything wrong with movies. It took the premise of adapting Homer's literary classic and completely butchered it into this...osbstrocity. With acting that would pale in comparison to an elementary school play, a script that would make Ed Wood blush, and some of the words special effects ever, it truly makes me sad for humanity.The one good point is that it makes for some great ""in"" jokes. Telemakhos's double spear throw has become a running gag at my school."
0,"THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER! As a Detroit Red Wings fan, I must say that I loved this version of the Odyssey! This special effects were absolutly wonderful, and I must say I love the acting, some of the best i've ever seen in my life, almost better than sergey federov acting to get hit to draw a high sticking call! There was more action than Chelios misses checks! Oh, and there were more holes in this movie than Curtis Joseph leaves in his net. This movie was wodderful"
0,"Yeah, watching it felt like 10 years, too. NBC miniseries tells the tale of the Greek hero Odysseus, played flatly by Armand Assante. Boring adventure film features unlikeable characters, routine action scenes, and a lack of spirit and passion. This all builds up to a surprisingly very bloody conclusion (Given its TV roots).* 1/2 out of *****"
0,"Ouch! This movie was so bad, it was funny Everything about this movie was baaadddd....From the everchanging accents, the fake special effects(the cyclops looked so fake that it took away from the movie), the movie was so flawed that it became more entertaining to look for the flawed parts than actually watch the movie. Yeah, this movie sucked."
0,"Hallmark Entertainment needs to join us in the 21st Century It is extremely sad that Hallmark Entertainment has not realized that hard of hearing and deaf people need closed captioning to understand the product they are marketing. If they have realized this, then they obviously could care less about disabled people of any kind."
0,"Awful, just awful Armand Assante is one of the worst actors I have ever had the misfortune to watch. He could not act dead if you put a bullet in his brain. The odyssey is a great story and it deserves a great actor. I would rate this movie zero stars if I had the option."
0,"Who be dissin on our noteboom? Ok, first of all Mr.Cmndrnineveh from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA I find it very hard to believe that you even read the full book version of THE ODYSSEY. God knows if you did you wouldnt be madly in love with this made-for-TV movie THE ODYSSEY. Personally i think the only ppl this movie does good too are druggies and wanna-be drop outs who dont want to read the book or buy the cliff notes so they watch the movie. its absolutley horrible. Mr. Noteboom is a very bright and brillant honors teacher in Washington state. I must say i agree with every honor student's last year review of this book. To the point where Telemachous was whiny and horrible; Athena had blue eyes; and Menelaos' hair is black. All i gotta say is what a waste of film! Ppl out there- spare yourself."
0,Can't get worse This book is bad (period). It is very incoherent and ill-organized. The examples are vague and serve anything but support the material. Very theoritical with hardly any real life applications. Lacking in modern AI topics/game design.
0,"Nauseating In a phrase: as nauseating as the ""artwork"" which besmirches its cover. This book is definitely not worth the price. Donate the money instead to your city's homeless instead! You will learn as much about AI by doing so and will actually contribute something to the world. Of course, the cover makes a great prank at cocktail parties. Place it under someone's drink and it will look like the beverage has been spilled.Winston's book is not only disorganized, but pretentious. He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer. Winston and his books will go down in history with the works of others, such as Doug Lenat, who made their fame primarily by doing something very easy before anyone else got around to doing it.Real AI is yet to come."
0,"RE: Wipeout originally by Surfaris Google the instrumental Wipeout , and you will read the real story. I love the Surfari's version which got to #2 on the Billboard charts in a matter of weeks."
0,"A pitiful excuse for a movie If you want to see a movie of Moby Dick, see the John Huston directed version, with screenplay by Ray Bradbury. This pitiful excuse for a movie was made by people who had no knowledge of New England, whaling, whales, or Herman Melville's epic novel. The grand poetry, the vivid imagery, the theological symbolism which fill ""Moby Dick"" are all missing in this shell of a film. Even Stewart's performance is a disappointment--Khan in Star Trek II does a better job of spouting Ahab's venom than Stewart's anemic portrayal.The additions to the story are meaningless (Chinese harpooners, Queequeg's ""BLAH!"" noises,Ahab's family)...and the omissions are puzzling (Elijah).And the rubber whale--who is unscarred, unmarked by corkscrew harpoons, ungrizzled, unbarnacled, with no flight of gulls--well, he looks like a rubber whale."
0,"TERRIBLE MOVIE What a waste of 2 hours. Nothing gets accomplished at all! You watch some terrible graphics, watch everyone die, and they didn't even kill the freaking WHALE!That made me mad.This film accomplishes nothing.There is no point at all to this movie.Don't waste your time, money, and energy.Leave, quickly!"
0,"DRASTIC EDITS RUIN THE VHS VERSION It seems that there are several different versions of this TV movie available. Rumor has it that the movie that was originally broadcast on USA came in at 3 hours, there is a laser disc version of the movie that is 145 minutes long, and the VHS version is 120 minutes long. Unfortunately, the edits made to the VHS version are so extreme, abrupt, and awkward that it makes the movie virtually unwatchable. You can't help but feel that you're missing something."
0,"Ordered this item 3 weeks ago still waiting.... The description said usually ships in 1-2 business days, well it's been 1 month and I have another month to go until I recieve this item. Don't believe the descriptions! I ordered this 3 weeks ago now the delivery estimate is the end of November. If you are cold and need this item this year don't buy it from Amazon. It probably won't arrive until February! It's going to take 2 months for delivery! Just a warning!"
0,"Dreadful. Ms. Perry's depiction of post-traumatic head injury is completely irresponsible. She apparently did no research at all. Amnesia of the type she describes here does not exist. Thus, the underlying premise of this book unbelievable, even infuriating, to anyone with the most basic knowledge of brain injury. In addition to this, Monk's investigative skills are virtually nonexistent. His interviews with informants and suspects are fragmentary and incomplete. Suspense is not built, action is nearly absent, and the eventual solution is anticlimactic. Laden with turgid prose, this book is absolutely dreadful."
0,"This was the slowest and most non-action, action movie ever. To start off, this movie lacks any direction, also there is no build up of excitment, no rising interest, and little or no action till the very end. I love Van-Damme movies and especially actioners of all types but I found myself desperately trying to stay awake through this. Watch this movie if you have alot of time to hopelessly squander."
0,"Van Damme gives the best performance, which does not bode well for the movie. The other actors are just so horrible and the story so flat. Don't get me wrong, I like Jean-Claude, movies like Timecop and Bloodsport were pretty good for what they were. The fighting scenes in Black Eagle just don't make up for a lame movie though."
0,"worst action movie ever Totally fake, unrealistic, plotless. I love action movies, but this one just didn't have any action in it. You could see the missed punches and fake reactions--I can't believe that anyone would pay money for this movie"
0,Seems every time Van Damme plays a bad guy he does his mute method acting Black Eagle was released a few months after Van Damme became a star with Bloodsport. The film could have made Van Damme a wash up but luckily it didn't. The martial arts chorography in the film is very sloppy and the fight scene between Sho Khogusi and Van Damme is weak. Skip this one
0,"I wish I could give 0 stars I must admit that I'm not a big Van Damme fan. Still, I try to keep an open mind. Not only was the sound terrible, but it was so obvious that the punches were checked, that it would have made a comedy if the plot weren't so boring. I think that Woody Allen could make a better action picture than this attempt."
0,"Didn't work...I have to start again My (indoor) cat contracted fleas about a month ago and I used the Zodiac spray on the carpet, upholstery, curtains, and mattresses as I went about treating the apartment. I also used the Zodiac sponge bath (2 treatments/bottle, used both) and one course of the Frontline topical medicine. Today I was brushing my cat and found more fleas. My vet informed me that they have heard nothing but complaints from pet owners who've used the Zodiac products.The label claims that: ""One treatment gives continuous protection against pre-adult fleas for 7 months."" I used the spray generously but here I am 1 month later right back where I started.Just treating my 2-bedroom apartment for fleas is a costly and tedious task. If you're going to go through this, make sure you use the BEST products available. Talk to your vet and explore ALL your options. GOOD LUCK!"
0,"A charismatic Lutheran who's more charismatic than Lutheran This work is an enthusiastic encouragement and guidebook for charismatic renewal among Lutherans. However, it offers some dangerous theology. For example, it suggests that it's okay to make mistakes when first trying to prophesy--that everybody needs practice. However, this is contrary to Scripture. God takes false prophecy very seriously, but unfortunately Mr. Christenson does not."
0,"Sad Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite Authors. This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up. Some of the characters you never figure out why they are in the novel at all.It's too bad that I spent money on this book when I could have purchased a Mercedes Lackey Novel without help."
0,"Mercedes wrote this? I've been a longtime fan of Mercedes and own most of her Valdemar series. So, of course, I picked this book up at my local store. After wrestling through 50 pages, I gave up! I plan to sell it back to my local store ASAP- this is nothing better than a paperweight in my bookshelves. The worst part is, my boyfriend picked it up and tried reading it. Now he thinks that this is a good example of her work!"
0,"This book has already been written Mercedes Lackey contributed to a series I'll refer to as the Merovingian Nights Series, set in a universe invented by C.J. Cherryh. Mercedes's ORIGINAL contribution to the Merovingian Nights series is a far better read. The Shadow of the Lion was a major disappointment to me, not to mention I could have spent my money more wisely on another book. There should have been a warning posted on the cover or flap that if the reader has read the Merovingian Nights series, this book will offer very few surprises. Shame on you Ms. Lackey!"
0,"CHEESY! And I don't mean Parmigiano-Reggiano! As a previous reviewer said, it pulled out every single American cliche about Italy in the book, which is pretty much what I had expected. But oh my GAWD was this awful! I was laughing hysterically at this. As bad as a low budget miniseries."
0,"A great idea! Hey gang, let's pool our resources and get the rights so Mystery Science Theater can talk us through this one!I'm telling you it would surpass even Manos, Hands of Fate for sheer yuks. The cheese, the schmatz, the dishonesty, the cluelessness, the pretention of this flick just begs, begs to be put out of its misery."
0,"very much disappointed It was just terrible for me, living in Italy for many years now. I hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of Italian men. it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View."
0,"The Book is WAY Better..and That's all You Really Need to Know! Don't waste your money on a DVD unless: 1) You just want to see beautiful Italian scenery (and it is gorgeous!) or 2) You actually enjoy watching a whiny, sniveling, pathetic female character waiting for a man to fulfill her life. Doubt if the author was thrilled with this version of her story. BUY THE BOOK!!! It's a great read."
0,"Boring, Drawn Out Movie I watched the movie before reading the book. The movie was so bad that I felt compelled to read the book to see if it could redeem itself. The characters as depicted in the movie were very one dimensional and I just didn't care about them or what happened to them. The book tells a totally different story than is depicted in the movie and is SO MUCH BETTER."
0,"Terrible movie I rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things I had heard talked about it, like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery. What a disappointing story!The story had no sense of direction. It seemed badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were saying, ""we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the real estate man."" All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character."
0,"under the Tuscany Sun Was Very Very disappointed!! Movie though brand new, just out of the box it was stopping all the time during the latter part of the movie."
0,"not worthy to be a chick flick First, this movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the book except for the title. That said, once again Diane Lane plays someone who is supposed to be sympathetic as if she's a sociopath. Really - when she looks serious, you think she's about to kill someone. When she's happy she looks like she just did. Then you have the fact that nothing that happens in the movie is realistic at all -- except, if someone like Cameron Diaz were in the title role, we'd probably not care and even enjoy it. I feel used and cheap after being duped into watching this movie and I'm no longer going to waste my time on DL's films. She doesn't deliver. If she plays a Black Widow, I'll watch. If she plays another sensitive caring woman, I'll hurl first."
0,"Good Fun? This is a fun movie if you like the romantic comedy.Why 1 star?? There is a scene where an old woman calls ayoung German couple ""facists"". The irony is, the old lady is Italian. Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."
0,"Make Sure the Format is in Your Region I'm such a goof! I automatically assumed that the format of this DVD was for North America Region. I was so excited when it came in, I opend the package and went straight to my player to watch. Opps! I discovered that the PAL format is not readable on my player. Though, I am aware of the many video formats out there, I still assumed that this DVD was just like any other DVD or Blue Ray that I have pruchased.The PAL is for countries like Japan and Europe, I confirmed my findings when I red the back information of the DVD package.Good thing that I have an adopted daughter in France, she will like this DVD. It's just her format! :-)Please be carefule when purchaseing video's on amazon...read carefuly that the format is for your country or else you may end up disapointed."
0,"For MEN only maybe they are clever enough to figure out why these actresses,directors, producers, etc. are still in circulation.This film is not only BORING BORING BORING but also an INSULT to everyone ... except perhaps the Far Eastern looking ""actress"" who gets to play the ""friend"" of the protagonist, and who fairly deliberately ruins what was supposed to be a one night-stand (one-night lay to be more precise) anyway, on the part of the slow, but dark-looking Italian HOD (hunk of the day, my abbreviation, he-he). Don't worry, a bearded, rugged looking American is going to fill the Italian's rubber shoes ... Sorry for italianizing and americanizing but there is more than enough of that going on in the film, at least on the DVD version.The film forgot to elaborate on the potential dangers of adult owls snatching kittens though, as it's a romantic, and not a realistic view of the world, and it was definitely not meant to be a horror flick. Then again, some of the scenes are pure horror."
0,Boooring..... This was the most boring movie and the most wretched performance I have ever seen from Diane Lane. All she did was sigh through the first 45 minutes.
0,wrong formAt I may have read the description wong but the DVD won't play. States wrong source. In small letters on the box it says it's the UK version. Can't fiind by receipt so I can't return it. I was really looking forward to sharing it with someone special. :(
0,"Dismal I hated this dismal movie. Not completely, of course. Diane Lane, the villa, Italy and the builders are lovely, but the story is dismally surreal. First you have the divorce, then the lesbian couple, then a gay tour bus, then some promiscuous italians, then more breakups, then a nice pormiscuous fellow writer. Yuck. There is no romance in this movie - this is not romantic, it's a biological and twisted tale of some womens pre-menopausal angst and bedroom problems. And as if her bedroom problems weren't enough, we get everbody else's too. What happened to nice normal romantic comedys in the Audrey Hepburn style?"
0,"Non vero Italia! This not a window into Italy, but rather an American contrivance of Italy. Cliches abound. Comedy forced. I have disowned all who claim to even mildly enjoy this movie. Questa film e' merda."
0,"If you liked this movie, you might have a brain damage Easily, the worst film of the year.Manipulative, ham-fisted, sloppy, insulting mess of a movie.Imagine some chick-flick parody in ""The Simpsons"" and you'll get pretty close (add some strange PC garbage for a good measure).Close to a bad soap opera episode.BTW I like both Diane Lane and Tuscany , but nothing can redeem this gross and pathetic caricature.I've learnt my lesson though - Audrey Wells work is to be avoided at all costs."
0,"Italian-American Fairy Tale set in the 21 st Century? I should have read the reviews before wasting $10 bucks at BB for this used dvd. I bought it for my wife. She wanted to see it but as I write this review I am watching it with her and we both think this movie is a fairy tale. Please, please...if this movie had any sense of reality I would be the first one to move to Italy. Enough! Read what others have said before me for more specific. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
0,"Terrible movie, Great scenery From the onset, this movie was stilted and poorly developed. While Diane Lane is wonderful in some other films, she was(or her character was) irritating at best in this one. The plot is trite, Hollywood drivel. Some of the costuming and lightingwere well-done. I'd like my two hours back. This one is definitely going to be donated to the library where people canbe tortured by it for free -- but not me (again)!"
0,"BORING!!! I rented this movie while my husband was out of town, looking forward to a good chick flick. By the middle of my movie, I couldn't believe I was still sitting there, and by the end, I wanted my $4.00 back from Blockbuster. The story did not keep my attention and the pregnant friend has got to be the worst actress ever. I do not recommend this at all!"
0,"Just not the same Quality as Canon Batteries. After about a year of using this generic battery from China, the battery is quickly fading away. It will not hold charges and seems to make my camera actually reject the battery. When using this replacement battery, my camera will sometimes shut off or will not even turn on. I will not ever buy a cheap replacement battery for my expensive cameras. China is producing some really bad products lately, using cheap materials and cheap labor. Those products seem inferior to factories from other countries, especial USA, Japan, Germany. You have been warned."

0,THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER! SEEN I saw this movie in theaters with a friend and my brother. I was expecting a exciting movie but it was exactly NOT that! The movie doesn't make sense and there really isn't a plot. Don't waste your time or your money on this movie!
0,"A Confusing Waste of Plastic The movie has a vague plot, meaningless items, (like the facial tattoo), and a loud, annoying soundtrack which frequently overwhelms the dialog. The additional injection of non-english conversations, which it only translated occasionally, simply adds to the confusion. No real resemblence to either the novel or the original movie. I'd find 90 minutes of the Shopping Channel more entertaining."
0,"Why, oh why, oh why! Im begging you now do NOT watch this film at any cost. It is an awful thing (cant bring myself to call it a film) with shoddy acting horrendous set design and one of the most fake, boring scripts ever. If you really want to buy it I suggest purchasing it for the pure pleasure of watching it burn!"
0,"Why? Oh Why? This is just an outrage. The temptation to re-make movies is evidence of the fact that there is little creativity in Hollywood. This movie is evidence that there are people in Hollywood who should not be allowed to go to movies let alone make them.The original is not all that great, but it was in fact original and had some very interesting photography and stunts. This version is insipid to the point of stupidity; the photography stinks, and the stunts are mostly cut-and-paste special effects.The people who made this should be banned from any association to movie making for life! So why did I buy it? By mistake! I had a copy of the original and thought a comparison would be interesting. I was wrong. Learn from my error and avoid this like the very plague."

0,"Great movie, if you have the mind of a 10 year-old The setting for this movie is not in the future!!!! It is current day, and takes place in a poor European country. The arena they skate in looks like a very cheap prop from American Gladiators. There is VERY LITTLE SPECIAL EFFECTS and no high tech equipment.15 minuets of the movie is done with a night vision camera, so everything you see is either dark green or picth black.Most of the action happens within the rollerball arena. There are only a few action sceens on the streets of the city."
0,"Rollerball ROCKED In Theatres,... ""Rollerball"" in theatres was an awesome, bone-crunching, action-packed movie! But once it got on video & DVD...they added in nudity & took out scenes.

WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TRANFERED THE FILM?"
0,"Horrible stupid movie Nothing more to say, this is one of the worst movies ever. Bad script, stupid story, terrible shooting, boring acting. I highly don't recommend this title."
0,"R? What the heck? This movie is rated R! The theatrical version was rated PG-13! Now I'm not allowed to get or see this movie, which was only mediocre to begin with. Great job!"
0,Appalling This is a grotesque despoliation of a classic film. Essential elements of the background storyline are not properly established. There are scenes whose purpose within the overall structure simply defies understanding. The nighttime 'escape attempt' sequence is shot in a bizarre green blur and was extremely unpleasant to watch. Hideous music plays frequently but the nail in the coffin of this film is the poverty of the in-game action sequences. These are generally nothing more than a confusing melange of images. The transitions from one camera shot to another seem very poorly done and it is really impossible to follow the internal dynamics of each game.
0,"TERRIBLE MOVIE! DO NOT BUY! This movie was one of the worst films I've seen in years. The script is horrible, the movie had little glitches on it, and a big scene of the movie is shot in night vision (GREEN!) If you are thinking of buying this movie, read this review. I'd give this movie 0 stars, but the minimum is 1 star."
0,"The Worst Movie Ever! This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen! The plot was impossible to follow, the action confusing and flashy, and the film editing awful. For example, there is one sequence in which a motorcycle crashes through a chain link fence and the sound effect boingongong is heard, like a spring snapping. Ridiculous! Concept - Terrible, Acting - Worse, Execution - Rollerball looks like it was made in 2 weeks using 2 computers that didnt work. I reccommend that you see this movie, just so you can tell your friends you've seen the worst movie ever made!"
0,"Top Ten Worst Movies I ever Saw This is somewhere up there as one of the worst movies I ever saw. Its not hard to find faults in this movie because its full of them.I was horrified by how poorly the first rollerball game scene was shot. It was so uninteresting and almost impossible to follow what was going on that it was PATHETIC. There was no doubt in my mind after the first fifteen minutes that this was the worst intro to a film I had ever seen.It got somewhat better as the weak plot developed and there was less action shots of them playing this ridiculous game.I normally end with something positive, but there was none. NONE at all.I must admit to watching the whole thing... a sucker for punishment. I would never watch it again, and could never recommend this film to anyone.A real letdown"
0,"Little to say about this embarrassing film... Not many films make me feel stupid for actually watching them, but this movie did. Despite starring LL Cool J (who generally happens to at least make stupid films entertaining) this film falls so far flat that it almost bows under and creates a ditch. Chris Klein is a horrendous actor and he manages to muddle up nearly everything he comes in contact with, and no matter how hot Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is (just Romijn now), she doesn't bring anything to this film outside of her body, and that just can't cut it. The violence is cheap, the script is preposterous and the action sequences feel third rate. This is one of those films that offer us absolutely nothing.I have nothing else to say about this."
0,"Umm, I don't know what they were trying to do This movie is just plain sad. In addition to mediocre acting, the special effects were just as bad. In one scene you could plainly see the safety wire connected to the motorcycle. Bad diologue and senseless nudity made the film even worse. The plot drug and the resolution could have been solved a little sooner than it did. They came up with a lame chase scene with an airplane cruising on the ground after a motorcycle. Maybe that was a last ditch effort to make the movie a little bit more exciting. The only slightly interesting character was played by LL Cool J. His on camera presence is always rather captivating to me. It also carried him through a poorly written character. Since most of the movie took place on the track, there was more of the game than I could really put up with. Avoid it."
0,"The pits A complete waste of film start to finish.Don't waste your money.If you must see it for yourself, rent it.This movie didn't need a remake, the original starring James Caan was just fine.One star is generous."
0,"What the???? It is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on. What will this do for you. All it does is make noises. Have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing, but make a noise and just sits there after one day of being played with? This has no education value. For Yu-Gi-Oh fans, you should try buying Yu-Gi-Oh tins instead of this CRAP!"
0,"Hassles galore! We bought this last December (2005). It worked well enough for the first few months (some resetting of the TV Guide and blanking for days at a time, but OK). Was great to backup our Digital 8 video tapes to DVD.THEN...two weeks ago the TV Guide went dark (could not use it at all). I left it alone thinking it would reset and be fine.Machine then went into an endless loop the other day when I tried to turn it on. Would not come on. Gave a ""LOADING"" message when powered on - then went off to EPG function - then fired up again to ""LOADING"" then to EPG - etc. It seems to be frying.Read elsewhere on the web that the TV Guide function has been a disaster for almost all users. New version does not include it!Pioneer asked us to ship it to them and they will repair it under the 1 year warranty. Frankly, I feel it is a lemon and should be replaced with the new version under a lemon law for bad electronics!Buyer beware!"
0,"A Note about Charles Taze Russell It is curious that one one the more significant achievements of ""Pastor"" Charles Taze Russell is omitted above. That fact is that he was the primary founder of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and the religion now known as ""Jehovah's Witnesses."" No small amount of his theology is controversial in the body of the Church as a whole, as it would be (for different reasons, perhaps) amongst Jehovah's Witnesses."
0,"I used to eat it till I found out how it was made diseased yellow pile of tortured meat, that's what it is. I used to eat it... but than I found out how it's made, that's just gross. people are disgusting and will eat raccoon's a* on a stick if it's called a delicacy."
0,"Who eats Fois Gras? So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods? What gives? Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is? And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line. So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal). People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding."
0,DISAPPOINTED I was extremely disappointed with the fabric and color when it came. It is obvious that it is of poor quality but I guess you get what you paid for 10 bucks.The zipper of the plastic cover of one set was broken.I bought 2 queen sheets and I wanted to return both purchases if only I did not have to pay for shipping.Do not buy this!!!! You will regret it.
0,"i got it cheap and it is Cheap !!! I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . This is not a quality product , avoid at higher prices"
0,"Not really a bargain--terrible sheets Dollar store quality. Lovely dark pattern, but it is printed on thin white flannel, not over-printed on blue yarn-dyed fabric, and the stitching on these fairly dark sheets is white."
0,"This toy is the WORST! This toy is the worst! You can't even get past the Password screen to play anything. I got tricked that it was a good toy, but it's not. And I don't want you to get tricked, either. I thought it was a good toy by looking at it in the wrapper, but it wasn't."
0,"I hate useless products You have to buy most of the battle chips seperatly which leeches your cash in no time, don't bother. Get a Game Boy or a Nintendo DS if you want handheld fun."
0,"junk junk junk it has terrible graphics i mean it is just black and white.also it moves very slow on the screen.that is what little of a screen it has.(...)i say get av gameboygame instead.at least that has decent graphics and isn,t a cheap piece of plastic.overall it is a piece of junk."
0,Not a good toy This toy isn't well made or designed with kids in mind. You have to shake it forever before it will even do anything. I thought it was broken at first but then I found out that you can shake it for 10 min and nothing will happen but that's normal. If you like Megaman then I'd get the GBA game instead of the PET toy.
0,Not appropriate for 9 yr olds My very athletic 9 yr old absolutely could not use this - much too hard - returned it.
0,"Good for downhill only I can't believe this rates higher than 2 Stars. Don't be fooled, this only good for down hill. While it is well built, you can't propel this trike as advertized. Save your money, don't buy this!"
0,"Why do people like this garbage? Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking. My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious. I, however, am left wondering: why?I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors. The characters are boring and flat. His humor is downright stupid. This book is not clever in the least. If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel. But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand."
0,"The worst mess ever DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Once out of the box, the three layers were cut with what looked like pinking shears and were horribly uneven. This was NEVER a mattress that sold for 999.00 ... When I tried to return it All Sleep was helpful at first but I could not package the layers to send. While trying to come up with a solution to the shipping problem, the UPS labels they sent to me expired and now they will not return any emails or calls. WORST SERVICE AND PRODUCT EVER!"
0,Spend your money better This book is a total waste of money; it is only useful for lighting up the BBQ. The only one to make (plenty?)of money out of this book is the writer. Do not be discouraged by the title!. This is not a serious book.
0,tbone thought this was a cd by the group pieces of a dream. you put it with their cds. not what i wanted.
0,"Terrible! My sister was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and there is a strong chance that I may have it as well. I wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start. Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly written and with the most bizarre suggestions; how to write your family a Christmas letter, informing them of the diagnosis. Come on! There are other instances that I felt it was just a little over the top and was not realistic to everyday life.Since finishing this book, I began reading Elizabeth Hasselbeck's book, The G-Free diet and have found it to be much more informative and much better written. Ms. Hasselbeck's book gets right to the point giving you the information that you really need to understand this disease."
0,Poor Information for Celiacs I found areas of this book that contained information that would make individuals needing to lead a gluten free life style ill. There were several poor suggestions in this book and also poor information regarding some of the products mentioned as NOT being gluten free that are!There are great books out there to help Celiacs! This is certainly *not* one of them.
0,"Where's the storyline This is beautifully written but this does not make up for the total absence of a story. Three characters in war and how their lives, interact. Reads like a series of notes rather than a completed work. If it is trying to convey the horror of war it fails. Deeply deeply disappointing - I feel I have wasted my time and been cheated."

0,"NOT GOOD Who does she think she is? Amy Grant has been singing for years and years and still no one sees what she's doing? First she gets everyone thinking she's a Christian singer so she doesn't get as much opposition and more positive attention. Then she gets secular and fools those who are too blind to see. If you think ANY of her music will draw you closer to God it won't, and NO MATTER WHAT don't get this CD!"
0,"Beware: this is a bootlegged/pirated video If you paid for this product, you overpaid. Granted, the original, out-of-print dvd of The Bikini Carwash Company sells for exorbitant prices, so my suggestion is to just download it for free through torrents and cut the video pirates and video scalpers down to size. If anything, buy the European PAL version, which is also uncut and uncensored, and available on the North American Amazon as well."
0,"don't even bother this is by far one of the worst step 2 prep materials ever! the questions on this CD ROM were random, poorly written, and testing very obscure material, certainly material inappropriate for the step 2 level. as an example, drug X effects which part of the electron transport chain? oh my, that's going way back into first year med, which in not what step 2 is about. we all know step 2 is for clinical applications of what we've learned as third year meds, and i can honestly say that this CD does not test these types of things. it was extremely frustrating trying to go thru the CD and ""give it a chance"" but i just couldn't take it anymore! try the NMS series or the A&L ERT if you want some computer practice, this exam master stuff doesn't cut it."
0,"Exam Master. for the USMLE Step 2 I hate this CD , it was waste of money and I wish I could refund my money ( 89 USD + S&H, I bough it directly from the publisher) I am absolutly agree with the rest of the reviewers. questions are not even close to USMLE step 2 format. whoever wrote those questions I am sure that had no idea about USMLE at all since the questions are about any thing but USMLE step 2. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS CD 7 insted try to read NMS REVIEW multiple Q ( it is bible of USMLE step 2 )."
0,"save your money, dont let the price fool you second hand quality. i have ordered this before from sleep warehouse. now their memory foam seems to be second hand quality. i recommend trying another site that has true grade quality. don't let the low price fool you, like i did. when i press my hand in the foam, it comes back to shape in 2 seconds. the foam i got 2 years ago, same brand, it would take 5 seconds to come back to shape. that was great foam. try someone else"
0,"Devoid of depth or even much substance The only type of person to whom I could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a ""forest"" level view of them from one source. There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. ""Raising Your Spirited Child"" is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child. I am saddened and more than a bit annoyed (I purchased the book on the basis of the organization's recommendation) that the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight."
0,"Less than one star. Didn't like this book at all. For several reasons: 1. the hero Ben seemed weak especially when he allowed his mother to slap him, come on he is like 37-39 years old!!! Unbelievable! 2. the heroine was way too dependent upon daddy; did she not have any type of backbone? 3. The biggest, Ben knew the truth and yet he had to create all this angst on both their parts!!! YUCK!!"
0,"I dont feel it Im not feelin this album. I always liked Bad Azz along with all the other LBC and DPG rappers,,, I thought his ""word on the streetz"" album was good,,,, but I just dont feel this album. In my opinion the best song is ""wrong idea"" which as you know is also on the last meal album from snoop dogg, and it isnt a real great track..... so that doesnt say a lot for this album"
0,"Save your money This is a 6 x 4.5 x 0.5 inch book that is basically the federal rules with SOME objections. So far the description doesnt sound so bad right? But then throw in that this tiny little booklet is $35.00 bucks. If you buy this, and some of you will, you will be shocked at how tiny this book is with large print running you 35 bucks. I got a required book on the federal rules and a book on objections that total $70.00 and both on their own are worth more than this. Get something else if you can. The books I purchased instead of this are below.[...]"
0,"don't buy I got this for my 8 year old son because he loves hand held games. He played it the 1st day he got it, but it was difficult, involved alot of shaking. I also had to take it apart because he pressed the reset button & it stopped working at all. We put it away for awhile & the next time he tried to use it, no battles, no matter how much we shake, it is useless now. How can they make such junk?"
0,"Parents - Don't waste your money! Buy the GBA game I purchased the Red and Blue PETs for my son who loves the show. These toys don't work properly. My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6-10 to understand. If your child wants a PET, but the GBA game Red Sun / Blue Moon. There is a build it PET that works. Kids can battle each other."

0,ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!! i ordered this item for support being that i have a rather large chest. the item had MUCH more coverage than the picture lets on and came in the size i ordered according to the tag but once i had it on i realised it was 3 sizes too SMALL. when i returned it to the sender the refunded only HALF my money. this item was ordered with one more bra like it and out of my $40 order i got just over $20 back. i plan on disputing this with amazon and the seller.
0,"I did not like it. Messy I did not really care for this book. I found the plot messy and muddled, with many clumsy devices and scenes that felt forced (the climax, in particular, seemed very rushed, cinematically speaking). The characters, for the most part, were thin - and perhaps the author reached too far in casting the reference-net. I wanted to like it (I very much enjoyed Alan Moore's tales of the Extraordinary Gentlemen's League)... A very intriguing idea though (I give the acorn a golden prize but the oak grew sickly)... Maybe it is your thing; it was not mine."
0,"Too many names, too little interest. This book needs a grammar check. It is incomprehensible. I am trying to return it. It sucks, to coin a pun."
0,"This item is a total scam This ""book"" is only a pamphlet that is available online for FREE! I recently bought this for the length of the book (claims 264 pages) but it is not. I have recently had to deal with a close family friend suddenly dealing with schizophrenia and it has had a traumatic effect on his family and his friends. This is a serious illness that not only affects the person diagnosed but everyone surrounding them. The last thing anyone would want at this time is a book that claims to be something it is not!!"
0,"Cannot Recommend It This product has only one thing going for it. It's nice looking. Besides that, it's totally worthless. Cheaply made. Almost impossible to remove without either dropping it or having your fingers slip off of it which usually results in your fingernails scraping across the surface of your lens or lens filter. After 10 drops and 4 fingernail scrapes, I ordered the following product.Mennon Pro Center Pinch 67mm Snap-On Lens Cap with Leash. It's much better. Sturdily made, snaps off and on very easily, same price as the Canon. Only drawback - no nice Canon logo."
0,"NOT what I ordered! I would have liked to know that the cord in the picture was NOT the cord that I was ordering. Not only are the connectors NOT nickel-plated, like in the picture, even the shape of the connector is wrong and looks to be smaller than the one pictured as well.My rating is more for the distrust I'm feeling from this company rather than the product itself, as it does work... For now...My recommendation: Don't buy this product, at least not from this company. You never know what you're going to get."
0,I imagine if you get a working one this would be very useful. I had to rate this low because the one I received was broken or had some sort of short in the wire and didn't work. I'm pretty sure a working one would be very useful.
0,"cheap, but not worth the money This product does not fit tightly. It tends to fall out of the plugs it is attached to, both at the computer (the male end) and at the cable (female end). Complaint to the provider went unanswered. We will have to buy a replacement."
0,"Defective and more? I had 2 problems with the product. First the sound would cut out of one ear unless I played with the connection and second, using the extension caused the sound in my left and right headset piece to reverse (right sound came out of the left ear and vice versa). I have requested a refund and will not reorder if this is normal."
0,Stopped working after 2 months Ok while it lasted. However this cord stopped working after two months. Save your money -- this is junk.
0,"Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC), all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM.---Out of the box, if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension (fully connected in the female end) I only get sound out of the right ear bud. Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well. I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first ""click"" (not fully inserted), sound comes from both ear buds. There is tension with it connected in this fashion, so it works but could be better. Others may have better luck with other headphones."
0,"A New Translation This is a new translation (2006) of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. I hope someone qualified might soon comment on the merits or significance of this new translation. Meanwhile, the Editorial Review information offered for this book comes from an earlier edition of a different translation of Freud's work, FWIW. And the second paragraph in the editorial review prelim is entirely inappropriate--it's for another book altogether.I give Freud's book (not the translation) a low rating because it is misleading. It's not about the interpretation of dreams in general, but more specifically it's, covertly of course, about Freud's own dreams. More basically, it's about ""infantile memories"" he claimed dreams concealed. (For more explanation of this point, one could consult ""If Freud's Theory Be True..."" in Psychological Reports (1992, 70, 611-620), which would explain how Freud himself tells us his book is not about what it appears to be about."

0,"No Table of Contents Please be aware before you purchase this Kindle edition that it DOES NOT HAVE A TABLE OF CONTENTS. If you are reading this book for pleasure, starting at the beginning and proceeding directly, this may not be a problem. If, however, like me, you are using it for a course and/or in conjunction with a hard copy edition, this makes it virtually impossible to locate anything in the book or to navigate from chapter to chapter. You have to use successive approximations of the location number every time you want/need to change locations. Consequently, this Kindle edition is useless to me."
0,"translator confusion I have downloaded a sample of the penguin kindle edition, and while all the reviews refer to a new, and it would seem generally well regarded new translation by Joyce Crick, the actual listed translator of the ebook is J.A. Underwood.While this may be OK for the casual reader, this is not OK for someone approaching these texts in any kind of rigorous fashion.Whatever carelessness accounts for this error, it is enough to make me opt for a good old fashioned paperback instead.Fix it!"

Anyway, I found this camera at Walmart thinking it should be good for the $20 price tag they were asking. When I first opened this wannabe camera I noticed the buttons were very cheap. More than half the pictures taken were either blurry and/or yellowed. Don't bother trying to create a video with this thing unless you like a still frame video. I brought it back after I did some research and found the Logitech C310 Webcam for several dollars more here on Amazon(which has HD!). This is the worst camera i have EVER used. Live and learn, and never buy anything made by Vivitar. Shop around and spend a few extra dollars for a better camera. If not, you get what you pay for."

0,The Black Art of Xbox mods Good basic book on modding. The pictures are of good enough quality to make the verbage much clearer.

0,"Racist and stereotyped I got about halfway through this idiotic (and extremely poorly written) tripe. Whine, whine, whine. Take some responsibility for yourself. Bigoted, empty, hateful nonsense from a vacuous, race-baiting hack suffering a dearth of originality, an abundance of misguided vitriol, and an excess of hand-wringing and pouting disguised as legitimate literature."

0,"No Disrespect You talk about bigots! We have adopted 3 black children, 'tho we already have 5 biological. We are so darn happy that we have saved our 3 from the horable, unetical, imoral life that is epicted in this book. If that is how Sister has lived her life, we see absolutely no reason why she would brag about it. Also, while white students are worrying about their student loans, and wondering how in the world they will ever be able to pay them back, little or nothing was said about the African-American students concerns about their pay-back. Oh, yes, I forgot ""We Owe You""(?) Great that Sister Souljah is trying to help her ""brothers"" and ""sisters"", but maybe she should start with teaching them some morals, and maybe cleaning up her act while she is at it. Sister is a talanted writer. We hope that someday she will find something more uplifting to write about."
0,"Further proof that stupidity comes in all colors. Firstly, I find it startling that Vintage would deign to publish something so poorly written. The semi-literacy of this prose (I'm being generous) does, if nothing else, suggest that Miss Souljah didn't use a ghost writer. The words, in all their ghettofied glory, are hers. Booker T. Washington would have wept. While I can appreciate to some extent this woman's pathological disgust of whites, I cannot understand the roots of her homophobia or anti-Semitism. Her easy-way-out philosophy (Everybody's to Blame Except Me) is the very thing that keeps her where she is."
0,"Not the real deal We received our comforter, and it was not the dimensions advertised. We contacted the seller(Egyptian Cotton Factory Outlet Store) and the claimed manufacturer (Warm Things). The manufacturer responded quickly to tell us that this seller does not have access to their products. The seller has copied the language from the manufacturer's website and is selling fraudulent products in their name. If you care about the quality or dimensions of the comforter you're buying, don't buy from them."
0,"Sci-Fi Natural Law Here is a recent example of this author's online reasoning, which he proposes others should be governed by in a free republic:""Let us assume that two planets which have not yet been inhabited by humans are to be colonized by them; on Planet Alpha, heterosexual couples only are assigned; on Planet Beta, only homosexual couples. In one hundred years, will both islands be populated assuming that reproductive technologies are not available to either group? I suggest that Planet Alpha will be; but Planet Beta will not. Why? The basic answer is to be found in the biological complementarity of the heterosexual couple necessary for procreation that is absent in same-sex couple. This is a scientific argument...""As I suspected, Natural Law theorists are about as serious as Trekkies"
0,"Long winded. This video was dull and did not provide any information that I didn't already read in the books that I checked out from the public library for free. I'm fairly disappointed with my purchase and I feel that my money could have been better spent. I find the video rather pricey, but gave it a try because of a very enthusiastic recommendation from a friend. Needless to say, if you are the type of person who must have audio and visual to learn, steer clear of this and find an instructional video that's more concise. If you can learn through just reading, I highly suggest you just check out some books for free and save yourself some money. If you like long winded stories and have too much free time on your hands, this might be the video for you."

And, she really must hate women in labor, judging by the way she makes fun of them and mimics them with a whiney, high-pitched baby voice. Throughout the whole ""pushing"" section she talks about how much you will whine, and if you don't, just wait because you must not really be in labor yet. She goes on and on about how horrific the pain will be, but them she tries to talk you out of an epidural!! If she was my L&D nurse, I would cross my legs until the next shift change."

Do not buy this dvd! if you are curious check it out at the library.... she spends the 1st half an hour talking about how big babies and small pelvis are to blame for most of the problems in labor...... SO UNTRUE!!! I am a trained Doula and we should never blame babies or women's bodies for unexpected outcomes in labor. Birth is Normal.... Birth is Natural.....

0,The Worst Quality Blu-ray ever! I couldn't get through the first ten minutes because the quality was as if it was a DVD from the dollar store. The quality of this Blu-ray makes VHS look fabulous. I even wrote a letter to the company and got no response. I buy lots of Blu-rays and DVD's and I will NEVER buy one from this company again.
0,"Why an EP release of this film? While Troma treated this well regarded latter day Argento film reasonably well with its DVD release, and its initial $14.98 VHS release, anyone who is a fan of this talented director's visual virtuosity and deft use of color, camerawork, and scene composition should be aware that this new, reduced-price VHS version of The Stendhal Syndrome is in the inferior *EP* speed mode. I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality. Since the original, more expensive SP version of the tape appears to be in the process of being phased out by the less than artistic-oriented Troma, this is very unfortunate.Please, Troma, give us VHS buyers back a decent quality SP version of this film.And please, Amazon, do include a note in the technical information section when you do carry a VHS tape in EP mode."
0,"The blu-ray image is TERRIBLE! I wish I had read the negative and accurate reviews of the terrible quality of the blu-ray before I bought a copy. Apart from the Dirty Dozen blu-ray, this is the worst I have seen. I have not seen the DVD, but I can't imagine it is any worse than this blu-ray."

There are a few vendors that list this part number, but I also suspect this is a single-sourced inventory item. A lot of speculations, but what else are we supposed to do?[...]After one review that states the inaccuracy, AMAZON should have this rectified.There is not a valid excuse to keep a listing that is know to be inaccurate.That being said, the i410 is an excellent instrument.AMAZON is usually fair about inaccuracies when it comes to returns.

Yeah, if you're travelling you need this, but more importantly why can't Apple just sell the different adapaters individually? Apple must assume that a lot of people have more than one of their products - perhaps a macbook and an ipod, so wouldn't it make more sense to sell the adapters individually, that way one could buy for example two European adapaters, one for ipod and one for macbook? Another apple rip-off if you ask me."

You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE! That should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere. Not Recommended."

I am not a writer, but if I had the writing skills of Jean Auel, my review of Clan of the Cave Bear might look like this:""I eagerly awaited the rare opportunity to read the famous book by Jean Auel. As I anxiously read the exciting words on the white pages, I was constantly distracted by the desparate use of poorly-chosen adjectives. After reading two large paragraphs, I could easily tell that the large book was poorly written by a hopelessly unskilled amature.""Jean Auel had some great ideas for a story, but does not have the skills to tell it. The story might be interesting and well researched, but it is difficult to get past her awful prose which does nothing to paint a picture of a prehistoric time, and her amature use of adjectives is forever distracting from the story she's trying to tell.Please read the sample pages before buying this book. This is not a book for anyone who enjoys good writing."
0,"No plot, No Characters One of the worst novels I have ever read. Well researched - maybe, poorly written - definately. The plot simply goes nowhere, and the characters are so unrealistic and banal that it is impossible to feel sympathetic toward them.

0,"I Know I'm in the Minority Here, But... I'm so sorry to be such a spoilsport, but I found this is a terrible book and a worse series. Leaving aside all the wild inaccuracies - one of the main ones being Auel's portrayal of Neandertals as doltish brutes -the heroine is constantly making one earthshaking discovery after another - shampoo, domestication of animals, law of genetics, sex=pregnancy, and, last but not least, tampax. No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock. It became really maddening."

0,"Horrid! I really wanted to like this book. After a good friend suggested it I decided to give it a go. Big mistake. This book put me to sleep, literally. The description of the land and plant life goes on forever. Takes way to long to get to the plot and it's just not worth the time."

0,"poor quality backpack, don't buy... I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop. I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one, so I chose JanSport again. It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials, and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings, and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless, the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook. So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport. And the quality of my new bag is Much Much Much BETTER than this one.Don't buy this backpack!"

0,"Worst game I have ever played Wow. Fire Emblem is one horribly designed game. 75% of it is listening to the characters talk. And by talk I mean you see pictures of them on your screen with nothing but their mouths moving and eyes blinking and written below are what they have to say. It gets boring very quickly. On top of that the fighting is almost like playing chess, you move your characters around through squares on a board and you never get to actually attack any enemies. All you do is initiate the attack command and they show a little video of your targeted character hitting the enemy and maybe them hitting you back once. It's monotonous, cheap-looking, and not very fun at all. My advice to anyone considering buying this game is to rent it first. Then you can see for yourself how bad it is before wasting your money on, in my opinion, the worst gamecube game ever."

0,"pretty awful I'm an aviation buff and I'll accept a mediocre screenplay and poor character development if the flying is worthwhile. Sorry to say that this film falls short on all fronts (pun intended). The CGI flying scenes are very contrived, and are sadly inaccurate. The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as ""We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates"" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't. Don't waste your time with this one."
0,"completely disappointing I do enjoy historical war movies when they're done right. This clichÃ©-ridden story is pain to watch and I fell asleep several times during the second half. The movie is ridiculously predictable, although in a few scenes the writers still managed to surprise me - the private airlift flown by the main character in order to rescue French girlfriend with kids from advancing German troops, or taking out the villainous German ace pilot during the final dogfight with revolver (after machine gun jammed/broke) are few examples of the worst writing taste. To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars. Do yourself a favor, ignore this movie and watch Blue Max again instead."
0,"Terrible - I walked out of this movie When I heard Larry Ellison the world's second richest man was involved, I had to go see this movie. Expecting great things. ORACLE sized greatness. Instead don't be fooled by the 4,5 star ratings people give this movie. What a load of rubbish! I expected an action movie - great fights - true war. Not a romance set in a very serious war. The lead actor is terrible. Sorry they cast too young an actor. It wasn't interesting. The only interesting actor was the guy with the lion. The rest I can't even remember. All I will remember from this movie was the zepplin exploding and the funeral where they mention that the guy with the lion was an atheist and that he didn't care much about religion anyway. So that is it - a true waste of money. And these second rate actors and kiddie script writers are getting rich from hype."

By the time The Black Baron (whatever... ) got himself shot, a la ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the group was overcome by hysterical - albeit quite rude - comments and laughter.Haven't had that much fun since that stupid movie about the F16 pilot shot down over Bosnia.To think that such bravery, such envelope-pushing, such absolute horror has devolved into a depiction such as this.Jeez-Oh-Man, what'r they gonna do to the Battle of Britain?!?!?!?"
0,"Thank God for fast forward I asked the clerk at the video store how they determine the number of videos to buy for rentals. She told me it is based on the box office record of the film. She had 2 Flyboys. One would have been plenty.The story was sappy. The acting just so so. The aerial sequences were much like a video game. Try ""Flight Simulator"". WWI biplanes hanging on their props??? Climbing 90 degrees?? Landing a biplane in shell cratered ""no man's land"" in the heat of battle to save a buddy who has his hand (not his arm, his legs, his torso, but just his hand) trapped under the wing of his crashed plane?? That's realism??There wasn't much believable about this film. A third of the way through the movie I fast forwarded through all scenes except the dogfights. I was hoping for something on the order of ""The Blue Max"". ""Flyboys"" stalled on climb out, went into a flat spin, and augured deep into the depths of movie flops!"
0,"Flyboys Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong. The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right. Nevertheless, the film makers got a few details correct, but then added improbable special effects, far too many triplanes, annoying social lesson stereotypes, and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage. Conceptually, the movie should have been a winner. In execution, it is a disappointment. They ruined a potentially good story. Instead of buying this movie, I would suggest the Blue Max as the aerial scenes are far better, or just propose that the would-be viewer read a history book.As a parting comment, however, I always have liked Jean Reno. He is the good part of this film."
0,"Flyboys! Don't think so Aircraft physics [ cgi] are horrible. Planes don't fly that way. And the German guy is of course dressed in black and he's really bad. The hero becomes obsessed with getting even, and of course does. Most video games are superior to this sillyness. Total waste...."
0,"Predictable, cliched, mediocre acting.... Having been excited at the prospect of a gripping, historically accurate, realistic WWI film about the ""Lafayette Escadrille,"" Flyboys is a big letdown. Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous: aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film. More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister ""Black Falcon."" (!) Come on!Recommended: ""The Blue Max"""
0,"A $1 rental The plot of the movie ruins any thing they try to over come with the computer animation, and even that isn't as good as I expected."
0,"Painfully fake For a fan of the old wood and fabric fighters of WWI, this film causes nothing but heartburn. The CGI effects are painfully bad, so obviously fake that it hurts to watch. And the scenes where they use actual airplanes, or recreations, are just as bad. What really bugged me was the fighters with fixed radial engines, rather than the rotaries they should have had. Forget about this film, and just read ""Winged Victory"" for the story by somebody who lived it. If you want to see the real airplanes fly, go to Rhinebeck, NY."
0,A truly bad movie Considering the richness of the subject matter and the real life stories of those who lived it this was a truly bad movie. The makers tried to tell everything and as a result told nothing. The characters were unbelieveably superficial and too many of the flying scenes were historically inaccurate and unreal. If a few special effects are good too many are not necessarly better. The Blue Max and Battle of Britain are far far superior. For those who are willing to put up with a mess just to look at recreations of old airplanes its probably worth buying but be prepared for alot of dissapointment if you are looking for a good movie.
0,"Be Forwarned!!! I usually do not review films, but in this case I feel it neccessary. I have been a World War I aviation buff for many years. When I first heard that someone was making a film about this subject I knew that I had to see it. My disappointment when I finally saw the film can hardly be imagined. It's not just that they drag in every movie cliche thats ever been used in this type of story; there is literally not a single authentic detail or presentation of such detail in this film. The airplanes are wrong, the airplane paint jobs, markings. armaments are wrong. The clothes and uniforms are wrong, even the airfield that these guys are flying out of is wrong. It appears that the film makers, instead of researching information on life as a volunteer in the french air service of that period, opted for looking at old hollywood movies on this subject. Watch this film for whatever entertainment value it may have , but not to get an idea of what World War I aerial combat was like."

0,"Great movie, horrible DVD! Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced.

Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?!

0,"BORING SELF-INDULGENT DRIVEL As another woman who has actually reached the summit of Mt. Everest, I found this book to be nothing more than self-indulgent ""New Age"" drivel. Gammelgaard offers no insight into why the disaster happened and virtualy ignores the other climbers who were on Everest that day. The book has none of the gripping suspense of Into Thin Air and none of the factual reporting of The Climb. I'm happy Gammelgaard survived but she should turn her attentions to things other than writing. One of the worst books I've yet to read!"
0,"Don't bother! This book is a total waste of time to read. I couldn't wait to read it when I saw it on Amazon.com. But lucky for me I happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it. Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick. To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest, and the 1996 tragedy, and this is by far the worst. It will never compare with ""Into Thin Air"" or ""The Climb"". Also she has a style of writing that I have never seen before. She jumps from one thing to another, but I can guarantee you it will always be about herself, and how strong and great she is."
0,"Hey Lene, did you ever pay Mountain Madness? I haven't read this book but I've read Krakauer & Boukreev at least 7 times each. It is public knowledge that Lene G. did not pay Mountain Madness the full fee to be guided up the mountain. Ask Karen Dickenson. Maybe that's why Fischer's expedition had few (and inferior) radios. Hopefully LG paid Mountain Madness (after the fact) with the profits from her book. Otherwise she's just a user who used Fischer's good nature to sleaze her way into his expedition. Even if she paid, it's too late. I have zero respect for her. I would like to read her book but I won't buy it."
0,"Self aggrandizing psycho-babble, The book is poorly written with a lot of name dropping and gossipy insinuations. Into Thin Air, Climb, High Exposure are all better written and far more interesting. I think she figures if she refers to the ""mother goddess"" enough times she can pass the book off as feminist treatise. Lucky for Gammelgaard, she's a better climber than writer, or she'd be just be another fossil on the mountain. Don't waste your money."
0,"A Major disappointment Like several others who have reviewed this book, I found it a total waste of time. I was able to read the entire book in one day and I kept thinking, ""it's got to get better,"" but it never did. There is no sense of what drives this woman, no personal history in which to ""get to know her"" and certainly nothing is added to the Everest story, either historically or in the context of the '96 tragedy. I found it shallow and filled with exclamation points that made no point. While I certainly understand and accept the intuitive mind and its differences from a more analytical perspective, this book did little in the way of informing me about the mountain or the author. Instead it seems trite and superficial and filled with pithy statements and insinuations which discredit her perspective. I am, however, thrilled that she made the summit and returned safely and that it fulfilled a personal quest she had. I only wish she hadn't written so poorly about it."
0,"Self-indulgent drivel I purchased this book looking for a new perspective on the tragic Everest climb of May 1996. I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps in Denmark people were interested in how she, a female Dane, attempted and summitted Mt. Everest. However, the novelty, for any climber and for most everyone else, of a woman climbing Everest on a guided expedition is nonexistent. After hundreds of ascents of Everest, it approaches absurdity to have the author repeatedly mention that she will be the first Danish woman to summit.Those who like to read self-help books may enjoy her spin on the ""inner game"" of preparing for Everest, but I didn't."

They actually show him shaking and in a lot of fear, something that should not be shown to young toddlers. They don't understand why Elmo, their hero, is so afraid and it really upsets them. Why they had to take such a great idea and ruin it is beyond me. There are ways to teach safety without scaring someone to the point where they cannot hear what you are saying out of fear, which is what happens to Elmo in this video. Save your money - this one doesn't do the job."

The kill scenes were cheaply done CGI which looked terrible for the most part. It's a spoiler, but in the last attack scene of the movie the 'dream girl' literally bursts through a tree and a burned body to attack Simon/Stanley. My biggest problem with this movie is that I know Cripin Glover can do so much better. I'm sure he did the best with the script he was given, which wasn't much, but I'd have passed on this role. After seeing him in Rivers Edge and Willard it was almost painful to watch him play this character. I'm just glad I got this used for six bucks and not the twenty-five amazon is asking for it"

It's that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?"

Even the topics that I have a very good knowledge of (e.g. Duration, Convexity etc.) are written in such a disjointed fashion that I could not recognise them. The author uses symbols without describing them, the passages have no relevance to the examples which in turn cannot be connected to the solutions. It was a great disappointment. I wonder if anybody at GARP ever reviewed it before recommending it as a text for the FRM exam."
0,"Hope this book is not representative of GARP's credibility Is there anything less than 1 star? For the errors, this book is not a good value for your moneyI agree with other readers. Book is full of errors and irony is most of these errors are not corrected in the downloadable supplement - available on GARP web-site. Agreed the book covers everything within the Body of Knowledge for FRM exam, but many important issues / theories are mentioned / covered in the Handbook because they are part of syllabus but sufficient justice is not done to them. One definately gets this strong feeling that continuity is missing in certain parts of the book and they seem to be just product of simple copy / paste action.I strongly recommend GARP, Wiley Finance to correct the errors and replace current book with an error free version. Why should the readers pay for the errors? And please let the readers know what actions you are taking and when?"
0,"Do you rely on it for FRM exam preparation? As comparing with some other exam-oriented books for CFA and AICPA exam., it would be the most poor book I have read up to now. The book is poorly prepared and organized. While it is organized in according with the exam. structure, it is still difficult for the reader to follow. Most concepts have insufficient explanation. While some notations have not been clearly explained, some topics are explained (or jumped) very fast without proper elaboration. Some examples are even not supported by adequate reading before the examples and the explanation can only be found in the answers. Thus, it has made a chapter in pieces and then becomes difficult for the reader to memorize. I doubt why GARP recommend it to the candidates since 2000 and whether it is suitable and sufficient for exam. preparation purposes. I suggest some serious candidates may be required to refer to other textbooks and even myself has such planning."
0,"I Wish I Hadn't This book cost me the FRM last year. I made it the center of my study program.

When I finally realized my mistake, it was too late to rescue my study program, and I failed the exam. I am very disillusioned with Jorion and GARP. This shoddy, overpriced paperback makes me think they are in it just for the money. This year, I have signed up for the CFA exam instead. So far, I have been very impressed with their study materials."
0,"Redundant and Too Expensive This book is not on the FRM reading list. The author already has one book for the GARP exam, and this one covers all the same material in much the same manner.

No matter how many lives you have left, how many items you have collected no matter how far into the level you have gotten, they all get erased to zero and you get the distinct pleasure of having wasted your time.

0,"Not as good as Harry Potter, says I While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax. This book isn't as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion, and no one can refute me. Tastes are relative!"

0,"this is the worst book i have ever read!!!!*- 1984 is the worst book I have ever read. I would advise anyone who is thinking about reading this book to reconcider! George Orwell is not a bad writer, however, this book he does not do evry well on, as some of his others. Prehaps he was getting old and lost his touch. Animal Farm was okay, but 1984 was horrible. It took him forever, it seemed like, to get into the accual book. If someone were to take out all of the useless part of 1984, it would be half as long. Why would he wirte so much about nothing? I havent ever meet someone who could wirte such a boring book about the goverment. I have meet many people who have loved this book, but i dispised it. I am not at all intrested in the goverment. This may be part of the reason that I didnt like it. I would advise you not to read this book."

0,"1984 1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member or the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere he goes he is video taped by cameras of the so called ""Big Brother"" party. This books talks about Winston on how he thinks what the ""Big Brother"" does is unfair. I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Wiston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction. Overall it was a good book, but I don't think Iam ever going to want to read this book again."
0,"monotony Attempting to read this book is worse than watching the grass grow. At least the grass will become something you enjoy. The title and plotline of the story intrigued me to read it. Don't get me wrong, if well-written, this storyline could be very interesting. But even after just ten pages, the only thought going through my mind was ""When will this guy shut up and tell the story???"" The plot comes in a distant second to the narrator's monotone, seemingly unending monologue. If I could withstand this, I believe I would have enjoyed it. But forgive me for not having that kind of patience for hundreds of pages."
0,I think this book is horrible I have never read a bigger piece of garbage in my entire life. For the people who read and enjoyed this book...GET A LIFE!
0,"Big Brother is Watching! George Orwell's book 1984 is a wonderful book set in England's future if WW II never stopped. The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party. In the end it doesn't turn out how he expects it to be but was inevitable.The book was a great read and a good use of time. I personally think big brother is the man. Even though it was a school assignment to read it was great."
0,"George had a good idea but the book really stunk. At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. And please for the love of God don't read that ""Brave New World"" book by Hoxley. It is twice as worse as 1984. To put it bluntly, DON'T READ ANY GEORGE ORWELL. Your just waisting your time."
0,BORING This book had a good warning about futur totalitarian government but it was way too wordy. I had too much description and was really boring at the beginging that it took me a while to get through it. The love affair was discusting and the torture and Winston's viens were discusting and horrifying..Thats it

0,What to do to get Seaon 5 and 6 The rating is not for the show but for the delay. Why is it taking so long to get these seasons of one of the best TV shows of all time to DVD? What do we have to do? We want to all go about this in a legal way but it seems that we are being pushed to illegal means in order to obtain these shows. I'm sure I could get them from numerous vendors throughout Thailand. It would not surprise me if these two seasons are already available for download off the internet. But some of us want to spend our money legally. And thanks to Fox it seems like we may never be able to.
0,"A Real Disappointment This fan is a colossal waste of money - it's not worth the shipping cost, much less the purchase price. When the tent got hot, the poor performance of this fan was a real disappointment."

0,"Pointless Movie!! I was sold when I saw how many ratings this proclaimed 5 star movie it had received but to my disappointment, it was just a waste of time and money. If you really want to see a good movie about a piano or pianist with a good story to it then I recommend ""The Piano"".This movie was somewhat sickening and pointless. There was no real good story behind the movie. Just 2 puzzling demented sicko's who's only purpose was to make you vomit and throw that movie away. I'd like to give a synopsis about the movie but the truth is, is that there's really no good plot to talk about a synopsis.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You'll save time and money. Not all 5 star movies have earned their stars."
0,Movie sucks This movie was crap. It boasts of a journey of submission and tale of D/s. It is boring and merely a poorly filmed interpretation of the lustful quest for dominantion.
0,"Save your money. I am a big fan of foreign movies. When I read read the reviews listed here, I decided to see this movie before buying the DVD. Thank goodness. The storyline was terrible."
0,"one of the worst Cannes winners That movie was soooo boring. An old teacher living together with her mum, whom she hates, very blunt loud dialogues between them, why does an independent self supporting lady stay there at all, ridiculous..I was very, very disappointed of actress Huppert's role, it was not her fault, that she had so little to do or say, eg in that scene on the public toilet.E. Jelinek's story was either not transported or is it really so far away from real life, or sex, or even perverse perversion?I did not even try to find out, too much time spent on that already. Sorry."
0,"The Worst Movie Of All Time This is the number one worst movie I have ever seen. I usually love French films and enjoy the unprudish and free attitude in most of them, but this one went too far. I wanted to leave the theatre, but I was too transfixed in horror to move. I gagged, I winced, I covered my eyes, but still I couldn't move. After the torture was finally over I felt shellshocked and needed to go home and watch The Lion King to recover. It was a glimpse into the world of a sad, demented, and twisted character that I did not need to see. There was no point to this movie and I felt that it existed purely for shock value with no lesson, point or true plot. If you value your time do not watch this movie."
0,"Pretentious bore Ok. So Isabelle Huppert was brave in doing some of the things she does in this. So what?The movie is a pretentious bore which never grabs the viewer. It's just a series of nasty and kinky scenes which ultimately go nowhere. The Isabelle Huppert character is a psychopath, but incredibly she is an uninteresting one.A truly disappointing movie."
0,"Beware DVD-R copies This is the second time I have ordered a movie manufactured ""on demand"" in a DVD-R format from Amazon.com. My Sony DVD recorder/player is less than two years old. When I attempted to play each movie on the Sony, this message was displayed: ""Error. This disk cannot be played"". I have never had problems with movies that are manufactured directly by the studio so I assume that the middleman responsible for making these DVD-R copies is unreliable. Anyway, I am very disappointed."
0,"A Majority of One DVD-R movie If this was a professional DVD, it would not be made on a DVD-R disk. Instead it should be made on a dual layer DVD disk because it is over two hours. This DVD-R disk must therefore be less quality than standard play playback. Not good for High Definition flat screens, especially the larger size screens. By the way, this movie was broadcasted by Turner Classic Movies in letterboxed form. The TCM broadcast movie differed from the movie I had on prerecorded VHS tape. The TCM movie plot was better than what was on the VHS version. Also the TCM version was in widescreen and more sharp than the VHS version. The source of where this DVD version came from which you are selling is NOT provided and that is one more reason why I won't buy it. Sincerely, Rick Gershon.A Majority of One"
0,Delightful Short Animates Stories for Young Children This is a delightful set of four short stories about the magic of Christmas.Each short is animated in either vivid color or black and white. 30 min. total playing time. Each has its own personality and charm. The stories can be used for discussion about Christmas between parents or teachers and young children. There is freshness in each. Few opportunities exist to share a Christmas story classic that is very short and talk about it with young folks. Makes them excitingly aware of the famed comic figure Howdy Doody and animation in fun terms.I watched it from the viewpoint of both a young child and parent. Four **** for delight and colorful fun that often brings out the smiles in young silent children otherwise prone to remain quiet. At a low price too. Not worth the new VHS price.Four Stars.

0,"More like ""Tower of Feces""!!! This was a pretty damn boring movie. Thank god I did not buy it, for I would be rather angry at myself. Boring plot, boring actors, you can probably see where I'm going with this. They couldn't even throw any gore into the movie for at least something to watch. I guess that would have put them over budget. I will say that I thought the cover art looked pretty cool, which is why I rented it in the first place. So overall, I would not recommend this to anyone."
0,"Doesn't warm bottles Ever been in a car on a long distance trip with a cold bottle and a hungry baby? Let me tell you how obnoxious it is to have a bottle warmer that, even after 20 minutes, still has not heated that cold bottle. Don't buy this product."
0,"it is a joke this bottle warmer is just a joke. It takes forever to warm a cold bottle up. I say "" forever"", it is forever. When I checked the power, it is only 13W. If you do the math, you know the energy the warmer produces may take forever to reach the heat to warm a bottle up."
0,"NOT RECOMENDED DO NOT BUY THIS WARMER hi i bought this warmer for a vacation trip, i was really dissapointed, it wasnt even 3 minutes that i had it on for the first time and it started to get ON FIRE!!!! melted plastic all over the place smoke like crazy all around the car it is VERY UNSAFE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY DONT PUT YOUR BABY IN DANGER IF YOU HAVE THIS PLUGGED IN YOUR CAR, CUS THE WARMER MIGHT GET ON FIRE, MINE DID!!!! i hope this review helps you, i wont EVER buy this product EVER again."
0,"I'd pass on this one This bottle warmer seemed like a great idea--it was great to take the chill of a cold bottle. But the fact that it can start smoking and melt the bottle, like it did for me today, makes it not worth the convenience and dangerous. I'd seriously pass on this one!"
0,Cannot be used with Playtex Nurser Bottles I was very disappointed to get this product and find out that it cannot be used with Playtex Nurser bottles.
0,So HOT it caught on FIRE!!! Purchased this item and it caught on fire during its first use. I had it plugged in for about 3 minutes when my sons bottle and product caught on fire. I do not recommend this item. When I called the company they requested that I spend my own money to return the item and if they found that it was a mechanical failure they would replace the item only after I paid shipping. When I asked about my bottle they said their was nothing they could do about my loss. (Fire had caused the bottle lid to fuse to the bottom)This product is not worth a penny.
0,"Don't waste your money I purchased this in hopes of (like everyone else) having something that would warm a cold bottle in the car fairly quickly. This is NOT the product for the job! It takes forever, and actually makes the bottle too hot to handle without warming the milk much at all. The outside of the warmer gets way hot, too. Definitely a danger to you and children to touch. Luckily I have not had the problem some others have had with it melting my bottle, but I am not going to use it again to risk that!! In fact, I think the company needs to be notified so they will recall this product before someone gets hurt!!"
0,"Waste of money I bought this for our first long trip with the baby. It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk, so we couldn't just grab some hot water from a drive thru. It would have taken hours for her milk to get warm enough, and she is not that patient (neither are most babies, for that matter)."
0,"Cali iz inactive Dont get it twisted. I used to love Dogg Pound when they dropped their best work DOGG FOOD. But ever since then Kurupt changed his style around and Daz has been slacking on the production. The only standout tracks are CALI IZ ACTIVE and KEEP IT GANGSTA(featuring Lady Of Rage) where Lady of Rage delivers a verse that makes these female rappers we have out now sound like pigeons cooing. Its all hood(featuring Ice Cube) might have been a standout track if it wasnt for the weak beat and the even weaker rhymes coming from the Dogg Pound. Filler: Its craccin all night(who the f*** in their right mind makes a song with PeeDoody?)Heavyweights(more like lightweights), Slow your roll, Make that p***y pop, She likes that and the rest of this album. Bottom Line: One of the lowlights of 2006 without question. Bland production and sophomoric lyrics and pathetic guest appearances describe this album in a nutshell. Pick up the classic Dogg Food and stay away from this tragedy of an album."

0,"Pathetically bad! This is some of the worst trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. The language is overwrought, the plot far-fetched and shallow, and even the readers sounded embarrassed to be involved in the project. However, it did make me laugh out loud quite often. Maybe the book was better. For a good S&M story, try Alasdair Gray's ""Something Leather"""
0,"One of the worst books I've ever read.... I read the first two chapters of this book, and I have to say that the writing was horrible. I can't believe that I wasted my time reading that much of the book."
0,"What the heck is up with this cover? 'Herland' is hardly a cracking read, but it's interesting as a feminist-historical text. It's worth reading, but for the love of Mike get a different edition. This cover is utterly hideous and completely at odds with the ethos of the story. Why would a female-only society, where dress is utilitarian and reproduction asexual, tart themselves up in pink eyeshadow and mascara that would make even an overly-flamboyant drag queen quail?"
0,"The worst book ever written. Herland, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, tries to take the view of a world without man. The notion that the world would be one peaceful little place without man is absurd. Women as well as men, have competed against each other for centuries. It is ridiculous to assert that women would not fight amongst themselves. If it was at all possible to give this book zero stars, I would."
0,fahrenheit 451 the book has a good theme but it just dragged on. i did not like this book. montag is stupid to revolt in the first place he knows its the law and he knows what will happen to him if he does. Why did clarisse die there was no point to that just one day mildred said she was dead and montag was like oh ok it was lame and boring. i recomend this book to no one.
0,I HATE THIS BOOK I thought this was the worst book I ever read. There was no point and way to confusing. he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot! i hated reading this! stay away from this book!
0,"In My Opinion.... Fahrenheit 451 lists in my top 5 of worst books ever. my english class had to read it. i didnt even read the lastsection. by the time the first test rolled around, i hadnt even read 10 pages. i evenually forced myself to read it but stopped when i got to last section cause i thought if i read anymore, i might die. i felt no connection to the characters, no emotion towards them. Everything is drawed out way to much. when he could easly say something in a couple pages, he takes like 50 to tell one little minor thing. For me, its really boring and stupid. For u, many ur will like it. Maybe not. Cant no until u attempt to read it(NOTE: i said attempt)"
0,"The usual dreck I had to read this when I was in high school. So did my children. Now my GRANDCHILDREN have to read it! None of us has been able to discover WHY! Of all of the superb books I have read in my life, not ONE has ever been selected for required summer reading!"
0,this book was awful This book makes absolutely no sense at all. I read the first page and I didn't like it. I have to read it for school and I have fallen asleep 4 times reading it. All of my friends hate it to. We have a test on the 2nd day of 8th grade. Even using the Cliffs Notes didn't help at all. I don't recommend this book to anyone.
0,"Re: Is 451 degrees really the temp books burn at? If it is, then I will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces. The book proves one point to me: burning books and their society is much better than ours where Farenheit 451 can be published"
0,This book was really odd.......... This book was a hard read because I didn't find it interesting. It was really strange to me. I was required to read it for my English class. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because I personally did not enjoy it. I was confused as to what went on the entire way through.
0,"The Worst Book Ever! Fahrenheit 451 is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life. I was forced to read it in school, and I disguised the book starting at the first page. There is absolutely nothing good in the book. It makes no sense, and I personally don't think the world will become to be, as predicted in this book. I also find this book very offensive to my religious beliefs. How can a book that takes the name of the Lord in vain, in almost every page, be used as a class novel. Everyone knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is breaking one of God's commandments, and is a sin. I have never read a book that was as bad as Fahrenheit 451 in language. I don't understand how the school boards can justify such a book, and use it for classes. Anyone who hasn't read this book, don't waste your time!"
0,"Didn't Like it!! Confusing, disturbing, and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book. Firemen who start fires?? Come on. Burning every book that exists, this isn't a look into the future. It's a look into Bradbury's twisted little mind. Bottom Line.... Don't waste your time."
0,"CD Fahrenheit 451 I marked one star only because I cannot give it anything lower. I placed this order on Jan. 10. Time to get the order came and went. Here it is Feb. 7, and I still do not have the CD of Fahrenheit 451. Is this company located on the moon? Why is it taking SO long for my order to get here? I am MOST displeased. I will never order anything from this company CheapBks4U again. This service is atrocious."
0,"Not worth reading This book has been raved about as a classic SF story for many years now, so I decided it had to be worth reading. How wrong I was! As with many so called ""brilliant classics"" the author gets a novel idea and then tries to run with it. Unfortunately, the story fizzles out completely towards the end and the full impact of the original message dies with it. I was very disappointed with this book and wonder how people rate books like this so highly. Don't bother reading it!"
0,"Fahrenheit 451....It sets a new record in boredom. After reading it for a school project I would avise anyone reading these reviews to stay clear of it unless your eighty and you want waste your last few months of your life. Pointless, which school teachers of little old scotland make you read. If we have to burn books I put this one up to get burned straight away."
0,"It Deserves Negative Stars! Last year we had to read this as a class. There were two books our teacher made us read that I hate with a passion this is one of them. I could not stand the way Bradbury writes most authors would say the pit pat of rain he would say the pit pat pit pat pit pat and so on for half a page it was royally annoying and as far as what the guy said about it being about individuality and conformity if you want to read about that read Ayn Rand's Anthem. It is much better, and deserves its status as a classic unlike this one."
0,"Hardly even deserves 1 star This is definitely one of the WORST books I have ever come across. In the modern version, there is a forword and an introduction. Both of them have nothing to do with the story, and Ray Bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that NO ONE CARES ABOUT! I almost fell asleep during the forword, I dont know how I survived the book. The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace. As for Ray Bradbury himself, he states in the introduction that in his eyes, Hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book. I think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity. Great guy, eh?"
0,"Horrible execution of an addressable topic... This book is quite possibly the worst piece of science fiction I have read... It is dramatically boring and far too contrived to be interesting... The world Bradbury creates is thoroughly dry and I simply hated his look at the future... Nothing was at all interesting or thought-provoking, except for the books examination into the issues of censorship as a whole. I like fantastically created worlds and futures, but when they're dry and brittle like this, you simply long for the pages of the book itself to burn bitterly...."
0,"How else would you like to WASTE MY TIME? To put it simply: this book sucked. Although this is a very juvenile way of putting it, it fits perfectly. This book was so boring, that all the description Bradbury puts in couldn't possibly describe how slowly it moves. If Bradbury wanted us to realize the importance of books, the LEAST he could do was make this book SEMI-interesting! Essentially: Don't waste your time."
0,"Not worth it I had to read this book for school. I, personally, don't care for any type of science fiction, so that could play a part in my rating, but it was very confusing and not worth my time. The book is about Guy Montag who is a fireman from three or four hundred years in the future where firemen cause fires instead of putting them out. The book mentions people Montag meets and is friends with and about his failing relationship with his wife. There are many 'futuristic' objects in this book which keeps you thinking and confused. The book ends in a chase which was by far the best part. If you don't enjoy science fiction, I do not recommend this book for you. I only read it because it was required of me."
0,"HATED IT! I really did not like this book! Now, don't get me wrong the idea was good, but the writing was horrible. I normally like Ray Bradbury's work, too. The writing style was very repetitive and boring. I think that this is one of those books that could have been great if written differently."
0,Confusing who ever wrote this dumb confusing book is in a mental state of mind! Fahrenheit 451 is a overworded description of a fireman who lives on rebellion! It is a bad influence on the young people of the world. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNED!
0,"A good idea gone horribly wrong! At first I thought that Fahrenheit 451 sounded very interesting, and I was glad to see that my 10th grade teachers had assigned the reading of it. By page 3 of the novel, however, I knew this was not a book I would enjoy. While it's a frightening, though thought-provoking look at the way society could become, it was extremely badly written. Bradbury goes on and on for pages of nonsense, and his words leave you with no more enlightenment than you had 50 pages ago. He uses redundant adjectives, and pointless sentences. I was especially annoyed when he would go ""inside"" Mr. Montag's thoughts and repeat the same meaningless phrases over and over again. I wouldn't recommend this book to a single person, and my condolances to any other student forced to waste their time on this. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the few books I would gladly toss in the fire."
0,"How ironic - text to speech (tts) not enabled How ironic that a book about limiting access to books is NOT text-to-speech enabled.

He will not buy audio books so the publisher makes no sale at all. He bought his Kindle for the express purpose of being able to read books through the text-to-speech function. Unfortunately, too many books have this feature disabled - often through Simon & Schuster. It is especially ironic that the publisher would limit the blind community's access through Kindle TTS when this book centers around removing access to books. Everyone loses."
0,"huge disappointment at 180 pages i realized that i was one-quarter through the story and not even slightly interested in continuing. so i visited amazon ans clicked on the one-star reviews to see if their frustration was my frustration. if i finish it, it will be because i force myself. just before this book, i finished ""on writing"" by stephen king who points out [i almost wrote emphatically]: don't use adverbs ever. and if sparingly. Fahrenheit 451 is crammed full of ""he said softly"" and ""she said slowly."" my review: timewaster."
0,"Too bad Amazon can't help out students I am admitting this review does not relate to the actual book but to Amazon so with apologies to Ray Bradbury...Ten bucks? Really? Come on Amazon, you know this book is on a lot of school reading lists. My kid loves her Kindle but when I can buy her school reading book lists for $2 at the used book store, you lost. In fact, it is a weird circle of irony - we used to buy books, they got too expensive, bought the kindle, it was great, then you made the books expensive again and... now we buy the books. You lost an opportunity here, Amazon. For the record, she hasnt picked up her Kindle in a month.Too bad for you."

0,"Painful listening Ray Bradbury was a fantastic WRITER. I wish he would have stuck to his strengths. Choosing to read this book himself for the audio recording was a tremendous mistake. His speech is, at times, nearly unintelligable (He was over 80 years old at its recording). What should have been a wonderful audio book ended up being a complete chore to listen to. Writers of films know enough to cast proffesionals to act-out their visions. Writers should be no different. Do yourself a favor, read the book yourself."
0,The Worst book I have ever read!!!! This book was horribly written!! It confused more than it enlightened!!! I did not enjoy it at all and I never plan to read it again.
0,Wrong book sent! I ordered a book for my grandson's school summer reading program. The book was supposed to be Fahrenheit 451 and I received a totally different book. I returned the book and by the time another book could be sent would be too late.I probably will not order from this site again.
0,"Terrible, Terrible Book! Bradbury is a good writer (I'll give him that), but I HATE his writing style. He starts making huge long mini-stories within the main story that has no point and is useless. He could have written this book in 50 less pages, and it might've gotten 2 stars. I think this is a terrible book, no offense to anyone who likes it."
0,Painful to listen to Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read but deadly to listen to on the CD. Ray Bradbury reads in expressionless monotony. I tried to listen to the first CD five times and finally gave up. Stick with the book where you can supply your own voices.
0,"BURN THIS BOOK! Hey A reader from MISSOURI, I hear you. This book makes no sense what so ever and i had to read it for school. I have no idesa just how in the world a book this horrible could have stayed around for 40 years!!! I have talked to everyone I know and they all read the first 5 pages and immeadiatly hated it. THey rented the movie and watched some of it so they won't have to read it, and it was verbatum, and guess what...it was even worse than the book! I do reccomend this book to all of you...well only if you want to find out how terrible books can get or you want to find out what type of flammable liquid burns better on books!"

0,"Burn it! I'm no advocate of book burning, but burn this book! It was terribly disappointing--lots of hype over a cheesy science-fiction novel. There are two major problems with it. One is poor language usage--lousy descriptive word choices, lousy metaphors and similes that make inappropriate comparisons--and two, not enough attention paid to societal problems that give rise to things like book burning in the first place: the threat of the individual to the group; government control over the sheep-like masses; the modern epidemic of people's lack of interest in anything intellectual; the timeless epidemic of a fear of anything that goes against group mentality or upsets the status quo, and so on. Bradbury touches on some of these issues, but leaves them largely undeveloped."

If this is reality--the reality of L.A. or anywhere, I want no part of it. In my experience, people from most classes have some kind of spark or charm. This is a film that mistakes vileness and vapid, blank suffering for profundity or realism.Watch them suffer! On second thought, don't! The most unappealing group of people I've ever fast-forwarded through in recent memory--even worse than The Hawk is Dying.I like dark films--but this is just rub yer nose in it vile and stupid.Avoid at all costs!

0,"advertised as OEM?? I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Clearly all 3 products are china knockoffs according to the counterfit guide that one finds on other motorola product pages, but conveniently left off this one. I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for. The battery however (also clearly a knockoff) held less of a charge than the one it was replacing. I asked for a replacement(OEM as advertised this time Please!) and another knockoff was sent. Im disappointed in AMAZON for this. I was told to return anything I was unhappy with. Ill lose out on shipping both ways.one star because it worked, and they lied.Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook: Motorola, Inc."

0,"Boring As a longtime deer-lover, years ago I found a copy of this DVD at my local supermarket and bought it, thinking that I would probably love it. However, I was wrong. This is just another one of those boring movies featuring adorable animals that serve as the highlight of the entire film, but eventually over time their endearing qualities gradually start to recede in your opinion, leaving you to mindlessly sit through the remainder of the film. Not only that, but the fawn barely appears in the second episode on this DVD (only two cartoons are featured), and the cartoons are so old that you can hardly understand a word that anybody is saying."
0,"way to make the worst game of all time Thanks to the people at Vivendi Universal for making quite possibly one of the most horribly boring/glitchy/... games of my life. How could you take such a good story, and turn it into the most rotten expierence of my life. Was this game test played EVER before its release? Obviously not.... Let me list the pros and cons:pros:*now cons:-combat is few and far between and when it comes about it usually takes 45 minutes for the enemy to run at you, attack, then run back to its spot (awesome)-not only can your character go of the screen and get stuck, other NPC can do the same! (real sick)-equipping and sharing items only takes about 400 years of your life, forget about all your goals and dreams. This is way better.-the dialouge (like the game itself) seems to be written by children-the games ends in the mines because of a horrible bug in this awfuly designed game.I hope this review sways you from even playing this game..."
0,Horrific ATTENTION!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I REAPEAT!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS BUGGY AND NO FUN WHAT-SO-EVER.THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
0,"Slow, buggy, and awful I had high hopes for this game since I'm a big Tolkien fan and really like good GBA RPGs. Boy, was I disappointed! First off the game is horribly slow. Combat takes forever, and is boring since your character miss all the time. You'll spend hours walking around looking for mundane items like flowers or Pippen.Add to that fact that the game is horribly buggy. Gimli turns invisible in one quest, sometimes the elves don't give you items you need, and I've yet to meet anyone online who found a way out of Moria without the game crashing.Don't buy this waste of a game. Save your money and either wait for one of the other Lord of the Rings games coming out this Christmas (The Two Towers) or buy Golden Sun or Castlevania instead. This is a prime example of a great license going to waste."
0,"A Slow Game with Terrible Glitches This game is more based on the book then any other lotr game. But the battles are terribly slow, some items don't work, things that the game promised are taken out, the graphics are awful, and there are some terrible glitches in the game, especially the Moria Glitch which made me go out buy another one (I thought the first one was a defect) and go through the same glitch again. Even if you are a huge lotr fan you should probably stay away from this game."
0,"disappointed I am a huge fan of Tolkein books and lord of the rings especially. This was actually a pretty fun game for a while, I can't complain, I bought it in a bargain bin for $5 bucks, and I was thinking ""What am I going to lose?"" I lost 5 bucks and I want it back. I liked how it had aspects of the books instead of the movies in them, like Tom Bombadil and such. I would have more stars for it (1, mayyybe 2) if I didn't get stuck in Rivendell. I think I got Gimili's axe a step ahead of when I was supposed to and when I talk to him he says he needs it. Game over. There is nothing I can do to progress. And what really sucks is that I saved it before I knew that I was stuck. So its either spend another 3-5 hours replaying it and getting back to that part to progress, or quitting. I think I'll just quit and maybe sell it for a buck on Amazon."
0,"Might be okay, but glitches are doozies. I could have made it through this game several x by now, but the glitches stuck me in trees in caves over drop-offs, etc., numerous times. I'm done... didn't even bother to finish and I was well past Morea. Someone said the ending sucks, so what am I missing anyhoo? I'll try the other two, heard they were better. I'm glad I logged on here to see the reviews (that perfectly match mine) or I might have gone out to buy another copy... thought this cartridge had been flushed and just stamped on the grahics glitches were so bad! But no they say, this game just stinks. Don't waste your money, borrow this one from a friend at the most and see what everyone means. Does not deserve the one point I had to give it."

0,"Horrible Game This game is boring. You can't follow the story line, and if I hadn't read the books I would not understand it at all. The fight scenes take too long and they are also boring. In the mines of Moria there is this one place where you have to go but you get stuck because the game has a bug. The controls are extremely weird and take a long time to get used to. I have bought this game and I do not like it. I would suggest not buying it."
0,"The Buggiest Game I've ever seen Is this the same GBA ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings"" that was produced by Vivendi? Now it is said to be by ""Jack of All Games"". If this is the same cartrige, and it looks identical, this is the buggiest game I've ever seen. I have never even been able to get out of Rivendell, because Bilbo won't drop Sting, the Elves won't drop Gimli's Axe, and Gimli doesn't show up at the exit to get his axe. Unless these things happen you cannot leave Rivendel. I have played through to Rivendell twice, and it just gets stuck there. There are numerous other bugs as well, the game freezes in the house where you fight spiders, and when you enter the mines of Moria, although I have never even gotten that far. This would be a good game, if it worked. But it does not."
0,"AVOID THIS GAME!!! I was shocked to find so many glitches in this game! Give me a break; shouldn't products like this be tested and retested? I am not even talking about the silly and useless actions I was forced to take to make certain events happen, I am talking about outright glitches! I totally gave up when I got stuck in Rivendell. I can't leave the place; the elves won't give me an item I need and there is nothing I can do except start over from the beginning. Forget that! I started Two Towers; it's much less boring and inane, and so far, no glitches."
0,"Sorry, try again This ""book"" (40 pages, including the back cover as a page!) is very close to completely useless. Poorly organized, it does give some useful information, but it rarely puts it in a useful context. The very few drawings are of poor quality and tiny to boot!

At $14.95 it is not worth the money."

0,"Big let down from ATI - All in Wonder Radeon 8500DV Been in the computer industry for many years. Trusted ATI in the past, but this card is the worst thing I have ever had to try and install. I spent over 12 hours trying to install this card and make it work. Currently I have been able to get my system back to where it was prior to attempting this installation. If I could only get it to keep from locking up I would be there. To the writers of the latest code for this card, you shoud be hung from the highest tree. I had had high hopes for the functionality of this card, but with this recent adventure, I will never buy anything from ATI again. In summary, I think a perfect acronym for this card is POS, use your imagination!"
0,"DON'T GET THIS! OK, amazon.com is completely wrong. It says this card is worth [$$$] give or take five cents. The new one, supposedly comming out in August or September, is much better, and is going to be at a retail price of [$$$]. Itis MUCH better, and definately worth the wait. HOWEVER, if you must buy a new graphics card now, you should get the NVIDIA ti 4600 by VISION TREK. Not, by PNY, their customer service is very bad, even though they give a very good warranty. (Even read other reviews about PNY consumers). The NVidia 4600 is much better than the ATI 8500, however again, when the ATI 9700 comes out, that will take the crown. Until than, the NVidia 4600 is proudly wearing it."
0,"Be aware of ATI products I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great. I have quite extensive experience with PCs (I have put together over 100 of them) and it took me 6 hours to make this card work. I would give it more stars but..... First of all, when I bought it, it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included. Well it wasn't, instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I wasn't able make it work. Secondly, when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers. I would call them but they charge you over [X] a minute for support. So the bottom line don't count on any support from ATI."
0,"Bad product. Horrible drivers I purchased this product to upgrade my old all-in-wonder card. I love ATI for their wonderfully multi-functional cards but they really need to do a better job of writing software for them. I tried to install this card on Windows 2000 with all the latest drivers and with the exact instructions (after reading another review here) for each driver. The end result was video with vertical lines on both the DVD player and the TV software. Spent 4 more days trying to fix the problem but just gave up in the end and went back to my old ATI card. I might try the Radeon 7500 in the near future (since I suspect that the ""DV"" output of the card had something to do with my problems)."

Dont waste money for the worst game I've ever played."
0,"12 games for 9 bucks Yep thats right 12 games for 9 Bucks. No kidding. Yeah. But the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is the fact that yeah you get all of those games but you get 2 repeats (galaga, gal Im not saying i dont like the game (considering that i bought it solely for the galaga & ms pac man) but it should be more of a selection than just having all the galaga's Some might disagree with me but oh well. The fact that it has all these old original arcade titles loves it. It would be better with a regular tv rather than a wide screen, as all the games are narrow. Funplay its like being in the arcade all over again, difficulity- that digout game is the only one that i am having trouble with! and graphics (who cares) Your playing your favorite titles which is why you bought it so dont cry for mommy if its not in HD!For the money you cant go wrong"

0,"an unusual writing technique Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus, ""Ulysses,"" did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in 1922.Thus it was that the artist, while composing his next work, ""Finnegan's Wake,"" got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys, a poignant expression, obviously, of the searing torment boiling within him.Happily for us, the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume."
0,"Gibberish! ""Out door, keel cooling vorsnevou."" You could add this sentence to this mass of drivel and no one would know it wasn't written by Joyce. If the point of this book is the utter incomprehensibility of mankind, Joyce greatly contributes to it with this rambling waste of paper. A monkey and a typewriter could have written this ""experimental"" trash. I cannot see any way in which this ""work"" is a classic. It is stream of conscience gibberish. Anyone could have done it."
0,"Ridiculously Bad I am a fan of Joyce's writing especially Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, but this is pure garbage. Thank goodness for the look inside features at amazon, so that people will be able to know what to expect when ordering Finnegans Wake. The novel has no plot and lacks the vivid descriptions of seemingly meaningless things that made Joyce's other novels so great. Here, he picks random foreign words and places them wherever he please just to make his book seem original and artistic. The result is an incomprehensible piece of garbage that is not only plotless but devoid of any writing ability and talent.Use the look inside features to see what I'm talking about."
0,"An Udder Disaster The cow who dried up was an udder disaster....like this gibberish novel. Even JJ's best friends and critics called it drivel (his brother included). I guess after writing Ulysses, JJ felt somehow had to create something more mystic. Well, he certainly succeeded. I have a standing $1,000 bet with anyone and the challenge is that I will open 3 random pages of FW and have the reader explain, in detail, who the parties are, what the sentences are about and mean. I am quite confident than there is no one out there who can do that. Period. So much for a memorable reading experience."

0,"this is bad This book is bad, and I think it was intended to be so. Probably upset with the over analysis of Ulysses, Joyce must have set out to play a trick on the literary world.

0,"WTF is this?! Real words, unlike what you'd find in this book, cannot describe what you find in here. This book is the bane of my existence. James Joyce must have self-inflicted mercury poisoning in order to write this. The only other plausible explanation is that he became severely mentally retarded from a lack of flow of oxygen to the brain. If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY ""sentence"". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of. If the author came back to life, became unretarded, and then read his own book again, he would instantly want to drown himself in Lake Michigan.

0,"I do not like Finnegans Wake I think it's rather dumb to write a book for the purpose of making it difficult to read.

Installation was easy in my Dell 8100 system, but there is only one vga plug on the card, the other is DVI. Great if you have a LCD, but otherwise you must use an expensive adapter...

0,"A Disservice to Martial This is a very poor translation. Martial is a lively, urbane poet with a razor-sharp wit; his language is precise and powerful. James Michie's translation is insipid as poetry, and often unrecognizable when set next to the Latin. A single example: Mr. Michie has a penchant for translating simple Latin words like ""terra"" into configurations like ""turf and dew,"" rather than the obvious and elegantly simple ""earth."" In Michie's translation, Martial's more beautiful elegiac lyrics are made gaudy and his urban bullets of observation become flaccid. Get the Loeb Martial and a good dictionary and work through the epigrams yourself. You will be better served by Loeb's literal translation than something that sounds as if it were written by a mediocre pre-Raphaelite poet."

My dog obviously didn't like it and tried to paw it off but as long as I kept moving he only occasionally pawed it and didn't pull. He usually pulls nearly constantly despite my efforts. However half way through my second walk my 23 pound dog stopped to sniff something. I kept going and the strap that goes around his nose broke. Don't waste your money.
0,Sizing instructions are off The Halti must be correctly sized - and unfortunately the sizing info to determine the correct size is poor. The Holt sizing chart is based on breeds - and didn't work for my mutt. Way too big. Why don't they provide the sizing info based on the circumference of the muzzle and neck?
0,"Not good for small dogs like lhasas This is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware! Because of their flatter facial structures, the collar slips off and won't hold as it should. And speaking from experience, the size is not the issue i.e. even a small size won't work."

The producers of this franchise know they have a great fan base, but now after several years of making an intelligent and entertaining sci-fi series I think they've given in to intellectual laziness. If ""Continuum"" is the new standard of what we (the fans) can expect to see in the future from this franchise, then they should just stop making these films now. The plot to ""Continuum"" is silly, the narrative (the story and how it is told) is completely bland and devoid of life. It was as though all these characters we have come to know, suddenly had their souls written out of the script."
0,Not satisfied I purchased Stargate continium and when I received it they sent me Steel magnolias instead I have contacted the company 3 times anf=d after 3 weeks I have heard nothing I will not purchasing anything through Amazon again or its partners
0,"Not Good Too Expensive. 5- 1/2 cups are not true, you can barely make 3.5 cups. Every time you cook, you need to clean outlet also, that sucks. I don't recommend this product. You can do better with 1/3 rd of money what you spend on this product."
0,You cannot make sushi with rice made from this rice cooker. The quality of rice is inadequate to satisfy anyone who likes sushi. I am really surprised that Sanyo makes such bad quality product. I returned the product.
0,one time cooker This rice cooker is good for one time cooking. The rice does not last more than 12 hours. I usually leave my rice for 4 days so that I do not have to keep cooking it (lazy). I returned it and bought Cukoo rice cooker (made in Korea). The rice lasts for 4 days without changing color or get old. Cukoo is more expensive but it will last for years.
0,"Don't like this at all... I bought this because it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated and I've had excellent results from most of their recommendations. Not so with this one. I have major issues with the unit's cleanability. The lid is hinged and is not removable for easy cleaning. The inside of the lid had a scale on it after cooking and I was hesitant to clean it thoroughly because it seemed to be something of a mystery substance and I was afraid that I would scratch it. There is a trough that catches condensation and is also difficult to clean. Likewise with the extremely flimsy gasket. The unit took longer to clean properly than it did to make the rice, and I prefer the old Aroma rice cooker that I bought this to replace."
0,"non-stick coating peel off after 6 month I don't like this rice cooker because the inner pot's non-stick coating peel off after 6 month, and there's no way to replace it. My last Panasonic rice cooker's non-stick coating lasted 5 years."
0,"ok, while it lasted.... It was ok, unless I left it on warm and the rice caked onto the bottom terribly. However, it stopped working after 4 months of use. Not sure what happened...."
0,"Broke! This worked well for about 4 months and then broke. Its mechanism turns to ""warm"" now way before the rice is done. When I called the company to ask about service or an exchange, I got someone one time. I had to call back with more information from the receipt and I have never been able to get a hold of someone since then. I have called about 8 other times. It is not worth my time to keep trying to get a hold of someone, pay to send it to a service person, etc. Since this item is well reviewed in Cook's Illustrated, I am debating buying another and crossing my fingers..."
0,"Three words: empty, repetitive and boring I know all opinions are subjective but I do not undertsand what you could find interesting in this movie. The love story is stereotyped. The boyfriend is an idiot (which makes the girl an even more idiot), the soundtrack is exhausting and the plot is non existing. In this type of movie there is MUCH better which has been done. Please....."
0,"What a waste! ""What a waste of money! "" These words demonstrate my exact reaction after watching this movie which I have regrettably purchased on DVD. Excited to have a new DVD player, I bought this DVD after reading the many great reviews about the movie. Now I'm extremely puzzled. Why so much praise for this flick? It is anything but interesting: the story is childish and shallow and the much talked about cinematography and the music are nothing more than cheap attempts to decorate the silly plot. For those of you who want to buy the movie, rent it first! If you are not a fad-driven kid who actually thinks MTV is a music television and Jewel a poet, then you'll surely dislike it. There are no philosophical ideas here. The mere fact that this movie is considered to be ""thought provoking"" may be a testament to the reality that perhaps we are not thinking much."
0,"Run Lola, Run Lola, run Lola and again run Lola I did not get it. She is just running and running and again running. No philosophical idea. No point. The movie is telling us the same story in three different versions. Why? Boring..."
0,"she never stops running ok, so u want to know what a bad film is like. yea well dnt watch this one cause u will just fall asleep and still not know the film is about her running and runninga and running and running and u get the picture"
0,"Run Money Run! This is one movie where the title makes as much sense as the content. I gave it one star, although Franka deserves five stars for fitness."
0,"One word: TRIPE I see a lot of glowing reviews for this movie and I just don't get it. It's not ""deep"", ingenious, brilliant, or anything else that I've heard it called. Anyone who thinks this movie is thought provoking probably thinks Barney the dinosaur is a great philospher (seriously, get an education). This is a gimmicky, kitchy film that is a combination of concepts that have all been used before. The funny part is that they weren't great concepts the first time I saw them in other films. But hey, nothing suceeds like excess...so lets bring it all together and make a really really bad movie!"
0,"HORRIBLE This movie doesn't even deserve one star. The script was horribly written, and they kept on playing the SAME thing over and over and over again. Little parts changed while they replayed it, but I knew I couldn't stand to watch ANOTHER rerun again. I had to watch this movie for German and I'm certainly not watching it again."
0,"""I don't get it"" ""Nothing thought provoking"" ""Nothing Philosophical"" I give this film 5 stars. This and The Princess and the Warrior are in my top 10 all time favorites.This is less a review than advice to those that may be influenced by the 1 star reviews. The reviewers all tried really hard to sound intelligent while at the same time admitting that they ""don't get it"" and claim that there was nothing thought provoking.They say that it was just the same thing three times showing three possible results. These reviewers said it themselves- they didn't get it.During the movie the song What a Difference a Day Makes is played both to create atmosphere and to send a message. One of the main points of the movie is to show what a difference precious seconds can make..Cheers.P.S.Hopefully this sheds some light for the 1 star reviewers as well, but I doubt it."
0,"This single is bad Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Deeper Underground (Chillington Mix) tries to have a more darker sort of industrial sound which sounds pretty mushy and terrible, as the vocals do not fit in one bit with the music.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
0,"IS NOT CAPABLE WITH WINDOWS XP. You probably read towards the bottom of the description that it works with XP, and you'll even read it on the BACK OF THE PACKAGE, but it's not true. compaq still has no drivers for XP to recognize the PA-2, so if you have XP you'd better get a different mp3 player."
0,no blow I bought this because 2 other 12 volt ocilating fans I've had did not ocilate. This one seems to reliably ocilate but even though it spins the blade it does not seem to move the air. jUNK DON'T BUY
0,"THIS ITEM DESCRIPTION IS VERY MISLEADING !!!! This calendar begins with August 2005 and ends with July 2006! My son bought this for me for Christmas and was very dissapointed when I opened it and found out it was 'halfway used up' already. He felt very cheated and I felt very sorry for him. I think it is absolutely terrible that the item is not described truthfully. Shame, shame, shame on you! I wish I could give this item a negative number of stars!!!"
0,"waste of money This book is a complete waste of money. It contains no information that a reasonably intelligent man (or woman) couldn't easily figure out on his or her own, or discover on internet dating sites for free. The authors are believers in astrology, and devote a substantial chunk of the book to providing astrological information. As you can probably tell, I do not believe in astrology, but despite that, the astrological information in the book would also be very quickly available at no cost to any minimally proficient Google user."
0,"AWFUL, the Worst, cut and paste crap...with horoscopes? This brief 100 pages book wastes 25 pages on horoscopes, zodiac signs, what your sign says about you, what signs mean in women, what signs you should date. What do ancient superstitions have to do with the Internet and why does it consume 1/4 of the book? The remainder of the book dispenses fairly obvious advice like woman types: ""some women are after money"" and ""if you marry a women with children, you will be a step father"" duh! Also a chapter on how to date when you are already Married, nice. This book mentions NOTHING AT ALL about the Internet. They just slapped Internet on the title to peddle an existing book on dating, except that it is useless as a general dating book as well! I got this at the library so I didn't pay for it, but I still feel like I was CHEATED, out of the hour of my life I wasted reading this garbage. The worst, avoid at all costs, even for free at the library. Horoscopes! Gawd."
0,"Not reader worthy I bought this to review it for content and usability, I can't believer what I read. This book has nothing useful in it! It don't tell you anything about what to say or even how to figure out what type of woman you want let alone how to get her to respond to you. It's just full of useless information like horoscopes I culdn't believe it, it even had the chinese horoscope taken off of some menu in a restaurant! This book doesn't do anything buy take your money and waste a tree."
0,"Just another excuse to make money I am sorry but after reading this book, I have to admit that the feminists are right. Men are pigs and the only reason this book was written was for the authors to make money.The book tries to justify its existance by saying it is designed to help you find the love of your life on the internet. It actually only helps you find the love of your night. If I had actually used any of the tips in the book, I would have had alot of sex but I doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible. In fact I doubt anyone using this tips would find their ultimate mate, it would be inspite of the tips not because of them.An entire chapter is devoted to sterotyping women, though the authors do try to explain most women do not meet these types, then the list over 10 to watch out for.I am glad I did not actually pay for this, I would have demanded my money back."
0,Gossip Girl Season 3... What happened to the gossip girl that I came to know & love? Guess thats gone for good now. Season 3 of this show took a major dive. It's not the same as it used to be & prob will never be again. Unless if they come up with something drastic next season to put this show back in the game. It's really ashame this was a great show with amazing potential. Now it's just a bunch of college kids that whine because they don't want to grow up & are stuck in their hs days. Gossip girl needs a major makeover if it's gonna last because this show is going downhill fast!
0,Did not get whole season Ordered this on Amazon and sent me 2 (CD #3) and no (cd #4)My daughter's Christmans present turned out to be terrible. Make sure you check your cd's if you order these. They don't send you the whole season but want whole season $$$$. Bought it from Sold by: Amazon.com LLC. Of course I can't return it either.....
0,"Scratched disk Disk 4 was scratched and so I couldn't watch 2 episodes, I tried cleaning the disk but that didn't work. All episodes were on the disks but there was also a disk 6 that had episodes from a different season, so I believe that these are fake."

0,"The title disproves its claim I graduated from one of the schools described in this book, and I was horrified to see it listed on the cover. Throughout my time there, I was surrounded by people who couldn't care less about the name on their diploma, and couldn't care more about the quality of their education. Anyone who would be interested in a book titled ""Hidden Ivies"" does not have the sort of personality suited to my school - the name is nothing, the labels are nothing. The professors and fellow students are everything. These are excellent schools, but they should be considered in spite of what the Greenes title them, not because of it."
0,"Not Worth the Trouble You just want to use your computer as a digital VCR right? It's unlikely you'll be doing so anytime soon with this video card. The TV feature wouldn't work until I uninstalled my NIC and USB. TV and DVD work fine now, but the capture (record) feature doesn't record any audio. Yes, yours may be ok, but here's one more thing: the software that comes with this card is version 7.5, but the current version is 8.5. Owners of the 7500 have to PAY $$$ for this upgrade, whereas owners of higher-end ATI cards get it for free. You want to do business with a company like this, be my guest."
0,"This card is terrible I bought this card for a new custom built system and problems from the start. This card caused my computer to crash so often that I had to save games every 5 minutes to make any progress. I wrote an email to ATI and received an automated reply advising me to update the driver. After downloading 5 files and spending over an hour with DSL I updated the drivers. Still the system crashed all the time. Finally the card totally failed with a boot to black screen and I sent it back to ATI for repairs. I purchased a PNY Geoforce Ti 420 to keep my computer going and suddenly NO CRASHING, NONE! It was so wonderful. I dug up the games that were too frustrating because of the crashes and they were perfect. ATI sent the card back and said that they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Well I can't find anything right with it."

0,"Horrible game! Hard to understand and follow, bad graphics We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games. This is the worst game we have ever purchased. It is hard to figure out...hard to play...and hard to see what you are doing. It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also...many levels that my daughter would want to play are 'locked' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it."

0,"Cheesy, boring, move on...... I'll make this short. Terrible script with very forgettable acting. How'd they con Liam Nieson into this one? Extremely cheesy, not to mention lame, visual effects. It seemed they skimped on the screen writer to waste more money on worthless effects. Very boring sound effects, there's only so many times I can here a creaky door in 5.1 before I put the mute on. At least it was only a rental, however, it was late so it cost me 6 bucks, what a waste. I'm glad I didn't blindly pay 20 for this dog."

0,"A Truley Horrible Horror Film A truly horrible horror film. Over use of not so special ""special effects"" attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum, and that the characters were never developed or interesting. The only thing that's scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after 30 years. The other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that I actually paid to see it."
0,"Wow, What a Disappointment It's really difficult to make a good movie with bad material. But making a bad movie with good material must be easy---Jan DeBont proves it with this turkey. Shirley Jackson's story was a spooky classic. Robert Wise's B & W version was excellent and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. And HE did it without special effects; just sound, shadows, and camera angles. This movie could have been so much better by relying on the original premise and forgetting all the comic book special effects. Mr. DeBont is proving that he's better as a technician than a director. Liam Neeson must have lost a bet to go along with this."
0,"NEGATIVE 100 STARS. WORST FILM OF THE DECADE. This is a travesty, not only of Shirley Jackson's creepy, intelligent, incomparable ""The Haunting of Hill House"", but of the original ""The Haunting"". It's a ghost story for video-game-addicted morons. I've lost all respect I may have had for Neeson, Zeta-Jones and Taylor. This will be a permanent blotch on their resumes. If they were smart (ha ha) they might want to consider just whiting this one out! I won't apologize for sounding spiteful, either; when one of this century's best 'ghost' stories was turned into an excuse for lots of gimmicky, asinine computer graphics, instead of being crafted into the eerie filmed masterpiece it deserved to be, I was angered and even more disgusted with Hollywood, its crummy formulas and lowest-common-denominator scriptwriting than I ever was before."
0,"Too awful to be funny I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad, SO corny, SO awfully un-scary that I couldn't even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through (and I, a lover of all things spooky!). I do recall however three things about this movie: the directing was awful, the script was terrible and Cathy Jones (I didn't know who she was - she hadn't married the old man yet which really launched her career) gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie. No! I speak in haste - there were a number of 'worst' things about this movie.If you want to be creeped-out, read the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson). If you must see the story in movie form, watch the old black and white original from 1963 starring Julie Harris. It's dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo.Happy Hauntingness,Wind in Hare"
0,"Just skip it. 1. This is one of those rare movies where it's so lame, that I didn't / couldn't finish it.2. This movie is so lame, that spending more time writing a detailed review is a waste of time."
0,"This movie insulted my intelligence... along with the new Starwars. It is one of those movies that you want your 8 bucks and 2 hours of your life back afterwards. The plot is lame. The psycho-thriller classic turns a flop & dumb special effects-fest. I recommend ""the Matrix"" ""Taxi Driver (remastered)"" etc. for your holiday viewing."
0,"Must I even give it one star? Crass, vulgar, ridiculous farce of a film that regrettably retains none of the keen psychological portraits in Jackson's novel. Believe me, I am no stickler for slavish literary adaptations. When changes need to be made for cinematic purposes, I utterly support a director's choice to do so. Here, however, Jackson's work is not even on display in spirit; instead, this juvenile, special effects laden mess is marred by a juvenile screenplay and lousy performances from good actors. Even Liam Neeson publicly declared his utter disgust with this production. If only the filmmakers had taken the Robert Wise film version as inspiration; it is by no means faultless but is a masterpiece compared to this dreck. Only those folks who adore CGI will appreciate this film, and to them I say ""enjoy."" To those looking for characters or true chills, try ""The Innocents,"" ""The Changeling,"" ""The Legend of Hell House,"" or the original ""The Haunting"" instead."
0,"The house out-performs Catherine Zeta-Jones I honestly can't understand why Zeta-Jones' badly-scripted part is stealing the show with these reviewers; her cliched ""liberated woman with just a hint of vulnerability"" part is no more of a highlight than the rest of this awful movie. Bitter, am I? When the '60s version of a movie has more scares than the '90s version, be very afraid."

0,"Just terrible No, it's not as good as the original. But let's rate it on it's own merit - hmmm, it has none! This movie sucks whether you compare it to the original or let it try and stand alone! One of the worst movies of recent years, it has ridiculous acting (except for Liam Neeson, but it's not like he's good, I don't know why he did this) and one of the stupidest plots I have ever seen in my life. This is such a waste, don't buy it, don't rent it. This is a terrible movie. Period."
0,"Absolutely horrible Movies don't get much worse than this one, folks. The plot was poor and the acting was terrible. The scene near the beginning with the two ladies prancing around the house was incredibly lame. The filmmakers tried to overcome the shoddy storyline by tossing in some mediocre special effects. If they were intended to be a distraction, they didn't work.I have to admit, my review is based only on the first 30 or so minutes of the movie. That was all I could take before I got up off the couch, rewound the film, and promptly returned to the video store."
0,"I'm Haunted - I Will NEVER Get Those 2 Hours of My Life Back If you want a movie with a poor script, poor acting, and poor scares this movie is for you. We were hoping for a scary movie, but instead we came across this comedy. Lili Taylor is horrible as Eleanor, a woman driven to save everyone else who deserved to die for deciding to be in this attempt at a production. Liam Neeson, what were you thinking?"
0,"Very sorry indeed. Not scary, not original, bad computer fx, bad acting and no suspense! What a waste of money..."
0,"Dismal I guess the part I liked best was where Eleanor discovered that she was related to the ghost haunting the house. It was really believable. Tears came to my eyes it was so touching. Then, when the cherubs on the wall came to life, I was even more moved as there little souls finally were freed to go to heaven. That was really touching. I am just amazed at the screenwriter's brilliance. And all those special effects! He was so clever to add those. It must of taken a great deal of intelligence to have everything--even the ceilings come alive. I feel richer as a human for investing my time in this masterpiece."
0,"what a joke this movie is so stupid. waste of anybody's money or time. Not even Catherine Zeta Jones can make it seem worth watching. no parts in the movie were scary at all. In fact, was this a comedy by mistake?"
0,"TRITE, BORING, DISAPPOINTING It just didn't work. Astounding sets alone can't create on-screen chemistry. The story line and performances were weak, and, even worse, I didn't think it was scary...and wasn't that the whole idea? I left the theatre feeling cheated. This movie was just plain DUMB!"
0,"Catherine Zeta-Hipboots A fan of both Jackson's novel and the 1963 Robert Wise adadptation, I went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming. It was worse. In fact, it was so bad, I laughed my way through it (along with the two friends who accompanied me). There are so many digital effects that the house seems alive, indeed, but computer geeks set free with a big budget don't creep me out. They're just annoying. So is the movie. The house shape-shifts, sighs, moans--hell, even the door-knocker gets a reaction shot. Zeta-Jones's leather hipboots manage to out-act her, and Lili Taylor is hilariously bad as Eleanor. (""I've got the save the children!"" Wha?) Liam Neeson is even less interesting than he was in THE PHANTOM MENACE, if that's possible. Let's just put it this way: I just sacrificed 10 minutes of my time to write this review so that you won't waste 1 hour and 40 minutes of yours on this film."
0,"ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE How any sane, intelligent person(perhaps that explains it!) could recommend this overblown crap-fest is beyond me. Quite posibbly the worst horror movie ever made.

0,"Hollywood has run out of ideas...... I'm sorry, but I just couldn't stay awake to see this complete video. Whenever a cliche' scare comes up, I fall asleep....and this was often. I saw the original 60's version and, sorry, but that one was a snoozer too. I think this story could be phenomenally scary, but the right party has yet to make it.The only really scary thing about this movie is looking like Lily Taylor and having to share the screen with Catherine Zeta-Jones. She's a Goddess!!"
0,"Typical Hollywood pulp Third grade mentality, third-rate dialog. Not for adults. Egads, I actually bought the DVD. Shame on me."
0,"A waste of time and money Good cast, high budget movie. The movie was supposed to concentrate on a group of 4 people (all insomniacs) who were going to stay in an isolated house, to test their reactions to pressure situations.Was it the lack of direction, the lack of story line, or the lack of interest from the actors that led this movie to become a flop ?Watching this movie was a chore. It was about as exciting as ""The Avengers"".There's not a lot that can be said, apart from save your money and get a better movie (The Sixth Sense was made on a cheaper budget & was far more exciting)."
0,"TERRIBLE ATTEMPT AT GOTHIC HORROR ""The Haunting"" is certainly one of the worst films I've seen. While it starts off promisingly, the sets and special effects become so mind numbingly overdone that the thread of the original story is lost completely. It is replaced by a story that is not only derivitive and banal, but laugably contrived as well. This movie proves that even with a classic novel and a classic movie, a remake can totally botch its rendering beyond all recognition. Recommended for the film audience that prefers style far above substance."
0,"99.9 FAILURE! The only thing in this ""horror"" film that made it was the house and Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, looking good!, but the story was so forced, it never caught any horror, the special effects were cartoon like, not one bit frighting, the original movie and the short story will scare the pants off you, and why?, because your mind can conger up all the horror you want, your minds eye will take you to all those dark corners you fear, oh, and another thing that ruined the movie for me is, Owen Wilson, can't stand him!, how he ever got in movies is beyond me!, ignore this cluttered up movie and go to the original black and white one and get set to be terrified!"
0,"Some movies are just born bad... To say I was disappointed in this movie would be an understatement. To classify this as a horror film would be just plain wrong. While it achieves its goal to tell a good story, the chills and thrills just aren't there. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone with a serious yen to be scared out of their wits. If you want a real frightening tale, I recomend Rose Red. That's how a haunted house story should be told."
0,"Worst Film Ever Made, ever! It's just bad. I've already written one review but I feel its my duty to make everyone avoid this hideous and vile mess at all costs. Rent the original!"
0,"Come on! This has to be the stupidist movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible besides Catherine Zeta Jones( she is excellent). But I mean the other girl in there was so dull, 1 word comes to mind when I think about this movie LIFELESS. Cant these producers waste 10 million on a movie that will be eerie or scary, because in my opinion this was just horrible."
0,"Boredom personified! This movie, supposedly a journey into terror, lulls one off to sleep most of the time. The pace is so slow that I thought the exposition would never end. There wasn't one fear producing moment in the entire movie. I believe ""Bambi"" was scarier.This movie is dreadful, especially when one remembers the 1963 version with Julie Harris. I wonder how much money was spent making this dud!"
0,Terrible To sum up this movie takes one word and one word only...Terrible. If this is your first foray into The Haunting stop now and go back 36 years to the original.
0,"Wish I could give it 0 stars This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was absolutly stupid, boring, and a time-waster. The movie seemed to take forever and I couldn't wait for it to end. Plus, the ending was absolutely terrible and stupid. The main character in the story was such a bizzare character you really couldn't relate to her at all. The other characters were pretty weird too, but they were just funny. The special effects were OK, but it really annoyed me that those stupid statues kept coming to life to make the movie go on and on. There were so many many comedy aspects of this movie that it was hard to tell sometimes whether it was a comedy or a horror movie(such as the fact that all the characters had problems that were very obvious). I don't know about the old version of this movie, but the new one really sucks."
0,"A waste of valuable money! I saw a commercial for this movie. The special effects looked great. I was expecting to see a great action-packed movie. A friend and I anxiously stepped into the theater. The movie started with a little action, but then it was gone. Nothing. That was it. I actually fell asleep during it, something I never did before! This was one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen in my life. It doesn't even deserve one star, but I've got to give it something. If you think that this looks like a good deal, think again. Your money is worth something much better for the same price."
0,"Please! This was a horride movie. It had some creepy sceans, but the story was flater than paper. This proves that a movie doesn't need special effects to be scary. I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" and that was much better (And more scary) than this movie. Don't waste your money."
0,"horribly......stupid Liam Neeson is pathetic. Catherine Zeta-Jones is sham. The young boy is boring, though i gave him a pity because he's killed for no reason. The only thing i was moved by is the girl and her story, her family story; in fact, the story itself is pretty interesting, so there's huge disappointment's waiting for you. Except computer effect there's almost nothing."
0,"PCKJC Review by Kelvin Lam This novel shows the struggle of a young boy troubled by his own faith, with problems within his own family from his father's death, to his uncle's fighting against his faith. It shows his struggle to find out what Catholicism is, the flaws of it, and which religion he should follow. It shows the heresies against Catholicism, along with its strengths. It has a sheer lacking in the amount of entertainment in the book, yet it can either strengthen or weaken your faith. It is tends to be utterly dull at times. Not a good book."

0,"FULL OF MISTAKES!!!! This book is great for people whom already have well developed, basic math skills and are just looking for a refresher to familiarize them with what they might run across on the ASVAB. You need to already have good math skills because the math, science, electronics, and physics portions of this book are FILLED with basic, arithmetic errors (elementary school level addition and subtraction and middle school level factoring). Don't expect to learn anything from this book. If you need to brush up on math for the ASVAB, I would suggest a different publisher."
0,"aim low Although there are good poems in here, and good authors, Astley is intent on dumbing down poetry - this book aims for the lowest common denominator possible, and then digs deeper. Astley's commentary and rants are opinionated and condescending. Poetry is far more alive and interesting than than this anthology suggests."
0,Yoga for surfers taught by a Poser I have never bother to write one of these review but I agree that the video is too advance for beginners and I find it difficult to get over the fact of what a poser she is. She seems to be cashing in on surfing and going after a niche market in yoga DVDs. I have watched and done all three DVDs and I have seen much better yoga DVDs. I sold these DVDs because they aren't the best out there. Check out the Living Art series of DVDs. I found these much better then the whole series of yoga for surfer. Go mindfully and slowly. Peace

0,"Nope, nope I cannot believe there are no negative reviews for this. No matter any point of view (feminists are gonna be mad) or theory this book is positing, the basis of the book is not understanding female anatomy. I have no idea if the psychological ideas have been debunked. This book was given to me as a joke a few birthdays ago. You can say ""the reason your sex is bad is because you've lost your feminine role"" and hell, that could be 100% correct, but a big chunk of this book ignores where the nerve endings are located. In the 40 years since this was published, I think someone went ahead and talked to some women, maybe even did some science-y stuff and decided 80+% of women weren't just orgasming wrong. But its good that this is still out there, to make people feel ashamed of the way their body works. In other news, no one poops but you: cause you're gross."
0,Do Not Buy I know because I bought it. The gyroscope spins out of control and the string snaps on the first pull. The gyroscope is UGLY and DULL. I am Verry Disappointed and so will you if you get this. Do Not Buy it. It is made of lead and stains your finger when you toutch it. This Toy is Very Low Quality and it stinks. As I said Before Do not Buy.
0,doesn't wash off that easily We bought this thinking our kids would love it. They did love painting. But the problem came when we tried to wash it off. We cleaned it about 30 minutes after the kids started and we had to get out the pressure washer. It took about an hour to clean up. It was by far the worst clean up. It does not come off that easily. the regular hose did nothing to get it off.

My brand new Simpletech card has gone mysteriously crazy, within 10 minutes of popping it in my Canon S230. I don't care what the explanation is, frankly-- card error is a scary thing to see. Magically, replacing my trusty (if allegedly slower) SanDisk cards rectifies all problems. I swear, I did nothing wrong-- it's idiot proof. This card is just wacky."

0,Dragon Fire I just could not read it; it was too violent and ugly. Perhaps it was just me but I couldn't get past the first chapter.
0,"Huh? What is the point of this book? It doesn't have one, in my opinion. The author himself said that the reason for writing it was that he wanted to write a book about incest! I really do not enjoy graphic descriptions of this incest, either. I would not reccommend it to anyone, in fact, I tell others NOT to read it. I wouldn't have read past the tenth page if I hadn't been required to for my English class."
0,"I hated this book This book was a total waste of time. I kept thinking that it was going to lead somewhere or reveal something, but it never did- it just kept repeating names until I had no idea and no longer cared who was who and rambled on to an unfulfilling end."
0,"Disappointment I read this book after it was recommended by Oprah as being considered ""perhaps the best book ever written""! What a disappointment... I slogged my way through it, thinking ""it must get better if it's the best book ever written""... but alas, no, it didn't.I am a voracious reader, and read fro 2-5 books a week. I noticed Amazon recommended ""if you like this, you'll like Catch 22"". I loved Catch 22! I HATED this book! What am I missing here?"
0,"Magical, mystical piece of tripe I read (well, not really...I got to page 100 and felt like I'd read it three times already) this book over ten years ago and I still rank it as the worse piece of tripe that I ever had the misfortune to come across. But I'm biased. Like most Latins, I think the whole ""magical and mysterious"" cloak with which Latin literature is viewed abroad is unfortunate, but ultimately it's that kind of rubbish that sells."
0,"Not for everyone I will not critize this book too heavily, as apparently it is a classic and many people find it delightful. However, I found the book extremely hard to follow, and without any identifyable plot line. Yes, it is interesting to see how a city can develop over 100 years of time, but all the characters kept dying off, and I found myself not being bothered by it, as nothing made me connect with them through the book. I really just did not find the book enjoyable enough to continue past 2/3rds the way in to it ."
0,"Glad to be done with this one I pride myself on finishing every book I begin reading, but this novel severely tested my perseverance. I kept waiting for the story to generate even a spark of interest but it just never happened for me. Admittedly Marquez is a gifted writer and for this reason I was tempted to award the book 2 stars, but if I had to sum up the book in one word it would be PAINFUL, thus the single star. I've read a number of 'classics' which were difficult reads, but there were usually rewards for the effort. I can't say the same for this book."
0,"The author put one over on us... 10,000 ideas thrown up in the air and landed randomly on pages.Characters not even likeable except for Ursula. Too muchridiculous stuff making story unbelievable. The author reallyhas put one over on the public; I could have written a betterbook!"
0,"500 pages of boredom The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores."
0,"Classic? I'll come clean first. I stopped reading after 100 pages. A lot happens in this book, with deaths and spirits and insomnia and marriages, and it's all fairly easy enough to figure out what's going on. Yet, nothing happens. So much plot takes place that the characterization suffers. I simply didn't care what happened to the characters, or anyone in the town. If a bomb had levelled Macondo, I would have simply flipped to the next page to see what happened next, not to read on about the characters. If you're interested in a classic worthy of its praise, where characterization is king, do yourself a favor and pick up Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. You'll work to read, but your mind and soul will be enriched. Faulkner's novels are like movies you watch in slow motion to get every nuance. Marquez, on the other hand, is like a movie you watch in fast forward. You get the plot and action, but when all is said and done, nothing sticks in your mind that is worthy of the space it occupies."
0,"big disappointment I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can't believe all the ""5 star"" reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection. The characters are meaningless, the text is scattered and awkward. Perhaps something was lost in translation, who knows. I've never been one to give up on a book but I considered it many times with this one."
0,"100 years of boreitude I can count on one hand the number of books in my life that I have been unable to finish. I am oftimes mocked for my reading, the rate at which I devour books being astronomical, but I could not drag my weary brain kicking and screaming through more than a few dozen pages of this book.I love a good fantasy novel, or anything that gives you a sense of the magical, but I could not find anything interesting in the random and inexplicable bizarre occurrences in this book. Mix that with the dry, long winded prose and I find myself doing something I have NEVER done; sitting with a book in my hands, looking around the room for something else to do."
0,"Disappointed I expected much more from this book. It started out interesting enough but, seemed to drag on and on. In the end it was depressing and a little confusing. I like a fiction book to be entertaining and thought provoking; with a point, I did not at all enjoy this book."
0,You must read this book! This was my first encounter with the magical realism style and I love it! The Buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing I have encountered in any book. A must read.
0,Nobel Prize? So if the Nobel Prize is for the author's body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that's in capital letters). If this is his best work and most famous work and it is a labor to read then his other works must be capital punishment!!!Much like the best book of the century by James Joyce - Ulysses.Again another book to be placed in Solitary Confinement!!!
0,pointless This is one of the hardest to read most pointless books I have ever had the misfortune of trying to read.
0,"Emporer's new clothes. I'm one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so I plugged away hoping I'd experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found...but I just didn't get it. Maybe it lost something in the translation, but I prefer a little dialog in my fiction...even in my heavy, pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction. I don't mind the magic realism, but I do get bored with sentences that run on for two-plus pages without a period. Oh, well, chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck who's educated beyond his intelligence. But I was underwhelmed."
0,"Oh, my. I recognize that lots of people think this book is wonderful. However, as an extremely well-read English major, I think Marquez must be laughing. Without repeating the comments of the other one-star reviewers, I'll just say that I was more than underwhelmed. It's nonsenical, and (am I the only one who noticed?) misogynistic."
0,"Struggling I agree with the other reviewers that say this book is tedious and much overrated. I read quite a bit, and I usually enjoy everything I read. However, I just cannot get in to this book. Yes, it is rambling, confusing, and all those other adjectives someone else used. But I don't want rambling and confusing. I don't want to be spoon fed, but it would be nice if there were an identifiable path for the book. I wonder how much is lost in the English translation, and if it would be a much better read in its native language.I am a few hundred pages into the book. I'll keep reading -- and keep hoping that it improves."
0,"Appalling. . . I checked this book out of the library after reading rave review after rave review.I wanted to like it, I really did, but I honestly cannot understand all the high marks. To me the book reads as if it were written by a 6th-grader. Characterization and storyline aside, the language itself is what turned me off. It seemed stilted, contrived, lacking in fluidity, and devoid of any real color; an amateurish effort at best.Perhaps this reads better in its native tongue, but the translation I read was atrocious. I promptly returned it to the library, shooting it soundly down the return bin with a force that it so richly deserved."

0,"An Oprah Classic (in other words Boring, a Non-Sense Story, It was a required reading in college in 1990. It was boring then as it is now. No wonder it was selected as an Oprah Book Selection. Most Oprah's book are boring but with HYPE.The story does not follow any logic even within the story itself. You will get confuse with the repeated combination of names that are used througout the story. I believe there are only 5 (Jose, Aurelio,Miguel, etc) Fiction does not follow logic I know but usually a story (even a work of fiction) sets boundaries within the story itself and are bounded by this limit. This story is a waste of paper on which it was written. Marquez is one of those overhyped writers with nothing to show for. I guess this is the result of some literary critic needing to sell some books to get a comission from the publishing house.Sorry if I was mean but I was forced to read it college and felt that it was a waste of time and money."
0,"Bad, bad, bad What a horrible book; hard to read; too many characters; I never did figure out what the whole thing was about. I can't believe this won a Nobel Prize. Definitely a waste of time reading."
0,"Can I give it -9999 Stars instead? Yawn. 400 some pages of nothing but incest and death. Characters with the same name throughout the book. Non-linear time, too, it's very hard to follow. How could this ""book"" change your life? I have come to fear love, it's like your emotions are being dragged through the mud and everything you hold dear and ethical are just pushed away like its nothing. It was about incest, personally, maybe something was lost in the translation. It was so depressing and disturbing. I could not sleep without lights on after I finished reading it. I would never suggest this book to anybody who has a weak constitution or is easily emotionally disturbed. NOT good reading for a highschool student. Even Faulkner's The Bear was not about incest (it was bad too)."
0,"Book This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all."
0,"Don't waste your time if you don't absolutely have to. I read this for a college course. If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn."
0,"Drawn Out 100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. Most of the characters have the same name - either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano for the boys and Amaranta or Remedios for the girls. The chapters are long and have large amounts of action. Most of the chapters are very similar: incest occurs, a child is born, named Jose Arcadio, he studies Melquiades, fights with some people, has a mistress, several children, and then dies. I do not recommend this book for anyone that wants a quick/easy/interesting read. It is well written and conveys many themes and such, but is purely painful to read."
0,"I DON'T GET IT I don't understand why Gabriel Garcia Marquez will get such great reviews on 100 years of solitude, I thought it was one of the worst piece of Magical Realism that I have ever read.Don't waste your time or money on this terrible piece of literature, Sincerely, it is a pointless, mediocre and most definitely not Nobel Prize material."
0,"The Emperor's New Clothes After a couple of chapters into the book I went online to check why so many people felt that this was one great work of literature. The words I found repeatedly were magical and enchanting....When a grown man has the desire to take a nine year old girl to be his ""wife"" and gets her pregnant, than I don't feel enchanted but repulsed. Fiction or not. Actually to make that up, speaks for it self as far as I am concerned. And Oprah of all people to recommend that in her book club. I clearly missed the point about a lot of things and that male characters shared names did not make it any easier. My husband read it as well and we felt the same about most passages. I was glad when I finally finished it, as I really wanted to know the whole story before making up my mind."
0,"more stars than the firmament.... I wish I could have given this book ""no stars:"" it's a book that deserves every star that man, god or science has created, and nothing we can put here on the internet (or in any review in any medium) would do it the eternal justice it deserves. A dream of a book: I would pick it up the day after having read forty pages, start the next chapter, and wonder where it was I had left off the night before. A book that gives off narcotic fumes, that gives off disembowling violence, love, and indifference. A book that deserves more awards than humankind can bestow."
0,A fad which no one will remember in 100 years so mr marquez is supposed to have invented this whole new genre of writing with this book and other annoying ones like In Evil Hour. But no one seems to stop and say that the events of the story are ridiculous and embarrasing. who wants to read about an old lady who makes candy for her family for generations? no one. and the romance portrayed is nothing short of farcical. it's a wonder he's a star in the literary universe.

I'll have to admit that the unit appears extremely sturdy and well built but it does come with one minor flaw- if a part is missing there is no way to get a replacement part. My specific issue was the bracket at the end of the arm that connects to the plate securing the display. The part was not in the box so I called Omni Mount to get a replacement part. They assured me the piece was part of the assembly when it left the factory and there was no way to get me a replacement part. I now have a $250 mount that is useless. Gotta think that if they are correct, I wound up with a used or salvaged unit."

0,"Warning! This is a warning to other Pratchett-lovers out there looking for audiobooks. This is an abridgment of the original book, and a bad one. A lot of the best word jokes and philosophical humor is missing, many scenes are in pieces, and the whole thing simply does not convey the sense of fun and insight of the original novel. As well, in my opinion, Tony Robinson is a horribly bad voice actor, but that may simply be a personal preference. [...]"
0,"Only because I can't give it 1/2 a star There aren't enough words in the English language to express my utter loathing and contempt for this book. I had heard that Pratchett was ""satirical"", ""devious"", ""irreverent"", ""magical"", ""entertaining"" and ""above all funny"".Sadly ""Men at Arms"" is none of the above. Pratchett is trying to be Douglas Adams and fails at it miserably. This story in particular was trite, condisending, and supremly unfunny. His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of ""ho ho ho see how clever I am!"" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame. It wasn't. It was just lame."

Bantam Classics normally does a great jobs on books, but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all, left it unstructured and the translation all over the place, intermingled with the lines, translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the place.Practically, I am reading four lines middle-english, five lines modern, three lines middle-english, 2 lines modern, 6 lines middle-english, and so forth. There is no connection between the middle-English and its translation.That was a wasted 5.99 USD for kindle version and a HUGE disappointment :( ..."
0,"bad version to read The annotation style if this edition ruins it. Putting the definitions of words in line with the text, rather than as footnotes or end notes, disrupts the flow of reading. It quickly gets confusing as to what is original text and what is editorial comment. I'm off to find another edition only partway into the first poem."
0,"Don't buy the Kindle edition This is not easy to read in Kindle format. In paperback, it has two translations: one in Middle English, the other in Modern English. These are displayed side by side, with the earlier English on the left, Modern on the right. When it comes to the Kindle edition, there are no breaks between these translations. It switches back and forth without any notice, making it really difficult to follow. It would be alright if we could view it page by page (in it's original format), but without that option it's harder to understand. (Yes, it's obvious which part is which, but finding where it stops and starts takes away from the reading experience. It's too choppy.)In short, buy the paperback or perhaps a different Kindle edition. The format makes this a challenge to read."
0,"Looking for a great book on Titanic? Don't look here! I study Titanic and try to get every book possible on Titanic,( I've been studying Titanc, way before the movie was made). But when I bought this book and read it, I regreted it. It's a good book, for... how shall I say it, Beginner readers for Titanic. I give this book, in my opinion, 1 STAR because of it's lack of thought. The book seemed like it was made for new Titanic fans. Since I've been interested in Titanic for a long while, this book wasn't at all great."
0,"Tedious and Self-Inflating I'm always up for another look at the Titanic, especially if new light is shed on the story. Unfortunately, Pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person, or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of Ballard's expeditions. On top of that, it's not interesting. The retelling of the events on the ship are fine, but they can't carry the deadweight of Pelligrino's attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story. It's the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting. PASS."

Coyote Ugly is just repeating this, with a particularly annoying character who suffers from one of the most demented looking cases of stage fright I've ever seen.Jerry Bruckheimer usually does good films, but this is a case in which I would love to ask him what he was thinking. The only attraction to this film is a bunch of girls dancing on top of the bar, and the singing of LeAnn Rimes. He could easily have just made a few music videos and dispensed with the vehicle for presenting them. It would have done us all a favour."

0,Dumb movie This was the biggest waste of time I have ever seen. The only person that would be interested in this movie is a thirteen-year old boy. Tyra Banks should stick to her day job. She is much better as a model for Victoria's Secret because she never has to open her mouth & speak. I want the wasted hour & a half of my life back. This movie was very predictable & lame. Don't waste your time.
0,A nightmare! I rented this poor excuse for a movie and couldn't help falling asleep the whole time. It's pretty predictable and not very entertaining. It's not really worth buying.
0,"Special effects?! Coyote Ugly has the worst cgi and special effects I have never seen before in all my years of movie bashing. Actually, I just started watching movies last week. Due to Coyote Ugly, I'll never watch another bad movie again."
0,"Good intentions... Horrible execution. Piper Perabo is a great new face in Hollywood and I look forward to seeing what she does next. That said, I believe the director and editor (more on that later) should be taken to a public place and caned with a bamboo pole.What starts as a cute girl-coming-of-age-in-the-big-city movie begins to fall apart the moment the girl who's too shy to sing in front of anyone starts working in a bar that requires her to dance on the bar while getting buckets of water dumped on her. ""Oh I'm too shy to sing one of my songs in front of my new date, but I'll strip for him!"" What???There is a spasmatic sequence with a phone call, a trip to a club, a family reunion and a performance that had to have been spliced together by an MTV editor that drank way too much Mountain Dew while eating pixie sticks. One character even repays a debt that was cut out so she couldn't have even known that she owed it!Hopefully Piper will have better luck with ""Slap Her, She's French"" this year."
0,"Another tax-loss movie? You know you're watching a bad movie when your partner leans over to you and, without ever having seen the movie before, outlines the plot in detail, including accurate descriptions of most of the scenes to follow minutes after the opening credits have run.What on earth was Bruckheimer thinkning when he made this? I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie. Utter dross; Hollywood really needs a fresh injection of writing talent."
0,"Howlingly Horrible This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I've seen in recent memory.I watched this because there is a 14 year old in the house who is understandably amused by girls in their early twenties dancing on top of a bar....and is willing to watch a non-plot for a half-hour between those scenes. Short of a pubescent male, I have to think that anyone who enjoyed this movie is either miguided (hopefully) or an idiot.If this is really what a person looks for in a film, let me recommend saving your money and watching nearly any television sit-com....they're just as bad and it won't cost you four bucks a pop. Take that extra four bucks and donate it to the library. That way, people who are dragging the human race intellectually down to such a depth can at least offset the damage they do by hopefully lifting someone else up."
0,really weak Film nothing really happening with this Film.the Girls were Looking Good but as far as the Film Goes not much Happening.it's one of those films you watch when you are in Pure T&A type of Mood.it's fairly a Air-Head Film.
0,"Weak... Garbage is an alright band. I'd heard them live BEFORE they became huge. Still, this album fails to match their true potential... this is really weak."
0,"Not PCI Port I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI. My son pointed it out to me after I ordered the card. When I contacted Tiger Direct, they did not know that it needed an AGI slot. They told me to call the Distributor - Diamond, who after a 35 minute wait on hold, said it was not his product (it was). When the card arrived and I confirmed that it was not PCI, I was able to return it and get a full refund. It was a hassle taking the box to be returned. I would have preferred to know about this before I ordered it."
0,"Amazon duped. Me too. This game can NOT be played on the Xbox system that is sold in the stores today!! Maybe I should have known that, but I didn't. I feel as thought sellers should have pointed this out in their ad.My son has an older Xbox, and I am currently waiting for him to get that out of storage to see if the game will play there. Until then, my rating of the transaction is that it was the worst for me ever on Amazon.com, but that may change to an OK."
0,I don't understand all the hype over this Another case of when I side with the minority. I didn't get through it. Decided I had much better ways to spend my time. The only thing I really enjoyed was Meryl Streep's bit. I don't whether she resurfaced later in the film but I guess I'll never know now.
0,"Glich Heaven I bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell, But I was sadly mistaken when I got halfway through it and I kept hitting glich after glich. I thought it was my Xbox, but I took it to a friend's and glich after glich. I guess I got the worst game in history, but that's what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one"
0,"I like the idea, BUT... As both a surfer and yoga enthusiast i was excited to see this program created, however, upon watching the video it became clear that it's not all that great. It's hard to follow the poses when you can't see the instructors feet b/c they're buried in the sand and unless you have a decent knowledge of yoga there are a lot of important details about many of the poses that are left out. I'd recommend a non-surfing specified yoga dvd over this. You'll get more out of it."
0,yoga for surfers don't waste your money .lots of wasted time talking about how great yoga is.content is good but alot of fast fowarding.not useful as a work out video.
0,Dont buy This video is not good. Peggy seems like a regular soccer mom who decided that she could make a yoga video. Her instructions arent good and her form is not good enough to be teaching others. The editing is pretty bad. And worst of all theres awesome surfing clips on when your head is bent over in your lap. How are you supposed to watch the sweet barrels?Maybe the other two Yoga for Surfers are better but I'm over it.
0,"Don't buy the dvd, and don't buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed. It has nice surf footage, but the yoga instruction is really bad. The time would have been better spent slowing going through each yoga pose, versus racing through a large number of poses. Skip this DVD, take a lesson at your local yoga place."
0,WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS STORE AGAIN! This book arrived 2 months after I ordered it. I had already went to my trip to Greece. I was so pissed off!
0,"If you love the songs on Noddy, DON'T BUY!! My son was very excited as we put the CD in the player! But when the music started, he was very unhappy!! The songs don't sound anything like the ones on the show. The melody and pace are different- and the performers aren't interesting. DON'T BUY if you are familiar with the 'REAL' songs."
0,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. A total rip off. This 52 minute video is nothing more than 8-10 minutes of bad content on a loop. It is a video of one woman doing sing-along style songs. Any claims that this is a ""Sign Language"" video are dubious at best. There are very few real American Sign Language signs, so few as to be pointless. An episode of Blues Clues has more signs. I feel ripped off, and I didn't even pay any money of out my own pocket (I was using $15 in free Amazon Unbox credit from a promotion). Stay away from this video at all costs. I highly recommend Signing Time, which isn't yet available from Amazon Unbox. I hope it will be soon; I'm going to send the makers of Signing Time an email asking them to get their content online."

0,"Where's ""The Myth of Working Fathers""? The author's message, in essence, is that working mothers are not ""real"" mothers. I can only assume that in the sequel to this sexist, essentialist rant, she will reveal how working fathers are not ""real"" fathers, and how they should build *their* careers around parenthood, and how they are sadly mistaken to think they could possibly be successful both in the labor force and at home."
0,What a stupid book! Don't waste your money on this book unless you want to be insulted. Just because women work does not mean they can't be great moms. Finding quality daycare is key! My children loved their daycare providers and they loved playing with other kids. I like working and being a mom! I think I'm pretty good at it too!

Typical low budget mistakes, trying to do a horror with no money and using non actors. I paid 99 cents for this movie and I think I overpaid by about 98 cents."
0,"This edition is full of errors, mistakes, and typos DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!! It is full of typos, missing information in problems, mislabeled diagrams, and wrong answers! I spoke with PR and they said that, yes, indeed that is correct, but the 2002 edition has been corrected. Can you imagine what I went through while studying? I was second guessing myself left and right. I finally realized that, no, I do what I'm doing, it's the book that was wrong.Please don't buy this 2000 edition, it is a waste of your time and money. The 2002 edition ought to be much better, and probably quite a good study guide. I, however, have not seen it and do not know for sure, but PR should be a fairly respectable test prep. company.Happy GREs...hahaha"
0,"Most horrendous test prep book in press... Amazon should offer negative star ratings, because one star is far too glamorous a prize for this untrustworthy and erroneous book. I am shocked at the simple lack in proofreading the text, question, and answers. Students of Chem should never buy this book, and those that have should write the publisher and demand a refund. The only good use for this text would be as camp fire fuel."
0,"This book is a Travesty With just four years of chemistry background, I could write a better book than this in my sleep. What did the authro get her Ph.D in anyway? Was it sociology, or perhaps basket weaving? I am quite bitter, becuase I am trying to use this miserable excuse for toilet paper to prep for an exam two days from now. It at least reassures me of how much I do know because all the errors are so glaring. I think that perhaps this author should also advertise that they got their Ph.D. out of a cracker jack box. I will be writing to Princeton Review to demand my money back, and I urge University Chemistry departments everywhere to warn students about this book. Honestly, a retarded monkey with no limbs could write a better book. I wonder what Laberge got on the Chem GRE?"
0,"sloppy The topics covered are generally clear, but there are numerous errors and typos. There are bonds missing in the organic chemistry section and at least one error that is of a seriously confusing sort."
0,"Not so good I had three books to help study for this exam including this one. This book has many errors and it also doesn't explain things very well. I don't even know if there is a good study guide out there because the one from ETS doesn't even tell you how to do the problems, it just tells you the answers."
0,"Cheaply made I bought this for my son after remembering when I played it when I was younger. I looked at tons of different ones to see which one I should get. I bought this one and it came broken. I tried to fix it but even after it should've worked again, it would still let you put all the teeth down without the crocodile biting. This one is also very small. I went to Toys R Us and bought the one they sell, which I was nervous to do since you couldn't see what's inside the box, but that one is perfect and exactly what I was looking for, plus it doesn't actually ""bite"" so my little ones won't be too afraid to play it."
0,"do not waste your money i purchased this thinking it was the ORIGINAL crocodile dentist. this one is FAR FROM IT. first of all, it is about the size of my hand. yes, very very very small. it does not take batteries. you simply ""push"" the teeth down with your finger one at a time and when you press a certain tooth, it trigger the jaw to close on your finger. but, the jaw is held open with just a spring attachement which often malfunctions. and when the jaw closed on my sons little finger (only 3), the top part of the crocodile just fell off. it is CHEAPLY MADE! the picture is also misleading - this one has braces. i do not remember the original crocodile dentist having braces on its top teeth. completely bored my son."
0,"crap This toy came in poor shape - the plastic was broken and it was dirty - suppose to be ""new"" - It has not even been one month and the toy is brok"
0,"very small and lasted about 1 hour I was really excited about this toy. Unfortunately, it was very small and lasted maybe 2 hours before breaking. Excessively cheap construction. Worth it only if you find it in the dollar store (toy was maybe 6-8 in nose to tail)"
0,"Travel Sized --- Not what I expected So disappointed - this is a travel version. It should be advertised as such. It won't last through Christmas morning if it's even looked at! I have contacted the seller as to my disappointment in hopes to obtain the real game or a full refund, I will post the result."
0,"WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY I bought this toy to give my grandson for his birthday. It was ordered in October for his December birthday. I decided to open it before I mailed it to see how it worked. Well, it did not work at all. I opened the mouth and some of the time the teeth all pop up but most of the time 6 to 8 stay down. When they all popped up, then I thought it should work as described. It did not. I have never gotten the mouth to close when I pushed a tooth down. It is a piece of junk! Since I did not check it out until after Thanksgiving, I can not return it for the full price. By the time I pay for postage I would loose even more so I'll just trash it! What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!"
0,"May not appeal to toddler My 3-year old toddler loved playing ""snatch-the-toast"" from her toy toaster so I bought her the crocodile dentist. However, she is scared stiff of the clamping action and refused to play with it. She started removing the sticker-eyes and -nostrils instead. Toy is durable per se but stickers can be easily removed. I had to glue them back with superglue, which is better lasting. I came to a conclusion that she is still too young to play with the crocodile dentist and I intend to keep it for her later on."
0,Cheap Plastic This toy did not last 1 day. The spring mechanism inside broke after about the 5th game we played. I wouldn't waste my money on it again. We were pretty careful with since it felt cheap right out of the box. After the 5th game the mouth would not stay open anymore.
0,"Instantly broke We had a larger ""Crocodile dentist"" toy that my 2 and 4 year old really loved playing with. After a month or two the toy broke so you couldn't play the game. I bought this as replacement. It is very small and the game never worked - you push all of the teeth and the mouth never shuts. It's a shame because the concept of this game is great. But don't buy this one"
0,disappointed We played with this gift three tiems and it broke. Very poorly made. Would buy if I could find a better quality product becasue the game itself is quite funny.
0,"doesn't live up to expectations Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it's size. From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again. All in all, a disappointment and not worth the money it would cost to send it back."
0,piece of junk We played this game twice and it broke. The teeth won't come back up and the mouth won't stay open. Save your money.
0,"Crocodile Dentist It started out being fun, but was too hurtful to little fingers. It's not being played with as much as I thought it would, but it was what they asked for. Another toy for the garage sale."
0,"Broke after a week A tooth fell out but could still play it. Then another tooth fell out (can't replace) so made the game even less playable. Also, it was really tiny and more like a travel size which I did not expect for the money."
0,"unhappy don't buy this, broke out of the box,poor quality item, dissapointed child,worst present ever,stay away from this game not worth the time or money"
0,"broken when I opened the box When I opened the box, I pushed down the teeth to see how hard it would clamp shut and it didn't clamp shut. I returned the toy to the company and will not be purchasing another one. I was originally excited about this purchase as I have seen the toy before and the kids really liked it."
0,"Beautiful music, lousy packaging I was glad to see this disc reissued, even as a CD-R, but despite the beautiful music, I cannot recommend this disc because of the lack of any information other than the track listing. There are no liner notes, no timings and no indication of which composer wrote which piece. As these rarities will be mostly of interest to the more serious collector/listener, this is a major failing."

0,"Worthless I bought this book when it was first printed hoping for some insight into how Tomcat worked, design decisions, architecture etc. etc.What I got was nothing more than a rehash of the online documentation.A complete waste of money then and utterly worthless now. If you have a copy hang it on a nail."
0,too expensive The price for these 22 packets was several times more expensive than buying it in the 4 count package in a grocery store. The only reason I agreed to it was because the store had stopped carrying the item (but is now)
0,"Cinematic satire is dead Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se, it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best, but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps, like the American Presidency, lobby money can buy anything."
0,"ridiculously overrated campy trash Only actor worth a hoot in this thing was B. Fraser -- McKellen and Redgrave's performances were pitiful. Redgrave acted like she was a skit character on SNL; I've seen McKellen's effeminate, snobby British character a zillion times. If you want to be bored out of your gourd, watch this claptrap."
0,"POOR SUPPORT I purchased this game and it would not work. I contacted the manufacturer(Oxygen) and they asked to send them a diagnostc. I sent this information and never received a response(it has been one week). I contacted them at least ten times, I also called them and left a message without a reply.Subsequenty I learned from my computer manufacturer that this game requires a T & L accelerator card which is not included in laptops and the game will not work on laptop. This information could easily have been suplied by them instead of ignoring my request for support.I will never know if this game is any good or if it will work and I am stuck with it.Buyer Beware!In addition I would like to add that the phone support did eventually get back to me several days later and they tried to assist me but unfortunately the game is not designed for the current laptop but I never received a reply from the on line support"
0,"don't bother As opposed to the listing and photo, this product has no provisions for headrests.There are no seatbelt slots. You can cut them in, but you can do that on a flat piece of cloth too. In fact this is actually not much more than a flat piece of cloth. Save the $$ and use an old blanket."
0,Disappointed I should have listened to the first reviewer. It truly was nothing more than a blanket- with no provisions for seat belts or headrests. You could cut them in yourself but you can do that with a blanket and probably have a much easier time of it (cutting into this material and not having it fray would be near impossible). Can't believe it is being sold as a bench seat cover. I sent it back and got the Elegant brand instead from a local parts store. Elegant had the provisions for the seat belts and the head rests. So much happier with that purchase.
0,I did not receive the item I did not receive this item. I filed the claim but I did not hear from the seller at all.
0,"quite bad I did not like this book at all - the author promises to tell all the secret truth about Caruso (the stuff that has never been told before, you know...) - in the end he just tells what everybody already knew, only that he criticizes as much as he can - without any foundation just to reveal the promissed secret. If you're looking for a good book about Caruso take ""My father and my family"" in the unabridged version by Caruso jr. (the best ever written about Caruso) or the book by Michael Scott."
0,"HORRIBLE I would acttualy give it 0 stars.

0,"Boring,Boring,Boring,,, How an author can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. Ho hum, I can't believe she's dead, let's pour ourself another drink. I can't believe her mother showed up, ho-hum let's pour another drink and watch her clean the house. One big secret does surface, but it is rather mundane in it's telling. At the end everyone gets better, while the Mom who is easily the most exciting of the group, realizes life does go on after the loss of a child. Even if'ts is a miserable and shallow existence. Color this whole novel as grey and bland as a grief stricken day in the Hamptons. I was disappointed because I really looked forward to this book, and intead could barely muster the energy to finish it."
0,"If I could rate it 0 stars, I would have! I looked forward to reading yet another Meg Wolitzer novel, and I was very disappointed--in fact, I lost interest early on and never finished it.

0,"Would not buy were I you The book's horrendous, a waste of money. I could have focused on other books, but sadly, did not. The worst book I have ever read, with poor characters, poor writing.

0,Disappointed I read this book and hoped against hope for something new in vampire lore but it's basically the same old stuff not very interestingly written.
0,"Not up to expectations. I thought the author would actually REVIEW the outlet malls, not just tell us where they are (you can get that for free on the Internet!)

0,"Incredibly slow, boring thriller based on a fascinating true story I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes. It's that bad. I ordered it after reading Operation Mincemeat. The film is a sort anti-Ken Follet film--not the eye of the needle but the eye of a tunnel. No suspense, just boring dialogue between cardboard actors. Clifton Webb and the glorious Gloria Graham (in a bit part) couldn't save this belatedly patriotic and badly produced, low-budget film. (It was made in 1955). No wonder its out of print."
0,"Wrong item! After receiving the cd in the mail, I opened it up and played it, and swore they shipped the wrong cd. This cd is Live, and they don't tell that in the details. It is also a poor version, even if you like Live music, I don't think you will like this."
0,"A few good, a lot bad There are maybe 3 good movies in the bunch and seperately they are inexpensive movies. The rest are bad writing, directing, acting, etc. Several are ""foreign"" films I guess because the accents are so thick that the dialogue cannot be understood. I will usually sit through any movie at least once, some of these were so bad I shut them off before I finished watching them. If there are any you recognize that you don't own and are building a library, worth the price; but if you think you are getting 8 great movies at a low price, think again.DLP"
0,"Way too many ads In the February 2013 mag there are 40 full page adds for some kind of dietary suplaments and 18 other full page ads of a total of 120 pages. There are also a few 1/3 & 1/2 page ads. So all togather about half of the mag is advertisements. The mag is alsofull of graphics and full page pics. There are only a few articles and they are generally not presenting original, thought provoking material.I canceled my subscription after three issues. Maybe this mag is geared more toward body builders that can't read."
0,"Pretty sad, fake pictures and nearly all adds. Fake airbushed pictures, ie Andy Roddick. That guys arms turned out bigger than his waist. This magazine used to be okay. I think they spend more time with tanning, lights, make-up and Photoshop that they do with real athletes. If they cut out the ""4-page advertisements"" every 6 pages along with all the adds at back of the magazine it would consist of the cover and a 1/2 page article. They should pay people to accept it in the mail, hard to charge for a brochure. I just wish it was more ""real"" and less about selling us on smelling like roses and wearing $350 desinger shoes, cater to the average Joe who just wants to get good info and work-out ideas. I could watch QVC and MTV to cover any lack of B.S. I may be experiencing. Your best bet is to just surf the net, buy books, save your money."
0,Review of Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer I'm sorry to say this but this book is absolutely horrible. This is my third year in college and this has to be the worst text book I've ever had. The text is not very informative and the examples are unclear. The book doesn't go into detail on most of the basic material. This is NOT a good book for an introductory level circuit analysis course.
0,"Don't waste your time I'm a second year EE engineering student with 20 years of electronics background in repairing, circuit analysis, and troubleshooting. This book is absolutly worthless. The auther jumps to great leaps of understanding with littel or no background to show the student how they got to those conclusions. The examples are non excistant. They use ""conventional current"" which is really backward to reality. It used to be called ""hole theory"" back in the day. Go with Boylstead or somone who has a clue about teaching. If your a beginning electronics student, forget this book, you'll be lost by the 1st chapter. There are countless problems too lengthy to go into detail here. If your school is using it, spend the extra money and get somthing to actually learn from, just to pass the course."
0,"Really bad! This text book is absolutely horrible. I'm a third-year Mech Eng student. I've taken plenty of classes on hard subjects, so I know when a text book just plain sucks. This book does a pathetic job of explaining examples and basic concepts. I've spent hours trying to figure out assumptions that they should have just mentioned in the first place. And the poorly explained examples don't prepare you for the actual chapter problems. Because of the ""wordy"" writing style of the authors, basic concepts sound more complicated than they actually are; getting through the reading is a slow and tedious process.The book is utterly sterile. The only colors you'll see inside it are black and a little blue; there isn't even a picture of an actual circuit in this book. It's like it's writen for a machine."
0,"Required for course This book was required for a course, and the previous reviewers are correct...this book sucks. Also, I ordered the hardcover edition of this book, yet amazon in it's infinite wisdom (or is that total stupidity) sent me the softcover edition. Three weeks into the course and the binding is failing. Can't return the book because I need to have it in class, and I refuse to spend more money with a company that is unable to fulfill a simple order. Amazon, you suck at least as much as this book does! Perhaps Barnes and Noble will know the difference between hardcover and softcover."
0,"False Intimacy has false determinations about God & sex This book was a complete turnoff. Instead of relating to scientific, psycological explanations of sexual addiction, the author blames everything on lack of closeness with God and not being saved by Jesus Christ. This author could use a good shrink. Take respondsibilty for your actions. Is God or the absense of him respondsible for everything. What a crank. Buy this book and go to seminary school. What a waste of time and money. Pure garbage. Now I need to buy another book to find out about my sexual addiction (psycologically) not spiritually."
0,"An abomination I'm a Stanford-trained MD and practicing psychiatrist and I have to say that this book is worse than terrible. It is the most dangerous kind of religious propaganda mixed in with a hefty dose of hateful, spurious, ignorant ideas."

0,"Character sheets with different pictures Well, I expected this to contain a bunch of character sheets customized for the different occupations. Instead all it is is a few character sheets that have the picture from the main book of the different drawings of the different occupations and then a bunch of blank character sheets that you can download from the website for free. Also they are bound in the book so you can't take them out to photo copy them without tearing them out, or you just leave them in there but there is no customization at all. They're all the same. Really not worth buying. Just go to www.sengoku.com and download the character sheet for free and if you really want a picture in the blank space just photocopy it from the main book and paste it in."
0,SUTURE SELF Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Also the obnoxious Renie sounds like a real jerk with all her screaming and whatever in a hospital. One sure can not wash their hair and take a shower after shoulder surgery either. This it the first book of the series I've read and don't know if I want to read another silly one of hers. Mary Daheim should do more research on her books and quit putting them out so fast!!!!
0,"Needs a lot of doctoring An anemic effort from someone who is touted on the cover as a best-selling author. I'd go back and check out the titles that gave her that status instead of reading this book.Very weak characters, an obvious mystery, too-convenient plot devices every other page, cheap shocks that make you feel stupid when you find out what they are, characters that literally fall into the hospital room so they can spill their guts -- or confessions -- to our bed-ridden mystery solver... And someone has the gall to compare her to Miss Marple. (She blushes modestly when they do so.)Search a little farther on Amazon and I'm sure you'll find something that is worth your time. Try Janet Evanovich or Katy Munger. Their stuff will treat you as if you're an adult reader and not a child."
0,"Requires too much strength for toddlers The springs on this toy are extremely tight, making it very difficult for babies and toddlers to operate.

0,"""eh"" What was I thinking? Ok I loath britney and Christina.And though I'm more of a Rock Music kinda guy myself, even I sometimes get pulled in by alot of catchy tunes from the secular pop music world. And sometimes I hate myself for singing that shallow filth. Stacie is SO GREAT! I've heard all the songs from her album. They're all so good, and the quality is far beyond Britney or Christina. Cause the only good songs on any of there albums are typically the singles. Stacie's lyrics are uplifting, but never cheesy. The beats are too hot! She sounds nothing like a 14yr old. I am now an official Fan and will buy anything she comes out with! I think she's way better then Rachael Lampa, but thats only cause her music has faster beats."

0,"Was Larry alive when he made this? Terrible! 1. Yes--> I am a Larry Carlton fan--> I've seen him numerous times over the years. As a baseline, my favorite albums are his earlier efforts etc... My favorite song (s) are strikes twice and mulberry street.2. Which makes this all the more frustrating--> how can such a great musician turn out such... completely boring music? I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album."

I can't bring up one specific dance routine to learn off of the menu, I can only hit""play all"" then fast forward to the routine I want to work on.Plus on the first dance he starts out doing the dance for like 3-4 minutes, then he teaches you the steps, then another minute of dance time... shouldn't he begin with teaching the steps, then go into an extended dance time?"
0,"Rip Off First, the DVD was produced in Germany, and you have your choice of the instructor speaking in his native German or dubbed into English. Second, the German-language menu works, but the English-language menu does not. The only way to navigate through the English version is to either fast forward or keep jumping to the next chapter. Third, this is not for beginners. I'm a beginner and I should know."

0,Not Worth It This product constantly connects and disconnects every two seconds. I have an HP and the connector plates don't line up either. Every two seconds the included program refreshes the network list and connects and disconnects. It does not work.
0,Doesn't work This product will come up with the networks in the area. If you put in the network pass key it will connect then immediately disconnect.

0,"crc receive errors Installation was relatively simple, but the receiver seemed not sensitive enough for the location.After successfully connecting a mac mini with airport at the same location, I was convinced that the problem was the adapter. I installed another adapter , linksys, that worked immediately. Perhaps the super G will work in locations with clear line of site access, but it was not strong enough for my environment. I had to spend the extra money to get a working solution."
0,"Waste of money This program does have some good hiking information but it is not very user friendly at all. The maps are the worst part of it, you can either look at a small general state map or zoom to a trail map NOTHING in-between. If you want to find trails (and don't know the trail name) you have to guess on the state which only lists major cities. All you can do is click on the small state map and hope it is near the town you are looking for. If you know the trail name then it is OK. My advice is save your money and use the internet because there are many hiking web sites that have the same or more trail information and are a lot easier to use."
0,"Lacks depth. This book does not treat any topic in detail. If you just want to skim through Java concepts at 10,000 feet this is the correct book for you. The print is very sparse with lots of not very useful (rather large) images.I got mis-guided by all those 5-Star reviewes."
0,"Not Practical This book leaves much to be desired. Take the chapter called ""All About Applets"" for example. It briefly covers how browser and applets interact, parameter passing, key applet methods, and jar files, but it does not put together a cohesive, clear, practical example in the whole chapter. The best example they have is displaying a jpeg file extracted from a jar file. When am I ever going use that? Try putting together an useful applet for your web page from reading that chapter -- I know I couldn't. Fragmentation and lack of good examples occur through much of the book.Don't be fooled. This book had a 4 1/2 star rating this book had when I ordered it (with many reviews), and it's definitely not deserving of the 4 star rating it has now."
0,"Don't buy this book unless you already know JAVA The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money. Thanks to the deceiving reviews, I now need to spend more money to get a real beginner JAVA book."

0,"Mising Information/Incomplete This is one of my all time favorite books but;This Kindle version is missing very important parts to the story. Every time a letter or newspaper is read it is left blank. The whole story is based on the information in the letter and newspaper clippings. They are missing in this edition, even as a previous fan of the story I am having some difficulty in following along. If you are not familiar with the story you will be completely lost."
0,"Missing Critical Text! This version is missing text. As others have noted, whenever there is a quote from a newspaper article in the story, the text is missing. The entire legend of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" which does much to set the supernatural tone of the story, is missing! I'm only in Chapter 4 and have counted 3 missing passages already."
0,"Don't bother downloading this copy As mentioned by the previous reviewer, this version is missing quite a bit of key content. Whether it's a formatting issue with the Kindle or the transcriber forgot to include the passages is unclear. But the story is unreadable without the missing text."

0,"Don't waste your money on this one! While this DVD will, in fact, be playable on a computer or a Region 1 player, the image quality is very poor. Scenes shot outdoors will be washed out and overexposed, and any rapid on-screen motion will cause the image to blur perceptibly. This gets worse as the film progresses. I got suckered into buying this clinker before warnings about the difference in regions were posted prominently. However, I don't believe incompatibility entirely accounts for the poor performance of this product: it looks and behaves like a poorly-executed copy of a copy made by a company that is not equipped (or doesn't care enough) to produce a high-quality DVD."
0,"Stick with SimCity or Capitalism 2 I was thinking ""SimCity helped me learn about real estate and land use in a fun way, so maybe this game might help me learn something."" This game has no educational value. But more importantly, it wasn't even fun.Okay, maybe it was fun for about an hour as I learned my way around the game. But that was mostly anticipation. I then realized that I'd seen all there was to see. Don't waste your time. This game is simplistic and has no depth whatsoever. SimCity is still the best real estate game around, even if it is only in a roundabout sort of way. If you want a good, educational business game, try Capitalism 2. Good tutorials and an actual understanding of how businesses run. If you want a fun business game, there are plenty of other tycoon games that have to be better than this."
0,Not so great. DISAPPOINTING!!! This album was a complete let down. It is watered down. As bland as a piece of toast with no butter. Plain rock. Nothing Ducky Boys about it. I hate this album. I really do. I hope that they realize this and never attempt this type of sound again.

0,"Great collection - horrible quality As much as I love The Untouchables and was dying for someone to put all their classics to CD, this is not what I thought I'd be typing here. Cherry Red's remastering has terrible sound quality. Compared to the original vinyls, it sounds like you're listeing to these songs through giant ear muffs. None of the edge and liveliness, neither the great guitar kicks nor the low beaty thumps, that IS the distinct Untouchable sound gets conveyed here."
0,"Bleh! Honestly, I'm shocked that this production has received such high praise. I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed. She just creeped me out.Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it."

0,"Don't buy it! I never saw the movie when it first came out in film, so I thought I would buy it. It is the worst movie I ever saw in my life and I am a movie buff.

0,"Horrible, wretched, totally overrated Unless you are one of those men who thinks any film with lots of female nudity is ""art,"" skip this.

I try to give LTIP another chance every severalyears or so, hoping that something in me has changed or maturedso that I ""get it"" a bit better. Well, I haven't or can't. It still seems like an indulgent, boring mess. Yes, Brando can act.Yes, Maria Schneider has a fantastic 20-year old body. What does it all add up to? Nothing! A 2 hour waste of time. A movie with a totally emoty story and emotional core. I like a lot of stufffrom the late '60s and early '70s, but if sitting through tedium like this in the name of art was indicative of the era - thankGod we've moved on. Oh, and congratulations to the otherwise usually excellent Bertolucci and Starraro for accomplishing the impossible and making Paris look ugly."
0,"trash masquerading as art Don't waste your precicous time on this pretentious tripe. The acting is self-conciously artsy and overwrought. Brando's character is an abusive jerk, while Schneider's character just can't get enough of it. Spare me the nonsense please! If nudity is your bag, rent a Playboy video instead; you'll thank me for keeping you from losing 2 hours with this mess."
0,"Horrible! Brando is my favorite actor and he's known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job. He did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one. I am an admirer of ""off the edge"" movies and themes that are hard to take....However, this film leaves the viewerwith only one thought ""Bertolucci is a filthy, lecherous old man"". I rarely HATE a movie but this bankrupt, purely perverted film is just AWFUL. Hope Brando made a lot of money at least."
0,"Couldn't wait for it to be over! I don't understand how anyone can like this trash. It was long, plotless (besides the whole wife commiting suicide thing-I would've too if I were married to Paul), random and most of the time I was asking myself 'what the f---?'I can understand that it was shocking for the time, especially that butter scene but otherwise, it was a huge waste of time. Its amazing how many people say how great this film is and Brando, but to me he was just a mumbling psycho that terrized a young woman. They had absolutely NO chemistry and most of the time, I had no idea what they were going on about. Overrated, overrated, overrated.2+ hours of your life you'll never get back."

Yes, oh, so erotic. Marlon Brando uses a stick of BUTTER to prepare his girlfriend for... well, let your imagination soar. Its clear to me that every single reviewer who gave a good review must've been paid off handsomely. To me, words like ""vacant"", ""nihilistic"", ""empty"", instantly and effortlessly leap to mind. Quite possibly, the most over-damn-hyped, contentless, worthless film in cinematic history. I'm appalled beyond words."

0,"Beware - Product is not as pictured While the text of the item's description is for 0.5ml of Loctite 222MS threadlocker, what is pictured is, as far as I can tell, a 50ml bottle (based on a later google image search). I purchased because I wanted that bottle that was pictured that would stand upright and not leak all over. Instead, I got a tiny tube with significantly less threadlocker than was anticipated. Toolfetch doesn't charge much for the tube, but quite a bit (almost 3x) for shipping, so you won't return it if, like me, you weren't paying close enough attention and relied on their picture to be an accurate representation of what they were shipping. Based on the fact you can't blow the picture up enough to read the printing on the bottle to confirm its volume, the marked-up then marked-down pricing and the disproportionate shipping charge, I can only conclude that this was intentional on the part of toolfetch."

Yeah, these creatures are supposed to be BLIND, but yet they seem to be able to see just fine, and these dumb bimbos don't shut up. I love how ""horror"" movies like this contradict themselves at every turn. The ending is nothing but laughable. It's hard to draw the line between horror and comedy here. Just a pure joke, nothing more, unless you're another little MTV airhead who finds this kind of crap scary or entertaining."

These movies make you want something to happen so bad that u almost turn the movie off. Finally when it did get to the good parts they were pretty good. I wish the story line could have figured out a different way to find these creatures instead of showing flashbacks of people cheating with other women's husbands before he died and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. Different storyline, same characters. Might have then been awesome!"

0,"Slllloooowwwwwww and slower I made it through about an hour of this horrible picture, I kept hoping something would happen. When a monster? finally appeared, it was like watching a silly kiddie horror film, after this I said I've had enough, everyone else watching it with me felt the same way. This was the british version, uncut."
0,"Horrible film. This film is utterly horrible. Gore shoots from the creatures and women as if propelled from a pressure washer, the creatures somehow rip several of the women to shreds without their teeth coming into contact with flesh, their movements look ridiculous as they are not actually moving more quickly but the film rate is, the ""monsters"" are on camera far too much and end up looking silly rather than scary, a woman accidentally kills a companion in the heat of battle and is judged, crippled and left for dead by another of the group, a dream/gotcha ending, and a nonexistent plot.I am a fan or horror movies, but this one is just not good. It starts off with a compelling story and then ends up being a slasher flick with characters so annoying, protagonist included, that you cannot wait for them to die. Although a lot of time and money was spent on special effects, it is not a redeeming factor. As an obscure military leadership saying goes, ""You can't polish a turd."""
0,"overated and robbed Taking the classic James Cameron ALIENS premise, except going underground, this really got nowhere, despite all the great reviews--I got nowhere!

Though the book started a bit slow, it took up speed and turned into one of the best reads ever, to me. I was wondering how they would turn something so interesting and complex, and psychological into a video. They didn't. This does not, at all, represent that book. If it pretended to and I were the author, I would sue. What a travesty. Boring, schlock, Hollywood representation, turning every interesting story into the outlike of a horror movie that once sold well. Please, if you like the idea of this story, buy the book.

0,"Dummy Scared the Be-Jesus Out of Me Oh, God, do I remember seeing the dummy's face in the ads. That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn't. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I've seen the ad, I've nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!"
0,"Mauled again - killing bears to enrich himself Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that man is not a advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself."
0,"Sorry Jim As a former realtor, Mr. Cole owes the natural world a large debt, and believes he is doing good work. My opinion, based upon a life lived in the northern rockies, is that bears NEVER benefit from interactions with humans. The natural world is not there for us to enjoy, or understand, or study - it is simply there. If you are looking for a better understanding of bears, read Steve Herreros book and if you like pretty pictures, check out any of the other authors online who do not routinely place bears at risk by forcing encounters."
0,"harassing bears? Cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons: ""Photographer, bear advocate cited for getting too close to bruins,"" by Scott McMillion, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, 3/25/05. Cole has been cited for harassing bear in Yellowstone National Park. He hasn't had his day in court yet, but you've got to wonder. It's easy to get close-up photos of grizzly/brown bears at designated (and well-managed) bear viewing areas in Alaska and Canada. To get publishable photos of grizzly bears in Yellowstone or Glacier, you've got to get so close you put yourself in danger and run the risk of driving the bears away from food they need or a place they want to be. Grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states. Why bother them when you can get photographs of grizzlies in Alaska without stressing the bears? What kind of bear advocate would do that?"

0,"Author has no creditability I have read ""In My Soul I Am Free"" that the author, Brad Steiger, wrote on the life of Paul Twitchell. The book on Twitchell was pure fiction and Steiger played the role of publicist. Twitchell fed Steiger fictional information that was never verified or researched by Steiger, and Steiger basically entered into a conspiracy with Twitchell to defraud the public. It would seem that Steiger writes a book every-other month or so. Once again, this author has no creditability what-so-ever with me. He has distorted the truth so much in the past that I don't see why the general public can trust anything or any subject coming from this author of fiction passing itself off as truth! There is a difference! Not everything is illusion! This is what the discerning mind is for... to discover your own Truth over the deceptions of others that would prevent you from discovering ITS value and worth."

0,"How dare you speak of Jarvis Christian College that way.. I was shocked and when I read this book. I went out and purchased it because I support black authors. When I found out she was my sorority sister, I was sick to my stomach. How dare she put down Jarvis Christian College, an historically black college that you she has never attended. You made my alma mater look as if the degree i received from there is worthless. I have a very successful life as do other JCC alumnus. It is up to our black authors to protray us in a positve light not degrade us. Before she writes another book she needs to get her informations researched thoroughly.

0,"Poorly written and insulting Let me first say that I read the reviews of this work and rushed out and bought it. I wish I had slowed down and read a few pages in the store, because I would have left it there. I found this book insulting on more levels then one, to the point that I was unable to finish it. All of the characters were simple and single minded with no signs of intelligent life anywhere to be found! I am at a lose of words to describe how bad this book is. I would recommend, despite what you have read here, don't buy it. For the record, I am an avid reader who enjoys the likes of Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Anne Rice, Terry McMillan, Valerie Wilson Wesley, and many others. If you want a good, easy read about African American life, I would suggest Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made. It is a much better read!"

0,Pretty Toney Unfortunately or on Purpose!!! this album was released 2 weeks ago on the Net...and I had a chance to preview it - there a handful of solid tracks but as a referral the better album is Pretty Toney - The B-Sides...every track is a hit...I dont know why Def Jam did not want to buy those songs the lyrics and production are amazing...peace.
0,"Warning The music on this CD is great. My comments have to do with the way in which Amazon describes the product. This is a CDR, without any liner notes and the track listing basically copied from the web site. But you will not learn this by looking at the Product Details. You will find this information under Editorial Reviews, where it says: This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.While this information would have been better placed under Product Details no where does it tell you that you will not receive the liner notes.Amazon is misrepresenting the product. I hope my short review will help others who are considering purchasing the CD."
0,"Design flaw prevents easy installation For a 1/2"" slip-mount installation, this diverter spout is not worth the trouble.You must unscrew the diverter's plastic nipple, remove a plastic adapter, slide it on the copper pipe, screw the plastic nipple back on, tighten the screw so as to punch a hole in the plastic, slide the plastic nipple back toward the wall, tighten the screw, and then screw the spout on after applying thread tape. That seems straightforward, but in practice it's very difficult.The problem is that the plastic nipple is too small to fit 1/2"" copper pipes longer than about 1"" from the wall. The instructions say that the pipe can be up to 2-3/4"" long, but actually this is wrong. At first I struggled with trying to install it, then broke the plastic when I could not force it to go all the way in.I elected instead to go withMoen 3808BN Kingsley Slip Fit Tub Diverter Spout, Brushed Nickel, which simply slips in and then tightens with a screw, with almost no effort."

0,"Warning: Clip Job - Search out the Original The other user comments are technically correct. The film is great... in its original version. ""Deadly China Hero,"" however, is a clipped version of the film ""Last Hero of China."" I highly recommend the original film instead of this one, which cuts out several crucial scenes and important subplots. There's no reason to settle for this hacked-up version."
0,"You don't want this version! When I first put this DVD in I noticed that they cut away the opening, then the movie starts and I can't believe my eyes as the quality of the DVD is even lower than my VCD version, this is just frustrating to watch. The subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie, the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time, the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can't even be read. Another thing is the audio, you can't switch between Cantonese and Mandarin like on my VCD, yes this too was fixed to cantonese only. There is no extra features, you might as well buy a VHS tape, which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality. It does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused VHS tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting ""customers""(read victims)."
0,"Last Hero in China - 5 stars / Deadly China Hero - no stars! Deadly China Hero is a poorly edited version of the original Last Hero in China. I'm glad so many people like it but it lacks about 15 minutes of the original movie and they are the minutes that make it a cohesive movie instead of a jumble of martial arts fights. This taking of a classic martial arts movie, chopping it up, and then releasing it under a different name has got to stop! People deserve the chance to see the original movies!"

0,"waste of money Fast deleivery as usual from Amazon, but don't waste your money. This coffee warmer doesn't keep coffee more thann lukewarm at best. Spend more on the Norpro and you'll be very satisfied. I gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it less."
0,"Shame on you, Mr Coffee! Jeez, I figured you guys KNEW about coffee! This is a terrible excuse for a warmer. It keeps your coffee slightly above body temperature, not nearly warm enough to be pleasant. I bought two of them and am tossing them out. Anyone considering this item? DON'T buy one!!!"
0,"not warm enough The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer will only keep your coffee, or whatever, a little warmer than room temperature. Bought three of these pieces of junk for the office. They're going back to the store for a refund. Coffe has to be up to a certain degree of temperature to taste right. This junker does not reach that temperature."
0,Lots to be desired Very disappointing. Barely keeps the coffee warm. 17 watts not enough. Have another brand at 25 watts and is much better. Didnt realize there was so much difference. At $10 cant expect too much. Not worth that much. Not worth returning. Dont buy if you like your coffee hot.
0,"Luke-warmish is more like it. Barely applies any heat to the cup. Fresh-off-the-stove water was luke-warm within 15 minutes. Very poor, and highly disappointing, performance. Would never buy another ""Mr. Coffee"" cup warmer."
0,"Didn't do the trick I wanted this to use for tea when I'm away from home and it doesn't get hot enough, not even tepid."
0,"Name I know but.... This thing was a waste of my money.Thought that this item would be a good buy because of the brand since I have a coffee pot that is over 10 years old and has been with me longer than anything I own,but I was wrong.It won't even keep a cup of coffee warm not to even mention hot.Save your money wait till around Christmas time and get one at the dollar stores or someplace."
0,"This coffee warmer absolutely does not work! I bought the thing, then read the reviews. I tried everything including using a flat bottom cup for maximum contact, pre-heating the cup and making sure the coffee was hot when put on the device. I left the warmer on for 5 minutes so it was ""hot"" before putting the coffee on it. When one does this, the coffee COOLS OFF(!) when on the warmer. Gets cooler! It simply does not run hot enough to work. It does work if you only put an inch of pre-heated coffee in a pre-heated cup. Then it keeps it semi hot. I took mine back to BB&B."
0,"DO NOT BUY!!! THIS DOESN'T EVEN KEEP COFFEE LUKEWARM!!! MY OLD THAT I HAD FOR OVER 20 YRS. WAS STILL WORKING, BUT THE PLASTIC WAS CRACKED UNDERNEATH,SO IT WASN'T SAFE TO USE ANYMORE. I CAN'T EVEN FIND THE BRAND ANYMORE...(IT WAS SOME LITTLE KNOWN BRAND, BUT IT SURE WORKED GREAT FOR $9.99) OH WELL, I JUST GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GULP MY COFFEE AND GET UP OFF MY REAR END AND HEAT IT IN THE MICROWAVE WHEN IT GETS LUKEWARM...UGH!!!"
0,"Didn't Work, Period I read several of the reviews before buying and kept in mind several of the recommendations. I actually ordered 2 thinking to give one as a stocking stuffer and keep one for myself. I tried the first one and it basically didn't work from the get go (broken I guess). So didn't give the other one as a gift, kept it (didn't want to give a bad gift). Finally got around to trying the second one out... put a steaming cup of hot tea on it, probably drank half the cup pretty quickly but the second half sat there for quite a while and when I went to drink it, COLD. I hate to say it but I would not recommend it."
0,Arrived defective Bought three of them for use around the house to replace one that I have had for years.All three produced a strong odor of burning plastics and electronics.
0,"Doesn't really keep the coffee hot, just luke warm. Not like the first one I had but wasn't Mr. Coffee This product does NOT keep the liquids in your cup hot, just luke warm and I would not have purchased it if I knew this. I had a different brand before and it was wonderful but after 3 years just stopped working. It kept my coffee warmer than when I first got if out of the coffee maker, so that shows you it really worked, but this Mr Coffee doesn't do that, its lukewarm at best."
0,"Enough cup thermal insulation was not possible The rating watt of this product was 17 watts. It was place, 53-55 degrees centigrade that measured surface temperature. Because wattage was low, cups enough for the surface temperature were not temperature to keep it warm, and there were not enough effects for cup thermal insulation. I expect a product with constant thermal effect (surface temperature 78-80 degrees centigrade)."
0,"Where the hey does one find a flat bottomed mug? I ordered two of this item, so certain was I that this would do the trick for my coffee staying hot. It makes complete sense to me that it needs a flat bottomed mug in order to work efficiently and I never gave a thought when ordering that a flat bottomed mug would be so elusive!I have looked high and low. If anyone reading this review knows where I can locate such an animal, please let me know before I send this purchase back. Without the aforementioned flat bottomed mug, the product does a very poor job - so poor as to be useless!"
0,The WORST!!! DO NOT BUY!!! Ok.....I threw away the one I was using in my office before this because it was no longer getting my cups of coffee hot...only tepid and therefore wasting energy. Silly me. I was SURE ( since I read all reviews) that this mug warmer by Mr. Coffee would be so great that I just tossed my old one before receiving this. HUGE mistake! This has got to be the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon! I tried for days with several different shaped mugs of tea or coffee ...nothing..none of them got more than BARELY tepid! It is very hot to the touch.....but for some ridiculous reason it WILL NOT HEAT YOUR CUP OF LIQUID....and I'm speaking of a hot cup of coffee to start with! I was so surprised that I kept trying different mugs...thinking maybe it's the shape or...??? Nothing worked. Nothing.Please do not waste your time. Do not purchase this product!!
0,"Don't waste your money I purchased the Mr. Coffee mug warmer because it was economical and I believed Mr. Coffee to be a reputable brand.Don't waste your money on this mug warmer, even if it's economical. There are good points -- nice length to the cord; convenient on/off switch. But the reason for purchasing a mug warmer is to keep the contents warm, even somewhat heated. This warmer does not do that. It barely keeps the coffee lukewarm. I previously had a warmer by Continental Electric which kept the coffee at a very nice temperature and it was never cooled to the ""tepid"" point.This model is not worth the money or effort. Check out the Continental Electric instead, even if it's more expensive."
0,"Caution: It does what it claims it will do. I have two other cup warmers, but this was to be my third. It does EXACTLY what it claims to do: it is a cup WARMER. So, if you enjoy picking up a cup of WARM coffee -- you know -- like SPIT, 99 degress in your 98.6 degree mouth, well, good news, boppers, this is the cup warmer for you!"
0,"Did not heat up enough I purchased this item for my husband, who likes very hot coffee and tea, but it does not keep beverages warm as advertised. We tried it a few times and even when his mug went straight from the coffee pot to the warmer, it didn't keep it warm. Too bad, so sad. I returned it."
0,"lukewarm I do not like my coffee HOT, but the coffee cup warmer I had for almost 30 years kept it at a very nice warm temperature. This one is barely lukewarm, and I do not have a very thick mug, which I am sure the heat would not penetrate at all. Don't waste your money."
0,You Get What You Pay For This warmer doesn't even begin to keep coffee warm. Don't waste your time or money. Very disappointed given the Mr. Coffee brand...
0,"Oversize Coaster Like other 1-star reviews, this warmer barely kept the coffee warm. And like most other cheap electronic products, the cord was too short; just enough to reach the floor with about two inches to move around. Also, don't waste your time trying to actually warm coffee, as it took about an hour and a half to go from room temperature to warm."
0,"Warmer Just to start off, warmer is just what this thing does. I like my coffee just a bit hotter. This is my second warmer and it is not any better than the first one. I bought my second warmer at Wal Mart for around $5.00. Target on line list at $9.99. The major reason I use Amozon for most of my purchases is I can find things quickly and don't have to go store to store trying to find something. As I get older it is harder to get out and shop. Most of the time I get good deals but to be careful, you can get ripped off too."
0,"Does Not Keep My Coffee Hot I decided to replace my warmer I've had for years which was not keeping my coffee as hot as it used to. After reading the reviews, I purchased this warmer and was disappointed that it didn't keep my coffee hot. My old warmer kept my coffee hotter than this one. I used the same cup on both warmers so it's not the cup I'm using. I'm sadly returning this."
0,"not worth the money This a a huge waste of money. I am so disappointed in Mr. Coffee, I've liked their other products but this does NOT keep your cup of coffee even lukewarm."
0,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer / Disappointed It does not keep coffee very warm.I can lay my hand on the warming plate with no discomfort.Hope that paints the picture you need.
0,"Doesn't keep the coffee hot, don't bother trying this one. I've read the reviews and disagree with most of them. The coffee will not stay hot, luke warm at best."
0,"NOT HOT! I know it's called a beverage warmer, but it barely does that. I wouldn't recommend this at all. I had a cup warmer by Dazey (can't find it now) and it kept my drink HOT, as it should. I mean who wants a warm beverage, which this warmer barely does."
0,Doesn't Keep Coffee Hot If you like your coffee or tea luke warm (which I don't) than maybe this is fine. I threw mine out.
0,"Safe? I recently purchased this mug warmer to keep my coffee warm while working at my desk. I plugged it in, turned it on and there was a *pop* sound, a spark, and then a little smoke. Nice idea and all but I'll take the trek to my microwave over a fire hazard."
0,"Lukewarm coffee If you like your coffee at perfect drinking temperature -- DON'T BUY THIS. It's got a cord on it long enough to reach from one room to the next, but barely warms the cup at all. The base is also too small for most mugs."
0,"Stopped working after one week. This desktop warmer worked great for one week. It kept my coffee at a nice temperature. However, after one week of use, it quit working completely."
0,"Waste of money I agree with the others who have said this does little or nothing to keep a drink warm. Lukewarm is at best, and you still have to continue to reheat a beverage if you want it to be anything close to warm or hot."
0,"1 time use only After the first use, unplugging the cable. while it was cooling down cracked voice raised then it's not heating again."
0,"Does not work as described in reviews I bought this over the lower priced version, based on reviews of people who were very happy with it. I was disappointed from day 1. It actually arrived in the mail and looked as though it was a return from someone else, as the plastic was lightly scratched on the surface.I turned it on and used it with a cup of fresh HOT coffee and it only stayed at a WARM temperature. This only kept my coffee slightly warm, right about the temperature you would go refill your coffee because it's getting cold.I will be returning this product."
0,Ugh I read four chapters and put the book up for sale without finishing it. Why do some of these romance writers think it endears us to their heroes and heroines for them to be dumber than dirt? And why do they think it's funny to repeat the same thing over and over and over?Ugh. I got rid of Bradley...and Cruisie as an author I'll pick up and read.

0,"Dangerously flawed Galbraith is an economist who could only operate in academia--in any other setting he would be a joke. In his many books, which are widely cited, he attempts to provide an economic justification to socialism. The principle flaw in this book, from which all the others radiate out, is that all spending is equal. That government spending is just as productive to the economy as personal or corporate spending. He uses this assumption to justify confiscation of wealth by the government through the tax code. Of course, we know now that most of the taxes collected by the government is at best wasted money, and at worst counterproductive to society (welfare, subsidies, foreign aid to countries that hate us, etc.)All that being said, I highly recommend reading this book. It's important to know the enemy."

0,smallville season 9-amazon (beware of DVD wrong region number) Please beware that this DVD that I purchased for use in the UK is the wrong region number. It was sold to me who live currently in the UK but it only works in region 1 DVD players which made me really unhappy to know that to watch it I need to change settings of my DVD player but it has to be watched at once because I won't be able to change settings again and again as the appliance can malfunction after that. The return policy should cover this type of problem and refund 100% in those cases. It was not advertised that it would be a problem to play it in the UK which was really not a good sign. All customers have the right to know exactly what they are paying for.I am disapointed with amazon and this company for letting that happen.
0,upset NEVER even got my order now they are telling me it is no longer available yeah season 9 of smallville dont think I will be ordering from amazon again!!!!

0,"Yep it's a Zombie episode Spoiler alert there are zombies everywhere. This was a lame attempt at a scary story, but yes Clark and Lois have a moment... again. Don't worry though this moment will be forgotten in the next episode like it always is. Oh and Green Arrow is on drugs, which is kinda interesting because he went through a drug phase in the comics after he started killing people. Though Ollie in Smallville mostly just very angsty and self-centered right now. Smallville once and awhile has some good writers get to do some very interesting plot lines but this isn't one of them."
0,The Other review was wrong I am sorry Smallville but all those touching moments don't make up for you having some terrible writers most of the time. So yeah this episode has a moment in the end but yeah its also not worth watching. Just move on to the next.
0,"Misrepresented Product As advertised, the unit is portrayed as an APC OEM replacement cartridge with OEM APC parts. When the unit arrived it was clearly a remanufactured item using batteries from ""ABC"" (manufactured in Vietnam). The advertisement as presented does not mention that the item is a remanufactured part using non-OEM parts. This is my first experience with UnbeatableSale and it will certainly be my last."
0,"Who did shoot down the Red Baron? The other side of the coin - in fairness. To be perfectly fair about it, NOVA's documentary disputes the claim made by Keri Bailey ""Kilby"" in the review regarding the death of Manfred von Richtoven - so while Bailey cites undenialble proof - NOVA's documentary shows another side of the story claiming that RAF Flier Roy Brown did not and could not have shot down the ""Red Baron."" It includes autopsy reports and photos which neither showed nor described a head wound as cited by Bailey's claim.This review is made by author of Blood of Scotland, M.E. Grant."
0,"Von Richtofen & brown This movie was not very good. It seemed like a low budget made for 3rd world TV production. The planes were hoaky and most were the wrong type for the time periods portrayed in the story. The story of the Red Baron was incorrect as well, and the ending was totally wrong. For a movie about history it was way off base."
0,"Amethyst sterling bracelet This is made OK. The stones are washed out, no color. Purchased for gifts but will not give them as it will embarrass me. I would have returned them but I was traveling and missed the deadline."
0,Viewer from NY I am in complete agreement with the viewer from MN as to the unfortunate full screen format this DVD version was produced in. What a blunder! What a loss of visual information so important to the script! I have had to make a VHS recording off of TCM when THEY presented the movie in its' Letterbox format. I hope someone smartens-up and rereleases Moonstruck on DVD that delivers all the great cinematography.
0,"Where's the letterbox? Like other reviewers, I'm baffled as to why this is not in letterbox. I can live without super-duper extras, but I have no reason to upgrade from my VHS until a widescreen version is published. The rating is reflective of my dislike of the fullscreen formatting. The movie itself is one of the great romantic comedies-a love letter to love itself, and NYC."
0,DVD Quality The first disc was defective. Returned it for replacement. The replacement is very slightly out of sync of video and audio at the end of movie. Shows poor quality control.
0,"To call this widescreen is fraud I just bought this widescreen edition and feel totally ripped off!!! I own the standard format edition, and because I love this movie so much, it was worth buying again in the widescreen format. This ""widescreen"" edition is nothing more than the standard format edition with the top and bottom chopped off! This is one time you are actually better off with the standard format edition. I watched both editions side by side, and the widescreen edition was not much wider, and missing the top and bottom of the picture! There was actually more to see in the standard format edition."
0,it would have been good if cher wasn't in it her fake italian accent ruined everything! They should have gotten a real talented italian actress to be in this movie instead.
0,"This cd doesn't hold my interest, sorry I think that it is wise to review this cd seperately, far removed from the movie that featured it.This being said, let's look at the merits of this cd. First off, it featured classical music. The classical music used here was not your regular run of the mill hits that we have come to cherish, but Italian classics. This could be good or it could be bad, it just depends on your taste for C music. In my case this music never struck a postitive nerve. I guess my taste for classical music is to love the big hits of the masters. You know the million seller tunes.I really felt like this music was a waste, as far as my individual needs are concerned. The only song I really got any kind of charge from was the non-classical piece ""Moonglow"". It really stole the show in my opinion!In all fairness, I can not ask anyone to buy this cd."
0,"moonstuck When this dvd was released, somebody struck out on the idea what a dvd concept was about. The commentary's are helpful and informative. But help me understand why this academy award winning movie is not shown in widescreen? Or not having the input of nicholas cage and his viewpoint of the making of the film? Did I mention widescreen?This film must adamantly be rereleased as a special addition in widescreen with full attention to detail then it will deserve five stars. Until then stick to video and save your money."
0,Warning - This Movie is Pan & Scan totally unacceptable. I would not buy this movie until they come out with a version with the Original Aspect Ratio.
0,"Why not a widescreen format? I absolutely agree with all previous reviews: great movie, but it should be in widescreen version on DVD. Otherwise I can watch it on tv. I hope that someday I'll be able to buy the widescreen version."
0,"Disapointed I can't believe this Great Film Has not been giventhe widescreen treatment it ,and we, deserve.Some extraswould be nice too."
0,Are you kidding me? Why on EARTH has this been released in pan and scan? I've watched my VHS copy countless times and was looking forward to replacing it with a nice widescreen DVD. But this? Fuggitaboudit!
0,"Why Is This Not Letterboxed? I have rated the ""DVD"" the lowest possible rating, although I would give the movie the highest rating. Who makes these decisions regarding full screen versus letterbox? With the advent of DVD's, there is no excuse for us to miss the incredible cinematography in all it's New York glory. I absolutely refuse to buy my own copy of this movie until it is reissued, remastered and includes some serious extras. This is one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time."
0,PRETTY GRAPHICS BUT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY BAD. NOT A GOOD BAD . JUST PLAIN BAD.PEOPLE RUN BACKWARDS AND WEAPONS FLOAT IN THE AIR.THERE IS NO THINKING TO DO ON A MISSION AS LONG AS YOU KNOW HOW TO PULL A TRIGGER.MISSIONS ARE TOO SHORT. A LOT OF EFFORT PROBABLY WENT INTO THE GAME BUT IT'S STILL JUST PLAIN AND UGLY BAD.
0,"NOT for introductory food The AAP says not to make your own green beans, spinach, squash etc. due to the higher levels of nitrates so I thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my 6 month old. The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job."
0,"Contains Tuna Oil from tuna from the ocean. NOT ALL THAT COMPLETELY ORGANIC!!! Okay were do I start, how about this may not be a wise source of DHA for your child. Watch a movie called Autism: Made In The USA, so you will know why. The movie is free on YouTube. This baby food product contains the FDA approved amount of mercury, which is in the tuna oil ingredient, in this baby food product. You may not be aware, BUT, mercury never leaves the body, unless you remove it by means of medical treatment removal; look that method up as well. Mercury is not good for your child, no matter the amount, I am a mother and involved in science. Take my advice and try something a lot more organic and mercury free. It will benefit you and your child in the long run."
0,RASH CITY Left my baby with a diaper rash after 2 days of use. I didn't suspect it was from the diapers at first until a couple weeks later I went to finish using up the package and her rash appeared again. I'll never use pampers again.
0,"Swadlers are MUCH better - these are anything but dry My son is 4 months old and we've been using Pampers swaddlers pretty much since birth. We bought the Baby Dry size two when they were on sale and it's been a horror show ever since. 120 diapers and there has hardly been a day since when we haven't had to clean up an explosive diaper. My son is breast fed and he's not on solid food so a diaper labeled ""baby dry"" SHOULD have done the trick but instead it is un-absorbant and thus very leaky. Even if the diaper hasn't shot the poo up my baby's backside while he was playing then when I place him on the changing table, it is sure to do just that, creating a mess. My husband wants to throw the diapers out, I want to give them away but it almost seems cruel to give them to someone."
0,"Not recommended. I was a Pampers lover,but not anymore. I used Pampers diaper more than three years for my first one and again for second one. But, it looks like the company makes thin diaper recently. As another mom says,""if the diaper gets too full, they just burst and the absorbant material goes everywhere."" I absolutely agree with her. Therefore, I cancelled subscription and changed to another brand."
0,"Stick to swaddlers I'm a new mom and was first I introduced to pampers swaddlers at the hospital...nice fit, wetness indicator stripe, no leaks, good absorption. Well I ordered a case of babydry by mistake thinking they were all the same. I was wrong. The baby dry are ill fitting, poorly constructed diapers that don't even need a wetness indicator because you'll see it all around your baby's sheets!!! You have to always make sure to fasten them up high and tight if not they'll leak. Also if your baby has runny stools good luck. Sometimes they'll catch it other times they won't. I also don't like how they have a plastic bag feel to them. Maybe it's just me, but my rating stays a one star."
0,"Leaks at the kid's belly Leaks at my kid's belly (especially during his sleep or nap), which is totally unacceptable.Pampers Swaddlers, Huggies, and even Costco's Kirkland Signature don't have this issue. This diaper is good for daytime only. We bought Huggies for night time or naps.Very disappointing."
0,"Expensive and not so good Until I moved to the us I used only pampers, but I have to say that the us pampers are less good and more expensive then the israeli version.My children wake up in the middle of the night due to wet diaper, with the Israeli version of pampers it never happend"
0,"HORRIBLE! These diapers are the worst. I bought them thinking that I wouldn't have any nighttime accidents & my son would wake up dry.Boy was I wrong! Carson wakes up almost every morning with spoiled sheets.I use the Pampers Sensitive during the day, & thought that the Dry Max would make him feel more dry - but he wets his diaper almost every night!They are also not as soft as the Pampers Sensitive - which was a downside to the Dry Max diapers, too.I wish I would have gotten a smaller amount, not a box of 200+. It was such a waste of my money. For a diaper that makes big promises, I am greatly disappointed."
0,"They burst when full I bought these as a ""night time"" diaper. Most of the time, they work great. However, if the diaper gets too full, they just burst and the absorbant material goes everywhere (about the consistency of little bits of tapioca). It is very difficult to get all of it off of my daughter without giving her a bath, and I worry about what chemicals it might contain. This has probably happened three times in the last two months (only putting the diapers on at night). I am going to stop using them now. As a note, my daughter weighs about 24 pounds, so we are on the low end of the weight range."
0,"hate them! Hubby brought home these diapers because we were running really low and he couldn't find the swaddlers that we normally use. I really wanted to give the diapers a chance and used them for a while, even after the first few blow-outs. There was leaking every single time. It just didn't seem to absorb anything at all. We're back to using pampers Swaddlers again and I make sure we NEVER run low!!"
0,"""Dry"" is such an exageration I only used Swaddlers and Crusers since my baby was born. Recently I wanted to try the BabyDry because they were a little cheaper. This was a BIG mistake. The babydry don't stay dry at all, especially not as long as 12 hours as advertised. It would stay dry for 4 hours maybe. These things leak (not overflow); that is it I sit my baby on my lap, after a while my pants will be wet. Moreover 90% of the time the bed will be wet in the morning, unless the baby cries in the middle of the night and I use that occasion to change her.In the end these babydry diapers are MORE EXPENSIVE than the Cruisers due to the fact that I have to change my baby a lot more often. I will NOT buy these babydry diapers again."
0,"Baby Dry - Rip Off Good deal for the price? NNOOOOO, they are the worst diapers and they rip off (Literally the velcro Rips off every other time) and the diapers are so flimsy and can not hold anywhere near the cruisers. this is the first time I ever bought them thinking they should be ok as my son is old enough to go to some economical diapers. big mistake, from last two days we had 3 leaks and two diapers velcro ripped off while trying to put the diaper. Save your self some trouble and stay away from this diaper. still do ot understand how it got such high ratings, may be people may not have tried the cruisers."
0,"Horrendous Smell! The Huggies Supreme diapers are the only diapers my wife and I will ever use! They are quality diapers that never leak for our 2 kids under 2.Plus, they don't have any disgusting scent at all! We have tried Pampers and Luvs, and not only do they leak, but they have the most horrendous scent - we had to throw them away!Trust me - Huggies diapers are worth the small amount of money more you will pay!Highly unrecommended 1 star review."
0,"Would not buy again I have been using Pampers cruisers with both of my kids, and never had any problems. But recently decided to try baby-dry diapers, and now very dissapointed that I even decided to try. For the last few nights my little girl woke up crying, because she was wet from head to toes. Baby-dry diapers are fine for daycares where the child is changed every hour, but they are horrible for the night time. I would never buy them again!"
0,"Big Disappointment ! I have been using Pampers Cruisers for the longest. One night I ran out and I had to run to the store to buy some more. They did not have the Cruisers but instead had these. I purchased them thinking if I had as much success with the Cruisers then these should not be much different from those. W R O N G !! I couldn't wait to get rid of these !! EVERY Morning my son would be soaked through the diaper, sheets all wet, and very smelly ! These hardly hold anything through the night ! The name is not fitting what so ever ! I actually can't believe that Pampers would even put their name on something like this ! The diaper is thin, cheap, and honestly a headache! If you want something that is guaranteed to hold through the night, without any of these problems, go with the Pampers Cruisers ! Because these right here are a total waste of money, manufacturing, and time ! Major Fail !!!"
0,"So sad :-( We have LOVED Pampers - have used them exclusively for all 3 of our children until now. I just upped my almost two year old from Baby Dry 4's to size 5's, expecting no big change, just help with her volume increase. Something has definitely changed! I first noticed a new chemical-like smell I never smelled with any previous Pampers Baby Dry. Then my daughter quickly developed a diaper rash. This child has never had a diaper rash a day in her life before this. I was still hesitant to believe it really could be the Pampers (they're so great! no leaks! so cheap on Amazon! I've ALWAYS used them!), but finally bought some Seventh Generation diapers to try, and the diaper rash vanished. MAJOR BUMMER!!! Why ruin such a great product, P&G? So sad to cancel my Subscribe & Save sub for these... :-("
0,Waste of money I have used pampers for a lot of years but have always used cruisers. I tried the baby dry version and couldn't be more disappointed. Just two diapersin and both were soiled through. Now I don't know what to do with the other 190!
0,"Does not justify its name!! I bought pampers baby dry for my new born. An absolute waste of money. Used only a few and i already hate them. Leaks, and becomes a wet cottony ball,and does not fit right will not suggest this to a friend! And will not use then ever!!! I have the entire box just sitting and collecting dust!"
0,"Pampers Swaddlers are MUCH MUCH BETTER! Same story here! I have been using Pampers Swaddlers for a while before buying this after reading through the reviews. What a huge mistake! It never keeps my 4 month old baby dry, I have to keep changing it as soon as he pees. I'll never buy it again!!!"
0,"Not something I would buy ever again The overall quality of Pampers has gone down so much and babydry is worse of all. after just two hours of putting it on, it breaks and actually all the inside material comes out. I had to vacuum so many times after having such incidents. no more babydry for us."
0,"Oh, how I hate these diapers!!! When I had my son 8 years ago, I swore by Pampers. They were the only brand I used. I recently tried them for my one year old daughter after using another brand and in just one week I cannot believe the amount of leaks we have had!! She is constantly soaking right through them. They sag in the back with only a small amount of liquid in them. My husband is begging me to go back to our old brand, which I am promptly going to do. I don't know if these diapers work better on boys than on girls or if they have just changed them. I HATE them! Terrible."
0,"Will Never Buy Pampers Again I have to believe we got a defective lot, but the right hand side adhesive tab tears itself free on about 2 out of 3 diapers that we put on our newborn--after the diaper is on the baby and her clothes are buttoned up. We have resorted to medical tape to hold the diapers together. This is our 3rd child, so we're pretty sure we aren't trying to put them on too tight."
0,"A big design defect My son has been using Pamper Cruiser and never had problem. So I think Baby-dry may be the same good. So I ordered some online, but am very disappointed with its design. The first time my 21-month-old wore it, it left a red mark in his thighs. One big design problem with it is the strip that adheres to the front side is not elastic, so it makes it impossible to auto-adjust itself, and is not suitable for an active toddler as it may cut into the skin. I have to return the product as I just can't use it on my son!"
0,Poor quality Quality of these diapers is NOT same as other Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers (same size 5) that I have bought before. These diapers come with very small fasteners and so they don't stick well. Diaper comes off easily. This pack is economy in quality too. I can not believe this kind of product is made by Pampers!!! Will NOT buy this 144 pack again.
0,"Weren't So Great. We didn't like these AT ALL. I am a big fan of swaddlers, and these are nothing like the soft, meshy swaddlers. These are crunchy and thin like store-brand diapers. With swaddlers I could easily let my 3 month old go overnight without a diaper change, but these leaked all over the front of me when I picked him up in the morning. Hated them."
0,"New and Improved with Sagging Technology It takes a lot for me to dislike a product, but these are terrible! After a half hour the diaper would sag and look like it was extremely wet, when in reality there was hardly anything in it. They don't seem to hold much before leaking, even doubling the diapers for overnight still doesn't prevent leakage. Definitely, not something I will ever purchase again no matter how good the price is."
0,"strong smells, no longer the old baby dry any more I have been using baby dry for a year with the subscribe of Amazon. All the past papers from size 3 to 5 are so good that I found the baby dry diaper is the best on market and Amazon did give great price for it.Lately, I got a box of diapers those are very different from what I used to have. The box size is 172 diapers instead of 156, for which I guess it is the new packing, but should be the same product. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The diaper is very different. All the diapers give out so strong smells that gave me headache. The smell is like the bad play mat or some foam you could find in the cheap way. I then ordered a replacement, and the same thing happened. I have to return. And I guess I would not buy diapers on Amazon anymore."
0,"Stick with the Pampers Swaddlers! My almost-5-month-old has never had any diaper other than a Pampers diaper on his body! I swear by Pampers!But, even though they are less expensive, the Baby Dry type are not worth it! I found them cheap looking and feeling (they could have been mistaken for a store brand.) The absorbancy in the seat of the diaper was so bad, my son would wake up from a short nap and the seat of his outfit would be wet (there was not a fit issue, he was the correct weight for the size I bought, and the leakage was not from the top of the back or sides of the diaper, but literally from the seat.) From now on, I will definitely stick with the Pampers Swaddlers type."
0,Quality declined I have bought four boxes of this product in the past year and had been very happy with it till this latest box. We had to throw away a number of the diapers because the elastic is loose and doesn't conform to the baby's thighs at all. The waistband also tears if the baby moves a lot. Very disappointed in the poor quality.
0,"""Baby Dry""?!@ These leak all over the place! I purchased these for my 7-month-old. They are supposed to keep your baby ""dry"" for up to 12 hours (box states). I'd put these on our baby at 9 p.m. By 4 a.m. they'd be full to the point that they had wet his sleeper (so we'd have to change his clothes at 4 a.m. which did not help our sleeping routine.) I would buy something else and not spend the money on Pampers again. I am now using Parent's Choice diapers from Walmart and these work better for us."
0,"A raw deal I decided to try the Pampers Dry instead of our usual Pampers Swaddlers in hopes of keeping my son more comfortable overnight, because he sleeps 8-10 hours. Huge mistake! These diapers made him more uncomfortable. He has huge sores on his bottom from these diapers. The sores developed in a little more that 24 hours of use. It started as redness and then turned into sores. At 6 months old, he has never had an issue with redness or even had diaper rash. I feel so bad for switching. Beware."
0,"Horrible Diapers I bought these diapers after using the pampers swaddlers and these are the worst diapers ever! The smell of urine seeps through the diapers. Also, they do not absorb at all...not worth the savings!"
0,"one mess after another I have been pleased with the regular pampers size 1, but I'm very disappointed with the Baby Dry Size 1. They are significantly smaller than the regular size 1 diapers and do not cover the back of my baby, so it's been one mess and clothing change after another."
0,"poor quality This is the worst diaper I have used out of all the different brand of pampers. Just because it is more in quantity doesn't mean it is a good quality. I am not ready to more on yet, so I am giving the pampers cruiser a try before I make a final decision to move to another brand of diapers. I am hoping we can still continue to do business, since I have being using this brand for 8 years for all my children."
0,"SLOW SHIPPING- WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO DRIVE TO GET THESE I PURCHASED THESE 5 DAYS AGO AND HAD FREE ""2-DAY SHIPPING"" AND HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT. WE HAVE TWO BABIES AT HOME THAT ARE BOTH IN DIAPERS SO I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD BE CONVENIENT AND I PURCHASED THESE BECAUSE WE DON'T LIVE CLOSE TO A CITY SO I WAS TRYING TO SAVE US A TRIP... WHAT A MISTAKE!!!! VERY DISATISFIED WITH AMAZON!!"
0,"Looks like old product!! I useally buying dipers from amazon.com. However, the dipers on this box are looks like old. Also, I can see the brown spots on the surface. I really want to return it, but I already opened and used some. Check your diper all the time!!"
0,"They changed the smell: yuck! Well, I don't see why people can't just leave a good product alone! This WAS a good product but this box of diapers has a bad smell. It's like Pampers has added a perfume or fragrance and now the diapers smell really bad! My son had bad diaper rash & I feel the perfume/fragrance delayed the healing of and maybe even inhibited the healing process.Not good! Will be looking for a new brand of diapers! Will never buy Pampers baby dry again and am very disappointed!"
0,"Quality dropped in the last 6 months I have 4 boys and have always alternated (for price) between Pampers and Huggies. Both diapers have gone downhill in the last 6 months. They have less absorbency, the top of the diaper in the front constantly explodes and overnight is out of the option. The strip is not as wide to catch urine, it's been cut down. Constantly waking up with both my twins soaking wet, the diaper has exploded and the more generic absorbing material sticks to everything. We've had to change out the sheets, clothes and anything else everyday. Several times, the diapers have ripped apart so bad, they needed immediate baths from all the gel coming out. I've grown more concerned, that since it's coming out so bad, it's coming out of the buttons of their clothes and them eating it. Is this a ploy to get people into buying the almost 3 times more expensive overnights? I don't know, but they certainly aren't what they have been for the last 8 years."
0,"Leaked after 4 hours We accidentally bought pampers dry instead of cruisers diapers, so we decided to try them. I immediately noticed the odor of urine. When out with gramma, they leaked after 4 hours of wear. We normally use cruisers and they have provided us consistent coverage and have never failed. Cruisers seem to cover more surface area and last for 12 hours through the night. I also do not notice the urine smell as soon as the diaper becomes wet with cruisers. We will be using cruisers from now on."
0,"Do not buy These diapers are terrible. I have been using the Pampers Cruisers and those work well. I thought I would try the Baby Dry for overnight. Every night my baby wets right through these. I have to change his entire outfit during the night, which really wakes him up and makes it difficult for him to go back to sleep. Sometimes I have to change him twice. I will not be buying these again."
0,"New design- Bad change I have used the baby dry diapers for months now. The last two boxes I have recieved do not have as much of the blue absorbant material and the diapers are overall totally different (almost flat). Although the diapers worked well for awhile, the new design leaves much to be desired."
0,"Leaking all the time I have a boy and this diapers are really bad for him and for me :-/.They are leaking all the time, even if it is a new not over wet diaper.Buy something else if you don't want to wash the clothes many times a day !!!"
0,"Too Small even when compared with other level 1 diapers I wanted to try this product for my baby girl. To my surprise, it was too small for her when compared with other brand level 1 diapers. I had to reorder my diapers again."
0,"Diaper leaked after 7 hours on the first night I bought these because my 6 month old started leaking with her Pamper Swaddlers. These said that they were for overnight protection and would last 12 hours. When I opened the package I was surprised to see that these are thinner than Swaddlers and plastic feeling. I can handle that as long as I don't have to clean urine off of my daughter, her pajamas, and her bed every morning. She sleeps 12 or so hours some nights, but still wakes up for a feeding on most nights. When she woke up after 7 hours for a feeding, her clothes were soaked. Very disappointing. Pick up a small package before you buy the value size to see if they work for you. These diapers did not work for my daughter."
0,"The Worst! I am a longtime Amazon buyer and a first time reviewer. I am also a Pampers Swaddlers devotee and so I thought, a fan of Pampers in general. I have since found that all Pampers are not created equal. I typically use Pampers Swaddlers in the day and Huggies Overnights at night for my 8 month old son - who is not by any means a ""super soaker"". I bought the Pampers Baby Dry because they had a good deal going, so I thought I would give them a try. With ""12 hours of overnight protection"", what's not to like? The first night I used these, I found my son's entire frontside wet in the morning. Okay, so it's hard to find a really good overnight disposable. Maybe I should have bought one size up from his usual. I thought, ""I'll just use them during the day..."". Well, after just 1 nap and about 3 hours in the diaper, again soaked. What a waste!"
0,They always leak. We always bought members mark diapers (we were very happy with them) until we found out about amazon mom. So I thought pampers would be the best. Not so much. They're flimsy diapers. They were always showing his booty and always leaking.
0,"Avoid these diapers unless your baby does not move Terrible diapers. We normally buy the cruisers and I accidentally purchased the baby dry diapers. The diapers continually leak! Even when they have been worn for short periods of time, they really can only hold a small amount of urine if your child is at all mobile."
0,Not a dry baby It says they are 12 hour diapers but not so much. We use them as day only diapers and change frequently. I like the dry max much better.
0,"Getting worse and worse.... I use Pampers for my kids for more than 3 years.. I always liked them, until few months ago.. I thought maybe a packages wasn't good, and then I see it again and again...1 out of 10 diapers is falling apart... ""wings"" are come off, when you try to put diaper on!!!I don't want to buy Pampers again.... :("
0,"Stinky smell in a clean diaper? No thanks! Previously we had used Earth's Best since size 1, 2.5 years ago. I recently decided to save money on his size 5s and go non-ecological with the mainstream ""best"" which are apparently Pampers. Not only do they smell like pungent baby powder out of the package, they just don't work. Our son isn't overly wet, due to regular diaper changes, but these diapers couldn't even contain pee for a 2 hour span. In addition, when he wakes up his pajamas smell like he had an accident, due to the thinness of the Pampers. And yes, more often than not he was wet through to the pajamas, sheets, etc., and if he pooped overnight, he was rewarded with a sopping wet diaper, a wedgie, and poop leaking out. We have four kids, and trust me, use Earth's Best.

0,Pampers Baby Wet These diapers absorb MUCH less than Swaddlers. They don't have a prayer of lasting through the night despite the claim they last twelve hours. Really disappointing product.
0,Horrible thin diaper leaving my 14 month SOAKED THROUGH We have been purchasing Pampers Baby Dry through Amazon Prime Subscribe and Save. This last shipment of diapers were horrible. Pampers has lost our business. The diapers were paper thin and my 14 month old boy kept waking up soaked through. Leaving the bed soaking wet. Something is horribly wrong with these diapers. We will be changing to another brand ASAP.
0,TERRIBLE! Leaks! This is the worst nighttime diaper we have used. They leak 100% of the time leaving our baby drenched in her own urine! Awful. :( I highly recommend Huggies Overnites-zero problem with leaks and a great fit.We will not attempt to use these again.
0,"Buy swaddlers not BABY DRY We got a big box of ""baby dry"" from amazon. Our experience is that my son's clothes are soaked with just a small amount of liquid. On the other hand, the ""swaddlers"" take on a ton of liquid and my son stays dry as a bone and so do his clothes. We are sending these back as defective and ordering more swaddlers."
0,"Leaky... Leaky... These are THE worst diapers I have ever used. I have never had soooo many leaks, soaked through diapers, messes all over my son, in his 28 months of life, than I have with this pack of Pampers Diapers. I will never buy Pampers again & will share my opinion to others."
0,"chemical can cause a reaction We usually put our baby in cloth diapers, but we do keep a stash of disposables on hand for trips and emergencies. I really wish pampers would go back to offering their usual 'cruiser' style diapers without the baby-dry. Our child has had a bad reaction to them-- she gets diaper rash almost immediately."
0,"I hate these diapers I like Pampers but the baby dry has got to go, it has no give to the sides and DD leaked through every one of them."
0,pampers fell apart I was very dissapointed in the quality of the last batch of pampers that I bought. 1/4 of the diapers fell apart as I was putting them on my daughter. I switched to Huggies because of this and have not bought any more pampers.
0,"Worst diapers ever These diapers are terrible. They leak in the front, through the diaper! How does that even happen? My 6 month old needed a new one every two hours, otherwise it would leak and soak his clothes. Putting him in one for bedtime was a joke. 12 hours? No way. We had to buy a case of Swaddlers for nighttime so he wouldn't soak his PJ's at night. Don't waste your money- get the Swaddlers, they're fantastic!"
0,"Deducted fundings even if I hadn't finalized the order! Started an order, which I never completed. Looked at my card and they had withheld the amount for the order, which I never completed! Called them, and they confirm that I haven't placed an order, but they are unable to credit my account in another 10 days! This was on a gift card!The customer service agent promised to take care of it first thing and he even stated that he was going to email me immediately the next morning. Two days later, after no email, I called and they have no idea of my issue, and we start over again with the talk about the 10 days. Noone seems to know why they've taken over $200 from the card."
0,"12 hour relief?! We started off with the Pampers Swaddlers, and I bought these ones by mistake. Since I had them, and the reviews were quite good, I decided to keep them. They claim to have an 'ultra absorb core for outstanding leakage protection', but my baby is 10 lbs (size 1 is for 8-14lbs), and after about 5 hours, she had actually leaked through and out onto her outfit! Not just a bit, but palpably and visibly wet! I would pay the extra money and buy the Swaddlers, which is what I have done."
0,"They leak when regular swaddler diapers don't I originally bought these diapers for my daughter to wear at night. They leaked so badly that I couldn't use them. My daughter would be soaked from her chest clear down to her socks. Of course she would wake up early. I had to wash all of her bedding and her jammies every night. You can imagine what the scene looked like when she pooped! To get rid of this box of diapers, I used them during day use, but, again, the swaddlers worked better and seemed more comfortable for my daughter. The Baby Dry seemed very thin and very uncomfortable....almost papery. Not good."
0,"New Design Leaks Loved the old design - my baby stayed dry through the night. Now, every morning he is soaked. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I didn't mind paying a premium price for the old design - it was phenomenal. The new design does not compare. I have switched to Luvs."
0,"Hate it!!! At first, I thought it was just one or two diapers that have sand like in them but it's actually the whole box of diapers that have sand in EVERY DIAPER. But I willing to give it another try. Unfortunately, the 2rd and 3rd boxes were still the same (still have tons of sand like in every diaper). The changing table and crib were filled with tiny sand like everytime I changed my baby diaper. It's freaking me out cause my baby is super active and she's at the stage where she puts everything in her mouth. So, no more Pamper Baby Dry for me."
0,"Horrible diapers I did not like these diapers at all! They leaked at night and even during the day. As soon as my 10 month old daughter peed in them, these diapers hung to the knees."
0,"HORRIBLE!!! I CHANGED FROM HUGGIES TO PAMPERS BECAUSE OF THE PRICE BUT NOW I SEE THAT HUGGIES IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE. MY SON USED PAMPERS WHEN HE WAS BORN JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE BRAND THE HOSPITAL WAS USING, BUT I QUICKLY CHANGES TO HUGGIES AND WAS VERY PLEASED. THEN I DECIDED TO GIVE PAMPERS BABY DRY A TRY SINCE THE PRICE WAS CHEAPER AND I GOT MORE DIAPERS FOR MY MONEY. THEY RAVE ABOUT A BABY DRY SYSTEM THAT LAST 12HOURS.....NOT AT ALL. MY BABY LEAKS AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS. THE DIAPERS ARE EXTREMELY THIN. I STILL HAVE SOME HUGGIES LEFT OVER AND I HAVE TO USE THOSE FOR NIGHTIME BECAUSE IF I USE THE PAMPERS MY BABY WAKES UP CRYING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NITE ALL WET THROUGH HIS ONESIE, PJ'S AND CRIB SHEET!!! HORRIBLE DIAPER...NOW I'M STUCK WITH OVER 200 DIAPERS. I'M GOING BACK TO HUGGIES AS SOON AS I FINISH THIS PACK, UNFORTUNATELY WILL HAVE TO BUY HUGGIES OVERNITES MEANWHILE I FINISH THE PAMPERS."
0,I wish there was a no star rating! These are awful! They gave our son an angry red raw rash all around his pelvic area! We even took him to the doctor thinking it may have been some time of Thrush from antibiotics! Do not purchase these if your child has sensitive skin or may be allergic to the filler!
0,"Huggies Snug and dry Is much better, and are almost same price I made a huge mistake by buying the baby dry after reading through the reviews. I thought that for the price, why not try them. What a huge mistake! I should have just bought a smaller amount to try them first. Instead we have been using these for over a month now and I have had to clean up a poop spill at least every other day. My baby was 4 months old when we started using these and since he is not eating solids yet, the poop is pretty runny. The baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on. It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the HuggiesSnug & dry from now on, The Snug and dry from huggies absorb much better that those lousy ones, Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Snug and dry or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SNUG AND DRY!!"
0,Most likely your order will not ship - do not order Do not buy diapers from Amazon. Your order will likely not ship unti lafter a couple of months or one fine day you will discover that your order has been cancelled because they ran out of stock. Not only that if your original order had multiple items on it and had qualified for free shipping they will charge you the shipping amount even though they are unable to fulfil this part of your order. I have voiced this concern strongly to CS and believe this is a false business practice they are following. If I were you I'd stay away from diaper shopping at Amazon.
0,"Surprisingly Poor Quality We use a lot of diapers and frequently go back and forth between Pampers and Huggies as our child grows. Our 18 month-old son definitely wears size 4 but this version of Pampers seems slightly too small. Worse, the stick-on flaps are much less sticky than most diapers we use. Several times his diaper has actually come loose because the flap unsticks during the night resulting in a wet boy. Not sure if this was just a bad batch or there is something different with this particular model. We have not had problems with other Pampers in the past."
0,"Terrible product, leaks over half the time We ran out of Earths Best and so I got some of these at Walgreens to hold us over. I am simply shocked that these diapers leak very badly over half the time. I was expecting these to perform better than Earths Best simply because they've been in business for so much longer and can use all the fancy chemicals. That was not the case at all. I can't believe these diapers are still on the market. It's like they have holes in them. Our son does like the Elmo image, though."
0,"Worst diaper This is a worst diaper I ever used for my kids. I bought this just to try , because of its price. This diaper is like a tissue paper. easily tear"
0,"Terrible! We went from Swaddlers Sensitive to Baby Dry and were so disappointed after less than a week that we gave them away and went back to the Swaddlers. First of all not only did they leak urine (EVERY night woke up soaked) but even during the day when I changed my four month old's diaper after only a couple of hours his skin was very damp. Now he's never had a diaper rash, and all Ive ever used to keep him dry were the swaddler and baby powder but with these diapers I started using desitin just to keep the urine off his skin. They also couldnt hold in his poops. EVERY time he pooped (not exaggerating) it was a complete blow out, down his legs, up the back of his clothes. We NEVER had this problem with the Swaddlers. I also have to agree with the post about them being too thin, feeling recycled and rough against babys skin. The Swaddlers are MUCH better."
0,"poor I was not happy with pampers diapers. I was using huggies before and after I switched to pamper, there were more leakage accidents. Plus the side wings broke couple of time while putting on diapers. So overall I was not happy with the pampers this product. I had used pampers with my first child few years ago and they were fine."
0,"Terrible diapers This baby dry diaper is supposed to be used for longer duration at nights. Out of the 5 diapers I have used, the gel balls from 2 of them burst and spread all over the house. I have been using the pampers swaddlers and the pampers cruisers but never had issues with them. I will never buy the pampers "" baby dry"" diapers again."
0,Poop leaks out the back As soon as I got these diapers I was surprised at how light and thin they were and I was also worried about the absorbent pad not running all the way to the back. The next day my fears were realized and I got poop all over my shorts. It leaked right out the back. These diapers have a cheap look to them and they perform that way too. I still have about 240 of these left so it will be a long month! My wife thought it was pretty funny though.

0,"Pampers Baby Dry Size 2 I bought these for my 5 month old because I thought they would be as good as the Swaddlers since Pampers are the best diapers, but I was sadly mistaken. The Baby Dry diapers would leak after only 1 hour of being used. It seemed like the urine would be collected in the front by the turqoise lining, but once it was full, it would bubble up & leak. One night I had to change the crib sheets twice....these diapers were a nightmare!!! Never again would I buy these."
0,No waistband! These diapers do not have a stretchy wastband. Poop frequently runs up my childs back!!! I will never use these diapers again because of all the extra laundry and mess they created for me.
0,Very bad product from Pampers its very bad diaper from Pampers.. It wont keep dry more than 2 hours.. during night i have to change my kids diaper 3 times.. thats being very worst thing.i bought new diaper for my kid.. i stop using this diaper.. i am totally unhappy with this pamper product.
0,"What a disappointment After reading the baby dry reviews, I bought a pack of 228--BIG MISTAKE! They feel ultra soggy after 2 hours (the other brands do not) and I can't even go without changing her after her early morning feeding. When we do change her, it seems like the diaper isn't wicking the moisture away properly as she seems a little damp (yes, even after just 2 hours). I'm dissatisfied that the box says 12 hour protection, when it really maxes out at about 4 hours. Even my husband asked me why I bought the crappy brand :( We absolutely love the swaddlers and swaddlers sensitive--they both make it through the night (anywhere from 8-12 hours) for my 3 month old daughter. I'm a little disappointed in Pampers right now because we have loved all their other products, but now I feel like I'm stuck with 200+ diapers that I paid for and probably won't use."
0,Diaper rash galore My baby was extremely sore after using one of these diapers for just one day. I am sending my order back because of this. No wonder it was such a great price!
0,Most of the diapers strap are useless Most of the diapers' strap are glued to diaper itself such a way that you cannot use those diapers. I am just throwing away lots of diapers without using it...
0,Pampers chemicals=rash I tried all the different diapers before converting to cloth pocket diapers. We used these Pampers for a few months before swearing off disposables completely. Pampers don't hold leaks and are filled with so many chemicals that they gave my baby a rash. I felt horrible about using something that filled up the trash so fast!
0,"Terrible for #2 Terrible poop control. Spills right out the sides and back. Absorbent for urine only, would not recommend this product. Swaddlers are much softer, and much more absorbent,I have not had any spillage events with swaddlers."
0,Does NOT stay DRY! Every single night my 11 month old daughter would wet through these diapers and get her sheets completely wet! HORRIBLE buy in my opinion!
0,"Exploding diapers Our daughter is 6 months old and 19 lbs. She has been wearing these size 3 Pampers, and we wake up to exploded diapers many mornings, with little gel beads all over DD. I'm switching to Huggies overnight, based on a co-worker's recommendation."
0,"Huggies are better . . . I, like many other reviewers, fell into the trap of buying these because they were going for a great price. My son had been wearing Huggies size 3, but I thought these might be worth a try. My husband and I now have a joke that our son has been crawling in the cobwebs again. These diapers fall apart and the fibers look like little spiderwebs hanging off his little bum. Sometimes we find our son plucking the ""webs"" off his diaper like someone plucking a chicken. I would not recommend these diapers, especially for active babies."
0,Baby Dry Runs Very Small I moved my daughter up from a size 1 Pampers Sensitive to the size 2 Baby Dry. The diapers are the exact same size. We have a blow-out every BM. I am so mad right now. How can the sizing be so off? I am stuck with two big boxes now of diapers I cannot use.
0,"Awful-chemical smell I have solely been a pampers mom but after buying these I'm thinking of trying something new.The diapers reeked of chemicals, very unhappy and very upset that I had 246 to go through. I will not buy diapers online again, at least not these."
0,"They leak, stink, and cause rashes People kept telling me to try Pampers because they hold a lot of pee. We primarily use cloth diapers and our cloth diapers work well for nighttime (11 hours) but sometimes I just hate waking up to that ammonia stink. I decided to try some different kinds of disposables to see if I could find a brand that would work all night without a change. We tried Seventh Generation and Nurtured by Nature, and they work off and on. I thought I would finally give some Pampers a try and see if the package was right. It says these are good for 12 hours. Not for us! They leak worse than the chlorine-free disposables and stink like powder. My son's closet (where these are stored) now has a stinky powdery smell. Some people might like this smell, but to me it smells bad. I decided to use them up by using them during the day and they gave my son a horrible rash.Never. Again."
0,"LEAKS !!! I AM SO DISSAPOINTED WITH THE NEW BABY DRY DIAPERS .I have been using Pampers cruisers for my son and have rarely had any leakage ..Maybe an occassional leak which is not bad.I was happy with Pampers.I decided to give ""Baby Dry"" a try bcos it claimed to have a more absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I am sooo disappointed. The core seems to be WAAAAAYYY inferior to the Cruisers core and leaks !! I started using them a few days back and my son has woken up atleast 5 nights crying bcos he was soaking wet !! :(This morning I was holding him and my shirt felt wet. The diaper was leaking and it went thru his clothes onto mine !! So its not just about night time leaks. So much for absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I was better off with my tried and trusted Cruisers.NEVER HAD SUCH A BAD CASE OF LEAKS WITH CRUISERS .......WILL NEVER USE BABY DRY DIAPERS AGAIN.I hope Pampers is not dropping its quality :("
0,"Not so Baby Dry At first we tried Pampers swaddlers, and they were great except that my baby developed a diaper rash when using them. We switched to Baby Dry, and the rash went away. However, they consistantly leaked whenever he was on his side while nursing. About 10 times I have ended up with a wet lap.Also, they do not fit very well, as they have no stretch around the waist. We switched to Huggies and they are wonderful. They haven't ever leaked and they stretch around the legs and waist."
0,"The diapers actually FALL APART. Every night we put our 1 year old in one of these diapers, and most mornings he wakes up not just leaky, but with the seams of the diaper opened up and the absorbent material all over his clothes and skin! But since we bought so many we have had to keep using them and dealing with this disgusting problem day after day.They are fine during the day, when we change him fairly often. But during the 12 hour night time they are useless. Huggies leak too, but at least they don't explode."
0,"Horrible! I won't use these again! They kept falling apart and the gel crystals went everywhere! They got all over my toddlers bed!!! I change his diaper every couple of hours, there is no way these could be used for 12 hours to keep your baby dry. I'm never buying pampers again, horrible experience with these."
0,"Amazon is very very slow in Shipping/Delivery for Diapers Amazon says the delivery is within 24 hours for diapers when you look at the item.After placing the order, it always gives the shipping date atleast 2 to 3 weeks after palcing order. You child may go the next size by the time you receive the box.Please order the next size if you ever order diapers from Amazon."
0,"I do NOT like pampers AT ALL I use these for my son, at night since he is potty trained during the day! He has woken up wet, WAY too many times, which means he is wet AND his bed! This has NEVER happened with Luvs...they are SOO much better of a diaper and cheaper too! All pamper has going for them is their name!"
0,"Never Again I decided to try these diapers instead of the swaddlers to save a few dollars. Needless to say that was a mistake. They claim to keep baby dry for up to 12 hours. My little one can't use these to sleep through the night (6 hours). I don't recommend these at all. Spend a few extra dollars on the swaddlers, you'll make your money back on the $ saved on extra laundry they cause because they leak."
0,"Leaky diaper...cheap - use Cruisers instead! I decided to buy this over the cruisers since i'd save a few dollars and get a few extra diapers at the same time. Unfortunately, this diaper would fall apart in my hands as I opened it to put it on my son. In addition, my son would leak. So i decided to go back to the cruisers and have been happy since. No more leaky diapers."
0,"good price, bad quality I buy these diapers through subscribe and save, so they come out at reasonable price. BUT the quality is not good enough. My daughter is a pretty good pooper and these diapers spil all the time! I have to change her clothes or wash sheets and mattress cover every day! The money I save on diapers i spend on detergent, energy and water.Huggies are so much better!"
0,"AWFUL These have to be the worst diapers I have ever bought! Waste of money, useless at night, they leak and smell after being worn for just a short period of time. Seventh Generation are by far the best I've used and will continue to do so, don't know what I was thinking buy these"
0,"Zero Stars - These leak! These are terrible for night use. We used them at night for a week, and they leaked at least half of the nights. Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive are much better."
0,"Diapers arrived pre-used It seems virtually impossible to just contact Amazon and tell them there was a problem with my order without writing a review or packing up the diapers in the huge box, printing out a mailing label and returning them. The diapers I've been ordering monthly (Subscribe and Save) for a long time came and when I opened the plastic packing, they appeared to have been pre-wet. They had that crunchy, beady texture that diapers get when they are exposed to water. Of course, the whole reason I have them on order monthly is because I need them regularly and these came just in time-- I had run out of diapers. I have 3 kids, 3 and under and I can't easily get to the store to get more diapers so I had to use these gross diapers on my daughters AND now I have to return them to get a refund?? Something is broken with this system."
0,"Worst diapers EVER!!!!!!!! These diapers literally FALL APART at night. Even with my son who has a pretty servere case of urine reflux (not all his urine fliters out) and these diapers decingrate(sp) This morning I spend almost 30 minutes trying to clean off the little gel balls of the diaper material off my son and changing table!! So if you have a baby that can sleep through the night and you don't want to spend 30 minutes at the changing station, spend a couple extra dollars and buy the pampers extra protection, or HUGGIES!!!"
0,Please be carefull when subscribing amazon account I am a amazon customer since Aug2010 but i never had this kind of experience that my account is charged several times in a month and same product is dumped into my home.When check with the customer care they are saying i might hit the button several times so my subscription duplicated and hence i am receiving the same product multiple time.I don't know how it is possible.Finally i am able to cancel my account.So be care full when you are subscribing and check you account(credit/debit) attached to the subscription frequently.
0,"So frustrated using Baby Bry!!! Now it is 6:00 am, Saturday. I'm so mad and just find this page to write this review. Yesterday was the second day we use Pamper Baby Dry and we yielded 4 dirty clothes and 2 dirty sheets in last 24 hours. Baby Dry leak terribly!!! It is soooo frustrated to change sheet and cloth at 5am in the weekend.Our baby is 15 days old and 9 and a half pounds today. Never got any problems using other NB or Size1 diapers.I bought a large pack of Baby Dry (252 counts, size 1). There are still about 240 left. For the last ~10 pieces Baby Dry we used, Half of them leaked. Need to figure out of a way to get rid of them."

0,pampers baby dry It gets soggy in no time and leaks out big time . The product has lost its quality .I will never buy it again .
0,"Long time user with new problem I have been using Baby Drys (via Amazon Mom) on my now 11 mo old for several months with no problems. There has been either an unannounced product change or a problem with this batch of diapers, as my child developed a severe diaper rash. The doctor confirmed it was a contact rash and the only recent change is this new box of diapers. Unfortunately, we'll be switching brands for at least the time being.Despite this problem, Amazon's customer service was great and promptly issued a refund for this product. I was pleased with the service."
0,Baby DRY? I am very unhappy with these diapers. I usually purchase Pampers Cruisers but this was such a good deal and being named BABY DRY! They leak everynight!!
0,I loved the price The price was great for my twin grandsons. After a month both babies developed a severe rash from the baby dry diapers. Other Mom's have said the same thing. Now they have switched to Huggies.
0,"leaked! These pampers leaked, one out of five times.Makes changing them much harder.I do not recomend this product to anyone."
0,"Don't buy this it should be called 2 hours dry not 12 This is the worst diaper I ever tried. I used the fisher price brand or luvs, I saw this on sale and was mislead by the 12 hour overnight protection advertisement which turns out to be more like2 hours. Maybe that was a typo LOL. Seriously this is not worth a dime and don't waste your money you will be wiping poop and peep of the floor in no time. They are no match for my 20 months old daughter"
0,Not a good product Pampers changed their diapers and added a new material (or substance) that I can only guess is suppossed to absorb moisture. It is TERRIBLE!!! It has given my littlt guy the worst diaper rash. The first box of diapers I received was great. The fit was perfect and they were identical to the ones in the hospital. The next box was totally different with that new strip and they are just awful. Do not buy them unless they are without the strip (will be white in color and just have Sesame characters). The ones with the strip are blue with sesame characters.
0,"Every poo is a blow-out I began using these diapers for my newborn, but was sorely disappointed to find that the diaper offered little protection for anyone holding my baby when she had a poo. Perhaps she is oddly shaped causing the diaper to fit poorly; however, she seems perfectly normal to me, so I am guessing it is the fault of the diaper. Every poo was a blow-out!"
0,"Worst diapers- Ever. I ordered these before our son was born. At the time, I didn't know the difference between the swaddlers and the baby dry. Well, I learned the hard way as these leak like CRAZY. I cannot convey how truly awful these are. Please spare yourself the pain and don't get these diapers. Baby dry is awful."
0,"weird fit, majorly leaks overnight These diapers have a weird high-cut fit, and our 2 1/2 year old has peed through them ENORMOUSLY both of the first two nights he wore them. Wet down to his feet. They just don't seem to have enough absorbency for the job."
0,"Welts and red rashes I have been using these diapers for both of my girls for years. My last Subscribe and Save box landed on my doorstep last week and my 15 month old daughter has had welts and red hot rashes on her diaper area ever since. I hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else and that whatever has changed is fixed quickly. For now I will switch to Seventh Generation.Last week I received my box on my doorstep and due to the new frustration free packaging, couldn't open the box with my hands anymore due to all the tape on top of the box. This makes it a bit of a frustration, instead of less."
0,"CHEAP! DO NOT BUY!! I bought this product because it was less expensive than the Pampers Cruisers and I thought it might a comparable product. WRONG!! Simply picking up the product, you can tell it isn't made as well and has a more plastic feel to it. I only gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it a ""0"". By the next day, my son had a diaper rash like none I have ever seen. My husband and I have practically had to hog-tie him to put ointment on his bottom or even bathe him. He even cried when he was sitting. We switched back to Cruisers and he is healing, thankfully, but still has marks two weeks later. We will NEVER buy this product again. Do not walk, RUN from this product."
0,Wet every morning We used Pampers swadlers and loved them. When we switched to size 4 we decided on Pampers Baby Dry. What a mistake! Every morning we woke up to our son completely wet. These diapers do not hold enough water!
0,"Feels like duct tape The baby dry diapers are terrible! I'm so glad I didn't buy them. I received them as a shower gift. They have a plastic duct tape feel to the top portion and they left my son's skin very moist. He literally had urine sitting on his skin when I opened his diaper. NOT my idea of a good diaper. I stick to Pampers Swaddlers or Pampers Cruisers, depending on which size you are using."
0,These are the worst diapers ever!!!! I bought these diapers not realizing that they were the baby dry. I usually use the swaddlers and I love them. So when I noticed these ones were different I thought it would be okay. No way!!! I used about 5 diapers and my 2 month old son blew out of every single one...keep in mind we have never had any blow outs before. So I definately would never recommend these diapers to anyone. Now I am stuck with 270 diapers I will never use...ugh
0,Pampers leak I don't often write reviews but I feel I need to. I have twin girls and have found that everytime I use Pampers they leak. The sizing is correct based on the label but they do not absorb enough through the night. I have had to change sheets many times. I do not find this happens with other diapers and Pampers are expensive.
0,Lack of quality and capacity The quality of these diapers just doesn't compare to Huggies. They don't hold up overnight for my 18 month old. I'm just sorry I bought 192 of these diapers!
0,"Not a good diaper for us Decided to try these as a cheaper alternative to Earths Best diapers. Since I read they don't have Drymax, I thought it would be okay to use. Within the first day of use, my child started getting a reddish rash. It went away as soon as we stopped using these. My feeling is that it is due to the blue colored absorbent material and/or the scent. I did not realize the diapers had a scent, since I was used to the EB diapers."
0,Do not buy this!!! We bought this baby dry I think this is great mistake done by me. Its getting wet so soon. Before we were using cruisers but we thought why don't we try this once. Never ever buy this pampers baby dry.
0,"WORST Diapers I have ever used!!! Do not waste your money They leak, they do NOT hold my daughter over through the night, they do not hold in the poop, they are thin and useless, and are loose around the leg after only an hour of wear. I opted for these instead of Huggies because I got a great deal on them... I'll never make that mistake again!"
0,"Love Pampers hate these diapers I love Pampers products and bought these with complete confidience but I was extremely disappointed.These diapers are awful, they do not hold anything and they caused my daughter to have a rash. I only wish I had bought Cruisers."
0,"Very disappointed My kids both wore Pampers. The last few times I've bought Pampers for my youngest they fall apart so easily. He doesn't even wear them that long before he has stringy diaper hanging off. I tried to chalk the first box off as maybe its a defective box or that he is so active. But after 3 boxes I know longer believe it. It doesn't leak, but just seems to fall apart (hard to describe) no matter if he's worn them for 5 min or longer. I can't wait until he is fully potty trained so he won't need them anymore. I am very disappointed"
0,"Buy Swaddlers or Cruisers Instead I tried these diapers b/c my daughter's diaper was leaking at night, and these were the worst of all of the diapers I tried. They even leaked during the day.If you have nighttime diaper leaks, try going up a size and buying Pampers Swaddlers or Cruisers instead!Pampers Swaddlers, Size 2-3 (14-22 Lbs), Economy Plus Pack, 152 SwaddlersPampers Cruisers, Size 4 (22-37 Lbs), Economy Plus Pack, 140 Cruisers"
0,"Awful... We tried a bunch of different diapers for our 2 month old. Huggies Natural, Pampers Swaddlers and Baby Dry, other Huggies and by far the most leaky diapers were Baby Dry. #1 and #2 never stayed in the diaper! Right out the sides and back and all over me...almost every time. Also, the absorbent core stuff would come out and stick to our baby's skin. Swaddlers are absolutely fabulous and we'll stick with those."
0,"These leak bad!! I have been loyal to Pampers diapers since my 13 month old was in Newborn Swaddlers. I tried these diapers because of the positive ratings and I am VERY disappointed. The diapers are rectangular and not good for a cruising baby. The front of the tabs turn under so they sometimes leak out the side. Also, they say they are suppose to last 12 hours. My daughter usually sleeps 10 hours straight at night and by morning the diaper has ""sweated"" pee through the diaper and through her pajamas and I've even had to change her sheets. I go through a lot more diapers with these because i have to change her very frequently. For some reason the Pampers Cruisers with dry max gave my daughter diaper rash so I guess I'm buying Huggies next time."
0,Leak with breastfeed poop up the back! These diapers leek up the back when my baby poops! Then got to waste time and change her shirt with poop and whatever else the poop got on! Annoying!!
0,"Terrible rash! Going back to Hughies We switch to pampers for the savings but my son developed a terrible rash. After a week (treating him in the meantime with lotions, skin barriers and other topical creams), we got back to Hughies and his rask got clearly better in a couple of days. We used pampers swadllers before wihtout any problems. I found in the internet other people with similar issues:[...]If your kid has allergies or delicate skin, I will say to do not use this diapers."
0,Terrible diapers! I will never buy again I purchased these diapers thinking that Pampers is a good brand. These were terrible! A tiny amount of pee would fill these and make them very tight. I will never buy again!
0,"Horrible - how does anyone use these??? I assumed since these are a well-known brand, that they would work well. They are the worst diapers I have ever used - pee leaks stright through them, ie if you don't change the baby pretty often, their clothes will be soaked more than once a day. How am I going to use up these 200+ diapers? Ugh."
0,"Used to be our favorite until recently when the quality dropped. We had been using Pampers Baby Dry for our daughter right after she outgrew newborn size of Pampers Swaddlers. Now my daughter is almost 20 months old at size 4. We couldn't be happier with Pamper Baby Dry until the last shipment we received from Amazon. The diapers are thinner than before and leak frequently. I thought it may be a bad batch and bought a smaller size of the same product from a department store. They were exactly the same and also caused leaks. The leaks happen both at morning and night times. I'm too disappointed in the product to give it a 3rd try. We are switching to Huggies Snug & Dry. Hopefully, they will work better."
0,"Worst diaper we ever tried This is the worst diaper we ever tried. After my 20 months old daughter go to bad (changing diaper at 9pm) we have to change it at around 4am, otherwise she (her outfit, bad and comforter) will be totally wet by the morning. We had no other diaper with such an experience. During daytime it is even worse, sometimes it start letting thru everything after few hours. We use 5-7 diapers a day whereas we needed only 3-4 from cruisers. This simply have not enough absorbent to stay dry for 12 hours (as advertised)"
0,AWFUL!!! THESE DIAPERS ARE HORRIBLE. I ALWAYS BUY THE PAMPERS CRUISERS BUT SINCE THE STORE WAS OUT OF STOCK I THOUGHT PAMPERS MAKES THESE AS WELL SO THEY MUST BE GOOD AS WELL. WELL I WAS WRONG MY DAUGHTER WEARS THEM FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HER PEE PASSES THROUGH THE DIAPER. THEY SHOULD MAKE IT TO AN HOUR AT LEAST. ONE PEE AND I HAVE TO CHANGE HER DIAPER. HORRIBLE I CAN'T BELIEVE PAMPERS MAKES THESE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE DIAPERS!!!
0,"My husband even complains about these!! These diapers are junk! I recently tried some Pampers again and they were terrible! The tabs would rip off half the time and this would really make my husband disgruntled! I told him Pampers are supposed to be the ""best"" in the diaper area! He told me to stick with the Huggies! Boys and girls, quality, price, Huggies are the way to go in our household! I would not recommend these diapers for anyone, unless you like throwing unused daipers into the garbage can!"
0,"HATED these pampers! Don't buy I purchased these Pampers from Amazon for my 7 month old. These pampers have the ability to burst open in the night while your baby is sleeping. When my daughter woke up the next morning, the pamper burst open on her belly. The padding inside the pamper was released on her belly on several other occasions. I didn't have this problem with Huggies. I will NOT purchase Pampers ever again. This is a hazard and they should be recalled."
0,"I don't do novels and this is why. . . This author knew very little about ancient Egypt, it's people and it's history - and didn't bother to learn.A wast of time."
0,A looser I bought this and returned it. There must be someone out there with the right voice and reading skills to bring us Whitman's words and rhythms. Ms. Gibson's soprano sing-song doesn't make it.
0,"Whitman Glorified? Whitman Glorified?Whitman's descriptions of nature are inspired and his style exudes with the same passion as his subject. Yet, his self-absorption overshadows his talent. Whitman's poem, ""Song of Myself"" takes up a significant portion of the book, Leaves of Grass. Here, Whitman keeps no points in reserve, but spends 52 sections ""celebrating"" himself. He feels he, as man, is the great panacea. He suckles at its mercy until it fills not only his subject matter, but influences his technique and his structure as well. His intriguing mind leads the reader along, until disappointment is found in another laborious passage expounding god status and the call to ascend to his level of distorted thinking. Whitman's momentary descriptive nuggets are lost in a sea of narcissism."
0,"Do not buy this edition I compared this to many other editions and this edition is completely wrong, the structure of the poems is all messed up.It's such a pity considering Whitman's poetry that the people of Simon and Brown were not even able to print an edition that manages to respect something as simple as the spacing and lines of the poems.Here is an example of the Simon and Brown edition, exactly as it was printed by them:As I ponder'd in silence, Returning upon my poems, considering,lingering long, A Phantom arouse before me with distrustful aspect,Terrible in beauty, age, and powerIt is painfully obvious that it should be, as I have seen in all other editions I consulted:As I ponder'd in silence,Returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,Terrible in beauty, age, and power,The whole book was edited in this way, which makes it unreadable"
0,"The uninitiated... I wasn't exposed to Whitman in my education so I gave this try. I ploddingly and tediously read the introduction and the first 40 pages of this book before I threw it down.I failed and I am sorry. Certainly I am a philistine who deserves to be excoriated by the community who loves his work. Here's my attempt to make peace:If you're wondering if Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"" is a good place to start your enjoyment of poetry, go ahead and give it a whirl! You can get it used for a penny."
0,"Rip Off This edition DOES NOT contain a table of contents, which makes it impossible to navigate and totally useless overall.Save your dollar and look elsewhere."
0,"A Mistake A co-worker gave this book to me. He was more of a fan than I, but Whitman grew on me, and over the next several months, I learned to appreciate his work.However, I left this book above my toilet and was disturbed that a relative of mine snooped through it while taking a dump, discovering secrets that this co-worker and I had together. I now regret ever having read this silly book and am planning on burning it."
0,Line break hell It is frustrating that the Kindle cannot accommodate this. It was not fun to read with awkward line breaks.
0,"This book does not contain the 1855 edition! While I adore the first edition of Leaves of Grass, this book is not as advertised. I definitely encourage you to buy it in another edition. I returned mine with a note, so hopefully Amazon will change the description soon."
0,"Shameful In my opinion, this dvd did not contain any worth while figure skating coverage. My five year old was in TEARS because we could only find five second clips of actual skating. To make matters worse, there doesn't seem to be anyway to access the actual skating events, even if one is willing to pay for it. Nor does the Olympic website itself have videos of the events. I could understand if we were searching the week of the Olympics, or even that month. However, it's been close to a year. SHAME ON YOU NBC. The Olympics are not yours."
0,"Very poor I'm a HUGE Jet Li fan. I love great kung fu movies. This is not one. There is NO kung fu at all. The rest is a surreal dream that includes a guy chained to a boulder and a guy that gets stabbed and asks why he was assassinated. It may be worth a laugh, but that's a stretch."
0,"HATE IT!!!! This is the worst monitor ever. We bought 2 of these at the same time and have had nothing but problems. We use them for tv and computer monitor. These have both had to have the bulbs replaced twice!!! The first time was within the first 6 months. Now after 1.5 years of owning it, I can't wait to take it to the DUMP!!!"
0,"I hated this book I purchased this book based on the praise given in other reviews. I'm pretty well in touch with my feelings, but this book just didn't do it for me. The progression is disjointed and somewhat hard to follow and the portions that should have been emotional didn't really resonate with me. I also finished this in no more than thirty minutes. Overall, I'm just not pleased with this one."
0,"Didn't meet expectations I purchased this product expecting to save some of the shoes with soles that have dry rotted here in the Caribbean and the Shoe Goo wouldn't stay. I tried with several pairs of shoes, from tennis shoes to sandals and the results were poor in all the cases."
0,"not what I expected I bought this product to repair the rand on my hiking boot. It went on easily, but after it dried, it peeled right off the leather part of the boot,and I was able to peel it off the rest. The product was also shiny, very unlike the original rand. I followed the directions for cleaning the boot prior to application."
0,"Did not stick to the shoe! DO NOT BUY THIS... it does not repair shoes. :( We bought it hoping to fix 3 - 4 pairs of shoes. But it did not glue the sole of the shoe back on to the shoe at all. I am not sure if there is a trick we missed, but it did not work. We followed all the instructions on the package... and still failed. Save your money and buy a good new pair of shoes."

0,"Can this BE any more wrong? As a huge Audrey fan I was disgusted to see that Jennifer Love Hewit was cast to play Audrey in a biopic. Not only does JLH not resemble Audrey in any way but JLH can't act at all, in any fashion. I see this as just another chance for JLH to be overexposed as something she is not (i.e. actress, singer.) If you buy this i recomend burning it when your done."
0,"Can we give something zero stars? Didn't anyone have the courage to tell the puzzlingly popular Jennifer Love Hewitt that she was just wrong for this role? By the way, Audrey Hepburn's career did not end after Breakfast At Tiffany's. Zero stars! ZERO!"
0,"Why did she think she could play Audrey Hepburn? Jennifer Love Hewit is realy just a fad so her trying play a legend is just seems realy silly. For while I actually liked JLH well maybey not like but I could stand her after seeing this movie i lost all resepct for her. I don't think any one could play her, though I think Winona Ryder in some ways reminds me of her though doubt she'd do a TV movie. Jennifer Love Hewit maybe admires Audrey Hepburn but I still think doing this movey was bad idea. She could of helped UNACEF that's what Audrey Hepburn probaly would want to be remebered for. They didn't mention that at all (okay five second of UNACEF) they only showed two films she made and Audrey Hepburned made 27. I fond this flim very insulting to Audrey Hepburn fans."
0,"Why Did They Choose HER?! I saw this movie on television. I was really excited because I thought it would be interesting and Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite actresses. Well...This movie was AWFUL!! Why on earth would they pick Jennifer Hewitt to play Audrey Hepburn. Natile Portman might have been a better choice. As others said, the girl who played the younger Audrey did a pretty good job. Perhaps Miss Hewitt is a better actress in other shows and movies, but not this time. This movie could almost be classified as a comedy! She didn't even keep up her fake Audrey voice throughout the entire movie,and when she did use it she sounded like Audrey with one word 'CAT'.The actors who played Gregory Peck and William Holden were a joke; they were awful and didn't look or sound like either Peck or Holden. The movie showed none of Audrey's later life. If you missed seeing this on television,you didn't miss much. If you still want to see this, rent it; you might be sorry if you buy it first."
0,"Nuh uh... I could not get passed the fact during the whole movie that it was Love Hewitt ACTING as Audrey. I did not get into the role at all. The accent was off and everything. I spent the whole 3 hours sitting there not watching the movie, but only pressing pause during the commercial; thinking I might actually want to watch it later. They better put one of Audrey's other movies on the DVD along with it in order for me to buy it."
0,"Faye shoulda won an Oscar for Mommie Dearest... ...compared to this piece of tripe.A lot of people (including me) thought Audrey slaughtered the film version of My Fair Lady. Personally, I forgave Audrey for that error long ago. Is this movie her payback?Jennifer, get over your self. Your a horrid actress. I cannot believe you have gotten as far as you have in your career. I never thought anyone could miscast THEMSELVES.Since JLH played Audrey, here's some suggestions for future movies about legendary actresses...Starr Jones as Bette DavisCindy Crawford as Katherine HepburnRosanne as Marlene DietrichBea Arthur as Marilyn MonroeElizabeth Berkley as Ethel MermanTori Spelling as Judy GarlandIf JLH can play Audrey, then my list is very plausable."
0,terrible Don't bother watching this movie. The facts are all wrong. The acting is not all that god. JLH tries her best but falls flat on her face. If you want to learn about Audrey read on of the many books written on her or watch the A&E biography.
0,"very disappointing The description of JonBenet Ramsey case is very lengthy, detailed and so boooooring (already known from the media !)The ""psychic part"" of this chapter is short, just 2 pages. Short and disappointing, author writes: ""I don't claim to know who did it ...""That's it."
0,"an open letter Mr. Douglas has done a great disservice to his profession by his work on the JonBenet Ramsey case. His self-serving and patronizing chapter on the case is incredible. I knew very little about the case before reading this book, and Mr. Douglas certainly offered no credible insight into the matter. There are so many holes in his theories that I am compelled to completely disregard his opinion as entirely motivated by ego. Others have defended his integrity by pointing out that at some point in the case he refused payment for his services, but it sure was useful to have the Ramsey's cooperation for the purpose of writing this book, for example."
0,"Junk mostly I bought on of these for $5 in the bargain aisle of wal mart, I bought it just for kicks to see if it would charge my Zune, I was happy to see that it did start to charge my zune and was very happy at that point, thinking that I had finally found a USB charger for my wonderful Zune, Turns out there are 2 major problems here, this unit it way to heavy to carry around on only charged my Zune for about 5 - 10 minutes. I figured that I could always take the whole unit apart and wire it up to the 14.7V system of a car, nope, the battery pack inside is only a 9.6V pack, bad things could happen if you hooked it to 14.7v.For an 1800Mha pack, it should give more than a 10 minute charge."
0,"A heavy brick I haven't even removed this from the packaging - it's being returned.This is not a pocket-anything, it's a large heavy brick. Definitely not something to 'slip in your purse'.I'm giving it one star because of the misleading description."
0,"Defective, junk My unit will charge, and power on. However it completely discharges in less then 10 minutes when charging my ipod. This has a 1200mAh battery in it. A 30gb 5th gen ipod has a 450mAh battery. You should be able to get 2 complete charges on your ipod, but my unit wont even get 1/4 of a charge."
0,"Not so great I didn't buy this from Amazon, but mine is just not useable. As others have noted, it is quite a bit larger than I expected. Also, it seems to charge, the lights come on normally, but it will not charge anything. It won't work on my iPhone thru the USB port, and the AC port won't power an external hard drive.Mine may just be defective, but since I only paid $11 for it, it's just not worth pursuing a repair or replacement to me. However, just beware that it may not provide enough power to charge anything other than basic cell phones."
0,"Beware! You're buying old inventory! When new, these were great, but everything being offered for sale now has been sitting on the shelf for a very long time, years in fact. Batteries this old cannot be charged up again. You're just buying a paperweight!"

0,"This Isn't A ""Summer Jam"" Summer Jams are memorable- just think of ""Hollaback Girl"" by Gwen Stefani and ""Oh"" by Ciara. This song by Cassie is TOTALLY forgettable. When I first heard ""Me & U"" I thought it was just okay. But after hearing 2, 3, 4,. . ., nth times, I decided that this song was weak. The music sounds like it is looped and Cassie sings like she's half asleep. There is no emotion or intensity in this song at all. NONE. It's just bland and dreary. But I guess it's just a sample of what's more to come on her upcoming album. Anywho, this song has already been forgotten like a bowl of Ramen Noodles with hot sauce when checks come out."
0,SKIPPING CD'S MY CD OF CASSIE'S ME AND YOU SKIPS THROUGHOUT THE CD. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I'VE RECEIVED A CD FROM AMAZON THAT HAS SKIPPED. THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I ORDER ANY CD'S FROM AMAZON. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AS I FEEL I'VE SPENT MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS.THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!!
0,"Ew Cassie is so bad, she has to resort to stripping down to her panties in her video clip to get music sales. You all know that she has definately got no talent at all, and you only like her for her looks. She is just a ashanti, but with even less talent. hahaha. Her voice sounds like she was raised from the dead, because her voice sounds lazy and her song is quite boring. She has got no vocal talent."
0,"meh! A little frustrated with the seller on this one. I bought the book and realized I got the wrong one, okay, my fault, but then I tried to contact them to return it and they just ever so not subtly refused to contact me back. Tried a couple times. This book is not good at all. I have the first one, which is amazing, but this one is so not aesthetically appealing to me. The cover made me think it would be a bunch of artists like the first but in this one they are more computer based artist and artists who paint far more loosely. Maybe that would appeal to some, or a lot, I don't know, but for me my work is tighter and this book doesn't inspire me like the first one. Overall, though, seller sucks!"
0,"ZERO stars I wish there was a way I could give this ZERO stars. The quality is awful. The ""satin"" looks like pleather and the feel is disgustingly cheap.It also does not fit true to size. According to measurements, I fit into a size large. Apparently the tape measure they have at the factory is not the same as mine.Now, I'm stuck with having to find a dress in less than a month."
0,Jen I ordered according to my size. The dress fit great except for the chest area was EXTREMELY to big and there was no way to alter the dress without ruining the style. Couldn't exchange for smaller size as the rest of the dress fit great.
0,was it measured in cm instead of inches?!? This dress got here about when it was promised but it did not fit at all. I had been measured at a dress shop so I know it wasn't my own error and there's NO WAY I got measured wrong by 8 inches! Just make sure you order bigger than you need.
0,"unusable This book was printed in response to my order,i.e., on demand, and the type chosen was so small I did not even attempt to read it. There were no illustrations.I subsequently bought a used copy of the paperback edition which included a brilliant preface, the illustrations, and an exponentially easier format.I threw away the copy purchased from Amazon.Probably my only truly disappointing encounter with Amazon."
0,"The prose is great, the print/binding/print size is truly awful I have never seen such a lousy printing. Indeed, we received our copy on 31 January 2012--and saw that it had been printed on 27 January 2012. It is impossible to read. The print size is worthy of an opthamologist's chart to determine just how small a size print it is possible for the human eye to read. I do not know how Amazon can even think of selling such a copy of what is a great book. I purchased the book as a gift--I am ashamed to present it."
0,"Don't waste your money! This is a great movie - I have it on VHS and I saw it on Broadway. The DVD version is shovelware! No bonus material at all. No subtitles - no alternate languages - no bios - nothing! It is listed as the widescreen version, but it is presented in standard format with the picture and credits running off the side of the screen. To add insult to injury, you have to turn the disc over midway though the movie. Wait for somebody to bring out a better pressing."
0,"A KENNY G WANNA B ... I thought I might be finding a low priced bargain here, but to much alto and not enough tenor here for me ...This CD seems to be a Kenny G knock off ... And while I'm not a great fan of alto, Kenny G does have a way with it that elicits some sweet and often times soothing sounds (I especially like his Christmas sounds) ... Not so with Parker's as his alto comes out a little ""tin-ny"" sounding ... If I'm allowed by Amazon let me recommend Sony's ""Sax For Lovers"" or # 32. Jazz Record's ""Jazz for When You're Alone"" if you want to strike a really jazzy soft-sax-love mood ... They're both serious ""soft jazz"" tenor sax CD's by serious tenor sax artists who will get the ""gig"" done."

0,"No fun, no action, no good I'm a 10 yead old boy who loves to read! but I totally hate this book. It was a summer reading assignament from school (4th grade). Nothing happens in 148 pages of boaring, repetitive and monotonus writing.They say things over and over again. This book is lable as an Eco mistery, but it seams to me like an encyclopedia type of reading. To much unnecesary information.I would not recomend this book at all."
0,"Not for us I have never seen the British version, but we liked the American ""Queer as Folk"". It was funny and real. Series 2 is a disappointment, the action seems contrived, and so do the characters. We couldn't believe a minute of it.

0,"STILL only sending 1 instead of 6 pack, 2 year problem I realize that this ""should"" be a review about the quality of the product, BUT for almost 2 YEARS people have been commenting that they received one canvas instead of a pack of six.

I'm sorry that the manufacturer won't have people purchasing their item, but there is no excuse for a problem to continue for nearly 2 years and not be resolved."
0,"Missing The Other Five Like one of the other reviewers, I ordered this as a pack of six. However, it arrived and it was a single canvas in a giant box. What happened to the other five? When I contacted Amazon, it says that they're out of stock for these. Why is this happening to more than one person? Just be sure to check your box. The canvas was nice and actually what I wanted but I didn't want to pay for six and get one..."
0,DO NOT BUY!!! This product claims to be six canvases but in fact they only send one. IT IS A RIPOFF!! DON'T BUY.
0,"do not use in the wind I have had at least four of these in the past 3 years. If a gust of wind comes along, the frame bends and you have a bunch of scrap metal. The last one lasted about an hour and a half before one of the legs bent making the product unuseable."
0,"Poor quality, not sharp These chisels are not sharp out of the box. My skew chisel was chipped and I see from other reviews there have been more than one chipped. As another review said, I cannot sharpen the carbide tips, so I have a new set of chisels that are not as useful as my old ones that I can sharpen. Don't waste your money on these chisels."
0,"Dreadful performance I expected so much better from the great Andre Previn. This version of the greatest programmatic orchestral music of all time is simply terrible -- utterly uninspired and passionless, both in the solo piano and orchestral versions. The tone is muddy throughout, and I don't think it's the engineering: pianist and orchestra just seem listless in a piece that should leave listeners awed and thrilled. The pacing is all wrong. No definition in the percussion. The brasses sound bored. Listening to this is like reading Cliff Notes of War and Peace. Either the performers didn't understand this music or they didn't care. The best version remains Toscanini's with the NBC Symphony Orchestra: even with 1950s recording technology, scorchingly brilliant."
0,"A nice way to flood the courts with rightwing fascists Not recommended for non-neoconservatives who believe in true justice. The author is just a dog for rightwing politics. The same neonazi neocons who complain about activist judges are themselves promoting their own set in the process. If you believe in losing the Constitution and turning this country into a theocratic dictatorship, then buy this book and join the losers."
0,"Endorsed by Edwin Meese and George W. Bush As to be expected of a book endorsed by Edwin Meese and George Bush, this book talks about how to permit right wing fascism by undermining the balance of power afforded by the Judicial Branch. Phyllis is in her typical form, blasting judges for such things as ending segregation and protecting human rights. Like another reviewer said, past the title there is nothing new. If you want to see where people like Reverend Pat Mahoney, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell get their ideas of how to destroy this country by breaking down the balance of power so that they can build a murderous Theocracy, this book is for you."
0,"Not convincing and overly political I knew mrs Schlafly's ideas from reading her columns at townhall, and this book therefore taught me nothing new. If you read the book description that is displayed above, there is no more need to buy this book.Her point: modern judges are doing a bad job because the interpret the constitution instead of listening to the majority."
0,"This book is more off balanced more than our Judicial System You can't throw out the baby with the bathwater! If you feel that our Judicial system is flawed because it is not being held accountable - wouldn't that be an argument for more checks and balances not less?So then what is this really about? I believe that the author is afraid of social evolution (as evidenced by her other books.) Although I don't understand why she is - without it she couldn't be an author, lawer, columnist, AND be the mother of six. Anyways, she would like to replace our judges with know it alls like herself. She does a good job of presenting the facts that back up her agenda, but she misses any evidence of how the system that she proposes would be doomed to fail. After all, history shows us the ugly death of all previous Theocracies. If you are afraid of moving forward, this book is for you. If not save your money for a book with more balance."
0,excellent movie - poor quality this movie with its magnificant cast and its thrilling story could be recommended like all films made by master-director Damiani - but I suffered when watching the story because they sent me a copy with a rather poor image-quality (like a view through strong softening lenses)...a pity..

A month later, same problem! The coffee pours around the caraffe, not into it. I burned myself trying to clean it up, and it stained my nice kitchen floors. I'm taking it back for a different brand coffee maker, I won't be fooled three times!"

0,"Disappointed After starting to read the first of many stories in this book. I closed it and didn't read the rest. I do not like fiction because fiction is a story made up in someone else's head. I thought these would be true stories. So if you like fiction, you will like this book. If you want true cat stories, which I prefer, this is not for you. It's my own fault being disappointed in this book merely because it is fiction. I guess it's a good book, again, if you like fiction."
0,"It's a dud I'm a fan of Ian Richardson's from the FU series and when I saw tapes were finally available of him doing Sherlock Holmes I immediately bought them. They're AWFUL. He doesn't play Holmes well at all and the action in them is slow and stagey. Even the damn credits take too long to roll at the beginning. Mothers, tell your children not to do what I have done--SAVE YOUR MONEY and watch Jeremy Brett instead. Richardson seems like a natural for this role, but it's a disappointment."
0,Not Doyle It seems the object of the writer was to see how much he could rewrite and still keep some connection to the original story. For example Blessed and Booth's characters were changed from father-daughter to husband-wife just so Lestrade would look foolish for arresting the husband for the wife's murder. Nothing in this film works so I gave it to charity. If you want an Ian Richardson Sherlock Holmes get The Sign of Four.

Instead of filling the entire TV or even having black bars on the top and bottom, I have black bars on all four sides of the screen and it makes it useless to watch this on a large TV.

After the first three test cassettes the machine would not load any more tapes, so back it went. The company was apologetic and sent another shipment right away, but I have my suspicions it was a different player at all, as this one would not load a single tape. In all, I've lost a month of VHS use and am out nearly the cost of the product itself in return shipping charges, not to mention the inconvenience of repackaging and taking time out of my life to do the return. Do you have that kind of time and money?"
0,"Don't buy I purchased this Sony VCR at a Target, thinking you can rely on Sony, well I was wrong. It did not record a very good quality picture from my TV (cable). I tried switching tapes, and recorded in both EP and SP, but there was always some kind of disturbance seemingly from one particular point in the reel/head/whatever. It occurred regularly in playback, about every few seconds at the beginning of the tape, and then occurring in shorter intervals toward the end of the tape. Oh, and I used new Sony tapes, which did fine on my older Sony VCR...go figure, but don't buy it."

0,"The Invisible Plot Even Bela Lugosi couldn't save this turkey. The plot is idiotic, the supporting cast is dreadful, and the film is incredibly boring. Definitely not a classic."
0,"Waste of money-""master"" The system required a check in the rating box so I gave it a one, which is probably two too many. I have tried/owned two of these devices. The concept is good, but that is the end of the line for this product. As someone else noted the bands are not strong enough to withstand even an attempt to put your finger thru the finger holes. I even continued to try and use mine after the first hole tore loose with continued failure of the bands. At the price even if used as a squeeze ball it is too expensive."
0,Product misrepresented Discription says 2-2pound wrist weights. Product received was 2-1pound wrist weights. A deceptive rip-off!
0,"Too small! I recently purchased these wrist weights, thinking I'd be able to use them as ankle weights. I couldn't get them over my foot, but this was completely understandable because they are in fact wrist weights. This would have been fine were it not for the fact that the weights don't even fit over my hands! I am quite skinny, and pretty small, so even when I tried my best to get them on my wrist, I was cutting off my own circulation.I don't know if it was just me or some kind of fluke, but they were definitely too small, and I can't use them so I will be sending them back."
0,"Cheap Cheap Cheap The day I received these they tore open and the little beads and grannules on the inside started to come out, not to mention I have about a 5 and 1/2 inch wrist and small hands and it is very difficult to slip these on over my hands onto my wrists. I dont see how anyone with larger hands and wrists could wear them. My advice is dont waste your money because once they tear it is not worth the shipping to send them back!!"

0,"What a disappointment. We are fans of Frommer's Guide books from previous trips and choose this book from Amazon.com without reviewing it the old fashioned way - browsing through the pages/sections. Too late we discovered the book barely mentioned our destination points: Pretoria (Tshwane), and a private game reserve bordering Kruger National Park. We missed the 'where to dine' suggestions and places of interest in/near Pretoria, which have been particularly helpful in the past.In addition, we found at least one map reference that sent the reader to a page that had no corresponding text to the map cross reference. We ended up leaving the book at home."

0,"Boring, pointless, meandering Mr. Marano's story wanders...and wanders... and wanders. His characters don't interact, and their development is pointless. This book is fully 200 pages too long. How long can the demons of Hell just sit and stir to existence and still keep our attention? Not 250 pages! There are some good moments, such as the Succubus inhabiting the mouse, but they are few and far between. The premise of this novel was so very promising -- I was very excited to read it. And I was let down completely. Mr. Marano, please, next time you have a good idea for a story, please write a story, not an epic adventure of style."

0,"Chekov's Play is like a Half-Eaten Apple... Although Chekov's play accurately reflects the decline of Aristocratic power in 19th century Russia, it is unfulfilling. Mdm. Ranevskaya's Orchard is bought under her feet by a ""friend"" whose hunger for profit motivated his friendship with her. So this is the transformative moment: Mdm. Ranevskaya loses her most cherished possession, and then what? Her friend, Lopahin, feins innocense, Mdm. Ranevskaya runs off to Paris to whom or what? We never find out. It's sort of like biting into a pretty good apple only to have it fall on the ground."
0,"Reading this book was a mistake Reading this book, though it was very short, was an incredibly large waste of time! It was confusing, badly written and pointless. Reading a book where the plot is hidden in choppy sentences and weird Russian words contributed to my dislike of this book. Take my advice, if you are going to read this book dont read it before bed or you will most definatly fall asleep!"
0,"A dreadful play. ""The Cherry Orchard"" is an atrocious play. If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards. Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s). For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make. The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are. I do not recommend."
0,"Very poor book This book lost all credibility when I read the authors' attack on fundamentalism. I am a former fundamentalist, so I might be expected to have an apostate's bias against fundamentalism, but these authors are not only inaccurate but almost comically biased. The authors claim that the fundamentalists' belief in the truth of the Bible is ""borders on idolatry,"" that fundamentalists are ""often parasitic"" and define themselves not by belief in their scriptures or truth, but by their opposition to ""other approaches."" Instead of examining the mainstream Christian fundamentalist beliefs, the authors simply define all fundamentists as having ""a totally closed world view,"" and damn all fundamentalists by guilt through supposed association with the Ayatollah Khomeini, David Koresh and the Taliban.Lastly, the title is misleading, especially when sold in secular stores, as mine was. The title would more accurately be, _A Liberal Christian Response to Philosophy_, instead of the current title."

Sean Penns acting in this film will go down in history as one of the great and mighty pieces of overacting and caricature. It will be used in acting classes for yrs to come as an example of how to butcher a part beyond recognition.I have read the reviews for this film and am astounded that one single positive review was written.A biased,lousy mess that will be forgotten.

0,"Terrible dub! Completely different from original series. This sucked!The WORST English dub EVER!Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy. True fans of the manga and series should NOT buy this lame production by Funimaiton."
0,TOO MUCH PRESSURE I received one of these carafes for fathers day last year. After filling every first time you push the button to pour coffee..it pops and blows coffee all over. I have found I have to hold a paper towel over the top to keep everything dry! I have had bad luck with other Oggi coffee carafes too.
0,"Don't Waste Your Money on Oggi Coffee Carafes! This carafe doesn't not keep the coffee hot or even warm for that matter more than an hour or so, and that is only when you preheat it and fill it full of coffee. Otherwise, you will have cold coffee in no time. It is impossible to keep clean even with a bottle brush. It's stainless steel but the bottom is rusting (on the outside) and although its only 3-4 months old the lever in the lid has broken for no apparent reason. Move on to some other brand like Correlle. This one is a wast of money."
0,"Swimming against the tide, but... An improvisation is wonderful, if, and this is a huge if, an improvement on the original is made. After listening to all 15 cuts I have to say that in every case the original is more enjoyable and satisfying to me to listen to. Can you really expect Montero to improve on Vivaldi? That really is too much. However if it is not as enjoyable as the Vivaldi, why would I spend money to listen to Montero? This revue is in no way a reflection on her pianistic abilities, but it sure is a gripe about butchering classic source material.My advice, and it seems to be unique among reviewers so far, is that if you like Vivaldi, listen to Vivaldi, not Montero seeking to change Vivaldi. Or Bach. Or Scarlatti. Or Pachebel...The original is stunning...the alterations to it are just misc. music."
0,Not at all what I expected! This book seems just a vehicle to vent the author's bitterness and is a very poor representation of the experience of Catholic schooling and upbringing. I am saddened to think readers may think it is. It is neither humorous nor entertaining. I read it cover to cover looking for merit and found none. I have to give it a poor rating.
0,spirit of christmas i was not able to purchase because of mistake in pricing and advertisinig. may try later. the company contacted to advise of this mistake.
0,"A disappointment and, in the end, a waste of time I kept reading past the midpoint of the book, hoping that this was not going to be another liberal-inspired jab at the Catholic church. But, as the end wore on, sure enough all of the liberal jargon found its way in to the final chapters, pro-choice, homosexuality is OK, female priests, married priests. This is suppose to be a novel, but I hate to see an author play fast and loose with factual history to satisfy a political motive. This book is a waste of time. My first Steve Berry read, and my last."
0,"Don't waste your money This book is rife with misconceptions about the Catholic Church and is a disappointing read for anyone with even the slightest understanding of marian apparitions. The suspense builds until finally, near the end of the book, the missing portion of the ""third secret of Fatima"" is revealed. The problem is that the missing portion of the secret is preposterous and unbelievable, making the climax of the book a disappointment.I am surprised that best-selling author Steve Berry would produce a book that is so poorly researched. He has lost credibility with me and I will never read another of his books.Beyond betraying the author's ignorance of the Catholic Church, the book was poorly edited and had many typos. At one point, the name of even one of the main characters was misspelled!While many would find the book's suspense compelling, I thought reading it was a waste of time."
0,"Couldn't Finish It... I began reading Steve Berry's books in order. The first two were fine. The Third Secret was just absurd. I got almost to the end and just gave up. Very rarely will I not finish a book once I get into it. I can overlook some implausability and use my imagination when reading, but this was just too far. I thought Dan Brown's Demons & Angels was pretty farfetched at the end, but The Third Secret is even worse. I am not particularly religious, so it wasn't that I was offended by the book. I stopped reading Mr. Berry's books for quite some time after this book. I finally decided to pick up with his next book, which is much better so far.I recommend this author, in general, for some light, entertaining reading, but skip this installment."
0,I wish I could give this book a negative 5 star review. Ready for the THIRD SECRET? . . . . wait for it . . . . SPOILER ALERT!!!!here it is--GOD IS SICK OF THE CHURCH'S OPPOSITION TO HOMOSEXUALITY AND ABORTION (Among other things).
0,"A disapointing stumble I had looked forward to this book, as I enjoyed ""The Romanov Prophecy"" as a fun summer read. Unfortunately, Berry's allowed his religious and social views to turn his latest book into a screed. The hero's antagonist is a cardinal that believes in priestly celibacy and other traditional Catholic dogma, which makes him not merely wrong-headed but a scheming, blackmailing, cartoon villain who does everything but twirl his mustache as he ties the heroine to railroad tracks. The ""secret"" that Barry's concocted is intended to be ""provocative"" in the model of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" but instead the revelation manages to be both hilarious and (there's no other word for it) blasphemous at once. Save your time and your money."
0,"The ""Politically-Correct"" Secret I truly enjoyed a good portion of this book. I read it quickly because I couldn't wait to find out what the Third Secret was. But, I was so disappointed. The secret revealed by the Virgin turns out to be liberal, politically-correct nonsense. I could barely finish the book."
0,"Painful! Painfully, painfully, painfully bad! At first it's just the bad writing and the stock cardboard characters. If you're looking for psychological nuance or complexity, don't open this book. Thank God the author spared us the love scenes! But by the time the secrets are revealed, the book has descended into a comic awfulness reserved for only the greatest bad books. I was writhing and groaning on my couch. If your book club is used to reading good books, have them read this one sometime, and then sit around like the guys in Mystery Science Theater and have a great time poking fun at it. But hey, it was a best seller! Says a lot about us doesn't it?!"
0,"Sacreligious I agree with the ""disappointing"" review and would add that the resolution of the mystery could have and should have been without the author's own agenda. To suggest that the Blessed Mother would actually call for murder, suicide, abortion, homosexuality and promiscuity in the priesthood is appalling! I would not reccomend this book to anyone and as I am a full time employee of a county library in an upscale community, I will tell our patrons to pass on this novel."
0,"Borrowed plot + absurd conclusion = Big Disappointment Being a big fan of the genre, I had read quite a few of Steve Berry's books and enjoyed them up to this point. But after reading The Third Secret, I will never read another Steve Berry book again.The plot line borrowed significantly from the likes of Dan Brown in his DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons books without providing anything original besides a ludicrous conclusion. When I finally arrived at the conclusion that is so terrible it felt like I got punked by Berry, I physically threw the book down in disgust.I have never read such a terrible book in my life.Goodbye Steve Berry!"
0,"Liberal bs ""Frustrating"" is what another review said and that really hits the nail on the head. The only suspense in the whole book is waiting to see what the third secret is which takes until the very end to find out. Only to find that: 1. Suicide is O.K. 2. Priests can marry. 3. Homosexuality is O.K. 4. Abortion is O.K. So much more could have been done with this book. How many people were disturbed by the fact that the Virgin Mary actually told the pope to kill himself?"

I'm not very good on the computer end and didn't realize that this product would not work with the new ""black box"" and digital tuner etc. Still don't understand it completely, but the technician that came to my house to set it all up said I couldn't use it. With this new system coming upon us I feel that when things that won't work on your old TV should state that it would be obsolete after a few weeks. I'm a senior and had no idea that this would or could happen. However, the service and cooperation of all was superb. The customer from whom I dealt with was so friendly and helpful and gracious as well as Amazon themselves. No complaints!!! Just think for us who haven't the knowledge the obsolete items should be marked. Something of that importance needs to be known. I truly have no idea on how or if this product works. It was rated very high when I bought it, but for me it didn't rate at all. Thank you !!!!"

0,"bad design It's my first time to use TiVo. This product is not user friendly. The hardware setup requirs either network(wired) or phone line, otherwise it won't work.

It takes hours to set it up. very bad design in hardware and software.Amazon service is excellent."
0,"Horrible video quality We were really excited to finally switch from DVR to Tivo, but when our tivo came and we plugged it in, the video quality was awful. Way way worse than the TV ever was. We tried everything, got new cables, called tivo, did the software update. Nothing made it any better. It was so obviously worse than our cable ever looked, we had to return it :( We decided it wasn't worth the effort to try to get a new one. So back to DVR!"
0,"Bullsh#+!! Perhaps by the time you read this Amazon will be clearer in its TiVo description, but in case they aren't, you NEED to know that this is just the hardware for a monthly PAY service. I REALLY felt taken for a ride on this, as they referred to it as a ""service plan""-- well, I don't have a ""service plan"" on my oven, and it works just fine. It is completely misleading to call the fee they charge every month a ""service plan"".Tivo won't be getting a penny of mine. . ."

0,TiVo TCD649080 Bought this product after hooking it up I found out you need a telephone jack behind your tv to plug in a phone connection which would tie up my phone line while the TiVo calls to get the tv programing schedule in your area.

0,"Annual Contract Please be aware - even when you sign up for a ""Monthly Service Plan"" - the plan itself is an annual one - the only thing monthly is the fee. I personally find this nomenclature incredibly deceptive and purposefully misleading to customers, so I would recommend staying away from Tivo."

0,"Tivo doesn't stand behind their product and the warranty is worthless. Don't purchase the extended warranty. I purchased a 3 year extended warranty and my tivo broke after 8 months. We put up with the initial Tivo even though it would not record voice on both turners at the same time like advertised, but when the network card went out, we thought we would get it serviced. The network card went bad, so they sent me another unit, which had a hard drive failure within one day. I got a second exchange and was told my extended warranty would not cover the replacement unit and is void after the 1st exchange.Brandon the customer service person was no help at all. I will never buy anything with a tivo logo again."

Plugged the new adapter in and same problem. Called Tivo again, wasted a bunch of time with people who were clueless. Now I have to wait up 10 business days for a new tivo unit to arrive.To sum it up:-clueless customer service-no way to record at a given time without a network connection-froze oftenIt seems like Tivo is a company that has gotten ahead of itself."
0,"tivo I gave it a 1-star review because I couldn't get it to work. The Dish Network package where I live wouldn't allow me to connect with the TiVo service. Before ordering this dvr, always make sure it will work with your cable or sattelite provider."
0,Didn't work I purchased this tivo from amazon. After hooking everything up I plugged it in and it did not work. No lights or sounds at all. I called tivo's customer service line and they said it would need to be exchanged.

0,"Burned Up! Be advised before you buy a TiVo product.I bought this item from Amazon but when it arrives I find that I need to connect to the TiVo Service to complete the setup (can't use device until setup is complete). I don't have a house phone and the network is on the other side of the house so I go to Best Buy and get TiVo wireless connector.Upon getting the wireless set up it tells me that it can't find my network so I call Technical Support. Support tells me that I have to set up an account with TiVo and pay them $12.95/mo so I can use my own machine. I don't want the service. All I want to do is use the DVR. ""Well,"" the lady says, ""if you don't sign up for the service the machine won't work."""
0,"Tivo Service RIP OFF Hello All,If you were ever planning to get a Tivo remember one thing. The customer service stinks! It is easier to have a root canal than dealing with their customer service department. Once turn on you will have to cancel your credit card to have them stop charging it.Don't get me wrong I love the service but don't expect any help from their customer service department, plus get one of those ""Prepaid"" credit card to pay for the service, because if you use a real one they wont stop charging it."
0,"Quite a snag here... When I received my new TiVo I rushed right in to install and play with my new ""toy"". The instructions were clear and I followed them to the letter. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the second of the ""dual-tuner"" channels working. After many hours and much fiddling I gave up and called customer service. As it turned out my RF input was not working properly; however, I found out something extremely important. New laws require that all signals be digital beginning in 2009. Many providers are currently in the process of changing over now, and according to the customer service rep. the second channel of the ""dual channel"" system is analog only and therefore useless in the new digital environment. I was not made aware of this fact when I purchased the unit as it would have made a definite difference in my decision to purchase it."
0,"Buyer Beware When you order a Tivo with a one-year service term, Tivo promises to send you an e-mail 30 days prior to the end of the year before charging your credit card.

In theory, Lottery Master Guide appears to offer a variety of proven systems to beat the odds, but sad to say, I do not feel it lives up to its claims. I personally, would advise you to save your money and not purchase either book."
0,"NOT GOOD! do not even waste the 2.00 for the 7 day trial I have been trying to find videos I can play on my Amazon Prime Roku box for my kitties. I have one really great video, Feline Frolics, which I Highly recommend. This one, however, is terrible. It starts out with a bunch of ducks and goes on and on and on and on..with the ducks. The sounds are ok but get very annoying after awhile. They have, of all things, a turtle. ( blinks) I am not sure why they have a turtle..They also have a crocodile.. and only 1 short scene of an aquarium!! ~ and that one was at the end. The scenes are entirely too long to keep my cats attention and are exceedingly boring. I am SO glad I didn't purchase the full version. Do not waste your money..... Amazon please find more cat movies to show on PRIME.. I love the Frolics one!!!"

0,"Really bad, cheesy comedy The acting was bad, especially those of the supporting characters. The actors weren't helped by some awful dialog. The plot was rediculous, though some of that was intentional. The low-budget special effects were silly, and not in a good way. In short, don't waste your money on this stinker."
0,Dorman HELP! 38419 Door Hinge Pin and Bushing Kit I ordered 2 of these door hinge pin kits which include the bushings and clip. One package came taped up. Today I was preparing to install these door pins I noticed the black clip was missing from the taped up package. I ran to 2 different hardware stores to find a clip. Neither store had this item.I had to halt my installation today and will run to an auto parts store to buy a whole new kit so I can get the installation done.There is no contact for the seller so I will now have to eat my cost on this kit. Plus it's much cheaper at the auto parts store.
0,Incorrect parts in package I was pleased that I got my parts so quickly but after removing my door to replace the bushings and pins I discovered that one of the two identical packages contained a incorrect bushing. This incorrect part caused the job to take about twice as long since I had to stop and make a bushing. Maybe next time I'll just make the bushings and not bother with the parts made in China.
0,Billy Connolly; Live in New York Little Disapointed seems to be old material from all his other videos Just an older Billy on stage
0,"Not Funny Billy Connolly: Live in New York is a poor recording of his comedic talent both artistically and professionally. The stage set looks drab and poorly lit, much like an amateur would do on his first chance of recording finger puppets for a kindergarten class. The comedian's appearance matches that of the set, leaving his grey hair standing out as if he just stepped out of the shower. His comedy material seems impromptu, with digressions that never establishes ""The Roll"" in any of his comedy bits, stories or subjects, throughout his comedy act. To be frank, I fell asleep 3/4 of the way through the DVD and decided to use the DVD as a beverage coaster instead.I originally purchased the DVD based upon samples of his material I've heard from Satellite Radio, and I believe that there are far better recordings of this artist besides this DVD title."
0,"Billy Connolly suitable to under 5s Unlike all other Billy Connolly dvds; this one failed to offend Catholics, Muslims, women, gays, schoolteachers,foreigners and the 'Good English' Society. My wife,children and our local priest were not offended by this 'Big Yin'offering.This is suprising for a Clydeside comedian who has a 'no taboo' regime with his comedy.the reason that no offense was taken is simple.DVDs from USA do not work in the UK.Oh yes it took yonks to deliver and the girls at work got a bit spooked with the packaging from Frankfurt airport.Fingerpost in St Helens is still at war with the Hun.It does have a nice box though!"
0,Made coffe sweet I thought these would just add flavor rather than such a sweet taste. I don't like sugar in my coffee. Now I have 6 containers that I have to throw away. There used to be a product just like this that just added flavor and did not have all of the artificial sweetners. Not a good thing for someone who does not like sugar in their coffee but if you do it is good.
0,Not a Huge Fan Monique was a bit to much. Didnt really enjoy her on the mic. Loved Paul Mooney piece it was way to short. And the last comedian Corey was funny. But I wouldnt recommend anyone else to buy it. If your buying it to hear Paul Mooney's Piece your better off waiting until his new stand comes out next month. Monique ruined the DVD.
0,"A waste of time.. Well for starters monique's stand up always involve male bashing because by the looks of her I can understand and the other comedians were garbage as well (except for paul mooney). This was by far the sorriest shaquille o'neal comedy video in his production, I definitely do not think this video was funny."
0,"Not what it appeared to be The cover of this DVD shows Tarzan standing with a lion. The movie with Gordon Scott that featured that scene wasn't even one of the five movies. This is definitely not what it is portrayed as being. I was looking for Gordon Scott movies (in color), but these were black and white movies that featured several other ""Tarzans"". Only one had Gordon Scott in it, and it was not the movie that was pictured on the cover of the DVD. This was a birthday gift for someone who has been looking for Gordon Scott Tarzan movies for years, and I thought I had finally found the ""perfect"" gift.....not so."

0,"Disappointing. Regardless of what I have read here, I think this movie is not on the same technical or artistic merit as Akira or Ghost in the shell are. The graphic art is very poor, the story telling is also very badly done. Any one that is not a japanimation fan but does like pictures like the above mention, will find it as disappointing as I have. I do not recommend this title. don't waste your money ."

0,"...jusr miserable This book promotes everything that a woman should not be: stupid and submissive. I am sad for Gillian, I am totally repulsed by Broderick - a possessive and rude pig, and I am bored by the book that reaks of a day-time soap (you know what is going to happen 10 pages in advance). I am sorry, Ms. Garwood if this is an ideal love for you for it surely seems like an abuse to me. I am truely sad that women still find books like that exciting and interesting."
0,"dreadful... possibly the worst book I have ever read...her history is not good-being English the term ""Pa will paddle my backside"" is not really something that a modern English person would say let alone someone supposedly born in the reign of King Richard. It just grated so badly that the rest of it left me cold, I love historical romances/fiction but please make some effort to get the time period even remotely correct!"
0,"Annette, CA My aunt persuaded me to read this book. I am not a big fan of Romance but I gave it a try. Did this book change my mind about this geanre? No, not really. The characters seem very undeveloped - the author told us upfront what they thought and felt rather than letting them convey it through their actions. Brodick is very rude and primitive. All that comes to mind is that he talks ""gruffly"" - that word was used 98 times to describe him (and that is only where I bothered to count). As for poor Gillian, she is just too irritating even to talk about. To wrap it all up -- NOT an interesting read. (Sorry Gulie Garwood..)"
0,"on the edge of your seat Gillian claimed to be Brodick's bride to spark his curiousity. He tricked her into marriage to claim her heart. What Brodick didn't know was that in order to claim her heart, he had to give her his. He had to show her he cared.This is a truly heartstopping romance, one that I found I couldn't put down. It's about the brave, stubborn young Gillian who is the only key to finding King John's beloved jeweled box, and the only key to the toughest Hilander Lord, Brodick Sinclair's heart"
0,"Ugh!@ I was bored!!! I haven't read a Julie Garwood in 10 - 20 years. I did enjoy some; Lion's Lady, The Bride, and even ""The Secret."" But, nothing has changed with her historical novels.

I still think she is a talented writer, her contemporary novels are not that bad. Sorry . ):"

0,Refunded! No text to speech option Beware!!! No text to speech option. Amazon was wonderful and refunded the cost of the book. Amazon has great customer service. I have contacted the author and publisher to voice my option on this matter.
0,"Hated this book ... If you've read anything else, don't get this book. The information in here is SO general that it could be applied to just about anything. The book lists quick explanations of what will happen, but no information on how to respond to what you'll experience. Additionally, there were frightening statements in this book letting me know the author was no expert on the subject of baby rearing. I was exasperated to read her thought that babies should usually be placed in the backseat of the car. I think that everyone knows that is the ONLY place to put a baby in the car. Though, I'm afraid unknowledgeable people will read this book and think it's ok to do such things as put a baby in the front seat of the car.If you've read ANYTHING else, you don't need this book. In fact, if you haven't read anything else, you still don't need this book. Don't waste your time or money."
0,Not very readable inspite of interesting subject The subject matter is very interesting and the research was obviously thorough but reading it is another matter. I am afraid I just couldn't keep making myself plow through it. It surprises me that this was the Oregon Reads selection. You would have to be a truly determined reader already to get through the endless detail and absence of warmth or color in the writing.
0,seriously? I have just about every workout there is and like a challenge. The only workout I got with this video is from pushing the fast forward button because she puts a 2 to 3 minute break between every set. There are 3 workouts and each workout is only about 8 minutes if you leave out the breaks. PLEASE do not waste your money Please. I am sending this back. I have never ever done such a bad workout. It is really ridiculous that this ever got released.
0,"Horrible This DVD is a waste of money. I brought this DVD based on the 5 STARS reviews; the reviewers must be Lisa's friends and associates. There are no instructions for variations of levels. The DVD says so many reps for beginners, intermediate, and advance; but, there are no cues as to when and what levels should be doing what. There is no consideration for a learning curve or alternate ways of doing certain routines. There are way too many breaks for such a short workout routine. I purchases this DVD for an intense workout at home when I am unable to go to the gym; will have to invest in another Kettlebell workout. Lisa is making hand over fist on this DVD at the buyers expense."
0,"Not at all what I expected This workout is a waste of time. I was excited when I saw all of the reviews before the dvd came out,nothing like what the postive reviews said. You barely break a sweat or get your heart rate up do to all of the pauses. The camera work is horrible. Very boring workout. I will no be buying the second video."
0,"Save your time and money Kettlebell Bombshell with Lisa BalashI too was very disappointed with this DVD. I own quite a few workout DVDs as I like to exercise in the privacy of my own home. I've really gotten into kettle bells so I was excited when I read the reviews. It seems to give good instruction, but that's about it. The workouts aren't much of a workout. There are three minute rests between moves. I could drive to McDonald's and eat a cheeseburger before she starts on the next one. I guess you could hold the remote and keep fast-forwarding, but I have better things to do. This is the only workout DVD I've ever requested a refund for. The long, positive reviews must be from friends and business associates."
0,"For beginners... I have been a exercise dvd junkie for years, Kettlebell dvds also. Although I like the exercises presented, I have some issues with her form. I know from personal experience, if you don't have your form correct, you can cause injury to other parts of your body as I did with my knees. Also, if you're advanced, you will be working out without her instruction, as she only does the beginner workout with you. Normally, trainers will either let beginners know when their time is up and continue on with the advanced exercisers. Lisa stops working out at the beginners level, which leaves you still working out by yourself, hopefully, finishing in time for the next exercise. I did pick up some good exercises but don't use this dvd as often as I would have liked. I will be sending it down the ""resell"" road."
0,"Not worth the time or money I purchased this dvd hoping for a complete kettlebell workout. This is not that video. She has 4 different segments or ""workouts."" You would have to do all 4 just to feel that you had worked out with a kettlebell at all. The exercises are very short with very few repetitions and the breaks in between the exercises are way too long. The instructor states that she is really feeling it and her cardio was up. I was really bored and not feeling any sweat or cardio at all. Save your time and money and skip this kettlebell dvd."
0,"Not available yet,how can it be reviewed? I don't understand how a DVD that hasn't been released yet has received so many reviews-all of them great. Has this DVD been released elsewhere?"
0,"Terrible movie... I should have known better. I did know better. But, in the words of Crow T. Robot: ""I did it anyway."" What to say about this movie? Terrible, wooden, hack acting. Bad/uneven lighting. Terrible CGI special effects. Hitler's over-acting head on a bad CGI robotic body. Nazi UFO. Hack job rip-off ofIron Sky.Frankly, the special features, for what they are, are actually more interesting than the movie itself. Not that they're super-interesting. But thee are features on pre-production, cast & location and one on the main production. Each one is all of about 5+ minutes long.And there's a commentary track.But those are about the only special features and hardly salvage this stink-burger.Overall, I'll rate this one a 'pass.' I might pick up Iron Sky at some point and see if it's any better, what-so-ever. One can hope. But the general premise is hokey to begin with, so I'm not holding out much hope on that one either. =o\"
0,"Frustrating I am deeply disappointed and thoroughly frustrated with the perplexing and redundant complications of the book. It is true that the author, apart form being a very fertile textbook writer, has a very thorough approach when it comes to derivations and mathematical explanations. However, in doing this, he obscures the physics contained. The author insists on very thorough mathematical explanation without reference to intuition, making the topic more about mathematical derivations then physics. The mathematics is not complicated, it is just tedious. He does not leave anything to be done by the reader, turning the learning process into an effort of understanding how the author thinks and how he thinks you should understand the topic."
0,"Nice idea, bad quality I thought this product would really come in handy for camping. But after owning it for just a couple of days, I accidentally tipped it over and that was all it took. The lantern would not work. I sent away for a new bulb, but that did not fix the problem.This is a well thought out product that offers many handy features. Unfortunately, with typical Black and Decker quality, don't expect it to last long or to take even the slightest jarring. It could be a nice emergency item in case of a power blackout, but I would not recommend trying to take it anywhere on a trip because it is bound to break."
0,"Could have been better This is definitely not Murdock's best. Some of his books are excellent (eg., 7 Laws You must Honor to Have Uncommon Success) and some of them appear to be just pamphlets taken out of the Biblical text designed more to raise funds than to inspire with original insight into the scriptures. This book is typical of that type. One would be better off just reading the original source than reading Murdock's rehash in this one."
0,"Not Practicing What He Preaches... My mother, who worked for Mike Murdock for about a year, passed away July 28, 2005. When I sent him a letter informing him that my mother had died he began to barrage me with all kinds of sales literature thanking me for writing him, with never a word of condolence. I sent him a second ""Personal and confidential"" letter and more of the same followed. In the second letter I asked him to stop mailing me but his mailing onslaught continues. Would Jesus conduct himself in this way?Upon checking Murdock out it seems he makes a lot of questionable claims and according to the IRS he does not give all the aid and help to other people that he claims he does.My mother had a bunch of his books, including this one, and when I started to go through them as I awaited Murdock's responce, they seem to go over the same basic ""secrets"" over and over again, in different combinations. I cannot recommend following someone who will not practice what he preaches!"
0,BioTutor is lame BioTutor is the worst educational software I have ever purchased. I trusted the reviews that were posted and was a total fool for doing so. It is simply pretest questions with written explanations if you need them. I can't believe they consider this interactive. I could get this from doing the pretests in the back of my book. I will be sending this software back!
0,"It's no where near the best I was convinced that after the great reviews of this product this had to be the best on the market. Unfortunately, it was not. Frankly it's the worse I have ever tried. There really is no tutoring at all, it's all questions and if you want the answer you would have to click ""answers"" and it gives you a useless explanation. Not to mention the mistakes in some of the answers.I'm almost certain that 95% of the 5 star posts are bogus. It's impossible for an actual user to be impressed with this product. I returned mine two days after using it. This product is the WORSE in the market, I'm almost sure."

0,Too Warm or Too Cold Looks great. Fits our space. Holds right number of bottles for us. But temperature either 40 or 60 degrees. Neither good for storing wine. Cannot get the temperature we want. Would send it back. But major undertaking for me--too heavy and bulky. Keeping as extra frig.
0,Good fridge while it lasts....... This wine cooler is thermoelectric so it takes some time to cool 16 bottles that are inserted at room temp down to 55 degrees. The unit worked well and was relatively quiet when it was running. All you hear is a little fan running that cools the thermcooling fins on the back.HOWEVER-I bought this unit as a gift for my wife along with a two year warranty. Good thing to because one year and one week after purchase the unit died. Have been getting the runaround from Warrantech who don't return calls and don't really care that I have spent a month trying to get either this unit serviced or a replacement unit. I think that I will go with another brand when I buy my next one.
0,"Disappointed After reading reviews about every small wine cellar offered through Amazon, I ordered this item, hoping it would work. It arrived damaged. The cellar was sent UPS in just its original box, no extra packing to protect it. The plastic around the door was cracked. The door was also hanging at an angle. I actually considered keeping it even with the damage so I plugged it in and tested the temperature with a refrigerator thermometer. No matter what setting I put it on, the temperature remained at a constant 42 degrees which is too cold for storing red or white wine. Amazon made the return easy. They sent UPS to my house to pick up the item. I was very discouraged about the idea of ordering again. I finally ordered a Magic Chef wine cellar through Home Depot. It arrived well packed and seems to be working just fine."

0,"Educating Rita - the most sleepless movie I've seen The movie 'Educating Rita' is a film about a drunken professor, Frank, played by Michael Caine, who begins to tutor Rita, played by Julie Walters, who is a hairdresser from the lower class of society. Michael Caine wasn't acting very well, he always seemed tired and bored. Rita had a very annoying voice, so I couldn't sleep during the movie (good one!). Julie Walters didn't suit the role, she just didn't seem to enjoy it, as well as not being very good at it. I didn't like the ending, where Frank went to Australia. The best part was where Rita was arguing with Denny, who then went and burnt her books. I give it a 1/5 because I couldn't sleep during the movie"

0,"Out-dated views on a chiropractic career. Dr. Sportelli has apparently made the decision to provide a very limited view of a chiropractors role. Chiropractic is not about back pain, it is concerned with the removal of interference to the nerve system, thereby allowing the body to function closer to its potential. Chiropractic has never been about ""LOW BACK PAIN""---it is this type of misconception which has permeated our society and continues to be spurred on by texts such as this. Dr. Sportelli graduated from Palmer College of Chiropractic in the 1950's. He most certainly was not taught such nonsense at Palmer, for his pigeon-holed concept is not taught there, nor at any other good chiropractic college. Chiropractic recognizes and deals with the bodies inborn mechanisms. Dr. Sportelli's book was quite a disappointment in this and other respects. My advice, pass this one by and talk to someone at a college such as Palmer, Sherman or Life College and get the facts."

0,"This Is a Very Boring Read For some reason I thought this novel was for adults although in retrospect looking at the cover should have told me otherwise. Set in the South, North Carolina, it is the story of Jim who never knew his father. The guy died at 23 of a heart attack, and his widow remained faithful to him, never considering remarriage. However, Jim has the love and support of his three unmarried--bachelor?--uncles. They live on a farm, and this is a sort of coming-of-age story. Quite possibly adolescents might like it. But it is a dull, dull read."
0,"Let's face it - I hated it! This book was recommended to me by a co-worker. I often love to read the recommendations of others, but after this experience I will be more cautious! This book was quite simply one of the more boring books I've ever read. Its simple-minded prose irritated me to the point of distraction. I was grateful for the distraction though, because the prose itself was mind numbing. The chapters could just as well have been titled: ""Jim almost meets Ty Cobb!"" ""Jim Climbs A Tree!"" ""Jim Gets A Baseball Bat!"" and the titles would sum up every piece of action contained. The characters were lifeless and virtually indistinguishable from each other."
0,"Don't Believe the Hype Jim the Boy is terribly overrated, with a cast of cardboard characters and a wooden tone. Apparently many critics don't know how to distinguish between spare, basic prose and dumbed-down bad writing. The author is probably laughing his way to the bank, especially now that a sequel has been published. I'll just let them fall all over themselves and take a pass. God forbid there should be a movie forthcoming."
0,"Worst Book I have ever read This is like my first try at writing - over-used plot, short chapters, small vocabulary, typical charachters. This book shows no writing skills whatsoever. Look at its title. ""Jim the Boy"". Very original.Yet the dialogues freaked me out the most:""..."" Jim said""..."" Uncle Coran said""..."" said Jim""..."" Uncle Zeno said.The word ""said"" probably has the greatest number of synonyms, but Earley never used any other word.The plot is an ""oh so sweet"" typical plot that I have seen so many times. Nothing special. No twists to it. A plain, dull, stupid plot. Just another boy without a parent during Depression.I can't even say much about this book, because there's NOTHING in it. If I didn't have to read this book for my school, I would never have read it beyong the 20th page."
0,"Sentimental and embarrassing This novel might be OK for children, but for grown-ups it's an overly idealized (to put it mildly) fantasy of depression-era Southern life. I kept expecting Andy and Opie to come walking in, carrying their fishing poles; at least something funny might have happened, that way. But this earnest, plodding book about an unbelievably good world is actually kind of an insult to the way southern people really lived in the 1930s, black and white. What was the author thinking?"

0,"What book did the other reviewers read? I'm very disappointed with this book. Very vague and broad examples and not a lot of the nuts and bolts of success. Jennifer Kushell is the self crowned princess of the young entrepreneurial spirit. She claims to have launched successfull business ventures but never elaborates anywhere in her books or websites and instead offers page after page of fluff and filler on how to get ahead. After wasting my time with this book and two of her other books, I'd be skeptical of allowing her to run a lemonade stand. Please save your time and money. There are many better choices by PROVEN success stories. Multiple streams of Income by Robert Allen and How to Buy a Business: Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition by Richard A. Joseph are two of many that are a much better read for your time and money"
0,"Historically inacurate and boring to boot. I found this book to be one of the most historically inacurate books on the Wars of the Roses ever written. Tey uses the shield of ""historical fiction"" and writes as a dabbler in the history of the period; without a serious consideration of the key players. She maligns the good reputation of Sir Thomas More, and makes ridiculous assumptions about his motives that do not stand up to close academic scrutiny. In addition she bases her detectives entire investigation on a portrait that is totally unauthenticated. I found her dismissal of Historians offensive and her overall lack of scholarship depressing. Read this book if you must, but then go out and get Alison Weir's ""The Princes in the Tower"" for a more accurate view of the period."
0,"Face it, he killed them. The pro-Richard effluvium is getting rather overwhelming here, so for all of you who think this is actually a history book, I'll recommend another book by a real scholar: The Princes in the Tower, by Alison Weir."
0,"One of the most overrated mystery classics I had great difficulties through the years reading this book. After finally reading it from cover to cover, my opinion had not improved: its chief virtue is length (mercifully short). It is mostly boring and of interest chiefly to students of the famous Tower of London murders it ""analyzes"". This book owes its reputation chiefly to the rave review that the greatest of all mystery genre reviewers, the late Anthony Boucher, gave it. For once, I dissented greatly."
0,"Don't Get It, Don't Care Almost one-half way through this so-called mystery, I had to put it down. Perhaps you had to be British to care about whether Richard III killed his nephews. There seems to be more engaging historical mysteries. And what about the use of research as a device to tell a mystery tale? It simply did not work. Perhaps she could have written a history book instead? I didn't get it. Also, I doubt if I will read anything else by Tey."
0,"Slow reading... This book was a required summer reading book. It seemed like it took me the entire summer to finish it. It took a very long time to get through it, and I was confused at many times during the novel. Not recommended unless you're up for a challenge."
0,"Boring! This book is the most boring book that I ever read. I mean, all we see is this guy who has a broken leg, and who's trying to solve a mystery that occurs decades ago. What's the point?"
0,Bored to tears This book has to be the worst book.... other than Shakespeare.... that i have ever read in my high school career. It goes on and on about a murder that really doesn't matter and the guy doesn't even get out of bed.
0,"Total Crap I bought this CD player with a gift certificate I got for Christmas. First of all it ways about 10 pounds, and it only comes with only 3 secound anti-shock""which they don't tell you in the review or on the web site"". I didn't even use it as soon as I opended the box and saw how big it was I repacked it and sent it back."
0,I Wont do it again I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policyI made a mistake by buying it
0,Looks good but material tears easily Got these for Christmas from my wife. They looked great but it's February and the crotch is already completely torn out of them. Just turning over in bed is more than the material can handle. I do NOT recommend these.
0,"Ripped off. I recently bought these silk pajamas for my husband's birthday. Within a week, all the button fell off the top and the fabric frayed 2 - 3 inches wide along the seams in the pants along the thighs. I paid $160 dollars for these pajamas, more than silk PJs listed from other suppliers on Amazon, expecting I was buying quality. After a week's use, they are heading for the rag bag and I feel defrauded."
0,"Bait and switch at its worst The product I received in no way resembles the Vanilla Fields cologne I've been buying for years. The bottle is not the same, but more important, the fragance is unfamiliar, and malodorous. Caveat emptor."
0,"It's not new, it's used It arrived in an amazon box with cushion. Inside the perfume box was beat up and covered in something sticky. Oh, and about 25% of the perfume was already used."
0,"Paper feed nightmare I just wanted to add my voice to those who already mentioned the problems with paper feed. Not long after I bought this model (but too late to return)it started having problems with the paper feed. I now have to hand feed each piece of paper, and even then it sometimes doesn't work. The print quality is fine, but what good is it if you can't get the paper in. I now have to replace this ""new"" printer. That was a couple of hundred dollars wasted."
0,Not so Photosmart My experience with HP printers has been good. But this one disappoints me. Find a different model with better reviews. The print quality is good but the paper feed problems are frequent.
0,paper feed problems I had the printer for one month before the paper feed problems occurred. I went to tech support and after they asked me re-register for the THIRD time I threw the printer out the window (literally). No HP for me!
0,Hairspray fixes paper feed problem It's true. The only thing that works in applying hairspray on the rollers with a Q tip (after first applying alcohol with the Q tip and letting it dry). Pathetic!
0,"yes total waste of money This is the second HP printer I bought and frankly the only reason I tried this printer was because of the network connectivity. I haven't written many reviews before, but this product is soo bad that I had to add to the list of angry customers. Getting the printer to load 1 piece of paper is a nightmare. Now i get paper jam warnings when there is no paper in the bloody machine. Anyone see office space? yeah after I get my new Canon printer, i will re-enact that scene. perhaps i should record it and send it to HP?"
0,"Find Another I have had good success with HP in the past, but I never had any luck with this printer. Like a lot of the reviews, the paper feed never worked right and I would have to hand feed the pages one at a time. When feeding paper it seemed like the printer jammed half the time. I only tried one scan and an HP error message jumped up. I downloaded the current software, some 165mb and reloaded but never got the scan to work. I went through the supplied ink cartridge quickly and after loading a new cartridge my text prints were coming out with a double image. Luckily I purchased the unit at Sam's Club and they took it right back after 3+ months that I tried to get this unit to work, thinking it was me and not the printer. I would have liked to purchase my next printer from Sam's also, but I am going to try the Canon MP600 and they don't seem to carry it."
0,"Paper Feed Issues-AGAIN At the risk of repeating everythingeveryone else has already said, pleaseread past reviews.The expense I haveto go through just to get **1** pageto print is absolutely ridicously!I end up going to Kinkos half the time.Deep regrets about this one!"
0,"Paper jam -- common among HP inkjets The printer worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then the paper feed mechanism suddenly stopped picking up the paper. I found that I could print single sheets if I shoved a piece of paper in at just the right moment. Too early and I would get a paper jam, too late and I would get an ""out of paper"" message.This issue afflicts a good number of HP inkjet printers. So many, in fact, that HP created a help page just for it: [...]Customer service is sending out a ""printer cleaning kit"", a.k.a. a mechanical band-aid for whatever design flaw they couldn't fix on schedule."
0,"PAPER JAMS This printer is awful. I have researched complaints about the 2575 and found tons of consumers with the same paper feed/jam problems. Not only does it take forever getting something printed because of the thing not grabbing the paper, but once it finally decides to feed it chews it up, causing almost half of the pages to be ruined. Great, more money for hp- paper.And how about thier troubleshooting for the issue on the hp website? I feel that hp is aware of the issues, yet their support page lists a few of the common things you should check and if those don't work, they suggest you invest some more of your money in a cleaning kit they sell. That might be ok if you had the thing for a while, but most complaints are from customers who haven't had the thing more than a month.Please do yourself a favor and don't buy it."
0,"Complete garbage. I had just bought this printer in May and it worked fine to begin with, now it's having the same paper jam and out of paper issues as almost all of the other people's printers are on this site..please, avoid this printer at all costs..all it does is give a person a headache trying to fix the problem. The only thing good about this machine is the printing quality, but that doesn't make up for the fact that it is a completely dysfunctional product. Had I read these reviews before purchasing, I would have never invested in this product..the sad thing is, I have previously owned a different HP model and it worked great..too bad this one wasn't the same."
0,"Awful! I've not had paper jams or feed problems in ten years. Now they are back! In two months I have printed perhaps 100 sheets. Now there is a problem with 3 sheets out of 4. Every other HP printer that I have or have had feeds paper with no problem at all, but this one does not!"
0,Don't buy this printer! The constant printer jams make this printer unusable! And don't buy the baloney that those of us having problems have not followed the manufacturer's directions. The thing jams with HP's own (expensive) paper no matter how many pieces of paper are in the tray.
0,"Buyer Beware! Wish I had read these reviews before buying this piece of crap. It did great for about 2 weeks, then the paper feed problems began. It doesn't pick up the sheets unless I feed them one at a time. If I don't, the rollers simply don't pick up the paper, and the message reads ""No paper in paper tray"" even though there is plenty. Then the misfeeds and paper jams continue. It even stops and reads ""Paper Jam!!"" when there is no paper jam!I called HP and they sent me a new one free of charge, with a box to return the old one in. The new one worked fine for 2 weeks, then started up again with the same old headaches. The alcohol/hairspray trick another reviewer suggested for the rollers does not work. Save your money. This printer is the absolute worst. HP should be ashamed of themselves for putting it on the market. They MUST have known about the problems."
0,"Doesn't scan, doesn't print! I agree with the others here, HP are useless and I should have known better. Paper jams all the time using laser quality paper kept in a humidity controlled environment. Every copy you have to feed through manually.I couldjust about live with that but it doesn't scan either!! It says it'sscanning, it sounds like it's scanning - it even says image sent to the computer after scanning but do any images appear?? Do they heck!! Still under warranty, I've had a replacement unit and still the same and the HP techie team, (based in India!) can't help - it's going back!!"
0,"This is the worst printer I've ever seen DON'T BUY THIS HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!! I was given this as a gift, so thankfully didn't spend any money on it. It simply will not print. I usually spend about half an hour and end up with at least 30 ruined sheets of paper to print one page.In looking online, I can see that other users have had the same problem. Apparently the feed mechanism is faulty.Very faulty.I find my blood pressure rising just looking at the printer.Please buy any printer other than this one. And I'm staying away from HP in the future."
0,"Babysitting the printer Like others I would like to voice my frustration with the paper feed mechanism. It worked fine at first but then it would say that there was no paper in the tray when of course there was lots of it. HP sent me a cleaner for it but it could only be used 3 times. When that option ran out I contacted them again and they stated they could no longer help me with the problem. Disappointing for a large company to put out such a crappy printer and I am definitely going us use reviews the next time I purchase a printer. Not sure if I trust HP anymore. Now I'm getting the ""No Scan Option"" message and it seems to be a fairly common problem also. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!"
0,"Paper-jam Issues from the Get Go Honestly, this printer worked normally for me for a day - the first day I set it up. Since then, I have had to hand feed every single piece of paper I try to print. Then there were the issues of it only printing in color and not using any of the black ink cartridge. The only fix was to replace a virtually new cartridge. Granted, the customer service people at HP, who helped me troubleshoot through instant message, were helpful, but this has been a lemon from the moment I bought it.I don't think I have ever found a printer that is not a professional-office grade one that works well at home. Any suggestions would be most welcome!"
0,"In the immortal works of Monty Python RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY.When and if it works, it looks great.I wish I could rate this at NO stars because of the paper jam or out of paper issue. I guess it's come to the point where we have to beg, plead and pray just to get something to work as advertised. I purchased this a Wal-Mart for $50, so I would bet that American manufacturers are thinking that ""if they only spend 50 bucks, what did they expect?"" ""They should have paid more so it will work."""
0,"I also have the paper feed problem Update... HP sent me a replacement printer at no charge!My printer did the same thing that so many others here have reported... worked fine for a while and then stopped feeding paper. It seems clear to me (after carefully inspecting and poking at it without disassembling it) that the roller that initially feeds the paper doesn't apply enough pressure. I kept thinking something must have broken, but now I think it is just a bad design and HP should do something about this. My plan is to call them, point out the dozens and dozens of complaints on-line and urge them to replace the darn thing with something that works."
0,"Paper bottom feeder After one month, the paper will not lift from the tray. HP knows about this problem when I called service. They showed me how to clean the paper puller wheel. It works for now. A little dust, and the wheel gets no traction. Stay away from this printer."
0,"worst paper feed ever It looks great, lcd screen with media card slots was nice touch..but what good is it if it can't take in any paper to PRINT ANY THING OUT ...I was able to get it to take in paper using exclusive HP paperand ONE PAPER at a time it works SOME TIMES.My first HP printer and it will be my LAST,when I run out of Ink on the darn thing, rather thanburning 60 bucks for INK I would buy a LEXMARK again."
0,"Paper I use the recommended paper for this machine and after a couple of weeks began noticing a problem with the printing. Everytime I print a page, the machine fails to feed the paper through. I have to manually hold the paper in until the machine can grab it and pull it through to print. It's a waste of time and a waste of money."
0,"Piece of junk Worst printer I've ever bought. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!! Constant Paper Jams, thick black line through scans/copies even after troubleshooting, annoying polling every couple minutes. This is probably going to be the last HP printer I ever buy. I was ripped off for a premium-line printer. I'm replacing it with a cheaper but more reliable Canon MP160 which does everything this one was supposed to and I've never had a single problem with it."
0,"WORST. PRINTER. EVER. HP IS TWO-FOR-TWO AT SELLING ME USELESS JUNK. HPs own installation CD couldnt install this piece of junk, and kept telling me there was no printer connected. So I tried installing it with the default Mac OSX printer utility, and it worked fine, printed in color and everything, but it wouldn't scan. So after visiting the HP support site, which led me thru a tedious half hour of searching thru files and deleting over 30 files manually, it then directed me to a page where I could download a new HP driver. THE PAGE DIDNT EXIST. I learned an expensive lesson - NEVER BUY AN HP PRINTER."
0,"Buyer Beware Is a copier expected to last more than a year or two? Purchased in spring 06 - In Oct 06 I had problems with thick black lines in my scans & copies. The fix was to remove ink cartridges, disconnect machine from surge protector, powercycle three or four times, wipe copper connects, put them back in, reconnect to computer, start it all again. It worked. Problem recurred now 5/07 only this time 2 big black lines. Got out my copy of troubleshoot, tried it again to no avail, Warranty is expired and I'm told it is a hardware problem. I feel ripped off. Stay away from this HP product."
0,"I see ""Out of Paper"" 75% of the time; ""Paper Jam"" 23% I am ready to throw this one out the window. I just inherited it upon marriage and now I know why the daughter who owned it wanted her own things when she moved out.I am really tired of Out of Paper and Pater Jam notices.I consider myself to be extremely printer competent but this machine has not little tricks for coaxing it to print. It is just junk."
0,I will never buy another HP printer Please do not waste your money. I have had one for 2 years and have reloaded the software to make it work at least 30 times.
0,"GARBAGE is NOW DEFINED as THIS PRINTER PLEASE this is a warning! Do not buy this printer!!! Avoid at all costs!! HP tech support is useless and clueless. I had it for 3 days when it started jamming 100% of the time. PLUS, as a graphic designer I need my output to be tru to scale, this junk prints a 4 inch square as a 4.125 inch square! It does NOTHING good, plus it ran out of color ink after 40 pages!!I wish they had negative 5 stars"
0,"Would have been great if it only accepted paper Add my voice to the throng of unsatisfied customers who own this one. The features are great, the print quality's great, but once the paper stops feeding except manually a sheet at a time (and even then only after several attempts and paper jams), you're hosed. Look elsewhere."
0,"mine jams too It was great at first, but after a few weeks of light duty, it will no longer feed the paper. It keeps saying it is out of paper, but it isn't. If I ""nudge"" the paper with my finger, it will print.Oh well, I should have known better than to give HP another chance."
0,"Paper feeder stopped working after 2 months I bought this printer from Sam's Club, and it worked great for about 2 months. After that, the paper feeder was unable to recognize paper - in order to print anything, the paper had to be manually fed through the printer. Fortunately, Sam's was great and gave me a full refund. Buyer beware!I bought the Canon Pixma MP600 - we'll see how that one works."
0,"Sorry piece of junk! I have had HP printers for years and this is the first one I have ever owned that came out of the box giving problems with paper jams and not feeding paper. If I was Hewlett Packard, I would have recalled this junk or offered to give customers credit for what they paid against another printer. I will never purchase another HP printer. Never!"
0,"Doesn't deserve any stars... This printer fails as a printer mainly because paper won't properly feed. HP helpdesk requests you to tap all paper, and put in 10~25 sheets only. This doesn't work. Feeding one sheet at a time manually has at best a 1/10 shot of success. Let's hope HP's refurb replacement printer is better."
0,"Very dissatified with this *thing* This is the first review I have ever written, but I am so annoyed with this so-called printer that I had to add my 2 cents.My last HP printer lasted for over 5 years before giving up the ghost. I was happy with its preformance. This one I have had about 2 months and I am ready to throw it out the window.The paper feeding problem is VERY ANNOYING. I find I have to fiddle for many minutes to get it to recognize there is paper in the tray. Then once it does, it has a 50/50 chance of jamming!For HP to call it a printer is almost funny, because I have yet to have it just print without problems.I am in the market for a new printer after less than 2 months!"
0,"""Out of Paper"" I didn't buy the printer from Amazon. But because I like Amazon and value its readers is my reason for writing this. The HP Photosmart 2575xi that I purchased was a great machine. However, when you discover its little idiosyncrasies it becomes a royal pain in the neck! The paper feed does not work correctly and I am not the only one that has had this problem. It completely destroyed my faith in HP when techs tell you turn it off 3 times and then what? Send it back...............You have to hand feed like a little baby.........then the paper jam error comes up................wonder what HP Tech's go to school for.......to learn to say turn it off 3 times and unplug it for 10 minutes..........then repeat it...sounds like level I techs on the Internet Providers..........Get your act together HP....................."
0,"piece of junk! Don't waste your money. This is the worst printer I have ever owned. If this is an indication of other HP products, no wonder HP stock is tanking. Paper doesn't feed, display screen doesn't work, error light blinks continuously.I'm taking this into the back yard and going ""office Space"" on it."
0,"This printer is a nightmare! It is almost impossible to get this printer to print without an out of paper error, jam, etc. Doesn't matter what kind of paper you use. Whether you put in one piece (still doesn't work), more then one ( takes entire stack) It always says out of paper when it's not. What a nightmare. I'm finally tossing this item. I will NEVER by an HP product again. There are hundreds of complaints about this problem and they won't take the printer back."
0,"Can't believe I wasted my money This worked for about a month, then the scanner function ceased to work except by accessing it through the computer, in other words, you couldn't put a photo in it and push the scan button but had to go thru the computer. Now even that doesn't work. The troubleshooting they have is extremely complicated/pure gibberish.What a piece of junk."
0,Stay Away!!! This COULD be a great printer except for the paper handling mentioned before. I will never purchase another HP printer.
0,"Does this work or not? This item has a number of issues, admitted on the site of HP and other forums.They vary from paper feed issues, to connection and hardware conflicts.I have experienced the printer working without problems for 3 months then suddenly with no hardward or software changes the printer stopped.I got it working again for a short period however there appears to be faults in the actual software from HP.If you want a hassle free printer that is reliable don't buy this one.When it works it is very impressive but when it goes wrong, you'll be regretting the day you brought it.Im sure there are plently of people that have this printer and have had no problems at all, however if you do your research there are an awful number of people that do have problems with it.Make your own mind up but check other sites/forums for reviews as well as here."
0,"Bane Of My Existence Worst. Piece. Of. Equipment. EVER. Oh, how I wish I were exaggerating. After reading many other reviews stating the same problem I've been having (paper jam, out of paper) I can now justify the purchase of a new printer but not before I take great pleasure in placing this one carefully under the front tire of my car, running over it again and again, then packing the thousands of pieces into a box and sending it to HP."
0,"Multimalfunction Printer Printer worked well for about 2 months with light duty printing. Now get constant ""Out of Paper"" errors even though the papertray is full. I've done everything suggested-cleaning roller, etc. After cleaning roller the printer will feed paper for about 5 sheets and then fail again. HP support site says contact them for free cleaning kit. When I contacted then on Online Help site, after a bit of useless troubleshooting, I was told that the printer was out of warranty and cleaning kit would cost $39. I estimate that I printed less than 100 pages of text with this pinter. Since I screwed up and bought extra print cartridges, my cost per page is probably around $2 per sheet. If you own this printer and are planning on upgrading to Vista-beware. There is a good chance the HP Solution Center will have problems."
0,"bad printer It does nice job of printing after you fight to get it to pick up paper, or it jams. Did the call HP right after buying it and they were really no help, clean rollors or some other thing you should not do with a new printer. bought there best brand of HP paper, that did not help.So I give up and will call this a total waste of money and am looking to buy a different printer, also This is just me but trying to get the drivers installed was a big pain."
0,"anyone see office space? undoubtedly the worst piece of equipment i have ever owned. literally threw it into the street less then twenty minutes ago. the only enjoyable experience was heaving it fifteen feet into the air and watching it splatter in the driveway.paper jams, ink problems and general misery all around.would give this a negative 5 stars if i could."

0,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit I bought this movie new, but it will not play on my DvD player. I have tried several other players/machine to play this in & it will not work in any of them.

0,"very dissatisfied I ordered this video for my granddaughter, all of the movies i have ordered from Amazon I never knew that you could not view them if they were from region 2. I guess I have been just lucky when odering videos. I never knew about this region 2. I was so upset that I didn't even want to return the video. You people should only sell videos that are able to be watched on all dvd players it was a waste of my time and money. I am not sure if I will buy videos from amazon again or not and I was a very faithful customer."
0,"An Awful DVD of an incredible movie This is one of my favorite movies ever; there's not a moment that I don't believe that toons and humans are interacting...but this version is a censored version of the film. They cut parts without the consent of the director, and for this reason, I beg you not to buy this version. Wait until they correct the bowdlerization of this masterpiece"
0,"One star for the Movie, None for the DVD As other reviewers have noted, this is a ground-breaking, hilarious, one-of-a-kind movie. It deserves to be in everyone's DVD collection, even if your collection consists of but two DVDs. It deserves five, even six, stars, but...I urge you to wait for another DVD version, for two reasons: first, if ever a film deserved extras, it's WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, but we get none on this over-priced DVD. Second, the movie is trimmed by a scant few seconds (on grounds of poor taste in the offending scenes), but the critical thing is -- It IS censored. Strike a small blow for the ability to decide for yourself, and avoid this DVD. Wait -- it'll show up in an unadulterated version at some point in the near future."
0,"Beware - censored version of movie! Caveat emptor -- this DVD release contains a censored version of the movie, different from the previous Laserdisc and VHS releases. It was apparently altered without the director's approval."
0,"Great film, but the DVD is attrocious Let me just get this straight: I love ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". If this DVD had a good transfer, good extras, and uncensored, I would have gone for it's purchase and give it a 5.The problem is, this DVD is the opposite on what I would have gone for.The transfer is a botch job with blurs, sandy in the tan areas, overbright in reds, has a grimmy sound transfer, and IS censored in two parts.Are there any extras? No. Unlike what the lying eyes of the box says, no. And the film is only 14 years old. It deserves extras, at least a theatrical trailer and pencil test.I'd wait for a special edition."
0,does not work This format does not work on ps3 or Xbox 360 so I was unable to view it. I tried to ask for a refund with no response. It is the European format. They need to state it better when it is like that.

0,no Why did you send a dvd that you are very sure it does not work here in The United States? Does it make any sense for you? Why don't ask us to be sure before send it to another Country? If you know that it won't work on that Country?
0,"Watch out when purchasing DVD's shipped within the USA but not able to be viewed in the USA because wrong region!? I was very disappointed when my DVD arrived and I was unable to view it because I live in the wrong region. Much to my surprise DVD's are specific to certain regions and our DVD players will not allow them to play. I purchased it from Amazon and it said it was coming from North Carolina so why would I suspect that I would not be able to watch it. In fact, until this incident I was totally unaware of such a thing and I feel that consumers should be informed about this. So you are warned! I will however mention that the company Amazon arranged my purchase through refunded my money but my time was wasted."
0,"Sucked I am sorry, but this film was as creative as a pile of toothpaste on a sidewalk on a hot summer day in Phoenix.

0,"So this is the new doom metal? Whatever. The only one demonstrating the slightest amount of talent is the singer, who used to be in O.L.D along with bass player Plotkin. They should have stuck to what they knew. The singing/shrieking is best described as excrutiating, but the music has no redeeming features. I've nothing against detuning but detuning this far just makes the guitar sound poorly tuned and badly played. To me it's extreme for extreme's sake, like making it sound plain crap was their primary objective. Mission accomplished, 2/10."

0,"One of the worst movies ever made! OK, I'm not going to get into this movie's lack of similarities to the video games;this movie just plain sucks. I can't see why anybody over the age of twelve can enjoy this piece of you know what. Come on, this movie has horrible acting, a dreadfully bad story and ""hilariously"" unfunny jokes. I think you people who gave this movie five stars really need professional help, 'cause one star is far too generous. I'm not saying all the media incarnations of mario sucked;the cartoons were actually pretty good. But this movie, in my opinion is what caused that chain of cartoons to end."
0,"Terrible with a capital T This movie was screwed up all kind of ways.It wasn t even like the video game or even the cartoon.For example,King Kopa didn t look like how he supposed to be and the storyline seem like it was written by a 4 year old.I wonder if the director was on drugs while he was making this so called movie.To all the people that didnt see this movie,you don t need to because you will regret it.Its so bad that it will be perfect to be shown on MST3K."
0,Worst video game adaption for a move. Some video game movies are great. Others are horrid. Super Mario Brothers goes beyond horrid! It seems as though nothing was thought out when writing the script for this movie and it does not resemble the game by Nintendo in anyway. If they had slapped a different name on this and changed the names of some of the characters I think this movie could have received 1.5 stars rather than just 1. There is nothing of value in this movie and I strongly suggest that you stay far away unless your looking for something to put yourself to sleep if you have insomnia.
0,"THIS SUX!!! aviod at all cost!! How much did Dennis Hopper get paid to appear in this stinkbomb!! I really respected Dennis Hopper, but after Space Truckers, Im not surprised he made this POS. If you are asking yourself ""this movie can't be THAT bad""...i'm telling you..YES IT CAN!!! It s probably worse that you can even imagine! and what happened to Capt.Lou? all I know is that after this garbage, Bob Hoskin's career went right in the toilet!! WHERE THIS TAPE BELONGS!!PS: no wonder it's out of print...NO ONE WANTED IT!!"

0,"Could have been better! I am a big fan of the Super Mario Brothers - the video game and the TV show. I had high hope for this movie, but boy what a waste of time this was. This movie sure give the Super Mario Brothers a bad name. If you haven't seen this movie, I envy you. Nothing like the game of the show. It NEVER should have been made; period."
0,"c'mon nintendo i'm not gunna lie. this is not a good movie. other game titles would have made a much better story. If they chose kirby, maybe. they could have made a million jokes about a wierd blob and an evil penguin. they could have had action with dark matter in a battle. they should make this movie, instead of more dumb mario movies. Kirby and King Dedede beat Mario and Luigi by a mile."
0,"All the bad things you heard and then some more. There is nothing good I can say about this movie.There is absolutely nothing remotely entertaining about it.If the main-characters didn't go by the names of Mario & Luigi, you'd be lost.Nothing here resembles the video-game it's based on, which isn't a bad thing neccessarily......except that nothing here resembles any kind of story.The acting is bad, perhaps on purpose......but who cares? It's not amusing in the slightest.The movie is boring. In 90 minutes, you'll want to gouge your eyes out.""Super Mario Bros."" -- the movie -- has been proven to damage brain-cells upon each viewing.In a Koopa-shell, don't waste your time on this movie. Don't even look at the cover. Don't even read this review. Just try and pretend this ""movie"" doesn't exist."
0,"Garbage. This movie typifies the lazy, expensive, misguided Hollywood misfires of the last 20 years, with its bargain-Blade-Runner-with-more-neon sets, poorly realized characters and jarring tonal shifts. Is it for kids? Is it for adults? A comedy? Thriller? Sci-fi? Who knows! Who cares!?Even if you completely ignore the video game origins (which this movie fouls up miserably), this movie does not work on its own as intelligible entertainment. The movie feels like a poorly directed stage play, with everyone pitching for the last row, but not campy or quotable enough to be memorable.For those of you who think this is an overlooked gem, I direct you to the climax, where Koopa basically stands in the same spot on a walkway for 20 minutes, while clichÃ©d, cartoonish ""action"" unfolds on the same recycled sets around him.Another movie that tries to be everything and only succeeds at being boring and mildly nauseating. Only watch this out of sheer curiosity."
0,"Great band, HORRIBLE video I don't get it. I love this band and have turned numerous friends on to them. All have been impressed, but their DVDs blow! Almost unwatchable due to there is seldom more than 3 seconds and typically 1 to 1 1/2 seconds of viewing without a camera angle change or change to somewhere else on stage. No continuity whatsoever! Dizzying and not in a good way. I was so excited to watch this. Bought both of the DVDs and watched each to about the 5th song before stopping in complete dissappointment. Watch and judge for yourself, but I became quite sour on these guys due to this, though I love their music and I'm sure this feeling will subside, but the DVDs are in the trash. There is ZERO opportunity to ""get in to the song"" with all of the viewing changes. There are so many awesome live concert videos available from numerous bands, but PT DVDs are NOT them! Sorry PT fans, but you must have received different DVDs than I. But do go and buy ALL of their CDs. Great Band!"
0,"Awful Wow, how bad does it get.It was a chore to read this book. It contains the most unlikely and implausible plot. The characters seemed to be conjured up and very unreal. Not interesting, not funny, not entertaining and it was really hard work to get through it.I droppped my copy in the trash bin when I finished reading it. There is no way I could ever read it again and I wouldn't want to inflict it on anyone else.I've never felt this way about any other book. It was awful."
0,"What a disappointment From reviews I had thought RB would be a genuine thriller.The only thing I found thrilling was the realization after anhour or so that the film would soon be over. Can't understand why anyone would make the effort to mentally get into this film.I found it corny and I'm certainly glad I didn't pay for the DVDthat I watched. Everything about this film was heavy - heavy acting, heavy scripting. Heavy,heavy, heavy."

0,"Yawn. The TV Guide called it probably the best horror movie ever made. This was supposed to be a classic? I guess it was a classic con-job. Mia's character, or was it just Mia, was so unbelievable. The whole tale seems so, simplistic? Oh let's not go over for dinner, oh we will, oh it is so ironic Guy's suddenly taken a liking to his neighbors. The 'suggestions' and red-herrings didn't help much in alleviating the pain of a sad non-ending. I would recommend this to film buffs only. For me, at the end of two and a half hours, it felt like nothing much had happened."
0,"I dont get it? I am a very big fan of horror movies, I have been snice I was around 5 or so. This was on sometime during Hallooween on AMC, and it was always one of the ""100 Most Horror Movies"" on Bravo. When I watched it before that show was on I saw a few parts and though to myself when does the good part come?..But I ended up about to fall asleep so I taped it, but not every part came on, then I watched it again and though to myself this is not even scary what makes it so scary?...The movies mostly about a young women and her husband who want a kid, then when she gets it(supposly she's rapped by the devil), and her kids the devil living inside her, but nothing really scary happened I was pretty dispointed."
0,"A waste of a good plot I thought that this movie was going to be scary, and terrifying. In the end, it was stupid and meaningless. The plot was good, but it was played out all wrong. It was a waste of a good 2 and a half hours and it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
0,"Not Again! I keep hoping that Ball will release an album that isn't as overproduced as his vibrato but I have yet to hear it. How can an album this uncreative seem so pretentious?

Please save the theatrics for the Original Cast Albums!Just my opinion.JMF"
0,Poor Job I got all four Discovery HD DVD's. Brazil and China work fine on my ToshibaA-2. Italy and Australia do not. I returned them to Amazon and the replacements did not work either. Then I started reading and found many otherpeople with the same problem which is caused by a coding problem with thesetwo disc's. These two will go back tomorrow. It's a shame Discovery did sucha poor job making sure these disc's were playable especially considering howfew different models of HD DVD Players there are out on the market.
0,"Wish I had read the reviews ... These videos are fantastic from a documentary perspective, but someone on the manufacturing crew screwed up the Italy & Austrailia disks. DO NOT BUY until the problem is fixed ... you'll just have to send them back."
0,Don't waste your time I purchased this DVD with much enthusiasm only to find that it dose not play on my combo bluray/HD player.I send it back for replacement and it still would not play and had to finally return it all together.It seem from reading other reviews this is typical of this title (or series). Don't waste your time buying this DVD.

Looks like everyone else has had this problem as well. I called Amazon for a refund and recommended that they pull this item. It DOES NOT PLAY.
0,"Didn't Like It Jesse Stuart is a school teacher from Kentucky and should have stayed that way. This book seemed like an attempt to get attention in 1949 for his teaching skills. He my have been a good teacher but he wasn't a good writer.The Thread That Runs So True never caught my attention. The book was dull and boring. The book wasn't worth my $14.00. Jesse Stuart gets too much in detail with his story. A lot of the time he is talking about his money troubles and give us acual estimates. The Chicago Sun my have said ""stuart's joy for living illuminates every page."" but I never saw that illumination. I would never recommend this book to anyone."
0,"Lower Than Low After finishing The Thread That Runs So True by Jesse Stuart, I sit here to give you my review on this book. Even though the book didn't catch my attention that much it had its ups and downs. The only thing that caught my attention while reading this book was how he fought back against the ""man"" and got his job back, but then he stuck it to them at the end. As for the down points of the book it would have to be the rest of the book. I could not in a million years honestly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book to read."

0,"Major Skip Problem While the memorex CD player did impress me with it's ability to read through scratches in the CD, it had absolutely no anti-skip protection. Simply riding in a car sets it off at least once a minute. I would definitly recommend spending another $10 or $15 dollars to get a product with anti-skip protection!"
0,"good for the money I, too, purchased this CD player for my 8 year old daughter. I am really impressed with the sound quality for the price. If you plan to leave this player stationary (on a desk, etc.), I think you will be more then pleased. Also, it's an excellent gift for a young child, who doesn't need a top-of-the-line player. The price is VERY reasonable, and the unit is straightforward and easy to use."
0,"This Products Breaks ten days after 90 day Warranty I bought this product in April. Worked until July. Without reason, display will not respond. I called the manufacture and they said they will not fix after 90 days. Shouldn't a brand new cd player work for atleast a year before something internal breaks. I guess Memorex doesn't think so. For $[money] they said they would look at it. I told them I don't think it's a good idea to send good money after bad. I'll buy a different brand name instead."
0,"Incredible (How could anything be this bad) I had this piece of junk for 3 months. When I put in a CD, static was audible in the background. At first, I thought it was the CD. Then I put it in my Aiwa stereo system and the sound was flawless. The radio reception was even worse. You have to turn the thing around in circles to hear anything but static. This so-called machine may be cheap, but I wouldn't want it if it was free!"
0,"This is definitely a low quality product If you want a cd player better spend a few extra bucks on a major namebrand product. I received this cd player yesterday and I'm returning it today. How bad could it be? Man, this is really a cheap and inferior product. The cd would skip frequently the track it was playing; there is a lot of static in the sound;it has low volume; and it has the cheapest construction in the world. You gotta be extremely careful when inserting a cd. The arm where the cd holder sits (i believe the lens runs along this part) will considerably move downwards to the slightest force. I agree with Bruce from NY. I don't want this cd player even for free. After returning this product I purchased a Sony cd player. Sure it was more expensive, but is working fine. Believe me, you'll regret purchasing this Memorex MD3020 cd player."
0,"Not worth your money These DVD's are not worth your money!

0,"Signal too weak Our wireless router is upstairs on one end of the house, and the TiVo is downstairs on the opposite end of the house. Even so, when using laptops while watching television, the internal WiFi cards manage to get a ""Fair"" to ""Good"" signal. Even my 5 year old iPAQ gets a workable signal at that location.But, the TiVo AG0100 Wireless G adapter could manage a ""Poor"" connection at best. It could work, sort of, but only intermittently.Faced with either using a repeater or wiring the TiVo directly with CAT5, I chose the latter.[...]"
0,"not too compatible with iMac the set-up requirement for the Tivo wireless connector to my Apple wireless network would require me to change the setup of all the other components on my network. When Tivo worked on the network, my printer didn't. It was less of a hassle to get an ethernet cable and plug it in."
0,wasted my money I spent an entire afternoon trying to get this piece of junk to talk to my wireless network. Went through the steps a bazillion times . It found my network and could not get an IP address ( after WEP key entered). Customer service were on the phone with me for hours and I think it safe to say we tried everything. Their final suggestion was call your ISP (Comcast) who were unable to help.So - I bought a new Tivo specifically to use on my network so I could broadcast my MP3 collection through my AV system and cant. Add to the fact thatthe new Tivo is giving problems switching channels and you can see what a giant step backwards I took - If I could give this zero stars I would!
0,"Don't waste your time or money on this piece of JUNK! I won't go into an elaborate diatribe on just how terrible this product is. To sum it up, it's useless and was not market-ready. TiVo customer service and support is abominable, and the ""help"" they supply for this product is laughable. My son has been a network systems engineer for over 10 years, he had to come and try and get it to work. After a bit of fussing with it, the adapter was getting poor reception. The wireless router and modem are barely 30 feet from the TiVo box, with open space throughout. My laptop easily achieves 12Mbps without a hitch.For a goof, we moved the wireless router and modem to the kitchen table, and hooked it up to the laptop. Only then were we able to get a decent signal, with the wireless router about 8 feet from the TiVo box and network adapter. Several calls to TiVo got me canned, simple fixes to try. It works best when you throw it in the trash."
0,"If you are considering this book... IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS BOOK, SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME AND WALK INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC NOW! I was forced to read this book for my english class. It was terrible! Sure the plot line, and even some of the characterization was fine, but MY GOD THE DESCRIPTION goes on and on and on and on. Theres almost 4 pages dedicated to describing a building! If I was given the choice between reading this book, or hitting myself in the head with it for the rest of my life, I would go with the hitting on the head one...becuase i'm sure its even less brain-numbing than Hardy's writing."
0,"WHY? I have recently read this book (not out of choice) and I am at a loss to understand why Hardy wrote this and why anyone would willingly read this for ""fun"". I agree wholeheartedly with the author of ""Classically Boring"" as this book is complete excrement. People are always going on about how we should stop cutting down the rainforest etc. and if this is what all those trees are turned into, then I'm with them 100%."
0,"Great title. Poor book. It's intriguing: The scriptures that have come down to us really aren't accurate and maybe we should rethink what being a Christian really means. However, this book uses little substantiation for its assertions, preferring, evidently, to be controversial rather than thoughtful. If you really have questions about the ""holy"" bible, please read Bart D. Ehrman's MISQUOTING JESUS. The author's creditials are REAL, his proofs are relatively clear, and his message is more useable: The bible is a human document that has application in our lives. My advice: Continue to be a seeker of Truth...but don't bother buying this book."

0,"A shoot yourself movie. Literally! This movie blows. You go through the whole movie bored and the least Van Sant could have done was let you see him blow his head up. If I have to see that movie one more time, I'd blow my head off. I mean, everybody that knew of him and followed his music as I did, already knew what happened. I expected a film much better than this one. I agree with one of the other reviewers of a way of Van Sant cashing in Cobain's name. What a loser! Cobain Rules!"

The only good thing I can say about this movie was that the actor looked semi-like Kurt, and thats it!! It was a def. bummer and I had to pull myself through it!! I really cant understand why we cant just leave him alone!! Hes a great artist with a great band! The legend should be left to rest in peace!! Kurt's probably turning in his grave over this.

0,"The Most Boring Michael Pitt Film!!! This movie is the worst most boring movie of Michael Pitt's that I have seen.

Only strange shots of Pitt alone talking to himself and interacting for only a about a minute with one of two of the characters. There was hardly any suspense or spice to this movie. Just downright boring. Do not waste your money or time on this flick. Ain't worth it. Pitt has done much better roles, his best work, FUNNY GAMES."

0,"Kurt deserved more than nothing One of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Actually I turned it off after about an hour...I don't know why I waited that long. Kurt was such an interesting and enigmatic person, a movie should have been made to pay respect to him or give something of a behind-the-scenes look at him. This movie basically shows Kurt as a wasted heroin addict with nothing more to offer or say or do; lazy film making, terrible camera work. Seriously if you rent this movie after reading this review you have no one to blame but yourself. Literally one of the worst movies ever wasted on film."

0,"This movie is not NIRVANA Gus Van Zant should really be ashamed of himself for producing this film . Visually, sure, it is great looking. However, his vision of this Kurt Cobain Character is nothing more than a stumbling mumbling half wit with no personality or reason for being on screen. This movie is an insult to the Real Cobain, Nirvana, and all of the Nirvana fans. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. It is garbage and has absolutely no business even being mentioned in the same breath as Nirvana, Cobain, or music in general."
0,"What a disappointment... Last Days was easily the worst movie I have seen since Eight Heads in a Duffle Bag. From start to finish, it was disjointed and each scene was entirely too long. In fact, I watched the last 30 minutes of the move in 10x speed and didn't miss a thing!Van Sant did not establish any kind of connection with the characters. You don't really even know Blake is a troubled musician (as it says in the synopsis) until half way through the movie, so you spend time watching him mope around the house in, what appears to be, a drug-induced stupor. But you really don't know what's wrong with him and it's not very interesting to watch.I had high hopes for this movie, especially after watching the making of it in the Special Features section, but it was a complete waste of time."
0,"The worst movie I've seen ever! Awful! I have never been so compelled to review anything until I watched the movie Last Days yesterday evening. The movie was about absolutely nothing. The character who is supposed to be Cobain just mumbled, walked around, and passed out the entire movie. It was awful and a complete waste of my time. I was seriously angry after watching it, because I stayed up to watch it. How does this crap ever make it?"
0,"He can't even make macaroni and cheese Wouldn't it have been nice if the _not_ Kurt had gone with Kim Gordon? He could've been a member of the family. How cool would that be to have Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore as parents? Kurt could have sat on the floor surrounded by kittens,making drawings of sperm and embryos with crayons.this over indulgent pile might as well have been about nothing at all, instead ol' Gus decided to cash in on Kurts name. the real question is, why not? everyone else did."
0,"Don't Watch It / Don't Buy It Whether or not this movie is based on Kurt Cobain it is still the most boring and horrendous film I have ever seen. In fact, I could watch it all the wat through because nothing happened. Sorry Gus your career has gone out wirh a bang."
0,"If there was a negative star rating.... Don't waste your time watching this movie. It's time out of my life that I will never get back. My thought, after it was all over, was how could he not be thoroughly embarrassed having something this incredibly useless out for public consumption with his name on it? Unless you're obsessed with Curt Cobain and would watch anything remotely having to do with him, just don't bother."
0,"Last Days should be called Last Time Because the first time you watch it will undoubtly be your last as well. Overall I believed I was going to be watching a movie loosely based on the life of Kurt Cobain leading up to his death.Instead what I was ""graced"" with is Blake (Kurt) sitting in a creek, sitting by the lake, sitting against a door and so on and so on. Half the time you're just looking at a still object with no characters on screen. There was a plot somewhere in there too but with all the MUMBLING you might miss it. Not to mention that there isn't that much dialogue to begin with.I wouldn't recommend this movie to Nirvana/Kurt Cobain fans.This movie bored me tears, I barely finished it."
0,"Sucked really bad, not even a rental... This movie was by far the worst I have ever seen, I had to fast forward most of it, as it was painfully drug out. You would be better off constipated, sitting on the throne with a comic book instead of watching this load of garbage.Eastcoast Phil.TCBRN."
0,"What is this? Ok, I must say I am a huge fan of Nirvana and Kurt's work, but this film......it was interesting if you're willing to sit and watch nothing. This film was about Kurt's last days and what he did, but it was a terrible thing to watch if your a fan because you get absolutely nothing out of it. Most of the music in the movie was terrible in choice; the only part of this movie that i liked was the very end scene where the ghost climbs out of the body. This movie didn't hold my interest at all; it was wandering, mumbling, eating, avoiding. How could you make a film about Kurt Cobain, the man who made grunge, so terrible? I must say I don't think any fan of Nirvana should watch this.Also the very end of the movie says:In memory ofKurt Cobain1967-1994This movie should not have been in memory of Kurt."
0,"Ultimately, a beautiful failure Brilliant cinematography fails to mend this meditation on the last days of Kurt Cobain. It's a frustrating experience that can be rewarding, but ultimately leaves you empty."
0,"WORST MOVIE EVER! This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I had to continually watch it because I was falling asleep over and over again. Boring, uninteresting, and bias! Completely horrible and the only reason I watched it was for my true love of Kurt Cobain! I would not even give it a star if I had the choice."

Yes he can weave a story, but good grief, imagine the ego of a man who thinks he can turn out a story as incomprehensible as this. Right now I'm reading his bio by Jay Parini trying to decipher the Faulkner code.I'll let you know if I do. I guess I've just read too much Flannery O'Conner (brilliant) and consider Faulkner a bit too precious. Slam me if you must. ""A Light in August"" was good, and I'm reading short stories that are wonderful, but please, present and future authors, try to engage the reader, not send him/her away frustrated."
0,"Read...at your own caution! I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the ""laws"" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS!"
0,"An Insult to the English Language I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust."
0,WHAT!?!?!?!?! I AM CURRENTLY READING THIS BOOK AS A MANDATORY OUTSIDE READING BOOK FOR MY 11TH GRADE ENGLISH CLASS. I AM ON CHAPTER THREE AND I STILL HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING ON EXACTLY. FAULKNER'S USE OF WORDING IS EXTREMELY CONFUSING AND DOES NOT CAPTURE THE READER AT ALL.ALONG WITH READING THE BOOK WE HAVE TO COMPLETE A PROJECT EXPLAINING THE PLOT AND MAIN THEMES. HOW CAN I DO THIS IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK ITSELF?THIS BOOK IS SAID TO BE A GREAT PEICE OF AMERICAN LITERATURE BUT I DISAGREE COMPLETELY.I THINK IT'S REALLY BAD.
0,"Quickstart? Maybe a different title is more appropriate This book is quite long, has lackluster coverage of major 9.0 features, and has several errors. I found myself trying to use it as a reference guide becuase of the size, but digging around for any useful information was almost always futile. Other books in this series seem to be tighter and more coherent than this overlong book."
0,Waste of money This book is the worst tutorial Illustrator book out there. It doesn't explain how or why. Not a good book for those new to Illustrator like I am.
0,"Unoriginal Listen once to ""The 1812"" and you will understand my one-star rating. The 1812 Overture is, admittedly, a little cheesy, but nothing deserves the treatment Bond give it.Classical instruments do not need a dance beat and electrification to be cool. Listen to anything by the band Apocalyptica, or even Godspeed You ! Black Emperor (who use celli)--there is music out there that pushes the boundaries of traditional classical music, and does it well, without resorting to electronic beats and scantily clad women.If you must order this, order Apocalyptica's ""Cult"" with it, for purposes of comparison."
0,"Buy a different coffee maker! I purchased the Bosch TKA 2801 about two months ago and it's been nothing but trouble. To begin with, it feels cheap, with plastic moving parts that feel like they're about to fall off at any moment, and often do. But worse, unless one is very careful with the unit, more coffee will end up on your kitchen counter than in the carafe when the coffee is brewed. It's no fun to clean that mess over and over. I called Bosch customer service and was treated very rudely, but after complaining I was referred to an outside service agent that has been quite pleasant to deal with so far. They've offered to pay for me to ship the unit to them and they're sending me a completely new unit. Hopefully the new one will function better, although I'm not holding my breath given the poor design overall."
0,"A Bummer & An Insult to One's Intelligence I didn't like this book when I was a child. I don't like it as a an adult. It is a farce, plain and simple. The reviewers who panned it for its absurdity were right on target. This poorly written tale just constructs a nice little fantasy about a martyr instead of a real child and it sounds like ""Ozzie & Harriet Confront C.P."" Although the anecdotes about the aminmals were cute, the whole book is written in a condescending tone. The racist name that one rabbit was given was insulting. Read ""Karen"" and ""With Love from Karen"" instead as these books complement your intelligence instead of insulting it like ""Wren"" does. I didn't like this book at all. I agree -- ""Wren"" really is for the birds."
0,"Suspected Fake if Bought from Dealer: FogDog I know this is a product review, but I need to bring up that I have bought over 20 pairs of these Under Armour Heatgear Compression shorts in the past, but if bought from this company, I suspect they may be fake. The material in the shorts as well as the band are rougher and seem of a lower grade material then what I've bought directly from ""Under Armour"". Two of my three pairs bought here have had the bands separate from the shorts with normal washing/wearing over a 2 month period. For reference, the oldest pair I have from ""Under Armour"" has lasted over 3 years with normal washing/wearing!!!"
0,"Bad Inventory Your inventory of Futuro Knee braces is bad and is being investigated by one of your Customer Service persons. I speak with confidence because I have worn the same brand, style, and size brace for years. The first shipment of 2 braces consisted of one correct package but the other was a ""small"" size clearly marked [package and product lable] as ""medium"". When the exchange shipment arrived, both packages contained ""small"" size braces but the lables and packages were clearly marked ""medium"".Both shipments have been returned in the last few days. In my mind this is obviously a manufacturers problem. To this day Amazon has been trying to resolve this issue. I am waiting for instructions on how to obtain the proper items."

0,"Dumping it down the drain This product obviously works well for most but it made my twins extremely fussy, gassy, and spit up like crazy. Not only did I hate to see them screaming with discomfort, but it was the hardest day I've had yet as a new mom to twins. Yes, I said ""day."" I took MMP as directed for only one day. The babies fussed all day and night leaving me no time to pump to even see if there was an increase in supply. I cut out the MMP and went back to plain fenugreek the next day and everyone is happy again. I'm pretty sure it's the blessed thistle that caused the issues. I tried previously adding blessed thistle capsules to my supplementation routine and we had similar issues, although not anywhere near the degree as with MMP. I hate leaving a negative review for a product so widely loved and touted, but I didn't find anything about effects similar to my experience so I felt the need to share."
0,"Unless your kids are over 12, leave them home with Grandma There is nothing, I repeat, NOTHING in Italy that would appeal to a child under the age of 12. This book is a waste of money. If your kids are under 12, take them to Disneyland/World and save yourself a lot of money and whining."
0,"substandard quality I have ordered this item 3 times, while the shape makes cutting easier than normal end cutters such as channel lock the quality of the metal blade is not good.

0,"wasted money I was looking for a doll-that-wets to help me potty train my 3 year old daughter. The doll was quite expensive, the only one with the feature I was looking for in that particular toy store. It comes without any instructions, or maybe they were missing from the box, but I really doubt that. When you give the doll water it instantly starts peeing, better when it is laying down than when it sits on the potty. No matter how you turn it and how you close or open the valve, IT LEAKS. I could not see any tears no matter how I turned it. Overall, big waste of money, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST IT. It makes a big title of glory that doesn't need batteries, but it absolutely does not rise to the expectations listed on the box, and I would personally get a battery doll that works, than this one."
0,"Grossly Overrated After the title I am with those that find the characters, story, ending, everything about this book without any interest. Personally I'm unable to fathom the good reviews this relatively boring book gets."
0,"ugh This book is dull, and I do not know why people like to read it and then to make it into a MOVIE and a PLAY. Boring writing, mild characters, slow almost motionless plot."
0,"Ick I was forced to read this poor excuse for a book for English class. It was awful. I hope Steinbeck's other books are better than this. This book read like a hazy dream more than a novel, and a BORING & UNCLEAR hazy dream at that. I hope this review convinced you to spend your time on worthwile literature as opposed to this."
0,"All they do is swear every other word! If your looking for book that gets a little dirty, but reveals a true part of history, you've found what your looking for in John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men/"""
0,"I don't recommend this book. This Book tells a story about two friends who are looking for a new job near the Salinas River in California. Lenny, who is mentally retarded, and George, the smart one. They had to escape from their last job because Lenny got in trouble. In the new job the story will be repeated, but this time for the last time. The only reason I gave this book a star is because is has a good plot, and because this is happening in the world right now, it is a reality. The main factor that called my attention was the vocabulary and quotations of the characters. This is why I give one star to the book."
0,"Of Mice and Men Of Mice and MenOf Mice and Men was a good book, I recommend it to anyone who likes a good short book. It's full of fun and adventure. But it had its ups and downs. It is not a bad book, I think that I would read it again, but not for a while, I would like to watch the movie first so I can compare if it is even close to how the book goes. I only like one character and that's Lennie, he is very funny at some points, and sad at other points in the book. Over all it was a good book to read if you like to read books."
0,"Of Mice and Men Three crucial pages were torn from the book: The ""Introduction by Susan Shillinglaw""(Director of the Steinbeck Research Center); ""Suggestions for Further Reading""; and ""A Note on the Text."" Since I was reading the book for a class discussion, these items would have aided me greatly during the discussion period."
0,of mice and men I read of mice and men because I had to for school otherwise I would have never read this book I thought it was going to be boring and nothing changed it was still boring. The story is about lenny and george and they travel around from job to job trying to make money. Lenny likes to touch things and always gets them kicked out of ever town they go to. Then they have a plan to get their own land and stop working for everyone else. This was a boring book. It was written by John Steinbeck.
0,"AHHHH!!!!!! I had to read this book for my 9th grade English class and i must say this is the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life! it had the worst ending possible, I had to keep putting it down because it had the slowest plot in the world and had very flat characters. (Amazon suggests you buy this with To kill a Mockingbird which was the other book that was required for me and I highly suggest that book because it is a great book and one of my all time favorites.) AHHHHH!!!!! this book made me soo mad. They killed of my favorite character!!! and george did it how could he do that! Slim was my other favorite and so was candy but even Slim wasn't cool in the end. I hated this book so much. Don't read this its bad. Read to Kill a Mocking Bird its good. If you want to read something of John Steinbecks read the Grapes of Wrath."
0,"dont read this book! My english teacher read this book outloud to us. It was the worst thing ever. I feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring! It seemed like it took forever to finish so dont read this book unless you want somthing really, really boring!"
0,Over-rated This book is kinda over-rated - it's by Steinbeck 'n everything but I couldn't read past the 20th page.
0,"If you like John Steinbeck, you are insane, please seak help This book was quite possibly the worst book i've ever had to read. No wait, the worst ever was The Pearl! What is wrong with Steinbeck? Why does he feel he needs to kill main characters? I would seriously recomend that you never read this book ever. If you have to for highschool, I feel extremely sorry for you. In cnclusion I just have to say George, just let Lennie tend the Frickin' rabbits and Kino, throw the pearl away already!"
0,"If you didn't like the pearl,you won't like this one Of Mice and Men had a good begining and a good plot. It would have been a better book if Steinbeck had made it longer and put more effort into it. When you read his books you get the feeling that he started out with this great idea, and then got bored so he just finished the book real quick."
0,"of mice and men this book may be easy to study for english literature, being short. However, this story is not interesting in the least, with a plot that builds up and then is thrown away totally at the end."

0,"Movie Only Good for Nap Time This is a real yawn fest. After the main character walks in front of her place of work for the 100th time and says the same ""catch phrases"" a 1,000 times, my eyelids could not control themselves any longer. The DVD extras weren't much better. There was a makeshift documentary about Morrissey fans and commentary from people involved with the film. I don't even know what they did or who they were but the makeup artist sticks clearly in my mind. I don't think the main characters were even in the room for this ""special feature."" Boring and Lame."
0,"The WORST movie I have ever seen I saw this movie in the theater about 4 weeks ago. It, by far, has to be the worst movie I've ever seen.The acting is bad.The plot is thin. (Hello!?! A lesbian rape scene?)It serves as the perfect ""How to stalk Morrissey Guide.""I suppose this film was supposed to be a farce. It fails miserably. I laughed at places where there was supposed to be no laughter. I just couldn't help thinking that Morrissey would absolutely cringe upon seeing this film.I think it's great that Morrissey fans are going out and creating art, but this film misses the mark.Props to Jose M, who stars as Morrissey. He always looks good."
0,"Worst Movie Ever This is the most painful 85 minutes that you will ever sit through. The movie sucks. Nothing about it is funny, just stupid. I think I could make a better movie with my camera phone. stupid."
0,"TOTAL PIECE OF TRASH! JUST SAY NO! I would like to give this movie no stars but it was not an option. Don't be fooled by the indie reviews and look of this film. It is HORRIBLE! I'm a huge John Waters fan and enjoy camp and ""bad"" movies. Even John Waters would be bored with this one. The director spent too much time on looooong shots and scenes that go nowhere. Repetitive dialogue from the main character also gets annoying. Too bad! The movie could have had great potential but failed at the hands of an un-creative director."
0,Waste of life. this movie has not only a horrible story but has NO smiths/morrissey music at all and the guy who plays moz doesnt even look much like him even though they cover his face in shadows. the longer i watched this movie the more i though how much of a waste it is to watch/buy/think about...anything! it sucked! don't buy it. dont even bother seeing it. believe me.
0,"Truly Disappointed Allow me to summarize this film for you.A self-centered, rude and unlikeable Morrissey fan licks Morrissey posters and basically deludes herself into believing that she is going to marry him.I understand that the film is intended to be funny and over-the-top, but the humor is merely vulgar and mean spirited.Before someone accuses me of simply not like Morrissey or of being a victim of Hollywood formula, let it be known that I am both a huge Smiths/Morrissey fan and an admirer of independent films. Despite these facts, I couldn't bring myself to enjoy any aspect of this film."
0,"DO NOT PURCHASE!!! The kit I received is not the one in the picture, it says it should fit a 99 civic, but does not even come close. The instructions are EXTREMELY vague and do not provide any clarity at all as to what brackets to remove or use. IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT!!! I attempted to contact customer service and i got what sounded like a crappy home answering machine. Now I have a disassembled car with no radio and no way to mount it. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN! Do yourself a favor and find another mounting kit if you have a 99 civic, this is not a mounting kit for a 99 civic. Such a scam."
0,didn't get mine either I ordered these for a Christmas gift. They were backordered so I got a new ship date. They cancelled the order after the end of the new shipping window. No explanation- just didn't send them. I'd be cautious about ordering from Fogdog.
0,"don't order from FogDog -- you won't get it I ordered these tights on Dec. 17. I waited, and waited and waited. They were a Christmas gift for my sister. It took a full month -- until Jan. 12 -- for an email from the company. They mysteriously canceled my order. Thanks, guys! Guess there's always next Christmas."
0,Terrible... This trick is terrible. Not what I expected at all. The picture is completely decieving and is not a cup. I would not recommend this at all.
0,"Kindle version almost impossible to use The content of this book seems to be good, but my problem is that the kindle version has no table of contents, no index and no search function. It is therefore impossible to quickly find the section that you want or the topic you want - you have to page through the entire book until something useful appears. This is a fatal flaw for a reference book."
0,"Kindle version is impossible to use I agree with a previous reviewer. The Kindle version is impossible to use, because it has no table of contents or index or any way to look up a term. If you search for ""prime number"" for example, you get 75 hits but there is no indication which one is the definition. Recommend that unless this book is tagged with a table of contents that you stick with the paper copy."
0,Horrible negative stars The DVD was unwatchable the sound was intermittent.Positively the worst purchase I have ever made on AmazonI suspect the DVD was a Pirate copy
0,"Truly awful!!!!!!!!!!!! I read some reviews here and elsewhere that sounded positive, but honestly this film was AWFUL. My friend and I seriously discussed leaving after the first 20 minutes (somthing I have never done before), but decided to stick it out and hope that it would get better. It did, but only marginally. I ended up wishing that I had walked in the first place and not wasted my time and $9.00 on this sea of stupid lines and pointless ""plot"". It was insulting to both Hawaiians and Trans-gender people and most of all was NOT FUNNY, truly. I like Drew Barrymore, and Adam Sandler when he is playing a character with a brain in his head--and there is chemistry between these actors(...). Rent The Wedding Singer instead. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY--if you are over the age of 11 this film is too immature for you. And if you are under the age of 11 you will be bored."
0,"blah Once again all the funny stuff was in the previews. This could have been such a funny movie, but wasn't. Don't bother."
0,"wow.................. Can Adam get much worse? This is a naturally bad and stupid movie. Adam Sandler needs to give up, he is not funny anymore. All he does is play the same type of character in all of his movies. Don't buy this film, or anymore Adam Sandler movies to come."
0,"For small gutter minds There is much raunch in this movie trying to pass as humor.And give me a break. Sandler a ""man about town"" banging the tourists evry chance he gets. YUK. Oh but wait! He gets totally reformed overnight and becomes the most selfless, committed, sacrificial man who is willing to wait forever and enjoy a lifelong relationship with a woman who forgets him every day. Sure. Maybe if he would have been a virgin looking for his one true love then it would have been beliveable.And all the boob, ass, homo, vomit, sex jokes are just plain mindless and talentless. ""are you sure you will still love her in 15 years if she lets herself go and sex with her is nauseating"" How would you like that said as you say your wedding vows while the ""preacher"" is looking at his fat wife? It's not funny. It's just tasteless and tacky.The only good thing about this movie is the end."
0,"Awful! I enjoyed The Wedding Singer, I honestly did. I thought Sandler and Barrymore had good chemistry, the script was entertaining, there were some good jokes... and most of all it refrained from being corny, slow and boring. Now lets take 50 First Dates. Lets take out the good chemistry (what happened? God knows!), the entertaining script (boo, bum and vomit gags only go so far), and any good jokes and what do you have? This film! Ok, it's not as bad as, lets say, Mr Deeds or Little Nicky, but it was a massive disapointment. It came across like a last minute idea Sandler and his buddies had while vacationing in Hawaii and though, ah hell, lets do a version of Groundhog Day here and pass it off as a movie!Do yourself a favour. You want to watch 'a nice romantic comedy'... rent When Harry Met Sally. Wit over crass wins everytime!"
0,Scratched and skipping I thought it would be fun to bring along some movies set in Hawaii on our family trip. What a disappointment when we missed half the movie bc the item sent was so substandard.
0,"Beware this version This version of the film, from ROAN, should be avoided. The hour and 41 minute original is here chopped to an hour and 30 minutes. A mutilated film is no bargain at any price."
0,"my 2 cents This is a good story along the lines of ""Here Comes Mr. Jordon"", with a slight variation. But the DVD quality of the Gotham release is horrible. The picture quality is almost unwatchable and the un-even mono sound has a steady hissing all the way through the movie."
0,"Stay Away From Passport - Large ""PIP"" Logo On Screen Both Passport DVD's I've had the misfortune of viewing (this one & Plan 9 From Outer Space) have a large ""PIP"" logo on screen for the entire movie which is extremely distracting & unneccesary. For quality, get the Roan edition."

It's kind of cute, but I would get big baby Phoebe and Roxxi only.As for your FALSE LIES about Barbie, people are still buying them, Mattel HAS NOT given up, and Barbie will still be aroundfor years to come!

0,"Babyz? An adult wouldn't even wear that outfit! Are you seriously trying to tell me that this is a baby? A 15 year old wouldnt even wear that slutty clothes. Nor would a 20 or 30 year old! Do you seriosly want your kids to have this toy, and start to dress just like the ""baby?"" If you do, then go ahead, waste your money and your kids life.

Try ""Be not educated."" This girl is a shallow child, and it shows in her daft music. Just because you drop a name like Steinbeck in a song doesn't make you smart, or worldly. Here's a cookie, now shut up and go play with your even more narcissistic pseudo-intellectual boyfriend Johnny Third Eye Blind. These two are cut from the same lame ass hipster mold that you can find in any of the coffee shop of Berkeley, pontificating on their own genius and never realizing that they are not special no matter what people tell them. You want real ""intelligent"" music; try John Lennon or Tori Amos. Listening to Carlton's lyrical drivel is like grading a freshmen Philosophy paper, it's trite and irrelevant."

0,Shameless Self-Promoter She's featured on Time Warner cable commercials in West Tennessee. Her voice is actually quite irritating and the fact she is promoting this CD on an ad in this manner is a huge turn-off.
0,"I gave it a chance but.... The only reason I am writing this is because of that Time Warner commercial that keeps playing on TV was driving me insane! Now I mute the sound every time it comes on. I kept thinking, ""Why are they showing this local musician on this ad?"" Then I found out VC is a very popular singer, so I gave this CD a chance by listening to the preview clips above (maybe the ad did not do her justice, I thought). Well, the same weak,thin, and out-of-tune voice is still there. If you're over 14 years old and like this music, consider yourself tone-deaf (I'm a classically trained guitarrist who has played longer than VC has been alive, BTW). I think she does have some ability on the piano (I'm assuming that's her on the piano), though."
0,"I don't get it. all right. i admit it. i don't get it. i had never heard of her before that irritating commercial started airing 500 times a day. i keep the remote handy just so i won't hear her bland, uninspired, amateurish rendition of a great stones song. this cd is all fluff. where's the emotion? what, does her dad own the studio?"

A better gift idea would be Speakerboxxx/The Love Below by Outkast, or Elephant by The White Stripes. Merry Un-Clay Christmas!"
0,"Clay ? More like mud... I'm sorry to every Claymate out there but Clay Aiken isn't really my type. He's annoying, whiny, and not meaningful. It seems like hes marketing to 5th graders and his mom.

If you want to listen to meaningful male vocals, I would suggest Coldplay, Keane, or Alexi Murdoch.I do think that Clay Aiken has a good voice for Broadway or theater, but when he produces an over the top pop album such as this, he's wasting his talent."
0,Snore...ZZZZZZZZ While Clay has a great voice this album was a total bore. Every song sounds exactly the same and I am glad I only listened to the album and didn't waste my money. There are about two good songs off the album and I am already want to puke from hearing one of them.
0,"Of couse he's number one! Most Clay fans are buying from 2 - 10 copieseach to help boost his sells! This isunfair giving us a false number of peopleactually buying! But how else can theykeep him in that number one spot withthat slop! Yeah,he's number one all right!A one star rating!!!!"
0,Fantastic Every song in the album is wonderful and he has such a beautiful voice. I never tire of listening to it.
0,"*1/2 stars I didn't care much for Clay on AI (or Ruben, for that matter), but I got the CD anyway since he has a really good voice. Well, there are a couple good songs on this CD, such as ""Invisible"", although some of the lyrics are weird (""if I was invisible then I could just watch you in your room""), ""No More Sad Songs"", and the chorus to ""I survived you"". Overall, though, I didn't really care for the CD. If you were a fan of him on the show, you'll definitely like this album."
0,"THIS IS ATROCIOUS! my God! this actually gets zero stars!!! how can anyone listen to this schlock?!?! clay aiken sounds exactly like the backstreet crossed with whitney houston. a CD full of sorry sounding pop hooks and soppy balladry is just absolutely aweful! if you want some good pop hooks and ballads, then get simon and garfunkle instead. and if you feel like some soppy balladry then get david bowie's ""hunky dory""...just make sure you pass on this true piece of crap of an album...seriously, this sucks really really bad"
0,"Could this be worse? Without the studio trickery, he would be doing community college musicals. The make-over doesn't do it for me either. I wouldn't spend the money and I'd give it away if it were given to me. What new lows will America's talent standards slip to?"
0,"Why?! Who buys and listens to his stuff?! I got this CD as a gift and must say I was very disappointed to hear that this is what America likes? His voice sounds so average ""broadway musical"" and not outstanding at all. My bet is he can thank American Idol that he sells any albums at all."
0,"American idle is more like it... Clay Aiken has to be one of the worst singers ever to come off of American Idol. The songs on his debut CD are all predictible and sleep-inducing. Even William Hung is capable of making a better CD than this drab garbage. With boring singles like ""Invisible"" and ""The Way,"" I can't understand how Americans could make this guy a star. Please, Clay, if you insist on making more music, at least have the decency of doing a nice gay anthem like ""I Will Survive"" or ""YMCA."""
0,"a disappointment for a HUGE Clay fan! I was a HUGE Clay fanatic throughout all the AI hype. I fell in love with his voice and his personality and dashing good looks. However, this CD disappointed me. The voice that I fell in love with was his ""live"" voice, and I don't like his ""studio"" voice very much. I like 2 or 3 of the songs on the cd, but it makes me sad to give it a bad review, because I was looking forward to this cd since May."
0,"You've Got to be Kidding For all those who compare Ruben and Clay, there is no comparison. Ruben won b/c he is a true talent. While Clay had to be ""made over"", Ruben is still Ruben. I listened to Clay's first 5 songs and had to turn it off. While he can sing other peoples songs well he cannot hold a tune to his own album. I was extremely disappointed, and would not buy this CD."
0,"Overrated Give me a break. I do not see what all the fuss is about. I listened to this CD and although Clay sings well, the songs are boring ballads and they all sound the same. I agree with all the negative reviews from the media. This album is nothing to get excited about and I sure wouldn't waste my money on it. You'll get more for you money with Josh Groban's new CD."
0,What is the world coming to? Clay Aiken stinks! He is a manufactured 'pop star' whose facial expressions on American Idol made him look constipated!These songs are cliched and over-sung. Let's hope Ruben's effort is better than this sentimental rubbish
0,"MANILOW ""WANNABE"" Okay, Clay Aiken may be a dork in person, but the fact of the matter is he won runner up in American Idol and can sing, and that's about it.When I saw him on American Idol, I was disgusted! Clay sings cheesy awful ballads that make you want to hit the ""mute"" button on your remote. What's even more disgusting is his God-awful wardrobe! The fact that so many teenage girls out there are so in love with Clay makes me want to vomit!!! This music is for nerds only! GET REAL!!!!"
0,This sucks. Why in the world did they record this mess? He was better doing that american idol material than this crap. Ugh save your money.
0,"UGH, yuck! Not a very good album. Many of the songs put me to sleep half the time, and were just down right boring. In my opinion, Darren Hayes is much more interesting compared to Clay. If you want a good CD get something else, this one isnt worth the time or money."
0,"Go to Broadway, please!!! While Clay Aiken does have an amazing talent for singing, he's album better suites middle-aged America instead of a younger, more ""poppy"" audience. I get irritated seeing people compare Ruben and Clay. They are in two totally different genres!"
0,"not so much a review of the CD k, I love Clay... he ROCKED on AI2.My only problem is the song ""Invisible""- lyrics: If I were invisible, i would watch you in your room"". STALKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!!! Does anyone else find this song as deeply disturbing as I do? He's got a GREAT voice tho! He just needs to think about the songs he's singing before recording them... I mean seriously..."
0,"YUCK!! Stop buying Clay's fame!!!!!This CD is definitely not 5 stars! L:ike someone said earlier, read the musiccritics reviews on it before you purchase.Whoever bought 10 copies of thisCD is a FOOL and an idiot! Actually that would make the whole so called ""Clay nation"" who are all purchasing multiple copies of it in their sick campaign to buy Clay his fame. Where is your trust in histalent? Please leave him alone and purchase the CD theway normal fans would buy for their favorite artist and see what happens?You are only hurting him, making him think that he's more than he is and franklyit's embarrassing. To see him strutting and stooping and straining and switching the mike from hand to hand trying to work up some feeling to the songs. lol!it's a big jokein our house. We actually had a party too laughing at this guy.I love Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and a few others, but to purchase more than one or two copies of their CD is totally rediculous! Stop buying Clays way to the top! LEAVE HIM ALONE!!!!"
0,"Disappointed I am a big Clay Aiken fan and anxiously awaited his full cd. Unfortunately, this cd was not what I expected. Apparently, this was a rushed job because none of songs really appeal to me. The cd is bland, uninspiring and totally not what I expected. I expected more and hopefully his next cd will be better."
0,"OH NO CLAY Yes, there is no question about Clay's talent. That's a given. However, this album just doesn't show it. His singles were fabulous and then they disappoint us with this album. You can't even tell where one song ends and the next begins. It's all the same stuff. C'mon now~give the man the songs that he is so capable of delivering with spine tingling sensations!"
0,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'm sorry if any of you teen enjoy this lispy southern high school reject like 'em but i think it's all crap...don't get me wrong, i appreciate all forms of music and clay does have an ok singing voice but his style belongs on broadway doing a musical...he would be the BEST Sandra Dee on Grease i'm sure...it's funny to me how you can all like him because of a show..."
0,"WIMPY!! Sorry Clay, I kept an open mind...but this CD is a corny, wimpy collection of out-dated pop. Clay should have stayed the red-haired, freckle-faced, 4-eyed christian singer that he once was. They have turned him into to a blonde, spiky haired howdy doody. My friends and I say......""CLAY NO WAY""!!!!!"
0,This cd proves why Ruben won This cd is hurrendous. Ruben is SO much better. Want a good cd - check out soulful.
0,DOESN'T MEASURE UP This CD disappointed me. I was expecting more from Clay but I guess this is what happens when you rush your work. I hope his next one is better because this one sucked.
0,"Not even one star to be honest This is just an album full of oversung sappy, cheesy lyrics. Horrible production from the AI machine. Where do they find these songwriters?And could Clay over enunciate a little more?Yes, he won't sing about sex, but he's singing about being invisible and watching someone in their room. <@@> Scary!"
0,Absolute Rubbish On behalf of Randy-Paula and the producers of american Idol I humbly apologize for besieging America with this crap.
0,Invisible is the only worthy song This CD is just full of rockish country same old stuff. I really do not think clay makes a good pop star at all and this CD proves it.
0,"Disaster It's easy, there're only a few possibilities why you like this album:1. You're a little gal in your early teens, and u think he's, well, cute.2. You know zilch about music. You're trying to be a victim of the mushrooming commercial music that I'm so sick of.Did u ever feel a rush of blood oozing to your heart. NO? Then his songs probably dun impress you much."
0,"I'll tell you why he's bad! Clay Aiken... why is he so big? Answer: he was on American idol. Did he win? Answer: No! Then why is he bigger than Ruben? Answer: it's a miracle! Number one, you have to admit, he looks sort of like a clown. Two, even his feet are huge! They look like a joke. But, I realize that this has nothing to do with his singing. What do I think about his singing? Awful! Every song sounds the same, and if he and everyone else would only realize how NORMAL he really is, you'd know that nothing of his is worth buying. If you want some real music, go buy Michael Buble's debut album, there's a guy with REAL talent. Clay Aiken is just a screaching clown that somehow scored a record deal. I will give it one star only for the fact that there is an actual CD in a case, that someone had to make."
0,"UH OH UH OH CLAYMATES!!! Clay's album has fallen out of the top twenty sellers on Amazon.com!!! Quick, better buy ten more copies to get him back up there! Because we all know you can judge the greatness of a record by how many copies get sold. (NOT!)"
0,"When a good voice meets bad music This album is a complete waste of Clay's voice. All I can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad Air Supply meets bad Barry Manilow. I can't understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album that's not worthy of them. These songs are about exciting as Muzak. Except if Clay's music was playing in elevators, I would be forced to take the stairs. I hope by the next release Clay has the music to complement his voice."
0,"clay hot man Dear Mr.Clay,You CD is a great CD. You voice is plesant to here. You very talentd singer. You hot man and not fat like the Rubin dude. I wish you look and hope make another grate CD soon. You win all Garmmys. Bye bye."
0,It hurts It hurts to see Clay fall like this. The momentum leading up to the CD release was so great that it only leads to disappointment. It's not Clay's fault. I blame it on the media and hype surrounding the release that Clay could not do anything but fail.Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this trash. Josh Grobin's CD is much more satisfying.
0,"Very Disappointed I just purchased the new Clay Aiken CD and I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in my life. I feel like this man's beautiful voice is no where even near 10% of what it is capable of on this album. Most of the songs don't even sound like him. I have waited for this to come out because his voice sends goosebumps up my spine when he hits ""those notes"", and I skipped through every song on this album and found none that even came close. I hope that Clay speaks up and says, this is not the measure of me, and his next album show cases his God given talent. When you hear songs like ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" that are amazing and then listen to this album, you cannot even begin to compare. The only reason I gave it one star is because of the song ""This is The Night,"" other then that, I would not have rated it."
0,"What did they do to him??? After listening to the first few songs of the album I've been waiting months for, I had to look and make sure I picked-up the right one. It doesn't even sound like him, which is ironic since most of his audience liked him for the way he sounds!!! The songs could use some help, but at least they used songs by serious song writers, such as Desmond Child. Let's just hope that Clay can hang around enough to go his own way and sound the way he did before."
0,"What a shame! What a waste! What sabotage! This CD is a spectacular disappointment. Clay has a huge, pure voice, and this CD works hard to cancel it out. Overproduced and underbalanced, every song is marred by a pervasive, tinny whitenoise, as if the drummer was told to keep the cymbals hissing through every song. This fuzzes up Clay's pure, clear tone, and cancels out every nuance of his emotional and musical resonance. It's as if the producer/arrangers didn't trust his voice to carry. What idiots. Clay seems like a smart kid; hopefully he's smart enough to choose another producer for his next CD."
0,"Yuck Clay Aiken's bombastic, over the top singing style is bad enough to make Baby Jesus cry. If you're not a tween or a demented middle-age soccer mom, I recommend you pass on buying this album.Patooey."
0,"A Matter of Spellling Does it matter how you get there? It's impossible to say if Aiken would sound different atop the virtual Mount McKinley if he had worked his way up and wrote his own songs. I think it would, because the sameness of the tracks are as alive as echoes in an anechoic chamber. How do you spell ""sucks""?"
0,"Clay please dont become so commercial! First let me start by saying that clay was y favorite American Idol, I thoght, and still think, that he should have beat Ruben, Now he very well could have been a member of the bubble gum band N Sync .the One Star is for clays great voice, the lack of the other 4 stars is for his giving into that teeny bopper sound."
0,"Recycled and Reused Measure of a Man should read Measure of a Boy. His ""so-called"" music is only been recycled from previous performers such as N-Sync, Backstreet Boys, etc. Isn't there anyone out there with an original voice or original music that they write themselves? This guy is not even worth watching as I witnessed one night on Jay Leno's, Tonight Show. Give me Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, even Luciano Pavarotti! At least these guys can and did sing with soul and a lot of heart, something this kid should learn before he releases another song. Even my 15 and 17 year old kids just can't get into this guy's singing. Sorry Clay!"
0,"New material I am a huge Clay fan, but I am extremely disappointed in this CD. The man can sing like no one else, but he had to sing songs that were less than stellar, to say the least. Give him some great songs to sing, and he'll do right by them."
0,"Sucked! There was not one song on this CD that impressed me. I expected more from Clay Aiken. His voice was drowned out by the music half the time and the lyrics did not capture my attention. In other words, there is not one track that I found myself humming or singing later.I force fed myself the whole CD just to get my monies worth. I was very dissappointed. Not worth buying. Hopefully, his next album will be more entertaining or at least bearable. I am a fan."
0,"Disappointed but still a fan. Can't hide my disappointment with this CD. I was looking forward to it, especially after attending the Idol concert in Raleigh. Unfortunately on this CD Clay is overpowered by background singers. There is also no diversity. Most of the songs sound the same to me. As an older fan I was hoping for some classic numbers like those Clay sang on the TV series. I won't be listening to this CD again. Hopefully whoever is responsible for it will learn from the experience and can produce something which will let Clay shine and reach out to his entire audience on his next CD."
0,bad music at its best this is the worst album i have heard since barry manilow . clay did a snow job on the american people witrh this crap he put out songs with no meaning at all. give me back my money clay. kelly clarkson was far better then this junk that no one wants to listen to. go back to georgia red clay.
0,Nice guy and great voice but I liked him better on American Idol. I'm glad that others like it his cd and that he's doing really well on the charts.
0,Go Back in the studio and Try Again I agree with the woman who reviewed this album. It just sounds like Backstreet Boys and Nsync music recreated in 2003. Been there done that. Clay needs to step his game up if he wants to last in the music industry any longer.
0,Stinks I am sorry but this CD just does not work. You are better off buying the single mp3 that you want to listen to. Buying the complete CD is a waste.
0,"Why I Hate Potato Chips Actually I love Potato Chips...this just plain SUCKS. What is wrong with you people?! Must you follow and do everything a ""reality"" show tells you to do? And this guy supposeldy freakin' LOST! There's something wrong here folks. When society is reduced this low and forget such classics and Beethoven and Mozart Concertos, Classic rock like Floyd or Zepplin, even modern music like Dream Theater and Nightwish...there is something wrong with American Society.Just like with Potato Chips...you don't know when the frell to stop!"
0,"Deja vu (like a bad dream over and over again!) Wow! Can you hear it?? Listen - listen very carefully! The music here is the same as Kelly Clarkson's album, only with different lyrics and Clay singing instead of Kelly! Can I sue somebody??"
0,"HE HAS A HARD TIME BEING CONSISTENT Think back to the final 32 on American Idol II, all trying for a spot in the top 10. I remember Clay being in the group with Kimberly Locke and Ruben Studdard. Clay had this habit of over enunciating which cost him a slot in the final 10, losing out to Kimberly and Ruben. However, Aiken was extremely lucky, got a second chance, he blows us away. Now, comes his first album Measure of a Man....can I just say, if Clay were trying to get into the top ten with any of these songs, he'd be sent home again and hopefully, he wouldn't get a second chance. This first release proves to me that there should never be another wildcard again, someone more deserving, talented, and consistent should be here. Simply because a person has a range of loud and louder doesn't make them a great and consistent singer. I will give him Clay credit, when he is on, he is on, but he can only yell for so long when singing, that must take a lot out of his voice and it shows."
0,You will agree I broke out in a cold sweat listening to this album. I don't like this album and you will surly agree.
0,"A total waste of time and money Oh Great just what America needs, another souless, overhyped no talent John Mayer wannabe. I haven't and won't buy this cd but workong in a record store I had to check it out and see what all the fuss was. The songs are poorly written and meaningless. Clay himself sounds as if he belongs in a highschool production of Grease. Don't waste your time and money on this. If you actually like this kind of drab souless music just pick up John Mayer's new cd, at least he sounds like a talented singer rather than a aspiring drama queen with a sore throat."
0,"EGAD!!! Listen up and watch that video for ""Invisible"" to see what pre-fab crapola Clay Aiken is up to. Remember when U2 had a spontaneous street concert and were shut down by the police? Well, Aiken's video for ""Invisible"" wants to convince us that his song ""Invisible,"" which isn't about much, has such political relevance and cachet that the police and a HELICOPTER have to suddenly rush in and hold the fans at bay. It's all calculated, guaranteed to provide his voice -- which deserves better -- to seem dangerous, although that danger has been carefully accounted for. Oh, Clay's not dangerous, except to ask people to open up their wallets for a song that is designed by a hit factory and make it SEEM politically relevent. Thanks a lot, Clay. If you were invisible -- oh wait, you already are."
0,"Why? Why do people like this fake music that is written by people other than the person who is actually singing it? This American Idol stuff is uncreative and for impotent minds. Reality that lacks reality. I lisetend to a few songs on here and sure Mr Aiken is a good singer, but there is no way I will buy into this facade. I will only listen to real music, and what I mean by real music is musicians that write and perform their own songs."
0,"Television Trash Is this what the music industry has turned into? As if the zombied brain dead haven't ruined it enough for those of us that know how to turn off the television. Music is about capturing the intangable, not fashion makeovers for the poor little geek. Explore artists with creativity and not this junk that is being spoonfed to the masses. You know you'll just end up using this CD as a coaster in 2 months anyway."
0,"Disappointed Have always liked Clay Aiken, but the songs and Clay's singing style all sound the same. It is an extremely non-versatile and very boring effort. Compared to Kelly Clarkson excellent Thankful CD, Clay himself should be ""thankful"" that his fans helped him debut at #1. ""Measure of a Man"" is truly a disappointing CD."
0,"The Amazon viewer dared give an HONEST review Why don't you people shut up your attacking of ever honest reviewer and actually listen to this drab piece of junk. So Clay can sing and he seems to be a nice guy. That does NOT make this mess a good album. It lacks everything that makes for a good album like originality, emotion, oh and how about having the album reflect the singer. This album has nothing to do with Clay. He didn't write one single word and therefore it is nothing but kareoke, which is exactly how it sounds. You obsessed people need to get a clue. Clay is not the messiah, he isn't even a real musician. A good singing voice alone does not an artist make. There are hundreds of equally talented singers out there doing commercial jingles. Clay got lucky by being noticed by a tv show, however a tv show is all this is. Real music fans will NEVER fall for this"
0,shameful. shame on all you pieces of crap for feeding the well oiled machine of manufactured pop crap.......i hope you all realzie that clay's lyrics and beats were all written by 40 year old men......im not disputing that he has an excellent voice ......but so do miillions otheres..........the only reason hes popular is because america is a rotten pool of television..........i love QUALITY television........which is so so rare...........but by watching American Idol and prompted this garbage to number one on the charts..........you are destroying artists with actual MUSICAL talent who can play there instruments......my only comfort is that this douche bags 15 minutes will soon be over.......anyways..........support bands with some talent........thank you for your time
0,"another American Idol disaster Why don't you people buy albums by REAL artists and REAL singers, not these prefabricated generic posers.Try listening to the Aislers Set, the Clientele, Belle & Sebastian, or the Shins.NOT Clay Aiken. Not N Sync. Not Justin. Not Brittney. I'm not trying to be a music snob here, but this guy is about on the level of somebody singing the national anthem at a high school football game. He stays in key but has no feeling or uniqueness to his voice. And he looks a little too much like that banjo kid in ""Deliverance"", if you know what I mean."
0,"This album deserves NEGATIVE 10 STARS! Why would any lucid human being waste their money buying this junk? This isnt music. This is contrived and manufactured. I don't watch american idol and i never would because it's a awful t.v show that degenarates everything good about music. The ONLY people who buy this are clueless teenaged girls who know ZILCH about music, and and middle aged woman who buy this for their kids to TORTURE them!! Way too sappy, way too bland. This is safe music for people afraid to listen to music that takes risks and challenges them intellectually. Clay Aiken should stop covering songs from The Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel. He's destroying those classics with his ""broadwayesque"" voice. The Beatles were actual artists who took risks in music and were innovative. Clay is nothing like that. Just another talentless popstar getting his 15 minutes of fame and then will fade away into oblivion. The sooner the better!!!"
0,"UMMM Ummm, he sounds good and all but some setbacks. The first song sounds good but when listening to words it sound awful. Like someone else said it sounds like he is stocking a girl. His voice warbles sometimes and just other stuff."
0,Not worth Buying This style is for broadway. The songs are blend!.. He will not last making those type of songs!
0,"Ewww Eyeflutter!!! Ewww last night on Billboard Awards, Clay was doing that gross eye-flutter thing again! Ick! I bet he was pretty sad when Beyonce beat him out for Female Artist Of The Year. This CD is horrible and so is Ruben's. American Idol stinks. Listen to the Foo Fighters instead, you will be much happier."
0,"AND YOUR AMERICAN IDOL IS... not Clay Aiken. I am so sick of all of these people saying Clay Aiken is the ""Real American Idol"". If I remember correctly, HE LOST. Did you hear that people? HE LOST to Ruben Studdard by over 100,000 votes. I personally like Clay, I think he is extremely talented, and seems to be a genuinely nice guy. However, this album is just horrible. It's slow, bland, and just boring. All the songs sound the same, and the lyrics to ""Invisible"" are just a bit disturbing. I hope on his next outing he will have better material, he deserves better than this stuff. If you want to hear American Idol at it's best, go pick up ""Free Yourself"" by Fantasia. She's the best idol of all of them."
0,"Overrated Unless you like syrupy power ballads that all sound the same, I would save my money. Mr. Aiken is overrated and over-hyped."
0,"Wasted Talent Here is a guy with an exceptional voice. What is he doing singing boring, emotionless music that could be sung by countless no talent others on the BMG label. I hope the guys at BMG can rent David Foster to help Clay to get it right next time. Clay could be as good as Michael Buble or Gosh Groban if only he had someone who could bring out his incredbile voice."
0,"Best CD!!! I think the Measure of A Man CD is one of the best CD's I have ever purchased in terms of versility and enjoyment. It has some great break up songs, a couple with a light Christian flare, total melt down songs of devotion and a sultry, sensual ballad that will keep you hitting repeat.....that would be track 12!!!!! Enjoy, I love it!!!!"
0,"I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH PREACHING THEY DO This album is not good. It's not the voice I heard on American Idol, the voice on this CD is not even good enough for Broadway. The power exhibited on American Idol is lost in this CD, I'm sorry folks, call it what you want but this CD isn't Clay Aiken. The attempt to turn him into a Pop King has taken away that beautiful voice. BRING IT BACK and forget about pop. Billboard may have said it is Pop Album of the Year but they forgot to say they took the voice away to make it pop."
0,"I Was SOOOOOOOOOOOO Disappointed!! I love Clay Aiken to death, but I was really disappointed with this CD... I really feel that it is too commercial. I love his voice and he ""curled my toes"" when I saw American Idol. He and Ruben were my picks. I was sad when Clay didn't win, and I liked the ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" CD single, but I didn't like this. I won't pre-order any more... I'll wait to hear clips."
0,"Good Try This is at best, a good try for a first CD. But, I was somewhat dissapointed with the selection of songs as well as with the vocal arrangements. The vocals could be a lot stronger coming from a talented singer, such as Clay. I think a lot of people are buying this CD and making a lot of hype because they are glad to see someone who does not fit the mold make it big. I'm sorry, I have to agree with the critics. ""He should stick to show tunes""."
0,"Nothing personal at all.... ...Clay has an amazing voice...very clear and strong. Honestly, I just don't like the songs or his style. It's not that he can't sing. I guess he just doesn't sing the music that I like to hear. I was given this CD as a gift...why?...I don't know. It was a gift from a secret pal and I guess whoever pulled my name at the beginning of the year doesn't know me very well. If you like Clay's kind of music, you'll love this CD because he sings it well. Me? I guess I'm just more of a typical R&B fan. Love Ruben's CD...love Tamyra's CD...love Kelly Clarkson's CD...but just couldn't get with this one. Nothing personal. I probably just never should have listened to it. My bad."
0,"Cynical cash-in Sorry, but this album is probably the worst I've heard all year. It's so bland it's impossible to distinguish one cliched, tune-free track from the next. The cynicism of Simon Fuller and the whole American Idol team is exposed again - they knew that Clay's first album would go multi-platinum however useless it was, so have made no effort whatever.They clearly have no interest in developing Clay as a long-term artist. If they did, they'd have given him some good material so people would come back for more the second time. Here in the UK, the first Pop Idol winner Will Young has just had a massive success with his second album - in part because his first one was actually good, and the public were not duped into buying a half-baked CD like this which isn't worth the plastic it's packaged in. It will be interesting to see what Clay does next - if I were him, I'd start writing my own songs. Whatever his talent, they couldn't be any worse than the ones on *Measure of a Man*."
0,"Big disappointment!!! Bought it and was a bit disappointed. I thinkthat Clay should stick to his own style andstop trying to be someone he's not. The songsjust didn't do it for me.Certainly not the Clay Aiken that sold platinumwith his first CD. Wonder how that happened???????Spend your money of something worth while, butif you just got to have it, burn yourself acopy from a Clay fanatic who is sure to havea few extras on hand."
0,"Measure of a man........Clay Aiken I had waited for a long time for this CD to come out and I was really looking forward to buying it. I'm no young kid (age 69) and think he has a beautiful voice, however, I was so disappointed in ""Measure of a man""! I was hoping he would have some of the songs from ""Idol"" or at least popular songs that I had at least heard before. I still think he has the most beautiful voice that has come along in a long time, but I'll tell you, before I buy his next CD, I'll sure make sure to look at the selections of the songs before I buy it!! I think he should pick his own songs next time instead of letting other people!!!!"
0,"measure of a man=1 star......clay aiken=5 stars and more! Clay has an amazing voice! and I voted for him on AI, but this album just doesn't makes him justice, yeah this songs, well some of them have meanning and thats great but the beat and just the flow of the album is way too slow(and I love ballads and slow stuff also fast stuff) and this kind of pop music trying to be contemporary is just not for him, he is a true sing a true artist and he has an amazing beautiful voice, but this album is just not for him, maybe 'Invisible"" I think it's the only one that kinda makes him jsutice but the rest no, sorry Clay I'm sure you'll make it huge with ur next album."
0,"just ok Clay is ok but he's no Fantasia or Ruben, and never will compare with them, sure his fan's say he's the true AI, but all I ask is where is his million dollar contract that they give to the winner's, sure we all know about clays padded sell's,(what else is new) but where is his industry nom, did they forget about him, it look's that way, maybe one day his writers will write him some desent songs, that people other than his over zealious fan's can say there ok, but that's about all you can say about clay aiken's music is it's just ok, anything else would be a lie."
0,"so sad I see why clay was'nt nominated for a grammy, this cd is not grammy material, this cd is strickly for those who have bad taste in music, all though I think clay has a desent voice he need to get better writers for his music...but I guess all that matters is his fan's are happy, however Kelly, Ruben and now Fantasia there the real product, getting a million dollar contract is the icing on the cake, that's how you can tell the winner's from the losers."
0,"clay is such a joke he might start rapping on his next cd and chances are you might hear him, ruben and pharrell do a joint together anyway clay's an okay singer but ruben was better too bad they got rid of frenchie davis to quote funkadelic the girl is bad."
0,"I AM A TRUE MUSIC FAN I know good music when I hear it and this debut by Clay Aiken isn't good music. Additionally, I read in these reviews that someone believes Clay is receiving 1 star ratings because of his Christian beliefs. Hello, he has a POP album and I had no idea he was a Christian and I think most people reviewing wouldn't associate Pop with being a Christian. If this is the case, shouldn't Mr. Aiken be singing for the Lord instead of Pop music? Looks like Mr. Aiken is a sellout. I purchased the album based on his AI performance and all the 5 star reviews here and it is a let down, I feel totally defrauded by all this false hype that has been going on. Most of the five star reviews here are false, don't believe them or you'll be turned into a sucker as I was."
0,"Ug! First of all, to the reviewer below me who called him ""a true American idol""--no, he's not. Even I know he lost, and I don't even watch that show. Next, his song ""Invisible"" is one of the worst I've ever heard. It shouldn't be ""If I WAS invisible""; it should be ""If I WERE invisible."" Plus, if you were invisible, you'd ""Watch me in my room?"" Mommmmy!"
0,"i'd rather pour acid into open cuts than buy this cd... i strongly recommend that anyone who ever considered purchasing this cd, spend your 15 bucks at arbys, because this cd is garbage. i used to love clay aiken, i even voted for him, but his ego is too large for my liking. this cd honestly would only appeal to deaf people, merely because they wouldnt be able to hear it. i almost fell asleep listening to it, every song is the same. maybe clay should consider flipping patties."
0,"Michael Bolton Jr WOW, this album is horrible!!! How can anyone with a fully functional brain buy this nonsense!!! This is contrived tripe targeted to people who don't know any better. I can't believe this type of CRAP is what people call music these days. This is safe, middle of the road JUNK! Music is going downhill and it's because CRAP like this is what sells these days. Whatever happened to taking risks in music? Not just pandering to people who are afraid of listening to music that actually challenges and provokes thought.Stop being braindead drones america and reject this manufactured sewage that american radio and record companies are trying to pass off as music. Awful just awful.......*gags*"
0,"Nauseatingly sugar-sweet Ulch, can we say ""boy band""? As much as I like Clay's voice, I have to say the complete opposite for this CD. With cheesy titles like ""I Will Carry You"" and ""No More Sad Songs"", this album screams ""teeny-bopper dream come true"". I've listened to each track a few times in hopes of maybe hearing something different and/or enjoyable, but no chance. 1 star."
0,"Clay Aiken Who? That's right. With music like this he's already forgotten. And to Mr. A music fan from Phila, Pa, Clay Aiken's album was released at a time when there was no other competition. Hello!!! Noone good or really popular anyway is releasing albums at this time, so sure he'll be #1. I'd like to see him go up against Eminem, 50 Cent, Norah Jones, or even Britney will smoke him in sales and she can't even sing. So keep reading , Mr. Music Fan from Philly a.k.a ""Loser"", those same two and only two magazines that like Clay. By the way, my radio stations doesn't play crappy music like yours."
0,"not worth the money My son really wanted this toy, he recieved it as a gift. The tower falls off if you look at it wrong, I will have to epoxy it to the base. It is expensive and does not come with any teen titans. Buy the figures and build your own tower/fort for them."
0,"Teen Titan Tower falls apart This toy is absolutely terrible. I gave it one star, only because zero is not an option. My son really wanted this toy, and when he got it, he played with it for about 5 minutes, and walked away. Even a four year old can see how lame this toy is. It comes with a trigger that is supposed to eject some kind of orange ramp to launch a car. Nice concept, except the thing doesn't come out all the way, so my son ends up pulling the thing out. There are missiles that are supposed to attach to the side according to the instructions, they don't. The tower keeps falling off of it. All around, I can't believe how poorly designed this toy is for the money. You would think I bought it at the dollar store or something. I would urge all who consider buying this toy, to talk your kid into something else. IT'S TERRIBLE!!!"
0,"Disappointment! We were very excited to give the Titan Tower to our son for Christmas...and are now very disappointed. This toy is of very poor quality. The pieces will not stay together and my son has no interest in it, saying it is not fun because it keeps falling down. I wish I had kept the receipt so that I could return it."
0,"Teen Titan Tick-off I got this for my son because he wanted it and on tv the toy looked strong... But, the tower doesn't stay on and I took the advise of someone that reviewed the item and crazyglued the tower on to the base. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product if you can help it. My son has all of the characters to Teen Titans and their different cars he doesn't use it at all anymore, but he plays with the action figures."
0,the toy that falls apart this toy is not well made it dosen't stay together. When the child plays with it the tower comes off the base. It is altogether not thought out I would not recomend or buy this toy again.
0,"Definitely NOT worth the money!!!!! My son is 6 and loves the Teen Titans. This item was on his Christmas list as one of his ""big"" things. As I was putting it together ""for Santa"", I was very disappointed at how poorly it was made. The sections wouldn't stay together at all. The little rockets/missles barely shoot out of the thing. In the back, there is a trigger thing that is supposed to launch the little car. Well, it barely touches the car at all. Not only that, the instructions were bogus and not very clear. For the money, you'd think it had lights and noises etc... Nada. My son was really disappointed. So, if you're child is wanting this try to discourage it. My son still plays with it but it's really not worth it at all."
0,"Not worth it Listen to the other reviews. This book is just an encyclopedia of waste. At least an encyclopedia has pictures and examples; this book has neither. After the first 2 chapters, it's all downhill. It is a very frustrating read because there are absolutely no examples. It's all theory. Don't waste your money and don't listen to all the fancy quotes on the book's back cover. This book just doesn't cut it."
0,"TOTAL LET DOWN - FULL OF ERRORS Book is incomplete and full of errors, even simple errors where toString is in the code and not used properly and throws an error - he left off the ""()"". And we are supposed to learn from someone who can not use toString? The code from web site does not compile per book instructions. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this, no matter what the paid-reviewers say. This is one of the worst written book, code fragments and no full listing of code. The site provides code that does not compile correctly with vague insrtuctions as if it were going to actual work. Stick with O'Reilly series. Please Ted Husted, find another profession..... ( I picked 1 star because zero was not an otpion)"
0,"Complete waste of money If I have to rate this book, I would rate it below 1 star. This is complte waste of money and I would suggest DON'T waste your money on this. If you really want to buy book on Struts, go for the one which O'Reilley has. Apart from numberous errors, this book doesn't cover anything new other then just basic and that too is not worth reading it."
0,Real Bad Book I've read it over and over and I can't understand anything. Struts Html Tags are glossed over without examples. Just 2 lines on how to use the tags but the object/bean that it refers to is left to your imagination. If you understand the javadoc that comes with Struts then this will be clear to you but then you don't need a book. The O'reilly book is 1000 times better.Serves me right for buying a book without browsing and just relying on the reviews.
0,"A Not So Nice Song From A Not So Nice Spice Will the real Melanie C please stand up? From athletic, hyper, popster, to cursing, loud, rock chick. Personally I find the new Melanie C to be annoying and way over the top. Not only is this song poorly written, but it's poorly sung, poorly orchestrated, and just poor overall. C'mon now Melanie dont you think you could do a little better than this?"
0,absolutely tasteless song for a tasteless Spice! Get a life Melanie C and I think you are better of with the Spice Girls where we cannot hear your annoying voice!! And please stop being ARROGANT. A one star is really too much for it! A minus five stars would be fair.
0,"No Thanks! Maybe this movie is okay for the art-house crowd, or those interested in mental illness, but for me, it was just plain boring. Didn't do a thing for me. Unwatchable. I've seen worse, but wish I'd known what type of ""comedy"" this really was before we paid for the rental.Not recommended."
0,Awful Horrible movie. I didn't even finish watching it. It reminded me of a low-budget B-movie and that is being charitable.
0,Special I found this movie slow paced. The plot failed to catch and keep my attention. I am glad I did not buy this title.
0,Not worth 1 star This book is not worth the poor trees that died or it.The Chandlers are con-artists and bullies. Save your money and seek the truth.
0,"12 years too late If it wasn't already evident that the 1993 child abuse allegations were based on money (greed) then the release of this ''tell all'' book certanly clarifies the situation. Let me tell you if my nephew (or any other relative for that matter) had ever being abused (whether or not it was by a celebrity or not) I AM NOT going to release a book which will bring myself ecomic gain at the expense of my ''damaged'' nephew.This book is full of half truths and whole lies, it amazes me that in ''the home of the brave'' the only way to make a buck is by capitalizing off somebody elses ''missfortune''.This book is 12years past its sell-by date and the odour is overpowering, the only place for this book is in the trash"
0,Trash the book! The book is all nonsense. Want to read a book about Michael? Read Letters to Michael Jackson.
0,All That Glitters The Crime and The Coverup I was just wondering if I could please have my money back. When is this man going to confess that his brother worte this while the whole thing was going on if not before.All I can say is YUCK.
0,"You really shouldn't believe everything you read! To the reviews that are claiming this book is the absolute truth, how do you know? You have a Uncle here that has not talked to this kid in over 12 years? Was not in the picture when the kid was hanging out with Mr. Jackson. You have a family here that extorted money from Michael jackson plain and simply. Thats why this kid now an adult refused to testify in the 2005 court case. To the readers who really believe this book ask yourself if my child was molested would I take $20 million and let the person run free to molest others? I for sure wouldn't! Food for thought!"
0,"What a waste of time This book is a total waste of time an money. I have to read it with my English class for 7th grade and it is just plain stupid. Trust me there is alot of other books out there that are much better than this. This is the worst book I have read in years. It is just so unrealistic, Beowulf defeating a monster Grendel (which has already killed hundreds of men) not using his sword but his own hands ?!? How naive and stupid is that? Besides I think I heard a story like this a hundred times before. Trust me, you don't want to waste your time, or your monwy on this book."
0,"Do not be deceived! This version of ""Beowulf"" should NOT be compared, at all, to the original text of ""Beowulf"". Students should not be taught that THIS story, as re-created by Robert Nye, is reflective of the ""Beowulf"" written about 1000 AD. The story developed and shared for hundreds of years is characterized by Christian concepts and ideals. This version, written by Robert Nye, reflects our societies overwhelming desire to rewrite history, de-Christianizing it as they go along. Robert Nye has replaced the Christian God of the original ""Beowulf"" with the mythological Viking god ""Odin"". The original ""Beowulf"" tale supports the historical significance that Christian beliefs and ideas had on the overall society of England and throughout Europe. Robert Nye has done a great injustice in adjusting an historical document to reflect his own convictions, or lack thereof."
0,"Why not finally release MODERNAIRE on CD? I really wanted to like this CD - and I even bought it at retail to support Dez - but...it's rather unlistenable. Flat. Unmemorable. Rote. Why not just finally release his amazing MODERNAIRE track from Purple Rain? After hearing that song back in '84, I waited patiently for the Dez solo CD...and waited and waited and waited...this ain't it."
0,"Ordered it and sent it right back I opened the box, took them out and immediately ran into problems: the attachment to the headset was way too tight and it was impossible to sit them all the way in. This is important because you want them to sit as close to your eyes as possible. After using considerable force, I was able to clip them halfway on....and then it stuck. I didn't even bother buying batteries before sending them back."
0,"too large I tested this product out on 3 different cats. I guess the aroma appealed to them because they tried to eat it, but not one of them was able to The pieces are just too large. I think they are too hard as well."
0,"Fall asleep at the Tertulia This novel was a huge disappointment. The idea--of mostly Latino women coming together to discuss the vicissitudes of life--is original, but the novel just sputters along. Part of the problem is that the dialogue is reduced to idle chatter and the narrator remains aloof and--do I dare say it--boring. The reader never gets a sense of how the advice of the Latino women influences her life in any deep way. The writing, also, is a disappointment: flat and uninspired."
0,"Huxley it ain't... I'm afraid that I must agree with the comments of 'Tedious' below. Apart from a wonderful idea for the theme of this novel (eastern religion meets western technology) their was not enough character or plot development to sustain my interest past the half-way mark. This book has been praised as an influence by some very great authors, but I must assume it was the theme and not the narrative itself that caught their fancy. The narative reads like a poor translation. Really bad style. A few funny moments... but overall, a very dissapointing book for me considering it's high falutin' reputation. I'll stick with Huxley, if and when I seek enlightenment."
0,"Through the Madness!!! First of all, Ike is doing the very thing that Tina always said he would do. Ike Turner will never admit to what he did to Tina. Tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like ""all the others."" Ike took advantage of her. Tina her self said she cared very much for him. Cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince Tina to leave him. Even the girls that danced with Tina on stage had whitnessed what happened.Tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career, she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on. So she released her autobiography in 1986, well after her come-back in 1984.While Ike can try to deny it all he wants, the truth is he violently abused Tina! And considering the person Ike Turner is, I would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back!!!"
0,"""Takin' Back My Name"" Hardly Ike In this sad excuse of a memoir Ike Turner tries and tries and tries to convince us that he is a good person. WRONG! Instead he comes off as a psychopathic obsessive fool who ruined the best thing in his life when he destroyed his relationship with the wonderful TINA. He also jumps back and forth with his opinion on TINA but hey who cares? We must remember that HE BEAT HER UP and like the old saying goes ""A leopard cannot change its spots"" or to quote Marlo Thomas on ""Friends"" ""once a cheater always a cheater"" Take that, Ike."
0,"Item is not as durable as it seems... After spending a significant amount of time trying to remove the U3 software that comes on this drive (I wanted to remove it because I don't use windows, and yet the removal software only works for windows) the connection between the actual USB plug and the body of the device gradually weakened (so that to get the device to read I had to wiggle it) until the it became useless. I would recommend Kingston over this, as I've never heard of any durability problems with those, and with these you risking getting a lemon."
0,"Buyers Beware After using this flash drive for multiple types of files I am very very disappointed. At first my only concern was that the USB felt sloppy. But now I can't get this thing to hold any information on my spreadsheets that I use on a daily basis. No matter what I do, I properly eject the device only when I get the message that it is safe. Then I will plug it in again and make sure my spreadsheet is there. Then eject the device again. But when I restart the computer and insert the cruzer my spreadsheets are all kaddywampus with just a portion of the information. It works fine for my word documents and photos, but not spreadsheets. I now purchased a kingston flash drive and pray it works better."
0,"Bummer - also burned I read a review of this book at woodworker's gazzette and it was really positive. So I ordered the book and it arrived last week.This book is cursury in its treatment of the topic and has no answers to any of the questions I was interested in. For example there is no discussion of stone tiles, heating systems for tiles, width of groutlines. This book is embarrasing. I have a book from Home-Depot on tiling that is superior to this one in simple answers to simple questions.My advice - avoid this book and look elsewhere for your info."
0,"Only useful as a backup to Snell and Weightman If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary, as ""Teach Yourself Hindi"" does. The authors of that title, R.Snell & S.Weightman, teach Hindi at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies.Further this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialogues.As a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of Snell/Weightmann. This is partly a product of having 10 lessons instead of 18.Recommendation : Get Snell & Weightmann, and then McGregor's Dictionary and Grammar. Use Bhatia if you need extra tape practice."
0,"It's not what you think This LOOKS like a less expensive version of the Spinbrush refill, but it is not. With this one, the bottom part does not move. Cheap junk! I don't know why they bother making it.Get the better one - it's worth it."
0,Wrong.. don't buy It's not the same as the one the brush comes with. The top spins but you loose the up down motion from the brushes under the spin part. cheap knock off I guess. spend more get the right one. :(
0,"Only half the head rotates I was thrilled to see what a bargain these replacement heads were compared to the store. I ended up throwing them out and going to the store. Don't waste your money.

0,Poor Disc Packaging Opened the First Season to play and 3 of the discs fell out of the packaging and were scratched. Trying to put the discs back is a real challenge. This is like no other disc packaging that I've ever seen. There is no center snap to put the disc in. You have to try to slide it into 4 plastic half circles(2 of which were broken in delivery) and 2 tabs at the bottom ( one which was broken in delivery). I am returning all seasons as it is not worth having packaging that is useless.
0,"Nothing More Than A Cheesy Summary For a Finance Professor at NYU this book should be an embarrassment. It is not only poorly written, but dispenses absolutely no advice. The book has no appeal at all, and is merely a summary of the existing wealth holders. I mean who cares how much Mike Tyson earnt in 1997. This is hardly aspirational stuff. If wealth creation is the topic that a reader is pursuing I would strongly recommend Peter Drucker (Innovation and Entrepreneurship), which will give the reader a clear insight into why Americans have expanded their wealth, without the rhetoric. Another great book would be by Lester Thurow (Creating Wealth) who explains how wealth is created. As far as this book is concerned, spend your money elsewhere."
0,"Waste of money I found this book on special for 5 Australian dollars so I picked it up. I didn't get around to reading it for a little while but I should have never bothered in the first place for a few reasons.The book is too focused on the american economy and had very little information which could be linked to Australia's economy.From the first page it presented itself as a very bland read, giving barely any encouraging information for anyone wanting to expand on their finances. I stopped reading after the second chapter as it just had no appeal to me.I do not recommend this book at all."
0,"Not accurate, needle gets stuck Maybe it's just the hot summer temperatures where we live (in Texas), but this thermometer turned out to be pretty useless - when the day got hot and the needle went up above 90 degrees, it would get stuck there and would not go down when the temperature went down. Plus when the thermometer arrived, it didn't tell the accurate temperature - the directions say you have to set it to the correct temperature by turning a screw at the back, which we did, but then after that it would get stuck as described above. Very disappointing product."
0,"Dont waste your $$$$$ on this. Could not get it to stick to the window. Would stick it to the window and it would fall off every 10 to 20 min. Even got it wet for better suction, lasted about an hour before it fell off. Gave up after that. Unknown if thermometer worked. Never got it to stick."
0,"inaccurate and useless Why have a thermometer if the thing doesn't reflect the correct temps? This one is a waste of money. Growing up, Timex was a great brand name. Now it's a joke. So sad.Don't buy the Timex ... go to Target and buy an inexpensive outdoor digital suction cup thermometer by Accurite, with big numbers. That way you can return it if it doesn't work to your satisfaction."
0,"Worst Ever This product is fantastic for those whose climate never varies by more than one degree. When I saw the name ""Timex"" I was somewhat apprehensive but said to myself, ""How can they mess up a thermometer?"". I don't know how they did it but they did, big time. Admittedly, for $5.99 I didn't expect a device approved by the National Weather Service but this product is overpriced by about $5.98. Rather than going through the hassle of returning it I joyously took a hammer to it and took out many inner frustrations. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy."
0,Pricing Backwards... used is more then new??? That just doesn't make since to me. The used price is $39.99 amd the new is $24.99I don't need it that bad.Was going to use it to teach my assistant.
0,"Boy, was I disappointed! I have to disagree with the reviewers who gave this book high marks. While Jim Richey is very knowledgeable, this book is a set of one-page clippings from various past magazines. The drawings are very basic, and there's not a single photograph to help the beginning to moderate woodworker. These tips are too basic for the advanced woodworker, so I really don't see an audience for this book. It didn't help me at all. There's nothing wrong with the book -- if you want to read about other people's woodworking. However, to help you build your router skills there are wiser ways to spend your money. Several are sold right here on Amazon."

0,"he lost it a long time ago I was never really a big Silkk the Shocker fan, but I had to apllaud him for his 2nd album Charge it 2 da Game. Unfortunately, after Made Man No Limit fell off. Silkk is quite simply a copycat. There is not a unique track on the album. The tracks seem to be copied from previous Cash Money albums. Silkk annoys me because sometimes he is trying to be a thug and on other occasions he is preaching nonviolence and doing boy-girl collabos. Which one is it Silkk?The only real rappers on No Lmit were C-Murder, Mac, and Soulja Slim. Unfortunately C-Murder and Mac are on lock down and Slim is no longer with No limit. You should hear Slim's new album Years later a few months after. He said that he saw Silkk in a victoria's secret catalogue! P should give it up. He can't survive without Mac and C-Murder."
0,"Save your money for your real ""dreams"" Ms. Browne seems to be well meaning when describing her experiences and her dreams and those of others. However, the books spends more time discussing Ms. Browne's views about herself rather than focusing on the more interesting information about dreams themselves.It is obvious from reading the book that Ms. Browne is a lay person and a ""spiritual guide"", not a scientist of any kind. I would venture to guess that most of the information she provides is based on her own opinions and conjecture rather than hard, sounds facts.I was very disappointed with this book, and only ""dream"" of getting my money back . . ."
0,"This game Pretty much sucks I was very disappointed with this game. I love the Resident Evil series, but this one sucked. Your AI partners are not very intelligent, they run around and don't listen to you when you need them. Normal mode is actually more like a ""hard"" mode. You can't really pause the game as it is live and the monsters come get you anyway, even when your in your inventory screen. The online option has been disabled so you can't play with other people anymore.It was just a hassle to control three people simultaneously, two of which never listen anyway.The only good thing is the scenery and surroundings. Also I liked how zombies could run after you if they wanted, instead of always dragging themselves around. Other than that, I really did not like this game."
0,"save your money save your money. go to the library and read it there. spend five minutes and you have the miter angles you need- out of the whole book that is all I took away.

0,"Strong??? Nope... this one just doesn't cut it This tool attracted me at first because of the concave shape of the jaws. My current cable cutter is a basic straight edge cutter, and it does the job well, but sometimes the cables slip out of the jaw since the blades are straight. So, with this curved jaw, I was pretty excited (as one can be for a hand tool).My tool arrived today and I decided to test the cable cutter out on a piece of shielded 1/8"" stranded wire. First attempt, EPIC FAIL!!! It cut through the plastic sheath and only one piece of the wire strand was actually cut through, the rest, just bent at the point of contact.What's worse? The blade on the bottom jaw got chipped. Very disappointed in this tool, when my generic wire/cable cutter can do the job at half the price. Tool looks well designed and strong, but the blade edge is way too thin and fragile. This tool is being sent back to Amazon..."

0,"save your $; buy better quality like the birdies sing...cheep cheep...yep they are cheapi got the izzue (sp) shirt and it was great...these blass ones, not so great...plus amazon plays the price game, they were 5 bucks, but then came a special promo, they raised the price to 7.50...to get you to buy more; using the promo code bringing the price back to 5 each, gamesmanship....gotta really watch amazon prices, always double check at other sites...like the contek sunglasses, amazon had them at 130 retail....heck the mfr only had them retail at 80...games"
0,"Poor Quality I bought this shirt for one reason, the price, and I soon as I open the box I found out why it was so cheap. Because of the cheap materials. Save your money, spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality."
0,"Don't be cheated I bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews. Dont mean to be rude, but people who gave these shirts probably haven't wore a decent dress shirt. You can frequently get 'good' $45 shirt for $10 in malls when on sale. I thought this was a better deal. But boy oh boy, I can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store. I had ordered these as a gift, but now will give them to Red Cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion, or even for daily use (except maybe when you are working at Septic tanks or something). These are from Bangladesh, and I can assure you, they are not much better than what would be sold for $0.50 in BGD. If you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere, DO NOT BUY THESE SHIRTS."
0,"Not a bargain anymore The negatives were as reviewed: thin, square cut, and ugly packaging. At $7.50 they were acceptable for the cheap price. At $9.99, they are no bargain!"
0,This Sucks I waited all week for this over priced shirt. I only bought it because I couldn't find another button down shirt in eggplant and I needed the color for an event this week. The shirt arrived and they sent me the wrong style shirt. Its a polo shirt. Doesn't even look like the picture. Now I'm screwed for the event this week. Hella Lame.
0,"Pathetic video, makes you blind I don't understand why the editors needed to cut the best songs from the show. I also don't understand why the felt the need to change the camera angle EVERY FIVE SECONDS. This makes for a decent cd, watching the video is hazardous to your brain. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL."
0,"OMG I am having terrible Iron Maiden flashbacks Just when I thought it could get any worse than Iron Maiden's Rock in Rio or Dance of Death tour dvds, the Scorpions appeared to have hired the same camera, film and editing crew of those aforementioned releases. A great performance no doubt but the editing makes this unwatchable. Just an overpriced dvd to play when the tube is turned off."
0,"Scorpions Live at Wacken open air 2006 Be careful. Had to return. Did not play on my DVD player or computer. The back cover said NTSC Region 0. However, the DVD said PAL Region 9. I could see the picture, but there was no sound. Wait for the US version!!"
0,great book / lousy ebook downloaded the book and immediately started to suffer from kindle freeze. it completely locked up my kindle. took a lot of effort to get back in but as soon as i deleted the book kindle performance was back to normal. other reviews dont metion this problem so im mystified.
0,3 men who are in a sub and tour the world. This book was VERY BAD. I HATED it. It is a big book with lots of words. Take my advice and STAY AWAY. I would give this book 0 stars but the minimum they let is 1.
0,A clas-sick that made me sick This book was very boring. very few moments in the book are actually exciting and they are few and far between. The beginning of the book is the best part. It spent too much time explaining and describing images; i felt like the whole book could be cut in half and you would still get the majority of the story across to the readers
0,Never received I never received this item. The seller sent this item to my shipping address at my billing address. 2 different addresses as we do not receive mail at our house.
0,"It was so boring. Do not buy this book. It is a waste of your money. If you buy this book ,it will sit somewhere and never go to use ,even if you just read the first 2 pages you will be disgusted."
0,"An Obsolete Translation This paperback, one of the Barnes and Noble ""Classics Editions"" is a republication of the original English translation by Rev. Lewis Page Mercier made in 1872. Mercier's translation leaves out 20% of the book and makes numerous other textual errors. These facts have been known for fifty years. The editor is a Victoria Blake, not otherwise identified, who in fact recommends in the Appendix that for further reading one might consult the complete novel as translated by Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter and published by the Naval Institute Press in 1993."
0,Horrible narration The narrator should have a European (french) accent. Instead he has a gravely American accent. It just does not fit the story at all. I was not happy with this purchase.
0,"I know this is classic literacy and what not, but I wiill never read this book again. This book would only be good for a marine biologist or a latin translator because they are the only people who can translate it. The book might say something like, ""The Nautilus was attacked by a group of spodulini auarius."" You then are confused. A few chapters later, it might say how the Nautilus was attacked by some giant squid. Then everything clicks. The story was long and winding, and seemed like it would never end. I couldn't finish the book as it had begun them to seem torturous. Don't read it."
0,"Major Disappointment I've always loved Brian McKnight's music. From ""Back at One"" to ""Still the One"" to ""One Last Cry"" and ""Anytime""... loved em all. If you're hoping for anything remotely like those, you'll wish you hadn't spent the money. It's such a shame that I have to not recommend this album, but it just doesn't shine. I sense that he feels like he needs to get back to ""his roots"" by going more soulful, more slow hip-hoppy. And while he succeeds on those points, it's just not gonna produce a top 10 single on regular top 40 radio. It sorta reminds me of later efforts from Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston where they stopped delivering the kinds of music their fans wanted and instead did their own thing. What a shame, and what a letdown."
0,"Best used for target practice Horrible horrible horrible! I get booted from it every few minutes and then I get ""No response from wireless router or access point"" And it takes me an hour to get back on, just to be on for 5 minutes, then I have to start all over again. I can get 2 bars or signal from it while my laptop is sitting right beside it, yet my neighbors router is shown at full signal so I know it isn't my computer. This is so bad, I'd rather go back to dial up!"
0,"AT&T DSL users stay away It did not pick up the DSL signal from my AT&T High-speed Internet service. I had to return it and get a 2Wire, which AT&T officially supports and which works without any problems."
0,"Internet connection turns off all the time After a certain time the modem begins to loose the conection to Internet every now and then, the only solution is to constantly turn it on and off.No lightning have fallen near my house, nor any other extraordinary event have happened.I have looked for help from zoom, internet forums and my ISP company and all of them agreed that it is a hardware problem, apparently a common one if you buy an X6 zoom modem/router.The only definite solution: buy a new modem (not a zoom modem)"
0,"It may be a good product, but Verizon made it junk I bought this unit to replace a unit sold to me by the phone company. It was to be ""combatable"" to DSL Verizon. Not so said the phone company. You have to by from us, they said. I battled this unit for a month. It changed my IP so many times and would lock up. Customer service from Zoom was as bad as Verizon. One would say, ""Its the phone company's problem"", then the phone company would say, ""Its the modem company's problem"". I was given a modem from a friend that had a wireless modem from a different phone system. It works great. Buyer beware. It does not work as advertised."
0,"I'm looking for a different router I'm using a Mac and a PC with this product. From the start, I could not get it to set-up like the directions instructed. I had to bring it to my local Res-Net office on campus for them to set-up. The big complaint I have with this router is the connection with the computer needs to be reset nearly every day for me, sometimes three times a day (PC and Mac). Depending on how heavy my internet usage is."
0,"Not worth the money I've had this item for 3 months, the support people don't know how to handle wireless connections, they keep referring you to the manual... and give you no directions... The unit itself isn't compatible with verzion.. this unit continously goes off the net, and must the software must be reloaded, or Verizon called to reset the signal to your home.."
0,"Vastly Overated When I began to read this book, I was expecting a superbly written historical account of the Saturday Night Live television show, and instead got nothing more than a plethora of transcribed interviews with people associated with the show.When I began reading this book, I was hoping the authors would include a listing of all of the people who have graced the show as regular performers, or one of all of the guest hosts, but none such information was offered.Apparently all it takes to write a best-selling book nowadays is a tape recorder, and a word processor, because that is all this book is comprised of.A court stenographer could have written it."
0,"Outrageous As many others have said, the unnecessary deviations from the book were just horrible. Why not just make up a new story about Narnia that Lewis never told before ?The character relationship development was horrible."
0,"Infuriatingly Inaccurate! 10 Thumbs Down *** Infuriatingly Inaccurate! *** Die Hard Narian Fans take heed to my advice and don't even waste your time on this movie. For example Disney thought that it was ok to allow Prince Caspian to KISS Queen Susan ( Attention Disney: That NEVER happened in the book! ). There are a number of other inaccurate happenings in this movie, but I will not waste your time to list them all ... This movie is in my own Top TEN most hated movies of all time. I REFUSE to buy this version. I will not waste my money on it!!!"
0,"So disappointed When The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe came out I didn't want to see it. I practically learned to read on the books, and they have remained favorite annual re-reads. As it turned out, I had no choice but to see it, through my work, and I was amazingly and pleasantly surprised.So I decided to see Prince Caspian too. Again I was surprised, but this time I was surprised by my disappointment. Did not follow the storyline at all. A lot of noise and violence, that was my main impression."
0,"terrible movie This movie is absaloutley awful, the acting was so bad, it made me cringe in my seat. This is one example where they should have completely recasted. It was also upsetting when it decided that it wanted to be ""Lord of the Rings"" with all the screenshots and battles. I love the books, the Chronicles of Narnia are one of my favorite series, and the previous adaptation of ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" I loved, but this strayed much too far from the book. The reason the four children slipped by with no acting ability in the first one was because their roles were not so serious. I mean, here they are killing other human beings without even flinching! Susan just whips out her bow and shoots trained soldiers off their horses with the nonchalance of getting out of bed! I tend to be very hard on movies. If you can sit through terrible unconvincing acting that makes Vin Diesels ""Fast and the Furious"" look like ""There Will be Blood"", than it's a mildly enjoyable time at the cinema."
0,"terribly disapointed I greatly enjoyed this book, but found almost no similarities between it and this movie. The plot was completely wrong. Prince Caspian is described as a child in the book. His uncle speaks to him as though he were a small child, certainly not a young man. Aslan is very minor in the movie, which takes all the power right out of it. All the battle scenes are ridiculous. They changed almost everything important. The only thing they were on target with is they capture the essence of reepacheep perfectly, but other than that this movie is a huge waste of time, if you love c.s. lewis. Maybe you would like it if you never read the book. But honestly the book is much more interesting"
0,"What a Disappointment I grew up on the Narnia Books and thought The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was well adapted to the big screen. However, Prince Caspian seemed to try to add all of the adventures of current box office hits rather than going with the strength of the story. Everything seemed too over the top: the battlescenes, the attempt at a love line between Caspian and Susan, the lack of quality character improvement. Urf. The scenery and cinematography don't make up for the lack of substance. If they can't pull it together for Dawn Treader, this will be a movie series to miss..."
0,"Almost All Fighting, Next to No Interesting Dialogue This movie is essentially a 2-hour fight scene with about 20 minutes of half-interesting dialogue and story sprinkled in. Terribly violent and uninteresting. Honestly the most fighting I have ever seen in any movie (including Matrix Reloaded). I wholly regret the $1.99 I spent to rent it. Unless you want to see endless stabbings and blunt force traumas, do not see this movie."
0,Soylent Dick says: Utter Trash The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe was bad enough. But THIS effort was so bad as to be beneath commenting on. The other negative reviews have said it all for me.
0,"A Child's Book of Saints????????????? When I ordered this book, I was hoping to get a book for my daughter that would teach her about the Catholic saints. I think this book is better read under the influence of hallucinogenics or in a state of temporary insanity. I don't know where the author is coming from. Take this review however you want. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."

0,"So very sad When publishers abridge classics such as The Wind in the Willows they must be very respectful. And they should not make their own determinations of what a child can and cannot absorb or enjoy. It is very sad that they cut ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" from this edition. Children can and will get something valuable from such contemplatve texts, but only if we allow them access!"
0,"One of the worst mountaineering books I have ever read. Factually shaky at many points, pedestrian prose, self-aggrandizing and a page turner only for wanting to finish the awful thing. What I found most offensive about this book was the author's egotistical disdain for the, ""lesser climbers"", of the team. In fact she and her fellow leaders showed nothing but hostility to many members and they all come off as smug, arrogant jerks. Having been on climbing expeditions before, there is a great deal of stress, raw feelings, etc, but the raw and condescending behavior of the author and trip leaders is disgusting. Don't even get started on their ugly American ""analysis"" of Asians on Denali.Read this book if you one day want to write a mountaineering book and this one will point to every flaw in doing so."
0,"Good bird cage lining I give this book one star because it made nice lining for my bird cage. Others have described, more eloquently than I can, why this is not a good book to read. I found the author mean, pompous and racist. As a climber of many years I can honestly say I would never tie into a rope with her."
0,"Don't Try This at Home, Kids... This book would be a joke if it were not dangerous. There's nothing wrong with being guided on a mountain...in fact, it may be a comparatively safe way to enjoy an outdoor experience (and it keeps many climbers employed. There's also nothing wrong with writing about the experience of being guided...David Roberts, Jon Krakauer, and others have done that entertainingly and tastefully. But to title it ""the extreme...true courage...death-defying survival...a quest"" shows serious signs of self-delusion. I am most concerned that some innocent will pick this book up, enjoy it, and do something really stupid.Hint: If you liked this book...if you really found it exciting...stay home!(1 star, in honor of the book's value as kindling, and because there is no lower rating.)"
0,"Far too fundamentalist, with not enough Sun Tzu I chose this book out of sheer desperation when I was looking for a good investment book on Holidays.This book is so far slanted toward a fundamentalist approach that I believe the author thinks Graham and Buffett are gods. It reads very poorly and the author could have imparted his message in less than a few pages.The author also denigrades all technical analysis with a few choice statistics that do not hold water very well.In my view this is a big let down, and I wish I could get my time and money back."
0,don't bother I was given this book as a gift and as a redhead myself I was excited to read it. All I can say is that I am glad I did not pay good money for it. The writing is so bad and pointless and does nothing to prove a point or even tell a story. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK!
0,"agree Agree with NY red, skip it. Half the book is personal ""Deep Thoughts"" and the other half stuff about red hair you could already read on the web for free."
0,Don't bother I was excited to receive this book. I am a red head and have an infant son with red hair too. This book was very boring. I hung in there hoping it would get better but soon found myself skipping pages. It did not hold my interest and didn't seem to make much sense. I have a red headed girlfriend that I was going to pass it on to but after reading it I have changed my mind. The cover is attractive so therefore it makes a good coffee table book.
0,"never received this item This order was part of a major scam. I never received it and the ""seller"" emailed me to send him cash to a particular account so that he could ship the item. I blew up his email and contacted amazon to wipe the order. No money exchanged. Surprised this item showed up (6 years later) as an item I had purchased. Learned to be careful of the too good to be true offers on Amazon."
0,"DO NOT BUY I bought this product because of the stellar reviews, but this product turned out to be TERRIBLE. When you apply this product to your face, it doesn't absorb into your skin...it just sits there and leaves you with a white mask. And who would go out in public wearing a white mask on their face?!?!?! For some reason no one mentioned that on here, but if you go to other websites (drugstore,com- I can't use a period because they might remove the link) and read this products reviews you will see what I'm talking about. Trust me when I say do not waste your money on this product; Neutrogena's Ultrasheer sunblock is the best sunblock for your face out there."
0,"This is a joke, right? The book is so painfully simplistic, it looks as though it was made in one sitting. How could we possibly insult our children by making them think they're THIS ignorant?One child was swift to point out, ""Does Larry have a last name, too? Or is he sharing the last name of Lilly? As in 'Harry and Lily Potter' do?And I had no choice but to confirm that yes, there is indeed a reason why these books are so.. uh... disturbing. They're related. And happily dating.Btw, the first book, ""Larry Potter and his best friend Lilly..."" you can clearly see in the book cover that Lilly, for a best friend, is a little too snug on the ""personal space"" touching. Even Ron wouldn't be caught in that pose with Harry and they're REAL best friends! So does that cover count as a spoiler? Cause for some strange reason ""More than just friends"" was more of a joke than a surprise. .Glad it was borrowed and not bought.And grats on little Kathrine smart enough to figure out the mystery behind the nonsense! <3"
0,"A sad waste of time. My cousin bought this book to read to his young sons. I decided to read it first before he did.At first I thought it was going to be all right. But as I started to read the story. I found that it was flat and not moving like you would have thought. Plus the title itself states sexual possiblities between Lilly and Larry Potter.Now don't get me wrong here, More than just friends is a term that most older adults would use for their 'sexual partners' who are not married to them. If I told my friend that I'm more than just friends with so and so person, the first thing that comes to their mind is oh she's having sex with him.I didn't read past the first three pages which is more than I did with the other books, I returned the book to my cousin and told him return it for a refund or an exchange of another book that is worth your time to read to your sons.Don't waste your money on this book it's not worth it."
0,not worth any money you may not take me seriously because i am a teenager but i am a big fan of the harry potter books. larry potter pails in comparison to harry potter and basically any other book it also uses similar termonoilgy and is a copycat that is why i even brought up harry potterso dont waste your time reading this book life isnt long enough
0,WHAT KIND OF HUMAN WOULD ENJOY THIS BOOK? This book was a monumentous waste of anyones time. It could've been possibly the worst book i've ever read. This book is supposed to be for kids? The kids themselves could of written a better story than this piece of junk! Take my advice- save a tree and ditch this terrible book!

0,not very good.. i could only read an hour of this poor paraphrase. ive read many paraphrases and this is one of the worst.
0,Not translated very well for Kindle I am in no way knocking the author's writing. Whoever transfered this book did not do a good job. The story is disjointed and when turning the page does not match up with what was just read. From what I can make of this story it was good andnot a long read. Of course i have no idea how much is missing.
0,"Very disappointed This was an adorable bird feeder that was supposed to deter squirels, but it didn't sending the feeder crashing to the ground."

0,"Disappointing, not helpful for traders at all A few years ago I redHow To Make Money In Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or Bad, 3rd Editionwhich was one of the best books on investing in stocks I've ever red. The author of that book mentionned he had over 2,000 books in his investment library with only a few very good books. He gave a list of 10 books he found best, which I've all red. Most of them were very good books (certainly for someone like me with some 150 books on investing). Books likeHow I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock MarketorReminiscences of a Stock Operator (Wiley Investment Classics)were all superb books. This was one of only books I had not red from the list. So I ordered it and began reading it with high expectations. As you can see in my rating, I did not like it all. To be honest I find the whole book one mess. I cannot even imagine how anyone could get anything useful for his/her trading out this book. I don't have a clew why O'Neill liked this one so much."
0,"No 2.2mm Hex Nut Driver I should have read the reviews; especially the one from Gary E. Landrum ""3rd Camaro"". There is no hex driver. The nut driver tip is not reversible as it would appear to be from the description and the picture. This is my first one star on anything but the tool is useless to me (I needed the 2.2 mm hex nut driver) and it is being misrepresented."
0,"Still looking for a hex nut tightener. It must be me! This is the second purchase of mine to find something to tighten the hex nut on my reading glasses.

I won't try a third time....I'll use the tweezers."

This video is missing one of the funniest SNL sketches of the episode, ""Monex"" the fact that NBC Universal has deleted content from this episode should be CLEARLY marked so you know what you're getting.

THEY'RE JUST TOO SHORT."
0,"Informative of media tactics, but not statistically accurate It's a cute book, although utterly misleading. The Atlantic wrote: ""A pleasantly subversive little book, guaranteed to undermine your faith in the almighty statistic.""The fact of the matter is that when proper, statistically sound data gathering and analysis methods are employed, the statistics not only do not lie, but they also reveal the nature and extent of the errors inherent in the results.I know - among other things, I'm a professsional statistician.In fact, it was my profession in statistics that steered me into network analysis, which is a statistician's dream world. Large corporations must figure out where the bottlenecks reside, and how to combat them in the most cost-effective, time-valued, long-term manner.To do this properly, it takes an individual who knows Finance, Statistics, and Networks.Bottom lie: Statistics themselves don't lie. However, the improper use of statistics can lead to erroneous conclusions."
0,"A Magazine for Kids Not For Professionals Purchased a digital subscription and regret it. A magazine for kids who like to look at pretty pictures. Unfortunately 95 percent fluff. Very little solid info. Lacking instructive content, but often has pretty photos of cars and of pretty girls, if that is what you like. Mostly advertising, I wouldn't wast the money on it again."
0,"I just didn't get it... A friend gave me this book as a gift because she had found it to be ""hilarious.""Huh?I have to admit that the only reason I finished this book was that I was trying desparately to find something, anything, funny in it. Unfortunately, the story was ponderous, depressing, and egregiously pretentious from beginning to end."
0,Easy Slumber It is on a very rare occasion that I fail to finish a book.I feel compelled to say that this was one of them. After 100 pages I decided I could take no more. This book started me off on the wrong foot. The introduction produced a large number of characters all at once which were impossible to assimilate. The author failed to capture an audience with such boring characters and much of the narration was in rambling form.
0,rip off I was mislead! This was marketed as the old style can. You even said people that bought this bought the old style pour spouts! THE OLD STYLE POUR SPOUTS DO NOT WORK WITH THE CAN. IT HAS THE SAFETY SPILL PROOF SPOUT AND IS ABSOLUTLY NO GOOD TO POUR GAS INTO AN OLD SYLE VEHICLE. IW WAS DELIBERTLY MISLED. This was a totla rip off.
0,"Mis-leading packaging Curly, perhaps the most popular and most imatated stooge is on the cover, on the back and in all the pictures that come with this slick looking boxed set.But he is in only one of the three short films. (Also, there are hardly any short films that come with this. The other filler is cartoons, a movie without Curly and interviews and other junk.)This is not a good collection for fans of Curly. It is however good at misleading the 3 Stooges fan into thinking that he or she has found a gold mine of 3 Stooges material at a great price. Sadly, that is not to be.Instead of wasting your time and money on this blatent rip-off, you would be better off at building your 3 Stooges library on other collections that don't contain the words ""75th Anniversary Collection."""
0,"Garbage Others have said most of the things I was going to say. This set is trash. Specifically, the documentary was sort of interesting for tidbits of information I wasn't aware of but was produced horribly. The mic on the narrator was pushed right up to his mouth causing too much proximity effect and you can hear the plosives clipping on the VO track. I'm in audio and this is basic, audio recording 101 stuff, folks. Even the stuff I thought was mildly fun was not worth putting up with the hours of utter dreck to experience. I didn't even bother watching everything. This is a great white elephant gift exchange candidate if you're stuck with it because it looks like it would be great. But it isn't. Stay away."
0,"We are the Stooges! The packaging is so deceiving! I had to have this set. Glad i only paid 10 bucks with ship. i'll be very happy to sell it, break even and get somebody else peeved off at me for selling them JUNK!Usually I read comments/reviews section. this time i failed to do so and i got burned. Caveat emptor! boys and girls. Read the reviews before you buy."
0,A complete misrepresentation of the classic trio The packaging is beautiful. Any fan of the Three Stooges would love it except for the fact that the majority of this material on this DVD set isn't the classic Three Stooges we grew up to love. It is VERY MISLEADING.Anyone defending the integrity of this release should be considered an employee of Madacy Entertainment.
0,"Misleading You get what you pay for with this set. Only contains maybe an hour of classic stooge fun. It may fill the gap in someones collection, but mostly contains fillers and short dvds. It appears to be a collection of videos that no one else wanted. One full DVD is the lame three stooges cartoons. If you are looking for classic stooge comedy this set contains very little."
0,3 Stooges Collectors Edition This thing is horrible do not buy it. Only one episode with Curly all else is terrible. Old clips and movies not funny at all Do no but this you will be very disapointeed as I was.
0,"Save your money Should have read the box before I purchased. Lots of early stooges, cartoons, and Curly Joe Stooges...not the shorts we all know and love. Should have known better...the price was too good! Looks like it's $100 bucks for the stuff I really wanted!"
0,"Not what I expected - a rip off The price was attractive, as was the packaging. The box shows Curly. But alas - Curly is not easily found in this compilation. Also - a lot of the ""extra features"" are lame. Stay away from this product. If you really want the Three Stooges - buy the 8 volume compilation from Sony instead."
0,"3 stooges 75th anniversary dvd set It came damaged, I sent it back to be delivered in 2 to 3 days and still have not received a replacement. The last time I emailed him, he said he did not get it back and that was after 11 days. I think it was damaged before he even sent it and thought I would keep it because of Christmas, now he is just ignoring me. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! I would like my money back plus what I paid for shipping twice."
0,"Total rip off The Three stooges( Collectors Edition)The box says ""7DVDs over 11 hours"" what they dont say is that there are only 4 classic stooges shorts and only on the first DVD. The rest of the set is crap. The reamaining 6 1/2 dvds /10 hours are patched together bad movies and cartoons ( remember the really bad stooges cartoons you wouldnt even watch back in the 60's) It is intentionaly misrepresented. The packaging is first class, a real eyegrabber, but whats inside is junk."
0,Waste of money This is a complete waste of money for any real Stooges fan. You do get three DVDs. One is cartoon stooges. One is Laurel and Hardy. Only one is 3 Stooges -1 Curly episode and 2 Shemp episodes. My husband is a huge Stooges fan and couldn't watch anything except the Curly episode. I don't feel it was properly advertised on the box.
0,"Disappointed by a long shot I was quite unhappy to know that this wasn't a ""Collection"" of shows, but more of a ""The making of"" series. There were only a few episodes on it, and the rest of it was a disappointment by a long shot! If you are looking for watching actual Three Stooges, DON'T BUY THIS!"
0,"Don't get this radio. I own and use the best radios on the market. I have and use the Tivoli Model One, Tivoli PAL, and Boston Acoustics Recepter among others, and all the ones I just listed sound much better than the Bose Wave Radio, PLUS they are much cheaper too!There is also one called a Cambridge model 88 that is better than the Bose Wave Radio as well.When you are comparing these radios side by side, the first one you turn off and throw aside is the Bose Wave Radio, it is that bad when compared to the rest.If you want a good sounding table radio, I would suggest the Tivoli Model One instead. If you want a good clock radio for the nightstand, then I would suggest the Boston Recepter. Both are available through Amazon.comI don't work for any of these companies, but I have bought all of the radios exept for the Bose Wave Radio, I borrowed one for a day and had no interest in buying one. Even if it was cheaper, and smaller, but it sounded the same as it does now, I still would not buy it."
0,"we must feel bad that this was our Poet Laureate Pinsky is in love with being a poet, but his poems don't mean anything to the rest of us. This book is a perfect example of this. We are supposed to admire him, not read him, and I find it a shame that this lousy work got him a Luareateship."
0,"Brand new, out of the box and it doesn't work. Just purchased this little gem and went to insert the cassette. The instructions say ""The cassette compartment will automatically lift up and open when opening the lid."" It Doesn't. For $1,359, I'm back to Circuit City for a new one. If I have problems once more . . . then I'll try another brand."
0,"BEWARE False advertisement This is a Graber guadian 3 ike rack, NOT a Saris guadian 3. I purchased it and it looks very simular, but has no anti-sways and the straps are a hard cheap plastic. I called the company and they said all they could do was have me send it back and get my money back. I informed them that the pictures on the advertisements were not of the one they sent me and they just said if I was unhappy with my purchase, I could return it. This was a week ago, and as I see they still advertise the Saris with anti-sways and rubber hold down straps. BEWARE of this company!!!!"
0,ARGGGGGG!!!!!!! This is generic half less than ok - half horrible - completely unforgetable - generic drudge - please get back with Survivor and make something someone in America would like? or are you happy playing to tiny crowds in Europe - comeon....lets get back together for some good music - not this sore missing any punch run of the mill yuk - Survivor could have rocked the sh.. out of the Real One - which is now being endless played on radio...
0,boring This movie was really boring. It was slow and uninteresting. the man who did this movie is the one trying to bring back the Zatoichi series. I have not seen the new Zatoichi movie yet but this movie gives me great doubts about how good it will be. His other movies may be good but this one is a definite time waster. Save yourselves.
0,"Disappointing I was hoping to get a step-by-step DVD on how to create a square foot garden. This was not that DVD. This DVD was really disappointing. I really need the help in getting my garden going, but this DVD didn't help.- No information on how to create your raised beds (which type of wood to use and why? How high should they be and why?)- No information on how to create Mel's mix (I'm not sure what she used for her soil, she never said)- No information on where to put the raised beds in your yard (Should you look for a shaded area? Lots of sun? Which plants for what type of shade)- No information on when and how often to water- Very little information on when to harvest- Very little information on how to take care of your plants in case of insects or diseases.This DVD was mainly about the plants the author chose to plant, spending about 15 minutes on the various varieties of tomato plants.The only good part of this DVD was the interview with Mel."
0,"even the stray cat outside wasn't interested! Since my cats have always loved Cosmic Catnip, I figured they might also enjoy the treats. What a disappointment! Neither cat even nibbled, and when I left some outside for the neighborhood stray, he even passed! Save your money and just buy grocery store treats."
0,Entertaining What an entertaining read...complete fiction I must add but a good book to remind you that there are still narrow minded people in the world who profess to know so much about a religon that they actualyy know very little about. This book makes a great lining for the kittie's litter box...wonderful absorbency!!!
0,"The choice is yours, so save some money. If you do let the missionaries in and listen, you'll learn about ""free agency"", i.e. the option to think and decide for yourself. Buying this book is the first step to giving up that priviledge."
0,"Horribly Disappointed! Don't get me wrong, ""Harriet the Spy,"" was one of my all time favorite books (and movies), growing up. I'm almost 26 now and had always wanted to read ""The Long Secret,"" So after re-reading Harriet, I went to the bookstore and ordered myself a copy. Well, at first it wasn't so bad, but there really wasn't any real point to the story. Harriet hadn't matured much at all, and to make matters worse, really offensive and hostile notes were left all over the place. I am also a Christian and find it offensive that the phrase ""Jesus Hates You,"" should be allowed to be published in a Children's book. This is especially true in this day and age, when almost any threat has the potential to turn violent.Skip this one."
0,"This student failed to enjoy it A previous reviewer said that as a teacher he's found that students never fail to enjoy William Golding's THE INHERITORS. When this reviewer was a sophomore English student, I can assure him that I failed to enjoy this book. My teacher thought this book was one of the all-time literary greats. I just thought it was boring.And now I have an even bigger reason to dislike this book. I happen to hate reading screeds that trash the author's own ancestors. I'm sure homo sapiens were not perfect, but please show me a race or culture of people who are.My plea to high school English teachers everywhere: If you must require your students to read Golding, have them read LORD OF THE FLIES. It's marginally better than THE INHERITORS and, if I remember correctly, does not include ancestor bashing."
0,"Whatever you do, don't buy this book Unfortunately, I have been forced to read this novel for my English class. It is extremely difficult due to the fact that the main characters haven't mastered a little thing we like to call language yet. Because Golding refuses to help the reader along with proper narration, the outcome is nothing short of a migrane. Just wanted to give all of you presently sane people out there a little warning before throwing all of that sanity away attempting to decipher meaning in this book."
0,"Strange fit, sent it right back I bought this item, along with the Squeem Miracle vest. I tried putting this on and it was so odd, I can't imagine anyone actually wearing it. I am 5'4"" and weigh 128. I usually wear a size 6. I ordered the medium size. I put it on and the abdominal area was really tight. However, the crotch area gapped really badly and when I fastened the thighs, they hung loosely. Now, I have saddle bags and my thighs are one of my biggest problem areas. But this was actually way too big to do anything for my thighs, compounded by the gapping crotch. I had great luck with the miracle vest and will be writing a review on that item."
0,"YUCK! I returned this product. The legs were too big and the waist too small. I looked like I was in a strait jacket. I have the high back waist cincher and am pleased with it, other than the rubber smell I can't elimate, but this product sucks!"
0,Hogwash There is not much to be said about this book except that it is total hogwash. Not even the author can pull all of his undocumented assumption together into a sensible hypothesis.
0,"Weak I detested this book. I felt the actual story never quite matched up with its admittedly interesting premise. The character of Patty Bergen seemed feeble and weakly developed, and I never understood the inexplicable hatred the entire world, excluding Anton and Ruth, seemed to have for this girl.The whole ""love story"" plot was laughably unrealistic, due mainly to the age difference. The most frustrating thing about this book is that it could have been so much better. The whole irony of a Nazi and a Jew falling in love during World War II has so many options for a good plotline, but instead the story seemed to spend a good majority of the book wallowing in self-pity."
0,"Crud Boring. Pointless details. Unbelievable. If I were a young girl aroung the time of the Haulacust, I would not help a German. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
0,"Very poor resolution As the book progresses, the storyline builds until, at the end, it goes straight down. There was absolutely no resolution. In short, it was the worst book I ever read. (And I read a lot)"
0,"The Worst Book I Ever Read This is the sappiest, most poorly written, manipulative crap I've ever read. It somehow redefines the laws of mediocrity. The story is cliched and contrived. The characters are like cardboard. The love story is perverted and it celbrates a young girl's ignorance. This is a bonafide chick book. If you are a guy click the back button on your browser and walk away. If not well maybe you might like it but that still doesn't make it good."
0,"Exciting War Story? (You wish!) Summer of My German Soldier is an average book. It is kind of romantic so I didn't like it that much. But that's just me. When my reading teacher first introduced this book, I thought it would be the best war book I had ever read. (This is because I am a huge war buff.) Before I even started reading, I was imagining an action-filled, danger at ever turn, war book. I was soooooo wrong! After reading the first few pages, I immediately became bored. I just hope that the sequel, Morning is a Long Time Comming, is better."
0,"washout This was given to me as a gift so I am not ungrateful . However the 600 mm waterproofing it states is not even a minimum allowance for being water repellent . I would not chance this thing in a light sprinkle and the bottom stitching is so loose you can see daylight between some parts. There is no logic in spending time seam sealing this tent ... the seams would be the only thing keeping the water out, the rest would come right through the fabric walls itself.This is kind of an expensive tent ... you wouldn't have to look too far to find a smarter option . If it does not have at least a 1000 mm rating then you will get wet ...and that is a fact . I cannot even image what this thing would do in the wind ... the thin poles are worse than the usual ones they put on the cheapest tents.You have my sympathy if you pay over 30.00 dollars for this tent ."
0,"BEWARE!! I need to preface this review by saying that I never received myZojirushi NS-ZCC18 from Amazon. Twice they sent me the oldermodel, the NS-ZAC18 instead. All the while their website claimsthat they have plenty of inventory, and that it ships within24 hours. Repeated calls to Amazon get plenty of sympatheticresponses, but no action. THE BOTTOM LINE: Amazon advertisesproducts that it does not actually carry.This seems to be a common theme with Amazon recently, somethingtantamount to a bait-and-switch. It also occurred when I orderedthe ""Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook"" and had to wait a week for itto ship, even though they claim it was in stock. I finallyreceived an e-mail that there was an unspecified ""problem""with the order. I called Amazon and was told that they had justreceived a couple copies and one would be mine -- remember, thewhole time before this their site claimed ""In Stock, ships in 24hours"".Not good business practice."
0,"Broken on Delivery Took it out of the box. Read instructions. Added rice and water. Plugged it in. Greeted with a ""U01"" staring at me from the display.Manual says ""breakdown"" Called customer service. Authorized dealers listed on a separate card. No dealers for Nevada (and many other states). Instructions say unit must be packaged (certain way) and postage paid befor sending it in for repair.I'll use my $10 pan for future rice cooks, and toss this $200 piece of junk in the trash bin. For this kind of price, they should drive to my home in a limo. I was very stupid to spend that kind of money on this rice cooker...don't you be."
0,"Congreve Has No Clothes Most great literary narratives, whether fiction or drama, boast simple plots and complex characters. This play turns that approach on its head. Here, we have a hopelessly and needlessly convoluted plot with the most superficial characters imaginable. Great drama? There is no drama. Great comedy? It's not funny. In short, it's garbage. Perhaps this kind writing was impressive in its day, but those days have long long passed us by. Why can't readers just admit that some so-called classics don't deserve the name? In reading the positive comments here, one can't help suspecting that the reviewers have been cowed by the play's reputation. It's a very rare reader who would find Way of the World anything but tedious, confusing, frustrating, unfunny, and overrated. People, let go of your pretensions and just say it! Sheesh...!"
0,seachoice stainless rod holder I ordered it from amazon and it came quickly but when i opened the package it looked nothing like the picture in amazon. Then when i used it the plastic at the bottom broke out and it riped the foam on my brand new penn rod. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Save your money.
0,not worth it I bought this tape in hopes of helping me out in school more.When watching this tape the camera position was bad on one side.The lady in the video was repeating everything again and a again.I didnt learn anything out of this video i think it was a waste of money.
0,Poor Design I would not buy this product or reccomend it. It is designed poorly and the different attachements don't stay on the charger. Disapointed withmoney spent
0,"Worse customer service ever Interesting..., Bought a Bones 2, 2 years ago.., had issues with one of the arms; called to ask for the ""so called"" lifetime warranty..; the guy on the phone spent more time convincing me that the issue was MY FAULT instead of attending my request. Just bought a Thule Gateway 9007! exc!!!"
0,"Destroyed the Paint on my Spoiler Fin I followed the instructions to the letter, mounted the rack, put the bike on it, motored around, used the bike, put it back on, got home, took the bike off and discovered the coarse fabric and hardware rubbed the paint off my spoiler fin in two places. There were scratches where the hooks go in to the side of the trunk. The only way I could get the sides taut was to have the hooks in contact with the edges of the spoiler fin.If I were a new car owner, I'd be all lawsuity and Consumer Reportsy. But, my car is 9 years old and I touch park, so I just feel I need to opine here as a Cautionary Tale.If you have a new car, don't use this. Get something that mounts off your trailer hitch. The only reason I got this was that it was the only trunk mount rack available for my car. My car does not have a trailer hitch. I cannot use a roof mount because I cannot lift a bike over my head.In a nutshell. OK for a beater. Not OK for a new car."
0,Lost my Bike The fasteners on this thing are awful. I was driving down the highway and after going over a bridge the bike flew off my car because the fasteners stripped and came undone.Spend more money on a nicer bike rack. Now I have to get a new bike and rack instead of paying maybe 50 bucks more and still having a bike.
0,"Smells Sweaty I USED to LOVE this perfume and used for years. But the last two times I bought it from Perfume World or I give someone to use, I have noticed that it smells worse than sweat - horrible. I donâ€™t believe this is the original perfume. Something somewhere is not right with it. But the original (real Paloma Picasso) was excellent. Everyone used to ask me what I was wearing and where to get it! My $60 down the drain! Next time will try to buy from Macys like I used to and see if I can get the original Paloma."
0,"typical Buffet cover band dribble This group bills it's self as the original Key West the Band so I tried it out because I like that group.No contest!If I were Key West the Band I would sue for misrepresentation!I tried listening to this music but it was tough to make it all the way thru.Bad, clique lyrics and songs.The singer is good but can't make up for the horrible songs and grainy recording techniques.Maybe next time -- but I doubt it."
0,"THIS MUSIC SUCKS THE WORST CD I'VE EVER BOUGHT.I BOUGHT THIS CD BASED ON ALL OF THESE RAVING REVIEWS THAT YOU'LL READ BELOW.I TRIED TO DOWNLOAD THE MP3 SAMPLES, BUT PROBLEMS WITH HARDWARE/SOFTWARE/AMAZON/AOL OR ALL OF THE ABOVE KEPT ME FROM FROM SAMPLING THIS PURCHASE.IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING.SOUNDS LIKE MY SONS GARAGE BAND TRYING TO PLAY BUFFETT SONGS."
0,"Horrible read don't waste your time!! This book proves to be unconstitutional, I cannot believe John Yoo teaches at UC Berkeley, I would be ashamed to call myself a professor and a patriot writing a book like this."
0,"Yoo's reasoning befuddled Professor Yoo's writing style is as nearly befuddled and confused as his understanding of a Constitutional law. I can say without fear of contradiction that this is by far one of the most ill-conceived, unsubstantive and pointless books I have ever had the misfortune to read. His theories and assertions are never clearly backed up with any real documentation or legal reasoning and he fails miserably in making any clear or concise point. I feel this book was nothing more that a total waste of time. Perhaps Professor Yoo should stick to writing legal arguments, where style and in his case substance, don't really matter."
0,"Unsupported by the Constitution Yoo's arguments in favor of an essentially unchecked executive fly in the face of everything that the Founders intended when creating our great country. He is undoubtedly intelligent, given the prowess with which he manipulates the Constitution and legal precepts into seemingly supporting his own theory. Despite the packaging, however, the fundamental basis for his theory is fatally flawed. He is, at his core, merely an opportunist who advocates theories for the sole purpose of furthering his own career, rather than because they actually have merit. In other words, he's just a hack at heart. This book isn't worth your time or money."
0,Freedom Hater The author of this book hates freedom and his book is unsupported by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
0,"Evident Growing Errors! Some ideas in this book are as helpful as any newspapers' garden section. There are EVIDENT growing ERRORS in this book. If you are a beginner or intermediate grower, this book may misguide your gardening efforts. If you want real facts, there are better sources out there."
0,"Nice features, poor reliability. The first one we received was dead out of the box. It made a loud grinding and sounded like a fan hitting metal. We assumed this was due to shipping damage and received a replacement. The replacement worked fine for six months but suddenly the display panel would go blank and the clock would reset after a few minutes. The microwave has now ceased functioning altogether. The warranty states ""in-home"" service, but there are no local service facilities."
0,"Totally disappointing Sorry to say, although Roland Barthes is an icon to some. This short book is self-indulgent, unintelligible, and therefore useless. The author is far more interested in himself than he is interested in the subject."
0,"Heavy going It is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly. I cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator, but it certainly does not measure up to this criterion. It may be of interest to photography academics, but I doubt if a photographer will get much out of it that is useful."
0,"wanted a soundtrack not an Elton John record Some of the other reviews are correct, this is a great Elton John record. But I didnt buy it to listen to Elton John, I bought it to get the music from the movie.I am very disappointed. While Elton John is indeed a good artist, that is not why I wanted this. The makers of this cd have cheated me and anyone else who is a fan of the movie. They have set this up as a soundtrack to get your money, but instead it is nothing more than an Elton John music.Which is why it only gets 1 star from me."
0,"Bad Songs Say So Much What a lousy soundtrack for a suprisingly fun movie. Some of the actual score pieces are decent, but NONE of Elton's songs on this album are worth even a brief listen. Save your money and buy ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" or ""Madman Across the Water."""
0,"Rocket Man Where Are You........? Elton John had peaked as a songwriter in the mid 70's and was even able to tweak out a decent hit every now and then throughout the 80's and early 90's. Today, Elton John's music has become about as exciting to listen to as a trip to the shopping mall. His songwriting has become so formulistic and predictable that you can see him doing the Lion King Part X in about 20 years in a full blown Vegas style show. Elton is a legend whose status is much owed to the music he created more than 20 years ago. Today, it seems comical that this legend has become a comical parody of the ""I think I can still write a hit"" composer who seems to have an endless supply of the same 'adult(now Diseny)-contemporary' melodies with variations on a theme of schmaltz."
0,"Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road - hello Shlocksville! ""El Dorado"" fails on all levels. Truly, this is a CD to avoid. Elton's fans should avoid it for the lackluster rhythms, simple chromatic melodies (if you can call them that)and banal Tim Rice lyrics and forced rhymes. Disney film fans - this is NOT Lion King of the Central American Jungle! There is no grand opening melodic sweep like ""Circle of Light"" - instead you've got the moronic repetition of ""El Dorado."" There are no ballads like ""Can you hear the love"" - so there's nothing to compare it to. And the comic songs isn't very clever, although ""It's Tough to be a God"" comes close. One last comment, I could buy the Spanish rhythms - after all the main characters are Spanish - but where the hell did the country/western sound come into the picture at all? Dreamworks, if you want to rival Disney, get Phil Collins to do your music next time."
0,"Great Generation, Lousy Book Don't bother reading this book. Brokaw's sham will teach you nothing about the Second World War. Instead, read Studs Terkel's THE GOOD WAR or anything by Paul Fussell. Better yet, go talk to a veteran...We're lucky they're still around."
0,"Not the ""greatest"" in my book. Sure, this generation won a war, but what was the alternative?In my opinion, all this generation did was run up the world's greatest debt...then leave it to their kids to pay the tab.When they didn't have a war to send their children to, they created one in Vietnam. After killing over 50,000 of us, they decided maybe it wasn't such a good idea afterall.When they decided they didn't want to pay for their own medical bills, they created Medicare. And guess who pays? They underfunded their retirement. And guess who pays? They built a highway system. And guess who pays? They poluted the environment like never before. Guess who pays to clean it up the mess.I do agree with Brokaw on one point, this is one generation that was the greatest at one thing...avoiding responsibility."
0,"Disappointing and shallow account of the ordinary heros WWII I was quite let down by the lack of real substance and information in the accounts. It is a great subject but the shallow treatment did not hold my interest. Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers is much, much better."
0,"Should have been a short story, too repetive The story was good for the first three chapters, then it was the same story over and over with new names. Highly overrated."
0,"Preachy, dumbed-down stories with no spirit or innovation I really looked forward to this book, based on my respect for Tom Brokaw and what I had heard. Unfortunately, he makes his point with a sledgehammer, telling sapppy stories with the same theme over and over, spoon feeding you the point, in case you somehow missed it. Grandma and Grandpa were great, generous, self-sacrificing gods and goddesses, and here are a thousand treacly repetitive stories why. This book condescends to the reader, unfortunately, probably with all good intentions but annoying results. I wasn't able to finish this book, and that's rare for me."
0,"Run - don't walk - away from your favourite bookstore ... This was not the greatest generation. This was the last bigoted generation. Bigotry today exists in smaller and smaller pockets, hangovers from the generation Brokaw prostrates himself to. My older friend tells me that she likes working with younger men than her own generation because she gets treated like an equal instead of a subordinate. Says it all really - the greatest generation doesn't even like itself. Is Tom Brokaw out to make a buck with the old `it were better in my time' malarkey, or is he stupid? Given that he is already very wealthy, and has never before struck me as an idiot, I'm going for the only other option - he wanted more limelight. By the way, the book was repetitive. If they were that great, why weren't there more examples to call on than the same schmaltz delivered time and again."
0,How can I write a book ? I to can ask my neighbors! It is not worth buying ! If this a must read for you go to our public library. You just might thank me!
0,"The most violent generation Here is a book that was hailed as a best seller before it was even released. One that was fed to the public by one of America's leading talking heads, Tom Brokaw. My grandfather was at Normandy and later helped liberate several concentration camps throughout Germany. What these experiences cost him, was ultimately his life. He rarely smiled after witnessing the horrific brutality, and inhumanity that was set loose on the world in WWII and after. This book is an attempt to rewrite, an already severely inaccurate history of this period of time. Brokaw tries to take the attention from the mass slaughter that was perpetrated by BOTH sides, and instead focus on the heartwarming yet tragic human interest stories so common to todays evening news. Living through the ""greatest generation"", killed my grandfather's spirit, along with millions of others like him, who instead saw in it a living hell, and a disgrace to humanity."
0,Am I missing something? What is so special about this book? I am a baby boomer that has always respected the sacrifices that the WWII generation had to endure both oversees and at home. Do I need Tom Brokaw to reinforce this? Please! I stopped about half way through; to me it was 200 pages of senior citizen complaints about the younger generations.
0,"Interesting content, poor writting and editing The stories of the people depicted in the book are interesting. Ranging from really interesting to somewhat interesting. These were people that made a difference and deserve our respect. However the book is poorly put together. It seems as if I am watching a TV show on paper. A poor end result. Would not recommend."
0,"Self promoting and falsely exaggerated American ""morals"" Tom Brokaw knows better than his ""admiring"" comments about U.S veterans. he is giving too much credit to American WWII veterans. Other than raising his ""good old american image"", I see no point in praising a nation that only profitted from WWII. Brokaw should spend his time on other journalistic adventures, and stop being a hedonist."
0,"Stick to the news, Tom......... It amazes me that this book remained atop the best seller list for so long. There was absolutely nothing in this book which has not been covered, in a far more descriptive style, by a host of authors. This book did not have another authors help, and by god it needed it!"
0,Presumably not the Greatest Generation of Parents It's very ironic that the supposed greatest generation were not able to instill their sterling qualities in their own children - the much maligned baby boomers. This failure seems to expose a serious deficiency of parenting and mentoring skills.
0,"A worthwhile topic but lacking focus and proportion. Brokaw's thesis is that a generation tested by (a) the Depression, and (b) WWII, rose to the challenge and deserves our respect and admiration. This may be true, but Brokaw does not prove it. His book lacks the kind of rich specificity which would be convincing. For the various people he interviews, he gives us very little on how they survived the Depression. And as the book advances, we get less and less of the particulars of how the subjects experienced the war. The problem may be that there are too many subjects, or interviewees, to be handled with the thoroughness or depth that is finally convincing. At the end, we are left only with the warm feeling that they have survived, and we can all be grateful for that, but not with a sense that we have come finally to know them, especially in their past, and how that past has shaped them, which is, after all, the point of the book."
0,"America's disturbing ignorance I am quite disturbed by the absolute ignorance of the american reviewers of this book. They honestly believe America was solely responsible for the allies winning of the war. This book is extremely complacent, and with its remarkable bias, does not qualify as history. As the last reviewer said, American's obviously think they are better than everybody else. That was the reason why Germany started the war in the first place."
0,"Good idea, poor execution Tom Brokaw is not a gifted writer. He wrote this book in the same dry and simple style as he uses with his TV audience. The book is completely stripped of romance and soul for the sake of the lowest common denominator. I have met many WW2 veterans who tell stories woven with romance and heartbreak that bring tears to your eyes. This is not represented in any of the 4 page biographies of these common place heroes. Pure non-fiction at its most uninspiring."
0,"Don't bother Sentimental, shallow book about WWII vets. I agree with his assessment of the generation, however. Read Stephen Ambrose if you want good WWII books. This book is only selling because the author is a celebrity. Duh."
0,The Greatest Generation Deserved Better Shame on Tom Brokaw for giving an epic title to a book that is clumsily written and tedious to read. I am totally underwhelmed by the lack of substance in this book.
0,Garbage Which is worse his ego or his partisan views? This guy has an agenda and it's almost as dumbed down as his representation of the news. One more example of the whole show going in the toilet.
0,"Really, all this just to sell books Listen, I like Tom Brokaw as a journalist, but this book was such an obvious pander in order to sell books. It worked, he sold a lot of copies. By calling the WWII generation the ""Greatest Generation"", it gives anyone born within the general area the idea that they are great. Brokaw doesn't bother to make a distinction between the ""GI Generation"", or the people who actually marched off the war, fought a war, came home, built a middle class and thrived. And those of the ""Silent Generation"" who came a long a little later and were big on conformity in the 1950's, didn't suffer in the war or the Great Depression. I don't think just because you're old, you're great, and the author simply would not make the distinction in order to sell copies."
0,"Redundant and repetitious. ""Tom...don't quit your day job.""The Greatest Generation is both cliche-ridden and self-servng.This book is merely a platform for Mr. Brokaw's ultra-left leanings.Tom never tells us what some of these heroes think of our present ""commander in chief."""
0,"Now we know why he is a newscaster Brokaw delivers a lightweight, sketchy, collection of interviews with World War Two vets, which unfortunately has made him a lot of money and spawned equally mediocre sequels.There are an infinite number of far superior books covering the same ground."
0,Contains Transfats The nutritional information on the packages I got do not match what is on the website here. Each bag has 4g of trans fats. Why the discrepancy? Why do they need to add that to sunflower kernels?
0,"VTech i6775 Review Years ago, I had purchased some VTech products and was very displeased with the their quality. At that time, I swore never to buy VTech again.While recently seeking cordless phones with speakerphone options, I came across the i6775. The price was right, and some time had passed, so I bought two sets (home and office) in June, 2006.There's only a three month warranty on these units, and one set recently (11-2006) died. After finally getting through to VTech support and troubleshooting with them, we couldn't revive the system. The phones are useless, and I'm stuck with them.You can guess my advice."

0,Tech Analysis is a bunch of BUNK This book along with all other books and seminars on tech analysis are mere ploys to make the authors wealthy.
0,"Reprint of a old-edition (1948 ?! ) The book is the reprint of a old edition date back 1948 with some little update up to 1963. The Amazon's Search-Inside(TM) refer to another update version of the book (9 ed.). The book's style and content is very old, the charts are hand-made and frankly speaking now it's possible to do much better and the calculation of indicators now can be exact. If you are interested to the prehistory of technical analysis a would suggest ""Welles Wilder - New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems"". Modern and better books are those of Achelis and Colby."
0,"Worst service ever The product itself is great, but it came in a plain brown box that didn't even fit the telescope and with part of it sticking out of the box. There were no instructions and no star chart. After 3 months of dealing with this company and filing a complaint with Amazon I am still having trouble with them. I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and today will file another complaint with Amazon. I would never order from this company again."
0,"SUGARJAY To those of you first hearing the j's you might actually like this record. But to those of you who like the previous intelligent hip hop stylings of return of the new and improved, sing earthboy sing, and supermercado you might find yourself staring at your cd player thinking what is this? I had a promo of this record last year before they switched labels and i didn't really like it back then but i figured when the new version comes out maybe it will be better..sadly i was very let down. It's almost like they are a completly new band. More alternative sugar ray/gimmicky radio songs instead of hip hop. I think the fact that they lost amays and andy action had something to do with it but i could be wrong. if your a j's fan who knows you might like it. if this is your first time definatly pick up supermercado first"
0,"One of the biggest blunders MTL really screwd-up bigtime by issuing the same UPC number to their entire music catalog. Most Marketplace sellers on Amazon upload their product by UPC, so you can end up with any title from the MTL catalog. Before purchasing this title or any title from the MTL line, be sure to inquiry as to what the Marketplace seller is offering! This will save you a ton of stress.As far as the album ""SOUL HITS, Vol 1"" goes... it is definitely worth having and is chocked full of classic soul jams we all love. It is definitely a great addition to any collection... if you can find it!Good Luck!"
0,Crazy Elephant CD There is only one song on this CD worth listening to. Do not buy CD. I was very disappointed in this CD.
0,"The production crew done her wrong... I would like to blame the director, but, didn't she preview her own material?Whatever it is that would account for the awful audio -- the sound mixing, or Ms. Corn's strident, almost lecturing tone as she reads her voice-over script -- I found it remarkably annoying and distracting. Also, the sequencing is not unique enough to get lost in the practice, so to speak. I really wanted to like this DVD; Ms. Corn has lovely form and provides a good demonstration of the standard poses, but there is nothing novel enough about the two practices to justify keeping this DVD in my collection when I find myself slipping into grit-my-teeth-asana as I try to concentrate on the music, which can barely be detected behind the grating narration. A big disappointment."
0,"Horrible Worst instructional video I have ever used. She talks and talks and talks and moves real fast. I had an extremely difficult time catching up to her and then she is on to the next move.The video starts with about 20 minutes of advertisement and the next 20 minutes is just watching her move. You must use the remote to find the ""instructional"" part. What a waste. I just wish I could get her address and let her know I will never buy anything with her name on it."

0,"Disappointing In an effort to tide fans over while they decide what the hell their next move will be--if in fact there is a next move--Destiny's Child have taken it upon themselves to release this remix album. What a disappointment. While their previous two studio records showed occasional flashes of musical and vocal greatness, this album sets them back miles, catering to every beats-to-the-wall formula that is saturating radio airwaves and in the process rendering nearly every song a futile exercise in staccato riffs and loud, obnoxious drum programming. Only on the Maurice Joshua remix of 'So Good' does the music show any signs of joy and life. And the Michelle Williams track tacked on at the end only further strengthens what many have always believed--both Williams and Kelly Rowland would do wise to leave the singing to Beyonce Knowles and continue in their roles as highly paid background vocalists--nuff said."
0,"Waste How sad is it that this CD was released. A supposed ""Hiatus"" yes. They just released this to cash in on their fans, and so no one will forget them. How can we when they are shoved in our faces at every possible moment, even when they are supposedly taking a break! So until they decide what they want from their careers, they will still manage to be a cash cow for their fans. Elsewhere, these remixes are far from anything good. Just another sad piece of plastic which isn't worth the time of day...Why don't they just take time off, I mean really take time off, and come back with something that is a good album? After SURVIVOR, I have no hopes for this disapointing group which was once good. This only adds to my disapointment."
0,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT I bought this CD because I love Destiny's Child but this is a tired selection of so called remixes.
0,"Dear Lord, What Happened Here? It used to be that when artists released a new album, they released a NEW album. Now we get live albums, useless Holiday recordings, and shoddily-made remix releases. This album falls into the third category, and as far as remix albums go, the results are catastrophic. Predictible hip-hop remixes of singles we've heard a zillion times before abound, while the FEW house mixes are as flat as soda left at room temperature for hours. Listen, nobody says you can't do a remix album, but give the listeners some variety and a groove. I actually like Destiny's Child, but after ""The Writing's on the Wall,"" their music is getting more and more vanilla. Should you feel the urge to get this CD, just say ""no, no, no."""
0,"Buy 883476028965 instead. As anyone can clearly tell from the reviews, this bundle (which is three existing DVDs shrink-wrapped together with a sheet of paper bearing the ""cover"" image rubber cemented to the front -- not a space-saver) only contains the rated cuts of FEAST II and FEAST III. However, TWC has seen fit (finally) to fix this decision by quietly releasing a new DVD. The revised set comes in a single, regular-width DVD case, and all three discs are the Unrated versions. The UPC for that version is 883476028965, and it can be found at many Wal-Marts (right now anyway) for $10. If you want a space-saving, all-Unrated way to get the FEAST movies for cheap, track down that one and pass on this one."
0,Confusing Illumination These are not HID. One star for false advertising. Persons unfamiliar with headlight technology are confused my this type of misinformation. It is typical for non-HID lamps to advertise that they have Xenon gas and that is confusing enough (although technically true). But to call these lights HID is just plain inaccurate and misleading.

0,"Poorly Made The thing made great rice, including brown rice, but that turned out to be beside the point since it completely failed to function after a handful of uses."
0,"Bought this 2 years ago but has started to fail over an year ago.. The rice cooker was wonderful when I first started using it. As time went by, it started spit dirty water unto the rice and is now usuable. I have grown up with zojirushi products since I was a baby and ate rice from it 2 out of 3 meals everyday. This rice cooker is crap and I am extremely disappointed, perhaps it is this particular model or the brand that has gone down in quality. I know is that I need to shell out some money to buy another rice cooker:("
0,"Don't buy Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker, computer chip problem This is 2nd one I had in 3 years, same model same problem started to show right after one year. Zojirushi customer service found all kind the excuses not willing to take care of it, they wanted me call service center, which they charging service fee $138- up-front(about the same price for buy a new one)....I will never buy Zojirushi again."
0,"Inner pot peels off!! I fell for these great reviews, but found out there is really nothing special about this rice cooker except for the price and the reviews to justify spending more for the same thing.After a couple of months of use, the inner pan peels off, had bad scratches. Talk about the worst customer service.I wish someone I've read a more truthful review on this product prior to buying.Save your money."
0,"Less than Impressed We purchased the acclaimed, top end NS-ZCC-10 Neuro fuzzy rice cooker. We expected perfect rice because after all it incorporates the latest software and heating technology. We are very disappointed. Rice is overcooked and clumpy. We've tried to troubleshoot (more water, less water etc), but you know, the bottom line is that this cooker does not deliver excellent rice. We got better results with our no-tech, aluminum $50 plug in rice cooker.Very disappointed. I do not recommend you spend your money on this product."
0,"Totally disappointed Very expensive. Have to read the manual every time for it to work. Got a mind of it own. The lid has to washed every time and there is only one way to screw it back on. If you lose the encyclopedic manual, you are truly toasted. Don't Buy!!! You can get this crap in Chinatown cheaper any way."
0,"What a Joke! Wow, after reading all the rave reviews here I expected a great rice cooker. It was anything but...I suppose if I had an hour to wait for my rice it would've proven to be the best rice. 40 minutes plus is the time stated by the directions, I figured cooking one cup would be less, but after 20 minutes the cooker had barely warmed up....I quickly got my ""cheap"" Hamilton cooker ($15) and voila, I had rice a few mintutes later.I'm sure that for those with time or with the time to pre-set cooking time for completion, this is a great machine, but for those that just want to cook some rice quickly and have dinner, don't waste your money. Will be sending this back asap."
0,No Value of Money.. Not worth the money. Takes between 80 and 100 minutes to cook rice. Panasonic Rice Cookers are much better at $49.
0,Broke in 10 months. I was very happy with this rice cooker until the very fragile rubber grommet on the lid tore. They do not sell the part. Beware. It is great but it will not last long this feature makes it very very vulnerable. I had it for 10 months before the fragile grommet tore now it no longer makes good rice. The cost to repair it makes it useless because I would just have to repair it again in 10 months. This is not a rice maker for anyone who cooks a lot of rice it just won't last.
0,"Just after 2.5 years, it is toasted We bought this 2.5 years ago. It was very good at the beginning. However, just after 2.5 years of light use, it is now toasted. The rice comes out sticky and lumpy and drys up in less than 12 hours. We thought Zojirushi stands for quality and durability. We made a big mistake."
0,Not worth the money The instructions are the worst I have ever seen! Right now I cannot tell if the d@#$ thing is even cooking rice! Buy one of the cheaper cookers and save yourself a lot of headaches!
0,"Too Soft - Not firm - Loses Air Quickly - Not good for Chair As stated in the subject line, this product may be a good fitness ball but not firm enough to be a chair."
0,"""Professional??"" I ordered this as it was advertized as being professional grade, like what you would expect to find in a good health club gym or the like. This ball seems no different than most others i've seen and used. I'm about 210lbs and when i use the ball for any exercise that involves sitting on it or laying on it the ball changes shape temporarily. When i get off of the ball it's not a ball so much as an orb. it returns to a round shape but for being as sturdy as Go-Fit seems to claim this thing seems to be crap. I'd recommend looking for something that is actually heavy duty if that's what you're needing. There are way too many junk exercise balls on the market and this one is a slightly better than average version. The 75cm size is really large too."
0,"Sudden Death of a Ball The Amazon return period expired on Feb. 7Almost to the day two months later the ball i was comfortably sitting on at worked popped and deflated and landed me on the floor during a business meeting.Embarrassed? A little. Especially because I have been telling everybody int the office hwo great this ball is and how well it works for me.I will return it to Amazon and will send e message to the manufacturer. Fortunately nobody was hurt.I hope the company will replace the ball without any problems, especially since there were no sharp objects involved and I think I am not too heavy at 195 lb.I'll continue writing when I receive a reply from the manufacturer or Amazon."
0,"If I could get it inflated, I could rate it... I just got the GoFit ball. It came with a handbook with excercise options. An instruction DVD on using the ball, a hand pump and a white plastic piece I assume it related to the pump or plug to the ball. The ball already has a similiar white plug in place. There are NO instructions on how to get the ball inflated. The pump does not fit into where I assume to pump air into it. No matter what Itry I can not get the ball to take any air. If I could inflate the darn ball, I would be able to rate its performance. If you can not get air into it, it is completely useless."
0,"Balls are mislabeled - this is actually a 65cm, that's marked as 75 These balls are excellent. I use one at work as a chair and was buying another for exercise at home. Very good product, but my low rating is due to the fact that Amazon apparently received a batch of balls that are mislabeled. I have 65cm Go Fit balls at home and this 75cm is exactly the same size. My 75cm Go Fit that I have at work is noticeably larger.I've returned this ball once and Amazon (as they always do) gave me excellent customer service and sent out a replacement. Regrettably, the replacement is also a 65cm marked as 75cm."
0,"Ordered 2, both failed the first day Found the product not to be durable. Both balls split in the first day of use so they seem too fragile for the intended use."
0,"Research this thoroughly before you buy one for an office chair I bought this ball to use as an office chair without reading up enough on the matter. I thought it would burn calories and improve posture, but as it turns out the ball really doesn't do much of either. An article at the N Y Times said that according to a 2008 study, performing clerical work at a desk while sitting on an exercise ball burns about four more calories an hour than the same activity in a chair, or roughly only 30 extra calories in a typical workday. And a Dutch study found that the disadvantages, including spinal shrinkage, may outweigh any advantages. All I know is that my back and hip joints hurt after I used this, and the ball didn't work out as an office chair. It might be fine if you want it for other exercise, but that wasn't what I purchased it for."
0,"Product is not what is being advertised! The ball that had arrived is not the ball that is pictured in the description. It's not even a GoFit brand ball.

I`m gonna order this again but only god knows what`ll i get.Also the real problem is; most people do not measure their balls ( LOL ) and with this product coming with a package stating that it is 75 i believe most people use the wrong-sized balls.

0,Huh??? This is very odd. In 1998 Garth Brooks had success when he put out a box set with a similiar theme. However for some artists that kind of treatment doesn't work and it falls flat. I like Toby Keith but this box set is just a way for a record company to make money buy repackaging three CD's (None of which are any good or have any worth) and make an extra buck. It's just sad.
0,"Disappointing This review is for people possibly looking into the Beta Band because of their single on the High Fidelity soundtrack. Drying the Rain is a great song, but unfortunately the formula that makes it a great song does not carry over to the rest of the album. It really is just a bunch of noise. Main stream music fans should pass this up and stick to the soundtrack. Trust Me."

I could have gotten better use out of $30 by purchasing a fairly decent bottle of wine...it would be gone too, but I would have had more enjoyment out of it. This unit is very small, and getting it into the ear is awkward, and is impossible to do without pressing one of the volume up/down buttons, which means you will have to re-adjust. If you have larger hands, like I do, it is a little odd to handle...hence, the greater possibility of it being dropped. The sound was mediocre at best, and everyone I spoke to (in the short 3 days that it did work) said there was an echo on their end. Not recommended. Move on to another."
0,Our unexpected wasted time I am a very big Maureen McKade Fan . I have got 2 of every book that she has . I waited so long to read this one .

0,"here we go again! holy crap once again this faggot NElly comes out with a horrible album, omg dont get this, paul wall song is whack, the only good song to listen to is Nasty Girl. Nelly is still whack and always will be, listen to true rappers like NWA, Nas, Eminem, Dre, not these bubble gum rappers like Mike Jones, slim thug etc.Seems to me like hip hop is getting worse and worse every year, where the days where people would talk about important things rather then cars and girls.This nelly guy collaborated with NSync WTF!! and Tim Mcgraw also WTF! XTINA, Fat Joe, Lil Flip all horrible people and yet he does it. I dont think he cares about what his fans think, wish he wouldve stuck with something like Country Grammer only thing but this CD is just horrible dont get it!(...)"
0,"Manufactured garbage re-packaged Sweat and Suit were two of the absolute worst albums of last year. Sadly, both of those disasters are being re-packaged and released again. Everything on here is just terrible. ""Grillz"" is also one of the worst songs I've ever heard all year. It figures that only Nelly would make a stupid song about his diamond teeth. It also figures he'd make a song with that horrible H-Town rapper Paul Wall. I blame Nelly for the state of hip hop today. He also created hip-pop which is one of the worst music genres ever created. Hell Cash Money and G-Unit make better club songs than this idiot. One of the year's absolute worst albums."
0,"Holy Canoli! 2 Crappy albums for the price of 1!!!!!!!!!!!! Nelly sucks, we all know that's a fact. I'm glad the legendary KRS-ONE pulled his b!tch card, Nelly's feelings got hurt when he heard one of the pioneers tell him that he sucks. If nelly was a fat guy with a gheri curl he wouldn't sell any albums, since he's a fair-skinned, muscle bound tool, he sells. He seems to model himself after LL Cool J, who also sucks and had 1 good song his whole career. Don't encourage artists like Nelly by purchasing their records, it only insults the hip-hop community, which you probably would never understand if you're listening to this crap."
0,"Simply wack. Nelly is garbage. Which explains why this album, now combined, didn't do anything on the charts. Even when they came out the first time, he only sold about 3 or 4 million combined. Nobody is feeling him anymore. Maybe the women will still buy his stuff but I doubt it. He is officially wack. Don't buy this."
0,a ripoff nelly's running out of ideas first this was 2 separate cd's a good way for nelly to make money since nelly can't come up with new song ideas he decided to put the best songs on both albums and combine them and call it sweatsuit boy nelly you sure are a jackass for doing this good matrketing skills every song on here sucks just like sweat and suit did nelly fell off after country grammar he lost his edge doing songs with pisstina aguilera and even tim mcgraw's weak ass you gonna do country keep it hood idiot.
0,"I usually give good reviews... From a white alpha male:I concur with the others who don't like this release from Nelly. I like much of his earlier stuff, solo & with the talented St. Lunatics crew...I love STL!Nelly buddy Murphy Lee's Law 2003 album is Jammin all the way!!...has not one crappy tune.Maybe Nelly should retire from rap, just be cool, open a restaurant or strip club, manage & direct new female R&B; groups...or start a funky jazz outfit, ala Brand New Heavies or Incognito."
0,"Dehydrated.........dying rapidly. Listening to this album is just like putting on the thickest sweatsuit you can find and going for a really long run in africa. Dehydrated and dying rapidly. Nelly helps with this dehydration of hip hop by constantly creating infantile BS songs. I am sick of this monotonous, commercial, ignorant so called ""hip hop"". When will the zombies and sheep get tired of hearing the same song over and over and over again? Avoid this rehash of Sweat and suit as if it is a newly found strand of AIDS. Shakespeare?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! WTF!!!!!!!!! LOL......if shakespeare wrote his plays like nelly writes his lyrics, the masses would've first stoned him to the point of death and then burned him at the stake."

The rack arrived in a timely manner but.........instructions were vague and hard to follow. My husband and I spent a couple of hours trying to install the rack & 2 bicycles onto the 4Runner. We could get the rack on - tight & secure - but the weight of the bicycles caused the upper legs to pull away from the rear window. We finally gave up and returned the rack to Amazon. In addition, no way could the rack be used on the VW - straps and metal clips would have to be attached to glass which the instructions clearly said should not happen. I consider my husband & I to be reasonably intelligent but possible that there was something we failed to do????????A positive....Amazon paid for return shipping and credited my credit card - no questions asked."

DON'T BUY IT. DEMAND BETTER QUALITY!"

0,"A terrible mistake in the history of the music industry Sheena Easton is a terrible mistake in the history of the music industry. How did this woman ever get signed? Don't buy this CD, it's gross. 80s pop is a bad genre of music. This whole CD is a bad example of that bad genre.First of all, it's 15 songs. 15 songs is cool if the singer is good. But Sheena is BAD. This CD is 15 songs of torture and regret -- regret of ever putting the CD in your CD player. Her voice is weak. The songs are very upbeat and poppy, but with her voice, they sound weird. She's not good at pop. And she's even worse at ballads. She's just bad at everything. She's a total Madonna wannabe.Please, please, PLEASE don't purchase this CD. It's a waste of your money. Buy something good! NOT Sheena Easton!"
0,"Bad (old?) pills that gave me hives I have been taking astragalus supplements for a very long time. I dicided to give Gaia's liquid gel pill a try, hoping for better absorption. However, only after a couple of days of taking it, I developed a lot of hives all over my body. When I examed the pills, I saw that every pill was only half filled with liquid. This can be indications that the pills were very old that the liquid had been dried up and poor packaging. I stoped taking it and threw out the opened bottle. I kept the unopened one so I can send to a lab for testing later. Will NEVER buy any Gaia product again!"

0,"Gives me a headache I am now taking calculus with this book. I don't know how people survived calculus with this book. This book is for someone who really has a grasp on calculus, not for beginners. The examples don't match the problems, so you're thoroughly confused and have nothing to look at to help you when you're doing homework. You get a headache literally just from trying to understand it. Calculus is hard enough and the authors make it harder to learn than it needs to be. I've had other calculus books that explain much better and have very thorough examples that I could understand and keep up with. This book does a very poor job."
0,"Not worth the effort This is the third calculus book I've had, and the only one I haven't understood. In the others I could always follow their examples and relate them to the homework questions. In this book the example problems have nothing to do with the homework questions. I imagine if one had a good calculus teacher this would be less of a problem.Basically this book taught me nothing more than to hate calculus."
0,"Good book, kindle edition filled with typos I guess somebody scanned a paper version of this book to build the kindle edition, as it appears to be filled with OCR errors.The content of the writing is enjoyable, but the kindle-edition typos are a real buzzkill for getting into the book.Get it in paperback, skip the kindle edition."

0,"Numerous transcription errors in Kindle edition While Ross is an excellent writer and I hate to leave a review that nit-picks the format rather than the content, I think it's useful for those considering buying the Kindle edition to be warned that the digital text has numerous obvious copy errors, seemingly created when scanning the book: ""candles"" become ""candies"", ""corn"" becomes ""com"", etc., over and over throughout the book. It's usually easy to work out what the word should have been, but it's very distracting and breaks the flow of the text."
0,"Once again, the G rating only good enough for OUTSIDE USA!!! As with every Nick movie from 2002 onwards, this movie is rated PG. However, some countries, like the U.K. for example, has a G equivalent. Come on! We hardly get to see G rated movie in theaters anymore! There are lots of PG movies for families that are innocent and don't deserve a high rating. Maybe it's just a filthy trick for the MPAA to encourage children to read a book or play a sport? B***S**T! I like movies, and kids like movies. I don't it when parents worry. Please, MPAA? Let our country's children see a stinkin' movie, will ya?"
0,"Really bad, boring, stupid movie. I had to watch this in my band class when we had a substitute teacher because some teenagers are so immature they watch SpongeBob. I don't watch TV at all, and was not expecting to see this movie.The ""humor"" in this movie ranges from forced (the whole ""Goofy Goober"" thing, a Chuck E. Cheese-like establishment, only with peanutes) to disturbing (SpongeBob's mentally challenged friend Patrick Star flies into a ceremony naked with a flag in his butt). The only good part is when SpongeBob and Patrick get drunk off ice cream. You know what would've been the perfect ending? Them getting arrested for underage drinking.Hey, I'd laugh."

0,"This edition SUCKS! Full Screen Edition dvds suck (UNLESS IT WAS filmed that way). Full Screen crops the theatrical picture to 4:3 ratio which is the shape of a standard (non-widescreen) TV screen. There is no letterboxing, but up to a third of the original picture is lost. WIDESCREEN preserves the original theatrical picture ratio of the film which will appear in ""letterboxed"" format on a normal TV screen. If the movie is going to be modified from it's original version then It should not cost as much."

0,"Not impressed This product didn't work as well as I had hoped. It doesn't hurt, but it also doesn't remove all of the hair. I had to go behind and pluck my eyebrows (even longer hairs that should have been picked up by the strips). Save your money and buy wax instead."

0,"On behalf of Britain I am deeply sorry. This is an obscenely derivative album which basically amounts to some not very talented people revamping Mrs Gallagher's record collection and passing it off as their own. If only they'd been American, maybe someone would have called the lawyers and done away with this formulaic, monotone drivel.I would suggest you go back to the search box and look up the original artists instead - T Rex, The New Seekers and,of course, The Beatles. Also recommended is R.E.M.s 'The Wake-Up Bomb' which derides them nicely."

0,"""Definitely Maybe"" definitely stinks... This has to be their most overrated album. ""Live Forever"" however is a song that must not be ignored. It is probably one of Oasis's best songs to date.

0,Book not received I have filed a claim for a refund. The book was never received and the seller did not respond to my 3 emails.
0,Somewhat creative but thoroughly uninspired This stuff is easily the most trite and cliche collection of prose on love and romance that I've ever read. I was expecting a good deal more. The writing seems to come from the mindset of an intellectually arrested suburban kid who hasn't experienced much of life or the world beyond his college campus and his few so-called love affairs.
0,"Overkill While I absolutely love the four agreements and return to the original book often, I found the companion book to be completely unnecessary. The writing style was poor and rambled in circles, constantly repeating itself. There was no new information at all. I seemed to me to be a way to get a little more money out of the concept - shocking considering the author.I did enjoy the last few pages of personal examples from people who had incorporated the four agreements into their lives.If you have the four agreements original book, you don't need this one and if you don't then skip this one and get the original."
0,"BROKE MY PALM TX!!!!!!! Their DEFECTIVE product caused my palm tx to BREAK! I used the armor case and the belt clip that came with it the very day I got the package. My palm fell on the ground!

I emailed boxwave and this is the reply I got: ""Our liability policy prevents us from providing additional compensation for it. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you.""- All they offered was to replace the DEFECTIVE armor case with another one. As if I would ever trust their product again!!!"
0,"Not good for the Palm TX I just got the newest version of the Palm TX--and I'm not sure if they've changed the dimensions or anything--but this case does not close when I put my Palm TX in it. That's right, it doesn't work with the new TX. There is a small piece of plastic that is supposed to keep the palm in the case, but this is preventing the case from closing because the palm is too large.FYI. I will probably keep the product and just break off the little piece of plastic. But just so you know, don't buy this hardcase if you're getting a NEW Palm TX (with wi-fi and such)."

She spent all these hours on the phone with them trying to get it to work, and it wouldn't, so finally she sent it back to me. I tried to get a refund, and the Mailstation people wouldn't give it to me, because I was past the 30 day purchase limit. Terrible."
0,"Who knows what this is? I bought this thinking it was a band with free jazz reed man, Peter Brotzmann. I was surprised that only two pieces feature him and the rest are Scandinavian polkas.

0,"disappointing.... This book is certainly Reed's interpretation of Rimbaud. I found his interpretations to be a bit far reaching, and at times absurd. Reed often goes on into his own ""poetic"" rantings and all too often describes what he see's to be comparisons between his own life and that of Rimbaud. I had to force myself to finish this book. It was very disappointing. Any one interested in Rimbaud would do much better reading - Rimbaud- by Enid Starkie, or -Rimbaud- by Pierre Petitfils. Both are excellent."
0,"sunk under the weight of its own pretentions I wanted to like this book, I really did. It's all artsy and rebellious, possibly like Rimbaud himself. But oh, it is pretentious! It's like Reed took a straight-up Rimbaud biography, a lot of half-baked hippie rants, some political and social arguements which would have probably left the real Rimbaud scratching his head, and stuffed it all in a blender. (Set on puree, dry to a paste, spread it on paper. Voila, this book.) This is more the author's screaming than anything relevant to Rimbaud. If you want an artistic representation of Rimbaud's life, watch ""Total Eclipse"". If you want a Rimbaud biography, pick any other; they're all better than ""Delirium""."

Subtitles appear and then become squiggly unreadable worms on the screen. The video flips and buckles just like an old VHS or Beta tape. Why? Because they are cheap and make no effort for quality...and they still charge too much for a piece of crap. That other reviewer must have been eating mushrooms...and you notice there was no mention of picture quality? Buyer beware!"

0,"Very bad work by Elizabeth Speare review for Mr. Jones I think this book was boring. The only exciting part is the witch hunt. Most of the time they talked about polatics. If they wern't the were cring over petty grevences such as love. This is why this story was boring. The characters were annoying and obtuse, it was hard reading such a disgusting piece of lititure. Kit was such an unintelligent and snooty creature it was infurating to read about. The women were either self-centered or meek, the thought about love all the time. The men disscussed politics like a change would end the world and the men thought women were dirt. Nat and the cat were the only intellegent creatures. The characthers are just lacking perwsonality and intellegence."
0,"The Witch that wasn't! I didn't like the book so much. The author put to much detail about one person, Kit. I knew all of the background information about Kit and everything she owned. But when Hanna Tupper was introduced I hardly knew anything about her. The author also didn't write in any excitement in the story. Everyone was just plain everyday individuals that did everyday things, like cleaning and spinning wool, making meals, cleaning the house and making clothes. It would have been interesting if the author had put Kit or some other character on an adventure or made it a fiction not a historical fiction. I don't know anyone who would like to read a book about just everyday, ordinary people, that are living ordinary lives. I want to read a book about some adventure or action."
0,"Sleep indusing boredom I HATE this book! It is so boring! Basiclly, this girl is moving from some island to Conneticut in the 1600's, and the storyline basiclly follows all the random boring things she does day to day, even when there could be action, it is still boring. Only read this if you have trouble falling asleep. There is hardly any magic or anything like that at all, as said by the title."
0,"Sigh This book is boring, but there are some ok parts. Don't read this book unless you have to. (...) Duh! Well, just don't read the book."
0,Horrible Book! This is the most boring book I have ever read! Nothing really happens in the end. How could anyone like it?
0,"bad book: A kid's review I had to read this for school, and it was hard for me to look at it. There is no action, no humor, no excitement whatsoever. There is a lot of detail, but that is only on one person. All that really happens is the girl, Kit meets a lonely old lady who is nice to her. She isn't even a witch. I say that this is the worst book in the world. I think that it's like eating pure cocoa. So bitter, bland and boring."
0,"Call me crazy, but... It's not that this is a poorly written or poorly concieved book. It's that I have a great deal of trouble believing that anyone like Kit existed in the 1600s. Certainly there were people who were frustrated with society, but...like this? WoBP reads like a bad Mary-Sue fanfic. The heroine is too perfect."

0,"A Girl who lost everything takes her chances in Wethersfield This book was an overall 1 star book. The quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic.

0,"This book was nice. The Witch of Blackbird Pond, by Elizabeth George Speare, was filled with excitement. The only reason I gave this book 1 star was I always compare it to the French classic Gravybleu. I liked a lot though, more than my usual books; Hamington Road and the most recent Loolystolu. I loved this book because I sort of learned about America. I am glad I was able to share this to the world...because this was my only dream...to share my feelings to American kids!!

0,"Bulldog Ractical Leg Holster I purchased this holster at Cabelas and am very disappointed. Among the many things wrong with this holster is that, despite being advertised for a standard frame auto, it does not hold my Colt Model 80. If fact, the weapon moves around in the holster quite freely. Secondly, the leg straps are too short and I have average size thighs. Lastly, the holster flops out from my leg approximately one inch and there is no way to hold the holster tight against your thigh. All in all, a pooly made holster from a poor design. It is almost redundant to say that it was made in China. Do not purchase this product."
0,"Didn't Work When I received this in the mail it didn't work.

I am still waiting 3 weeks later for both of these and now have to work with my credit card company to contest payment. I would not order anything from FansEdge again."
0,"Waste of $15 I disassembled this thing for pieces, and the construction couldn't be cheaper. The steering is achieved with an electric motor, not a servo, so it's ""all or nothing""; not very much fun. I recommend either get something much more expensive, or something much less expensive."
0,"formatting and grammar...where is it? I have to admit that I have real problems with books that lack editing. This is a case in point. This book is difficult to read because of all the grammatical and spelling errors. Misplaced modifiers abound, too. Perhaps these errors have been corrected in subsequent printing, but at least, the one that I read had multiple errors on nearly every page. By the way, what is with spaces between paragraphs?Living on the North Coast as I do, I understand that people living in Ohio might find the story intriguing because of the subject matter; however, I found it difficult to enjoy the story because of the stilted conversations and implausible situations."

0,"Bombastic over-indulgent arrogant rock star cliches There have been many comparisons of Oasis to the Beatles, often by the band itself; but Noel Gallagher cannot draw the distinction between inspiration and imitation. On their first two albums, they got away with mere imitation just because they came up with some pretty infectious melodies. But on this album, the melodies aren't even there. They've fallen victim to their own hype and have created a monster. For God's sake, do not buy this album. ""All Around the World"" is the best song, although like the rest of the album, someone should have turned off the studio tape halfway through the band's performance. Way too long and tedious. And if Noel is one of the richest musicians in England, can't he afford some cleaner production?"
0,"Dissapointing When I heard the Morning Glory I was expecting a great third album but....No!. This album shows no evolution in the music of Oasis and is like they want to sound the same in every song. The tracks are boring, the voice of Liam really makes you sleep, the guitar tones never change except in the acoustic tracks. The bass and the drums play a small role in this record. I hope Oasis think about it, and don't think about a ""Definetly Maybe Part 4"" for their next record."
0,"Get over yourselves, please. The Gallagher bros. are so full of themselves that they subject their fans to this mess of rehashed 70's rock. Every tune here is about 20 minutes long- if you would dig an entire album of ""Hey Jude"" and ""You Can't Always Get..."" here it is. Oasis' lyrics have always been pretty throwaway but here they are banally Hallmark. ""All around the world/ tell 'em what ya heard"" is as deep as they get here. Check out the Unplugged bootleg to appreciate Oasis without Noel's mosquito whine voice and forget this bloated joke."

0,Seriously Overrated Album Turned Telephone Commercial!!! Oasis arrogance is way out of proportion to their actual talent which is miniscule. If you want something real buy any album from The Beatles or the Beach Boys. This is music for people that get excited about strip malls.
0,"Go away, dog The book ""Go away, Dog"" by author Joan L. Nodset and pictures by Paul Meisel is teaching children to mean to dogs. For example, page 5 yells at the dog saying ""Go away, you bad old dog. The author should be teaching kids to be nice to animals. This book should be banded from the children's book store."
0,"Enjoy The Retirement Billy! I used to wish Billy would go back to his bread and butter and record another pop/rock album. Forget about the classical stuff and go back to what made him what he became - one of the best songwriters to come out of the 70's. And to not let the forgettable River Of Dreams album be his last say on the pop/rock world. But after hearing this rubbish, I hope Billy stays building motorcycles, and cruising around in his boats. This single may just be the most boring bland thing he has ever done, and after the mixed bag of his last three studio albums (Bridge, Storm Front, ROD) that's saying something.When dealing with Joel your best bet will always be his classic period 1976 (Turnstiles) to 1982( The Nylon Curtain) everything else is very hit and miss."
0,Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh maybe zero stars What happens with Billy? It is the age what it has affected? Why it wants to be the cartoon of Sinatra?Honestly I continue waiting the return of great pop rock or good new wave rock of Glass Houses! But Billy sadly very sadly your music is made for old man's lovers of Sinatra. Argggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"The book that went Bad This book was not very interesting at all it did not capture my atention in any way. Although I read the whole book it was very dull there is no paspizazz, action , the details where not realistic. At the begining when steven's cousin was killed the book became opaque. Because the book started right after the boy was killed. Steven got sent to a military acedamy and was sent to live with his father. Know lets skip to the middle of the book he saw the adam bomb go off. he was in the fire of the bomb why didn't he die. Next the child went to see his friend Alexie who he fins out that he is an undercover spies for the war. Know when Steven was running away from alexie why didn't he have a gun if he has been trained by the army."

0,Psychology 4 Edition worst experice ever trying to buy this book for my class. I never received the book in the first place. The seller hardly ever contacted me back. The first time he did was about a week or 2 after i emailed him. I did the a-z gurantee refund. I never seen that money either. I usually purchase all my books here and this time was extremly horrible!
0,"Pseudo scientific mumbo jumbo This book is a strange mix of some sound nutritional advice mixed in with a load of pseudo scientific mumbo jumbo.As with most pseudo scientific works, it makes sweeping assertions without bothering to offer any backup.If you are not well versed in either science or nutrition, it's likely that you won't be able to distinguish the good advice from the waffleIf you know even a little about science, you'll probably get quickly irritated with all the gibberish in this bookIf this is supposed to be a book about good diet, then why the authors take such an anti-vegetarianism hard line is difficult to fathom.It's virtually an established fact that vegetarian diets and low meat consumption diets are far healthier than the average Western diet.When it's so apparent that the authors are clueless about science, I guess you can't expect any better.My advice is to give this book a miss and read a good book about nutrition.I'd recommend Patrick Holford's Optimum Nutrition Bible."
0,"Stilted dialogue, one-dimensional characters I could not finish this book. Unlike the other reviewers, I was not the least bit impressed by the quality of the writing. The dialogue was stilted and the characters were one-dimensional. Save your money. Read Mike Tidwell's Ponds of Kalambayi if you're interested in a Peace Corps novel set in Africa. Tidwell's book is everything that The Road Builder is not."

0,"A waste of time Please don't waste your money or time on this book. Sure, it might make some people feel good, but it does it at the expense of their brains. In the intro he mentions 325 ad. He is referring to the Council of Nicea - which omitted certain gnostic writings from the Bible - oh, like the one in which Jesus had to remove Mary's imperfection- so he changed her into a man. The author evidently has a problem with the Council's actions. I would say more, but it all would be about the same. If you just have to spend your money on something, choose a good charity."
0,"What does Isaiah have to do with this? This nonsensical book has precious little to do with Isaiah, making very little mention of Isaiah while dragging the reader from Tibet to Hopis in Arizona. Braden's baloney name-drops quantum physics, a subject matter that, clearly, he does not begin to understand but does know how to exploit for his mush-minded readers. What Braden also understands is the mindset of so many irrational readers who are positively triggered by words such as ""Decoding,"" ""lost,"" ""science,"" ""prayer,"" and ""prophecy."" Combining all of these trigger words into one book title evidences Braden's marketing savvy, attracting the ignorant and the neurotic into a mire of mystery and mishmash. Even the brilliant writings of Carl Sagan do little to educate people away from irrational and pseudoscientific gobbledygook such as is displayed in this silly, silly book."

0,"Odd I called Barry Farm and spoke with two women to find out if there is any possible gluten contamination with the beans. Neither knew if the beans could have gluten on them because they are from a supplier and don't actually grow them. When I asked who the supplier was she rather curtly said, ""I will not give out the names of my suppliers"". I found that odd, on so many levels, and wondered if her suppliers are in China. A company has never refused to give me their supplier before. The best part was telling me I could wash the gluten off when I rinsed the beans. Due to all the recall mania, I am not willing to gamble my family's health. Anyone else wondering what they do grow at Barry Farm? The whole thing left me with the heebie-jeebies."

0,"Review of Chi Running I thought this book was pretty much a waste of time. A good friend of mine who is a practitioner of Chinese medicine recommended the book to me because he knows I'm a runner. He told me a little bit of what the book talks about before I bought it. Honestly, I got more out of that conversation about the book than I got out of the book itself. Turns out, I already practice ""chi-running."" The basic idea is to be aware of your breathing and your body while you run and work on having good form. Yeah, thanks, I learned that in high school cross country, except without the unnecessary baggage of eastern philosophy that Dreyer packages with the obvious running advice he gives."
0,"Disappointed After reading the many positive reviews and endorsements for this book, I anticipated something more thorough and more polished. The book is highly repetitive (the same amount of material might easily have been covered in 40 pages), it lacks organization, the author invents words which have no meaning (""instate"" as a verb, anyone?), and the typeset is HORRIBLE.The author has some good ideas. Let's hear them.....coherently."
0,"Why is the Kindle version more expensive than the paperback? I enjoy reading on my Kindle, I would rather have all of my reading content on it. I like seeing new titles come out on it, so I was very pleased to see this book that I looked at availble. Until I saw that it was more than if I ordered the paper back.What are the publishers thinking? Does their greed know no bounds? They have no print set up or fees, no storage fees, no shipping fees and yet they are going to raise the price up for the same digital copy that they sent to the press? Did they somehow grab the music industry's winning PR notebook?While I want this book I am not supporting the publishing company's short-sighted and greedy take on what they think a digital copy should cost. Amazon had it right when they launched the Kindle $9.99 for hot sellers, yeah I can get behind that but I can't get behind what the publishers strong armed Amazon into."

0,"Not worth the time I checked this book out from my local La Leche League. I'm surprised they still have this book available. Being nearly twenty years old, maybe some of my problems are with it being outdated. However, my main gripe is that it is very condescending and judgmental. Instead of just informing you on different options (none of which would work for me and only one or so that would apply well to a full time job) this book presents a certain ideal and if the job arrangements do not fit that ideal, they're not good arrangements and you aren't a good mother. If you want helpful, non-opinionated advice, this is not the book for you. Currently I'm reading ""The Working Mother's Guide to Life"" which seems much more friendly and helpful."

0,"They could learn from Mars Volta Okay....with the break up of ATDI, It is pretty obvious that all the talent went to The Mars Volta. These guys don't suck. They are just boring. They sound like every other band I have heard before that is out there making music with no uniqueness really. People think just because they can play an instrument that they can get a deal and start a band. This is what Sparta did just like all the other 500 bands in the industry who all sound exactly alike. The MArs Volta has tried new things and these new things have separated them from the 500 other bands. Like Tool, Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, And Queen...Mars Volta tried something different, which has gained them a great amount of respect. Sparta? I can name a million other bands similar."
0,"Cheap Plastic Design - Breaks Easily I have flowen model rockets for over 40 years now, and the parachutes that Estes is making currently are an embarassment to the company! They are made of cheap plastic instead of nylon. The plastic often tears away from the cloth cords, and the cords tangle easily. Added to these problems, the chute often does not fully deploy if the plastic chute is not powdered to make it less ""sticky"". And forget about launching in cold temperatures as the plastic has a ""memory"" and often fails to open in cold weather.Estes plastic parachutes, no matter what size, are a disaster to be avoided. Pay la little more money for a nylon parachute and it will last as long as the rocket.Jim Konedog Koenig"

0,"Barely Better Than The Previous Version I had my Creative Zen Vision for all of about 3 hours. Having previously owned a 20GB Creative Zen Portable Media Center and being completely unsatisfied with it I was really hoping that Creative had gone the extra mile and learned from their past effort. Well, 3 hours into things I discovered they did a few things right but one thing horribly wrong. The screen quality is just plain awful. If people are finding a decent angle at which to hold their's then that's great, I couldn't find one at all. You'll spend more time fidgeting, trying to find an optimum angle than you'll ever spend actually enjoying a movie on the thing. It's simply a cheap lousy screen.The rest of the unit is fine. The construction is solid, the interface very easy to use (though the included software isn't all that great), and even the sound is pretty good - but let's face it, we buy these things to watch movies on and if they can't handle that then what good are they?"
0,"hello kitty is better Oh dear. If 7 brides for 7 brothers is one of your favorite movies then by all means buy 8 women which is equally silly. Life is Weird and so is this film directed by Francois Ozon who should have been kicked out of the academy for this one. Arnaud De Moleron, the set director, should never be employed again. The set is so ugly is steals attention away from the silly action and songs in film. Fanny Ardant is beginning to look quite piggy in the face although her figure is still fine. If the intention was to make a movie in the vein of 1950s Hollywood drama/musical this film fails on all accounts. Unless you are a die hard fan of someone in the film don't waste your money."
0,"Awful I dozed off part way through the film and then after watching another ten minutes just turned off the DVD player. The film seems to be aiming to be a comedy, but fails utterly. It can not be anything else except for a very weak (dark) comedy."

0,SEE 8 1/2 WOMEN INSTEAD Imagine getting snowbound in a cabin with 8 WOMEN (Universal) and a dead body and then have to witness each woman sing and dance (badly) as they tell their story. Who dunnit? Who cares! A whopping French dud. See 8 1/2 women instead.
0,"Oh no - I had to end it! I agree with the others that gave it one star. I was expecting a much different movie. It was trying to be different, quirky, and funny and it was none of these things. I did not care about the characters because there was nothing of substance to care about. I realize it was a comedy that was supposed to be light and funny, but it did not make me laugh, in fact I was cringing at the performances especially the established older actresses. The songs were awful or maybe it was the bad singing and choreography. I am no movie critic and so if you want to risk the money be my guest. But, I rarely turn off a movie half way through and this I had to - booorrrrrinnnggg!"
0,"As bad as Moulin Rouge As a non-traditional student (having taught French for over 20 years before returning to graduate work)pursuing a doctorate in French, I`ve seen a lot of fine French films. 8 Femmes isn`t one of them. For a charming musical, for example, see Sous les toits de Paris directed by Rene Clair in the early 1930`s. The forgettable songs in 8 Femmes are stiffly rendered by actresses who can`t sing and can`t dance. The drama of the murder plot is oddly juxtaposed against giddy females singing about, well, who knows what? The songs are not organic to the movie, just added on at odd intervals so each of the eight ladies gets a chance to demonstrate her non-talent. Where is Ginger Rogers when you need her? And you need a score card to keep track of all the ladies who are in reality lesbians. The scene with Fanny Ardant on top of Catherine Deneuve was, well, beyond words. Kindly run, do not walk, to the nearest exit."
0,more than bad this is for sure the badest and most boring film i have ever seen (i swear).8 women in one room for more than 5 minutes is by far too much.and everybody has to sing a chanson.this is horrible !
0,"Femme Fatales or Very Lame? Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid."
0,"This is a classic? I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful."
0,"Go with Sony instead with regards to sound, this is a very good headsetThe noise cancelling features are very good ---- unfortunately, the 'phones suffer from discomfort and priceI compared these headphones, head to head, on an airplane, against the Sony MDR NC20, and there was no difference in sound - both performed excellently, and equally, within the airplane environment ---- however, the Sony ones were more comfortable and MUCH cheaperDon't even waster your time with the Bose Quite Comfort ---- grab a pair of the Sony's and you'll fall in love!"
0,"no highs, no lows, must be bose ... but worse, no quality headphones need to withstand at least some not so ideal conditions. my AKGs and Sennheisers have survived more than 25 respectively 15 years of use. sometimes they got dropped or i fell asleep while wearing them. and they still serve me well 'til this day and still sound perfect. not so the Bose set i bought in 2004. in 2005 the plastic parts holding the ear pieces to the frame broke. i fixed them on one side just to see them break on the other. then the plastic skin covering the foam padding started to come off. apart from being annoying, the chemical stench coming from the foam was sickening. i gave up on repairing the set and just recently tossed it in the trash bin promising myself never to touch Bose, ever, ever again. i am happy with a cheap Koss set now that at a fraction of the price sounds about as good and it still works."
0,"worst investment Paid $300.00 for these about 5 years ago. After about 2 years of light use the ear pad vinyl fell apart and the head bar rubber padding became very sticky, comes off on your fingers and gets on everything. The replacement ear pads don't fit into the frame well and come out easily. The overall quality of sound and durability was very disappointing. I found several over-the-ear clip ear phones for under $10.00 to be superior in every way, including comfort, quality stereo, and I can use these cheaper ear phones when I'm sweating/exercising: don't try that with the Bose headphones! The Bose headphones didn't really cancel ambient noise. I don't use them anymore."
0,"Short in headphones There's a short in the Bose headphones I bought from this vendor, and I'm going to have to have them fixed. I'm not particularly happy. The headphones work well in the short periods when I can actually hear through them."
0,"Poor Plastic Quality - Brakes Easily The sound quality is pretty good and battery life OK but the quality of the plastic used is REALLY poor, the structure complex and fragile. The head-band brakets will brake where it encloses the size adjustment ""sliders"". When that happens the headphone comes loose and the headset is unusable. The peace of plastic could be sold for a few dollars for a quick fix but in fact you have to get through the repair cycle nightmare and it costs a lot ... not a good deal, I am now looking for something different I can use while sleeping on the plane!"
0,"Good but shoddy! The noise canceling feature works well and the sound is good. However, the cheap plastic they are made of breaks easily. First one side broke but I managed to tape it together. Then the other side broke and was not fixable. You would think that something so expensive would be more durable!"
0,"There's much better out there, people! Tried one of these in a Bose store, oh my God it was a joke. Drums sounded muddy and boomy at the same time, highs were shrill and unnatural, and voices sounded completely hollow.The Sennheiser PXC-300, at 2/3rds of this Bose's price, blows it out of the water in all departments: noise cancellation, physical comfort, and most of all, SOUND QUALITY.Me, I'm no hoity-toity ""audiophile""---but I do have friends who are audiophiles, and they do plenty of headphone listening, contrary to the previous reviewer. In fact, many audiophiles will tell you that a two hundred dollar pair of quality headphones can easily surpass the sound quality of a two thousand dollar pair of speakers!To be fair these Bose headphones sound slightly better than the under-100 dollar competition by Sony and Phillips. But compared to my Sennheisers at 2/3rds of the price, they're toast."
0,"Save your money! My rating is not a reflection of the greatness of Cream, rather a forewarning to prospective buyers of this compilation. Before purchasing this compilation, consider that there is a vastly better one available for near the same price! ""The Very Best of Cream"" features all of the tracks presented ""Strange Brew"", an additional 8 tracks, and more extensive liner notes. Also ""The Very Best of Cream"", released in 1995, was the first Cream best of to be released exclusively on CD, and is mastered using Apogee's UV22 encoding that vastly improves the sound quality of the original songs, and the songs on this album. Save your money and get it instead!"
0,"Only 1 thing even slightly remarkable Okay, I knew going into this CD that it'd be heavily rap influenced after hearing Stick Em Up. I was extremely disappointed. It's basically all rap. They just get some people who are not even listed as part of the band to play an occasional riff on the guitar or provide background bass. The only thing that made this CD worth it was ""tarfur."" it's supposedly the first rap song written entirely in Icelandic. However, Quarashi makes Limp Bizkit sound like Metallica, Quarashi is so heavily rap. I wouldn't recommend it, cuz they're not even very good MCs. I picked it up for 10 bucks, but I wouldn't pay any more for it if I were you."

0,"Did I mention tedious...? Boring, snoring, not in the least alluring...obvious, sophomoric and terribly uninteresting...Oh yes, and did I mention tedious ? I'm sorry, but this book was torture from beginning to end (in my humble opinion). With a background in both Classics and Religion (to some degree) I very much looked forward to reading this book & liking it. There is just something about CSL's writing(s)that does not resonate with me, and I cannot say exactly what. I've read other works by him & felt much the same way afterwards. Perserverance is not always a good or noble thing I suppose, as the time spent reading this book could have been better used in more enlightening pursuits.Similar sentiments have been expressed to much greater effect (for me)in a number ofplaces...from the Bible to the classics to poetry, music, opera etc. *JTQ"
0,"A REVIEW OF TILL WE HAVE FACES A MYTH RETOLD Sadly , and with great disapointment. If i am honest i will have to say that this is the most boring and awful book i have ever read. Like the last commenter i had to put it down well before the end. the title should read ""a truely boring book""i am an avid reader. I love the classics. but this has nothing in common with the real myth and the book is distressing. i found myself wanting to slash my wrists because it was such an awful and boring hysterical book that never takes off. I kept reading because of the comments of other readers. However i could not carry on and had to put this book down. I dont think i have ever read such a boring and moronic text."
0,Incredible book. Kindle edition has LOTS of typos I have read many of Lewis' books and this one outdoes the power of Perelandra. other reviews will give you some of that flavor. The content is five stars; the Kindle edition is so sloppily done that it goes past a mere annoyance to sometimes interfering with what CSL was communicating. Needs a proofreader and a re-release available free to previous purchasers (like me).
0,"Great Concept - Lousy Product I purchased two of these little lights several months ago. The concept and operation was terrific, but within a week one of the LEDs on one of them went out and then the whole unit started flickering badly. I e-mailed Datexx about a replacement and they have ignored me.I don't recommend this product. Datexx chosing a lousy Chinese manufacturer is a mistake anyone could make, but ignoring a customer with a problem is unforgivable."

With excitement, I sampled all the songs and to my disappointment, I still can't figure out what the hit was suppose to be. It's really terrible so don't bother. Just stick to their old stuff. Their 80's stuff rocks!!"
0,"I should like it but I don't I would like to think that I am always supportive of Australian talent, but in this case I am not. This book is highly impractical in the main. I mean really, who could devote 7 days to working on a magickal new self. It's a lovely idea, but just so self-centred. The amount of money you would have to spend to fossick around for all the bits and pieces she says you need, urgh you'd need a lie down after that. Ok so she sort of redeems herself at the end with a small section on what to do if you don't have the time, but it's a token chapter.The other thing is that most of the text appears to have been borrowed form her other publications, and the picture on the front, whilst very cutesy, she is a pretty lass after all, is a real-turn off to a serious Wiccan practitioner.Sorry Fiona, not a great buy or unique read."
0,"What a rip off I order alot of merchandise from Amazon. But will have real reservations about doing so again. This product I did not realize was not from Amazon and so difficult to return I said lesson learned and kept it. But I will think long and hard about using Amazon again. This product was marked with a sticker that said $0.75 I was charged $3 something and then $3 something for delivery and that was suppose to be free. So I paid $7 dollars for a $.075 book. Not happy next Christmas I will just hit the stores and remember this expierence. Before I told friends Amozon is great so guick and easy , now I say watch out what you are getting some things are a real rip off."
0,"Problem with 2nd disc Like other reviewers, I had the same problem with the second disc. I sent it back not ONCE but TWICE, so in all I tried 3 copies of the movie, and the second disc still would not work on any copy.

0,It sucked go see War of the Worlds instead. A lot of people told me that Batman Begins was good but I didn't like it. The first hour was too long and slow without Batman and it was all about Bruce Wayne training to becoming Batman and Batman did not show till the last hour. I'm not really a big fan of Liam Neeson though he's boring but what's really the point of this Batman movie there's nothing exciting about it. It really wasn't surprising to me. Christian Bale did make an excellent Batman and his voice really fitted as Batman but the whole movie was just not good. Wait for the DVD don't see it in theater. That's all I have to say. I thought War of the Worlds was better than Batman. Batman Begins really sucked.
0,"I'm astounded at the ratings. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! Terrible acting, storyline and special effects! I actually threw it out. It makes Kilmer's/Clooney's versions look good and Keaton's looks like masterpieces!"
0,"A Bore I watched this movie when it first came out and thought it was really boring and disappointing. I generally like Katie Holmes and think she was fine in the movie, but Christian Bale was lousy and so was the plot and direction of this movie. If you just want to see a series of technical movie stunts followed by a few mildly romantic scenes surrounding a plethora of neurotic, self-absorbed dialogue, psychosis, and horrible directing, then you might be interested in watching this movie."

The action, the characters, the acting, the dialouge......it was all bleh. Sure, it may be the best Batman movie, but that's not saying much at all. The talk was that this was going to be a dark and realistic movie. I just saw it as another silly superhero fare. I guess I just don't like superheroes. If you want an interesting and dark action flick, check out the Bourne series. Batman is just for little kids and comic book fans."

0,"Terrible quality streaming video!! Don't waste your time or money. The movie quality is very fuzzy, that is, when it does play because it buffers and stops constantly. I have a cable modem and do not have this problem with YouTube or Netflix. I reported this problem to Amazon and they gave me a $5.00 credit, but that was over a year ago and the problem is still there. I'm going out to get the DVD of this now."

0,"Use your money on something else! My 2 and 1/2 year old loves Bob, so he played with this for a little while. Tired of it quickly, as the magnets are not strong enough to hold blocks together to have any real pretend play. Seriously, every time he tries to open the door for Bob, the whole house falls down. The blocks are so light weight that his wooden block set is more fun to build a house with. Buy the Bob the Builder lego set and stay away from this set!"
0,Poorly Made My 2 1/2 year old boy is obessed with Bob the Builder and construction. These blocks are junk. The magnets hardly hold the bricks together. Not enough pieces to make anything. Very poorly designed. Roof pieces will not stay attached. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"Really - Read the reviews. I read the reviews and still bought this and the shed for my bob the builder fan. This stuff really is terrible. My son wanted over and over to build the house as shown on the box - it can't be done.You just can't build anything - not even the face of a house. Not even because the magnets do not hold but because there aren't the right shape bricks.He uses the bricks now as Skip's load but surely there are cheaper things for Skip to cart around! Also the Bob the Builder Shed is terrible - I super glued it together in the end as if you just touched it, it fell apart. The vehicles and die cast characters are A+++ but the other stuff is utter rubbish. Get Wendy and Bob on e-bay!"
0,"Lacks Safety, Durability Issue 1 - The magnets are not secure. One piece ( a yellow sign, came apart and the magnet fell out. Either of my children (age 29 months and 7.5 months) could have choked on the small magnet.Issue 2 - The idea of magnetic blocks sounded great. After attempting to play eith them, my 2 year was a little frustrated, as was I. We couldn't build much. He has found it easiest to lay the pieces end to end and make lines, not buildings. It doesn't leave much room for creative play."
0,"Choking Hazard Beware! My Daughter pulled apart the ""tree trunk"" that came with this set and the tiny magnets inside fell out along with very small plastic parts. She is almost four but still put the ""candy"" in her mouth. We ended up spending half the day getting her checked out and now must watch her and her brother to make sure they did not swallow a magnet (one magnet is missing). she is not generally rough on her toys and this came apart way too easily. So if you have children under @ 6, beware. Only let them have this if you are right there with them at all times. If I hadn't been right there my child could have died."
0,"Rod Stewart And The Faces: In Concert This DVD of Rod Stewart and The Faces In Concert is a total BOOTLEG. The cover is with Ronnie Lane who was not in the band during the recording of this concert. This DVD is the final concert with Keith Richards. I'm sick and tired of companies putting out concerts with different covers of the same ones you already have. It's like bait and switch. And I am a number one Faces fan and this is a load of BS. And for those looking at the Rod Stewart and the Faces: Live In London, this DVD is the DVD featuring Keith Richards in his final concert, different cover. And honestly, this is the weakest show of the Faces I have ever seen because of Tetsu. You cannot even hear his bass in this DVD. I have a bootleg of this DVD that's a better quality than this one. Please do not put money in the pocket of this company, the only good thing about this is the cover.Yours truly,Number One Faces Freak."
0,"NOT for Trek Mountain Bikes I just received this stand and went to try it on my Trek 4500 and did not fit, not only did it not fit, but put some scratched on my bike :o(. So now I'm stuck with this stand that will most likely not do anything for me. It's not worth returning it. I paid $8.49 for the stand and the same for shipping. $16.98 total. It will cost me about $5 to ship it back so I will only get $3 back after it's all said and done which to me is not worth it.If you plan on using this on a Trek Mountain bike look elsewhere, it will not fit and will scratch it. :o("

0,"1*2*3* Rent, Don't Buy This Canker-Blossom 1 Star for the DVD, 2 for the director, 3 for the cast: I originally saw this for a Shakespeare in film class at U.C. Berkeley 20 years ago, and it's a ashamed that copy wasn't borrowed for this transfer. But even a clean copy wouldn't help this poorly edited ""art"" film. Hall was definitely trying to aspire to arty French and Italian films of the time, but it doesn't work. As for the acting, the women are great - the men cardboard. Helen Mirren's first major film role as Hermia is fun to watch as is Diana Rigg's Helena. It's also pretty fun to see a 35-year-old Judi Dench as the bare-breasted Titania. Ian Holm is way over the top as Puck and a future playing villians is apparent when you see David Warner's attempt as the fair hero and lover. Mirren's second romp in the forest as Titania in the 1981 BBC production is far superior. Buy that one, then rent this to compare the two for fun."

0,"The iSkin stretches w/in a 2-3 month period I LOVED the iSkin for the first 2 months. Then, it stretches, bubbles over the keys, and doesn't give a good fit. I'm very disappointed. The Apple Store has returned mine a couple of times now and have deduced it just gets heated and stretches. They will take it back now and offer a store credit. I would love a skin that works."
0,Disappointing fit I was really looking forward to using this product given how pleased I have been with the iSkin covers for both of my iPods. The iSkin cover for the MacBook Pro does not fit well over the keyboard and as another reviewer mentioned it makes the keys hard to read. I plan on returning this keyboard protector.
0,You get what you pay for. One of my Pioneer speakers broke so I took the cheapest path and bought Jensen. I should have known better. The magnet on the Jensen is 1/3 the size of the one it was replacing. I installed the one speaker and before I installed the second one I decided to try it out. Not only did it sound terrible but it blew within five minutes. Keep in mind that I have a standard Kenwood 40x4 head unit without any extra amp and I had it turned up up about three quarters. This speaker is week and as I stated in the title you get what you pay for.
0,"a disappointment I heard so much about this book but it has so little. Pseudo-intellectual language, undeveloped characters, a few nice parts. Not at all what I expected, and not particularly sexy."
0,"This book holds few ""charms"" I was vastly disappointed with this novel. I had read and admired ""Ellen Foster"" and was optimistic when ""Charms"" was selected by my book club. Unfortunately, the plot was facile, superficial, and unbelievable -- a fairytale with pretensions to reality. The characters were stereotypes, drawn with the broadest brushtrokes, with no remotely ""human"" qualities. What qualities they did have were repellent, a trio of do-gooders with no compassion for human failings other than their own. In short, I found this novel insultingly smug and sanctimonious, the kind of novel that gives Southern literature a bad name."
0,BAD: DONT READ!!! I had to read this book for my school's reading list. It was by far the worst book that I have ever read. There was no plot at all. All of my friends also thought that it was bad. Even some of my friend's parents thought so too!! My final word is DONT READ IT!!

0,"Not for everyone's skin After I started working out, watching my diet, purchasing Delfin Spa shorts, I thought this would be the final step in getting rid of any stubborn cellulite before bathing suit season began. I purchased this for $27 (not including shipping). At the end of one week, I have a rash that's spread from my ankles to the top of my thighs, my upper arms, my chest and part of my abdomen. It looks and feels like I've been attacked by a million red ants. After a day, symptoms got worse. Never having any skin problems like this before, I went to the clinic. After $64 for the visit, $62 in prescriptions, I am now going to be on 10 pills a day for the next 14 days to get this cleared up. To boot, sweat isn't allowed, so no working out either. My lesson: STICK WITH THE TREADMILL, and use the money on a personal trainer. And my advice - try the Delfin Spa shorts and a run if you're trying to get rid of cellulite. They're cheaper and they actually work."

Loud, no real meaning,and they are not really all that fun either so i dont get it, it looks like because they mention Sex that means they are good? Wrong, they suck bigtime and there is no talent here and they are not saying anything here that hasn't been already said many many times, save your money"
0,"No SACD !!! Don't bother buying with this one... This US release was supposed to be like the UK release and include a hybrid SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc) as well as the DVD. It does not. The SACD has been replaced by a regular CD. Extremely disappointing ! I'll be purchasing the UK release instead...According to Mute's Head of Catalogue, David Rowntree, Mute commissioned Simon Heyworth's Super Audio Mastering facility to perform the critical re-mastering work for this album. Quote: ""The SA-CD versions take the sound to another level - the next best thing to being there!"". ""If you don't have an SA-CD player, DTS 96/24 is the next best thing.""He doesn't even mention the 44.1 kHz PCM audio of the CD version, which evidently, most of you are listening to.(A digital audio technology which is now 24 years old, by the way. Hey, maybe they will issue the US release on 8-track cartridge too)."
0,"Buy the import version instead For whatever reason, Rhino decided to leave off the SACD layer of all three U.S. Depeche Mode re-releases, which is a real shame. If you have an SACD set-up, the audio quality of the import versions is noticeably better (especially on ""Speak & Spell""). Plus the DVD is region free, so the import video will still play in your PC or Mac (although it will not play on your TV, unless you have a DVD player that can convert PAL to NTSC). I highly recommend sending Rhino a message that selling watered-down versions in the U.S. is unacceptable, by purchasing the Mute label import version instead (all three of which are outstanding)."
0,amp Dont buy this if you want good sound and power! worthless to me for my use! Didn't work worth a DAMN!
0,"Piece of Junk!!! Upon the third use, I started having the same problem as all the other 1-star people. The problem is with the auto input line sensing circuitry. Even with the auto-sensing switch in manual, the auto-sensing circuitry engages and disengages after every dynamic passage on a center channel home theater setup. When it engages and disengages the sound coming from the speaker connected to the amp also engages and disengages. I just ordered the Niles Audio SI-2125 to replace this piece of junk. Thanks Amazon for picking up the return shipping!"
0,"functional but nasty click Works, but nasty click from the speakers when power on or off. What is the point of auto-on if you have to walk up to the box to turn up the volume afterwards? Company phone rings forever, so support is non existant. At least this amplifier is cheap, but of course there is a reason."
0,"Caught on fire after about 24 hours of use. After setting up and testing for about 24 hours over a period of a week, it went up in smoke!.I hate to think what would have happened if I hadn't been there. In this age this should NEVER happen!"
0,"This is junk This AMP is junk. First one burnt out within 2 weeks of running a pair of 8"" Audiosource ceiling speakers. Audiosource seems good so far, replace the first bad unit. Got the second one, smoked the second day. Same scenario - running background music in small house.Potential fire hazard, as it not only blows the fuse, but also heats up and smokes inside.Look elsewhere."
0,"WARNING - caught fire! Wow, pinch me is it really 2011 and we still have consumer electronics catching fire? Where is CE, UL, BS when you need them?Fortuitously I was next to the amp when the wisps of smoke started, followed by a crackling fire. The amp as spec'ed is decent and worked fine - until it decided to self-combust. The real concern is that this is configured as an 'auto-on' device, so it switches itself on when it receives an audio signal on the line-in: this means it is often going to be put somewhere out of the way and unnoticed - and that makes it a REAL fire hazard (as in 'burning the house down' hazard).So if i could give is a zero or negative star it would be duly awarded. Since now at least three reviews have indicated there is a real fire hazard, Amazon need to look carefully at what they are offering."
0,"Horrible Audio, No Teaching These other reviewers are kidding you.There are significant problems with this dvd.1. The audio on this dvd is horrible. It sounds like they are talking and singing through a tube. I could have done better in my garage.2. The tracks are: all the singing and stories in english, or the same program in Mandarin. There is no teaching whatsoever.I realize there are not many dvd's for teaching children Mandarin, however there are a few better than this."

0,"looks good but doesnt work as great the monitor looks really cool on the hand while cycling or at the gym... however due to its design, it does not provide accurate readings. the finger has to be in a specific position with the sensor and that too without movement if it has to be anywhere close to accurate.

0,"Overrated One would think that when spending nearly $200 that is claimed for a book that is claimed to be the be all and end of all courses on its subject it would have at the very least been carefully edited. What you get are two looseleafs into which you insert several hundred typed pages that are replete with spelling and grammatical errors. And, while there is useable material here, you are paying $197 for a thinly veiled manual of huckstering numerous software programs which either pay Internet Market Center commissions or that they own outright. Much of this software is buggy, troublesome and poorly supported, and for the most part much better can be found elsewhere. Same for this so-called course. There is much better out there for much less. Among the numerous worthwhile sources of material are Webonomics, and Make Your Site Sell. Avoid this one despite what IMC's shills want you to believe with their rave reviews."

0,Did Nothing I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
0,"Tastes like sweaty gym socks I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me."
0,"really disappointed though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed. i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results. the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes. still nothing.i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck. i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did"
0,"Another mystery series in decline This will be my last M.C. Beaton mystery. Maybe the author is burned out and no longer has the energy to set up a scene (description of how the character got to that scene, what was the weather like, the set up that makes the reader feel he's right there with that character). This lack of atmosphere/setting seems to be very similar to Lilian Jackson Braun's latest books. I can deal with sloppy proofreading (not too happily) but I'd sure like to have some help in mentally picturing the characters moving about instead of reading mostly dialogue. I agree with many of the other reviews in that it's also a shame that Agatha has not developed one bit and that a lot of the humor has been replaced with nastiness. My suggestion to anyone who has not read an M.C. Beaton book (either the Hamish or Agatha series) is to start at the beginning and enjoy her earlier works."
0,"Much duller than I had predicted The journal of a monk, Matthew Perry, was preserved, translated,and chopped up. Some pieces were then placed in a book for publication. Disjointed, obscure in many instances and almost impossible to read without a reference library close at hand, The Illustrated Chronicles.., is a chore to comprehend with little reward for your effort. Advertised as some kind of entertaining historical memoir, it is anything but. Not for most and definetely not for me."
0,"[not good]! What happened? I thought the first two were classics but this was just plain [not good]. RoboCop's fight with the samurai toward the end was OK, but did not save this movie from being terrible. If you want something real entertaining then pick up Die Hard, all the James Bond films, both Terminator films and the first two RoboCop films. They are more worth your time and money than this."
0,"Just Plain Awful The first and second Robocop films were great. I loved the over-the-top action and humor elements in both films.Robocop 3 is a pure, unadulterated disaster. First off, it is way too tame (a PG-13 rating??!!). Second, the ""plot"" is completely ruined by the introduction of the ""cute little kid who is a computer whiz"" character, what a travesty! Third, the movie is actually boring; a boring Robocop movie! I could go on and on, but why bother.They dare to put this garbage on DVD?"
0,"Junk When a movie has dialogue like, ""I thought your ninja was supposed to take care of RoboCop!"", it ain't gonna be Citizen Kane. It won't even be a good RoboCop movie. But if you must indulge, look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies. Yes, I said look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies."
0,"Robocop 3- Protect the innocent from this movie!! ""Ahh finally, robocop 3"" was the first thought that popped up in my mind as I sat down in my room to watch the movie. I loved the two first movies (Peter Weller is awsome as Murphy/Robocop) and I was really excited to see him in action again, wearing the metal plated armour suit... But wait a minute? What is this? No Peter Weller? Damn, well hope I live through this... I barely came out alive of my room that night...This is perhaps one of (maybe the worst) ""3rd movie in a series of good movies""-films I have ever encountered... The Plot is bad,probably written by a five-year old child, the actors disgusts me, reminds me of bad soap-opera acting, and the whole thing smells like a movie for children... I can only say one thing about this movie: If you love Robocop 1 & 2 and have no experience with this movie, well, do not see it, okay?! It will ruin your life... It has ruined mine..."
0,Oh man! What a crap film this is!Some films are so bad that they are funny. This isn't one of them. It's just plain bad.I have nothing more to say on the subject cept make sure that your holding a loaded gun to your head before you start watching this film.That way you can put yourself out of your misery in the fastest possible way.
0,"Robocop becomes Aerocop! Whoa!! A flying robocop with the strings attached and all. No way man, this one bombs. And where's Peter Weller? The dude IS Robocop!!! Cheesy movies I can handle, but this one's going moldy. Time for Robocop III to catch a wave. See yah!"
0,Why they did this Robocop 3 has to be the worst possible movie in the series. While the first and the second had great humour and quite gory action sequenses the third installment hasn't got any of the critsism against the corporate world and the plot of the movie is simply rubbish .The film is made for kids and the flying Robocop just makes you wanna cry .I gave one star just because Basil Poledouris great theme is back from the first film.
0,"Lead in for TV Series and lame tv movies This movie must have been made as a pilot for the series that followed. This would explain the lack of wit and social commentary as well as the toning down of the violence. This movie had a serious continuity problem. Nobody seems to have noticed that in the first two movies Robocop had a son, yet in the 3rd movie during the flashbacks he had a daughter. This was truly a bad sequel."
0,"I cant believe I'm reviewing this. This movie is so tasteless, that it scares me that even one person gave it a good review.

0,"Very Disappointing Oh dear, this was such a disappointment. Diana Ackerman spends too much time in pointless shots (looking a river; admiring her own photos from childhood) and has produced a NOVA series that seriously misses the mark. Too little science, too much irrelevant material. While one can certainly connect art and human experience with scientific knowledge about how the brain works, this series didn't do so successfully. If you were hoping to reveal the wonder of the senses for your students, do not buy this series. Unfortunately, I ordered it through an affiliated store with Amazon and they won't answer my queries about whether/how I can return it."

0,"GOT IT BUT.... GOT IT ON TIME BUT....TAPE WAS SCRATCHY AND HARD TO WATCH. IT LOOKED LIKE THE TRACKING WAS OFF SO I TRIED TO ADJUST THE TRACKING SINCE THIS IS A VHS TAPE. IT DID NOT HELP, I GUESS THE TAPE WAS JUST TOO OLD AND SCRATCHY. THEY SHOULD HAVE REVIEWED IT BEFORE SENDING IT OUT. WELL, A LOSS FOR ME. WHAT CAN I SAY, WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT OF AN OLD VHS TAPE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY, VERY DISAPPOINTED."
0,"Do not buy this coffeemaker This coffeemaker only brewed two pots of coffee before it stopped working. It's going back! the third 12 cup cycle took 45 minutes to brew 7 cups of coffee and boil off 5 cups water. The fourth (and last) brew cycle wouldn't pump water to the brew basket at all. When you open the water reservoir lid to see what's wrong you'll get scalded with steam rising out of the spout. It's noisy - sputtering, gurgling. One star is too high a rating for the machine we ended up with."
0,"I'd rather give up coffee. Dear Sirs,I purchased one of the Mr. Coffee CG12 coffeemakers in November of 2005. I have never seen a more poorly designed coffeemaker. What a piece of refuse! Because of its faulty design, it got coffee all over the countertop whenever it was brewing. I tried two of them and they both did the same thing. The whole design was slapdash. It should be taken off the market.After putting up with it for two months, I threw it in the trash and bought a Black and Decker. It was like going from a VW to a Rolls. Never again."
0,"Boring Book I picked this book up thinking it would be good (yes, I judge books by the covers). It was awful...I am not sure why I even kept reading it all the way through. There is no action or anything. He and his brother are poor, his brother gets girls (he doesn't)...boring..boring. I don't even know what the author was trying to communicate with the audience. If you don't want to waste your time, don't read this book."
0,School assignment This was a school assignment for my son. I read the book first so I could quiz him on it. It is in my top 5 of the worst books ever! Don't waste your time...unless it's a mandatory school assignment.
0,"Built like a 1980's American car! The machine was great while it worked. Just after the warranty expired my ""Ionic Breeze"" completely stopped working. For [the price] I expected quality!"
0,"Terrible We sent this unit out for testing at a leading test lab and they found that it would only be able to clean a very small closet - that is if you are looking to remove airborne particles like dust, smoke or pollen. It could help somewhat with odors due to the ionization process but that is very difficult to measure.I found more specific testing information at the [...]"
0,No good How do people say this works? I would say this picks up 1/10 of 1% particles...at the most candle soot! I have owned mine for 1.5 years.Save your hard earned cash and seek other filters with Hepa.My opinion applies to all ionic breeze filters
0,"Not dependable I agree that longevity is not in the design specs. I bought one and it worked for less than a year, got a replacement, and that one died even sooner. Didn't bother to replace that one. I also had two of the mini ones that plug into the outlet and have a light. One still working after quite a few years, the other, dead. 1 out of 4 is not very good. One note - it does seem to take odors out of the air. I have 4 cats and I think it helped somewhat, but not at the price they want for them. I would give $30 for a floor model if I thought it would keep running. As for cleaning the air - I don't think so."
0,"Does almost nothing Electrostatically removing particles works okay, but it requires a fan to move air over the grille. As others have mention consumer reports tested this product at it removed almost nothing from the air. It rated the lowest out of all the air cleaners they tested.So don't waste your money on this product. If you want an electrostatic air cleaner find one with a fan. Before you buy you should really go read the online Consumer Reports report because a lot of air cleaners don't work very well."
0,"Bad for me too...Loved it at first and now it just doesn't turn on! I really should have looked up people's reviews prior to purchasing this unit. Mine just stopped working. I cleaned out the inside with air, I've been cleaning the insert all along and it just stopped! What a waste of money. Haven't tried to talk to Sharper Image about it yet but I'm not hopeful."

0,"sneaky christian alert! I bought this at a Barnes and noble, so I didn't have these reviews to guide me before my purchase.While I realize the irony in writing an angry review about an 'anger management' book, I am a little peeved that I when I bought this, it was, first of all, in the regular psychology section, and as I read the back, read the table of contents, and first few pages, NO WHERE was there any mention of it being a christian book!I felt pretty stupid when I got home started reading about how the evils of pornography and living a hedonistic lifestyle is contributing to your anger problems...What??? Next time I'll read the ""about the author"" section, which revealed it's written by a christian counselor....whoops.Just thought I'd give others a heads up on what they're buying, in case you flip through in a hurry like I did, and discover reading bible versus just makes you MORE angry, because that would just be counter-intuitive :)"
0,"Misrepresented, wish I'd read the reviews before! I am, ironically, angry, after browsing through the Anger Workbook! There was no indication it was Christian based and now I feel ...well angry!"
0,"Book is not appropriately labeled When I purchased this book, I did not read the fine print. There is no labeling whatsoever that this book is fundamentally Christian based. The only indicator is the very fine print on the back cover, which most people would probably not see when purchasing this book. The reasons for anger are in-depth and can easily relate to anyone's life, however, the solutions are not for everyone. If you are not a fundamental Christian, the book can be interpreted as insulting, as not everyone lives their life thinking that everything they do/think/feel/say is based in what the authors may call ""sin."" I wish I would have read reviews myself prior to purchasing this book."
0,"Anger management book with christian agenda I was excited about reading this book as the text on the back and the information listed on the cover advised I would find answers on dealing with anger and ways to counter anger within yourself. I was dismayed to find that the book uses the bible to help resolve issues without going into greater detail within the book. I can understand how a christian viewpoint can be considered helpful, but was disappointed that the book makes no reference to the christian viewpoint on the back of the book. There is a brief reference in the acknowledgements about christian integrity in printing, but it is hardly sufficient notification prior to purchasing and reading the book. Unless you are looking for a book with a christian agenda on dealing with anger I would advise to pass on this book."
0,"not what I expected I bought the book to help me understand someone who I feel has anger problems. After about two chapters, I determined it would not help me but decided to keep reading, hoping it would get better. For me, the book posed many causes of anger, but never did propose specific solutions. A lot of theories with no substance. I quit at page 178. I was able to tolerate the abundance of religious context, but when Dr. Carter put forth the proposition that criminal behavior is the result of environment rather than free choice, I closed the book forever."
0,"a refund please If you want a book that's based on religion, not psychology and practical ways to deal with your anger (as I was expecting), then this book may be for you. If, like me, you want a book that deals with anger from a psychological/behavioural stand point, then look elsewhere, as (like me), you may be angered by all the biblical /God/Lord references in this book and find it better suited to kindling or the recycle bin....time for me to go find a 'real' book on this topic now...."
0,"Do not be suckered! There is nothing in the title or on the cover to indicate that this is a book whose sole intention is to convert you to Christianity.The first two pages are about anger, but by page three you are being told that Jesus loves you.Sad, that religious people feel the need to deceive others in order to get out their message."
0,Page After Page of Christian Verbage I ordered this book because I thought it would be helpful in my work with troubled adolescents at a non-denominational residential treatment center. Boy was I wrong! It seems like there's not one page without NUMEROUS references to bible passages! I couldn't even make sense of what the authors were trying to say when connnecting their points to stories in the bible. This book is useless for my work and now I can't even return it! It should have been made VERY clear on the description of this book that it is WRITTEN FROM A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE! All the Minirth-Meier Clinic series books should have that label/caution on them.
0,"Deceptive This book professes to be for all people, but is in fact, just for the devoutly religious. I could not finish it because it was so faith based, it made me sick to my stomach. Maybe some people can just give over control of their lives to God, but I cannot. I don't think that the reason for anger is our sins, as the previous reviewer has written, but I do think this book is deceptive. Nowhere on the cover does it mention that this book will try to get you to give your anger over to God and let him take care of you, but that is exactly what this book tells you. It is a total waste of money."
0,"Deceptive Deceptive, this is a book with a strong religious content. It assumes the reader has a strong reliance in God to solve his/her anger issues."
0,"Maybe it should be called The CHRISTIAN Anger Workbook... As thought Christians are the only ones who get angry... Or as though, if you want to work with anger more constructively, you ought to become a Christian... This book serves to put off many readers because of it's failure to be inclusive."
0,not a christian and can't use it in my work. this book is for christians and i am not a christian. i cannot use this in my work as it is illegal for me to foster christian beliefs on my residential clients. i was very disappointed in it as it was noted nowhere it was christian based. i feel ripped off.
0,"Too Christian I agree with the other people who thought that This book was too Christian. Neither the front nor the back of the book mentioned how Christian the book was. I would have returned it as soon as I realized, but I had already written in it (it is a WORKBOOK after all). I felt totally ripped off and let down"
0,"Very Christian! I wish had thought to check out the reviews on a site such as this BEFORE I bought the book. Considering this is a work which is supposedly meant to help people overcome toxic anger, I imagine many people feel even more angry upon discovering the very heavy Christian slant of the book."
0,"Get a grip The brush is stiff, I guess you get used to it. It has a long handle, compared to a hair bush? The handle is smooth and you cannot grip it when you are in the shower. It is anything but ergonomic. I guess you take a dry bath. Do not buy this brush unless you are needing to bristle off some very caked on dry skin or rust and can use a grinder to make the handle gripable. What a waste of good money."

Very disappointed and I've always had great experiences with Amazon."

0,"disappointed This product was purchased as a gift, it was delivered in a plain cardboard box and the cleaning supplies was stuffed in the box with the sponge and cloths stuffed in between the bottles w/no information explaining the contents or use of the items,(If items were missing I do not know) and one of the bottles leaked inside the box. There was not enough time to return and get a replacement. I have purchased this product before and the product is not the problem, it is the way it was handled that made it an unpleasant experience."
0,Damaged Goods I ordered the cleaning kit for a Christmas present. I opened it prior to wrapping it and it was a good thing! The bottles had leaked inside the box and there was a mess.

0,"Worthless Coffee Pot I bought this product to have a small coffee pot in the office. However, when brewing, this pot somehow always gets significant amounts of coffee grounds into the pot, regardless of how the filter is arranged. Total waste of money, I'll be throwing this away and buying another."
0,"Mr coffee let me down I bought this coffee pot for my mom for Christmas because she has one just like it from the 80's but it looks awful, this is the 2nd mr coffee 4 cup pot that I bought for her and they both don't heat water hot enough to brew the coffee, the coffee always turns out weak tasting, she tried using a dark roast and still no flavor, never will I buy me coffee again"
0,"It's heat plate grows rusty within few month. Two years ago, I brought it and like it. I drink coffee in the morning, so only used it only once a day. Few month after I brought it, its heat plate started growing rusty. I continuely used it for additional six month when the 50% heat plate was rusted. I thought it was an incidence, so I threw it away and brought the same model again. Nine month late, 20% heat plate is rusted.... This time I don't think it is a incidence again."
0,"don't waste your money i thought, 'ionic breeze for you car, great idea!'. and that's all it is, a great idea. this is nothing like the home unit. there is so much air moving throughout the car cabin at any given time, this product has no noticeable effect to the air quality. you would need some sort of blower/fan on this for it to be effective and coils would have to be much, much bigger.replace your cabin air filter if you want a noticeable difference in the air quality inside your car."
0,"Don't Buy This Book! It will Scare the Wits Out of You!!!!!! There are plenty of other great books on parenting twins & other multiples out there -- do yourself a favor & don't buy this one! First of all, it is very technical & difficult/unpleasant to read. Second, it has pictures of women after childbirth with like several feet of hanging extra skin -- not something I needed to see when I was emotional and pregnant with two. It also had the most negative, scary tone. It seemed to tell you all of the things that could go WRONG and very little of what could go right. Let me tell you, from a woman who has been there -- it can go beautifully & without incident -- & not everyone ends up with miles of extra skin on their stomachs. If you buy this book while pregnant, it will only serve to scare the wits out of you. Save yourself the stress and look elsewhere for good information!"
0,"Very bizarre one-sided perspective I've read most of this book and the more I've read the more bizarre it is. Noble claims that hypertension, anemia, and gestational diabetes are natural aspects of pregnancy that can be harmful if treated. She says bedrest is actually harmful, that ultrasounds increase fetal mortality and left-handedness (???) and a host of other claims. She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism, water births, home births, doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds. Though my twins are big and healthy I certainly didn't take the advice in this book.This is not medically sound advice nor is it objective or open-minded. It is a book of extreme views."
0,"Scared me to death! This book had me convinced that amy twins would have some type of birth defect, or that something would go wrong with my pregnancy, labor, or delivery. I read this when I was on bedrest, and finally had to remove it from my room because it scared me too much. The author seemed only to concentrate on what could go wrong with a twin pregnancy. I would recommend the only other twin book I read - ""Keys to Parenting Twins."" It's much more positive! By the way, my twins were born completely healthy & normal at 36 weeks."
0,"It scared me to death!!!! I do not recommend this book at all. There is way too much discussion of what can go wrong and too much ""new age"" philosophy that is very strange to me. Elizabeth Noble is under the impression that she had a twin that died in utero and that influences the way she has gone about writing this book. This is very scary reading for any woman pregnant with twins."
0,"I would NEVER recommend this book! This was the scariest book on twins that I read. If you want to be afraid to eat, sleep or breathe during your entire pregnancy than this is your kind of book. Almost every chapter focuses on a negative aspect of carrying more than one baby and there are more chapters on what can go wrong than what to do to help things go right."
0,"Focuses on the negative Having just been told I was expecting twins, I was keen to find a book that could give me the information and reassurance that standard, ""singleton"" pregnancy books could not. But instead of finding useful information and reassurance, I finished this book feeling anxious and alarmed. It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin, preterm labor, birth complications, vanishing twin syndrome, etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition, the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise, which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other ""macrobiotic"" health store food. All in all, I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women."
0,"depressing and scary I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome, along the lines of, ""when not even one of the triplets lived, I went out and got drunk,"" and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that I was quite stressed and anxious when in fact, my twins were born naturally, five days before the predicted due date, had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about, and were in excellent health. In fact, I so dislike the book that I go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it. In addition, the dietary advice is ridiculous and it's impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby. So, unless you like being scared, I recommend against buying this book."
0,"VERY DISAPPOINTED There isn't very much steam, very little pressure, and it isn't very hot. The steam doesn't even come out in a single stream: it kind of ""chugs"" its way out. I've used a steamer before - a little handheld one - and the steam was much hotter under much higher pressure, and much more plentiful. The salesman assured me that this would work just like the other steamer I'd used, but with the addition of a vacuum. This was completely untrue. The unit also feels clumsy to use. I find it heavy and the water tank is far too small."
0,"Do not waste your money!!! I bought this product thinking that for the price it would work wonders - boy was I wrong!!!! Sharper image claims that the steam option alone on the machine takes stains out of your carpet - you don't have to resort to carpet shampoos - what a joke!!! I have tried to get out an assortment of stains from my carpet, from dirt to wine, and I am disapointed every time! I have had cheaper steamers that did a better job then this product. The only thing that does work on this item is it's vacuum power."

Yes, I did order Michael Omartian, but received Randy Waldman....and to my surprise, I do enjoy it.....soothing, mesmerising....totally enjoyable. In other words it has become an enjoyable mistake.

0,"Disco Queen Queen loved to experiment. Every time they released a new song, I would hear it and say (in delight), ""Is that Queen?"" However, this album abandoned all that was Rock and Roll and gave into the pop craze of disco that can only be classified as the dark ages in pop music. The only bright spot from this album was ""Under Pressure."" Thankfully, they pulled out of it to cement themselves as one of the greatest rock bands of all time."
0,"Not good, but even bad Queen has its pleasures Let's face it, Hot Space is filled with filler. But if you love Queen, and I indubitably do, you'll find several splendid touches. But you have to go mining for them...rather than having them explode into you, as great Queen so incomparably does. We must come out of denial and admit that this album is weak gruel, with more than a few good moments floating in it. But it is Queen, and even bad Queen has its pleasures."
0,"Ugh. This is horrible I'm shocked at all the good reviews I'm seeing! I'm a huge Queen fan, and have been since 1980. Day at the Races is wonderful. The Game is a classic. Night At the Opera is quirky, but still a good listen. But Hot Space is atrociously bad. Let me repeat that: atrociously bad. It sounds like somebody fooling around with a drum machine who didn't realize they were being recorded. It's a bad karaoke nightmare.Admittedly, yes, Under Pressure is a great song. But it couldn't possibly be more out of place unless it were included on a Megadeth CD. Really, it's that bad. Am I making myself clear? :)"
0,"Should have never been made Just stick to rock. No experimentation please. That's not what Queen's music is about. Queen, Zeppelin, The Doors, Jethrotull...the ROCK man. Party on bud, but no funk."
0,"An embarrassment I am a big Queen fan, and this cd is their worst ever. Why they put it out instead of taking a sabbatical is beyond me...The only decent songs are Under Presuure - even if the live versions tend to put the studio one to shame, and Put Out The Fire. Maybe Life Is Real could be saved from the bonfire as well. The partially Spanish-sung Las Palabras de Amor is pretty silly. I am Spanish but have always found appalling the knack of foreign artists to try and record in my language because the lyrics lose a lot and sound silly.All in all, do not buy this if you consider yourself a Queen fan, unless you're the blind-faith kind, which is notrecommendable. You'll find yourself cringing more often than not if you listen to it..."
0,"WHAT IS ""UNDER PRESSURE"" DOING HERE??!!! QUEEN could have got away with this piece of junk had UNDER PRESSURE not been in this disc. Why? Because when you listen to that song you realize, by simple comparison, how bad all the other tunes are!!!!!! Even the ballads!!! Not to mention the dreadful opening track, STAYING POWER. THis album was an unsincere attempt by QUEEN to go disc and make some more money. Of course fans will say they ""tried a new approach"", ""experimented some new ground""... (...) THis is just a bad CD by a great band. There are hundreds of cases like that !!"
0,"Keep walking Every good artist has an album that should have been taken out and shot.With Queen, it's this one.Olly Buxton"
0,"Pretty bad choice of direction for Queen What happened in 1980 that made a lot of good bands turn sour? Disco! Queen was a victim of the times and perhaps a horrible identity crisis. While Body Language still pops up on greatest hits packages, that track is not enough to warrant buying this album. Stick with Queen's 70's releases."

0,"poorly done ! Not sure what the other person was smoking when reviewing this book, but must be a beginner to Dire Straits. This was very poorly done. In many places, the tabs are incorrect. It looks like the transcriber just did what they thought or liked rather than validate it. I would not have bought this book if I had known how wrong it was. I suppose on a plus note it provides an alternate method. Also, the print it too small.Don't buy the book. There are free tabs on the internet that are closer to the way it was played."

0,"A complete waste of a good voice ............... I don't know quite what to make of this album, or how to determine what part of it is her, what part is people she has known, and what part is people she has seen at a distance. But one thing is certain, it is all filtered through a suppressed anger which transforms the stories in these songs into dirges with very little color or light.Her vocal method of delivery here is a closed-throat, closed-mouth drone that is unnecessary. She has a good voice but won't let it shine because she doesn't trust her lyrics alone to reach the listener and leave their mark. She is the real loser in Bittertown because she hasn't accepted and moved on."
0,"Viewsonic builds products that don't last Viewsonic customer service is nonexistent and product support worse than poor. Products are poorly made and will not last. Call technical support 1800-688-6688 and see how long you have to wait for a service rep. Online you get someone to respond who barely speaks English. I bought a plasma TV for $3000 and it failed in less than 3 years. Viewsonic reaction: Too bad, you should have bought a warranty and we'll fix it in 48 hours. Without one, you are on your own. I think something bought for $3000 should last more than 3 years, and Viewsonic should too. Viewsonic intentionally builds products that won't last to sell you an expensive product warranty. I wouldn't buy Viewsonic again and don't think you should either until they built a better product and improve their customer support."

0,"It's not a story I'd like to hear again. I was expecting this movie to be like Eternal Sunshine or Garden State, a youthful drama. The lead in the movie was this entitled New York brat that checked himself into a mental hospital because he had a little stress from his prep school. Give me a break. I was hoping that by the end of the movie he would introspect a bit and find out that he was just being melodramatic, but instead the movie was biased to his point of view. The movie was not believable and the characters were not developed well at all."

0,"would someone please get Kim B a pair of decent shoes? This movie was a travesty of Hitchcockian devices. Old Alfred would roll in his grave. The acting was wooden, the dialogue cliched and predictable and not very convincing (wouldn't a Freudian analyst have recognized the flower arranging dream case study right away?) Bassinger looks like she's been on too many meds, with her bloated face and more-than-normally squinted eyes. Nor can she play a psychotic with any zest: when she lost it in the restaraunt in her husband's presence, running up the stairs and proceeding to yell and flail, I felt embarrassed for her. If I had more space I could go on, but I want to end with one burning question; Why the hell didn't the wardrobe mistress give Bassinger a decent pair of stilleto pumps to at least wear with her slinky black backless dress, if she insisted on outfitting her through the whole movie with dopey little flats?"
0,"Worse than the worst of Cable TV ""Final Analysis"" is one of the worst, silliest films I have ever seen. I have now abandoned Philip Joanou's filmography. It is slavishly formulaic, and just plain dumb, they couldn't even get the effects right. This is one of the few times that you will most certainly find something better on the Lifetime Network instead."

0,"The Devil When I turned 12, 5 years ago, I received the iZ on Christmas from my aunt and at first I thought this would be really cool. Oh how wrong I was. First and foremost it does not turn off, even at the age of 17 I still cannot figure out how to turn this contraption off. It basically plays the same looped annoying beat for hours on end while adding even more mind-numbing effects into the mix. This leads me into my next point: the sound effects and ""voice"" of this demonic figure can induce many nightmares. Honestly, this ""voice"" is so soul crushing I would rather be deaf then have to listen to this toy speak and/or make noise. This toy has fallen from my shelf several times over the years and it literally takes me hours to turn off.

0,Worst Travis MsGee I agree with the other two star reviewer for this book. Nothing seems real or convincing in this work. If this had been the first MacDonald book I read I would not have read another.The plot read like the cheap 60's motorcycle themed movies the book kept discussing. I didn't believe any of it. Travis reluctant to grieve over a woman he knew that was brutally murdered because he couldn't focus in on her personality just amazed me.Even if you're addicted to the series as I am; don't read this one!
0,"Resurection Day How many of other readers purchased this book and got to page 277 and found the pages blank to 477? The store it was purchased at was going to just exchange it however in review of the 5 they had in stock, all had the same blank pages. The store then refunded my money. The book was great up until then."
0,at least they came somewhat white I've never wrote a review about any product. I'm usually satisfied. This however kind of ticked me off. The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them. they were also not the right size. I ended up giving them away.
0,Very Disappointed I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker. The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $25 in shipping costs.
0,"Poorly Made I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes, until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped. Go figure with the poorly made stitching. I've never had a pear of shoes last only one day. I can't believe I wasted my money on this. I've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these. 365 times longer than these shoes. WTF"
0,"A great disservice. While Shaw may have been a gifted playwright, his ""Saint Joan"" did an enormous disservice to the subject: the view it presents of Joan of Arc conflicts with the historical evidence on nearly every point, echoing instead the propaganda of her enemies. In truth, her trial was orchestrated by the English and their clerical allies (and even Shaw admits that the Inquisition overturned the verdict in 1456, shortly after the English were finally driven out of Rouen); nor was Joan a ""rebel"" except in the minds of her political opponents. By dredging up this fraudulent view of La Pucelle, Shaw's play was among the first popular works to undermine the efforts of countless scholars whose research had brought a more truthful view of the issue to light. For an historically accurate version, I would recommend any book by Regine Pernoud, many of which are offered here at Amazon."
0,"Don't waste your time The book starts well( first 20 pages). However, the writing switches from overloaded sentences, to very basic prose all over the place. The author leaves you wondering why the relationship betwen Marc and Uva is so strong.Why does Marc go in search for her. Would not a foreigner taht has been attacked leave the country? And then magicaly Uva appears in the last chapter out of nowhere.Do not waste your time reading this novel."
0,BUYER BEWARE- does not ship well This is one of the cutest Tinker Bell candles I could find. I couldn't wait to put it on my daughters Birthday cake. However the 1st one I received had a broken wing. So I contacted CS and they sent me a replacement. But when The 2nd one arrived with a broken wing as well I was very disappointed. When I contacted CS regarding the 2nd candle it was recommended I not have a 3rd one sent (since they don't seem to ship well). So although I received a full refund... I still have no Tinker Bell candle. Buyer beware- This item is fragile and may arrive broken.

0,"Miserable A faint excuse for hard rock, in any case, would surpass System of a Down's awful music, and their CD ""Toxicity"" is no exception. The song that is the CD's namesake has no identifiable beat. Chop Suey is half-assed. Half of the remaining songs are worth little. There is not a track on Toxicity that is worth anyone's time. System of a Down, a bad band in any case, has not had much luck in displaying their apparently quasi-mystical musical talent, and it remains to be seen how anyone can enjoy System of a Down's music-that which lacks tone, feeling, or any sense of emotion."
0,"Pathetic The first time I listened to this album I was thoroughly disgusted. Repeated listens did nothing to endear me to it.This album basically sounds like it was written by a band that listened to ""System of a Down"" and thrashed out a really bad rip-off of it. Get the band's self-titled album and avoid this piece of garbage."
0,"Rubbish This band suck and all 2 of their albums suck. Anyone who can tolerate this garbage for longer than 5 minutes deserves a free copy of evanesence.(a band right on par with this joke of a group). People who listen to this are going to be emabarassed two years from now when people finally realize that it is all pretty unlistenable.. I just can't believe there are people out there listening to this and actually saying ""Yeah, man.. This Rocks. This is great music!"" Thanks. THere is no flow to the music and the singer sounds like Beavis freaking out. For true genius and great songwriting, look no further than The Brian Jonestown Massacre."
0,"Uh Oh I bought this when it came out because of all the hype, I really hadn't heard them on the radio as yet. After one listen I was disappointed..........and two listens I was pissed........after 3 listens I wanted my money back. The lead singer has got one of the worst, off key voices I've ever heard. The instrumentation is far superior over the vocals. I don't get why this band is so popular but to each his own."

0,"No disrespect to SOAD fans but I cannot get into these guys System of a Down's Toxicity has to be one of the worst albums I ever heard in the last five years.I bought it on a whim back in April of 2002 as everyone was telling me this album was amazing to see what the fuss what about of these guys.The songs like Chop Suey, the title cut, Ariels, Prison Song and the rest are all the same nu-metal poor me, I hate my life garbage which was immortalized by lame groups like Linkin Park, Korn and especially Limp Bizkit.The stupid singer and the guitarist are whining and screaming like 2-year olds that didn't get what they wanted.If you like metal, I recommend you get some good old school metal instead, like Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Motorhead, Judas Priest and the one and only Van Halen."

0,"System of a turban I may not be 14 or hip to what the kids today listen to.

Even I know its obvious. These guys support terrorsim. If you have your doubts read the back cover of their first album, it discusses how in the 21 st century the world will experience biological and chemical terrorism to combat the opression of those in foreign lands.Oh and not to mention the upside down american flag on the back of the record.Now maybe this is all just a coincidence.NahhDont support terrorism and dont buy this album"
0,Not all that Great! This cd kinda gets on your nerves their first cd was ok but this cd really gets on your nerves the constant chage from singing to screaming sucks because the do it so often. I mean the first album was great and then this one pushed the anyoying limitations that the first one only mildley had. So if you really want a good cd go get Reveille's Bleed the sKY which actually has a good lead singer and doesn't change from fast guitar playing to slow anoying songs all the time.
0,"Softer, weaker and not System of a Down I really can't believe how ""melodic"" (wussy) this cd was. I waited anxiously to buy it and when i did, i was so disapointed at the way SOAD changed. If the only song you liked off their first cd was ""Spiders"", then you will love this cd. If you preferred the real hard core metal sounds of SOAD, then I'm afraid you'll be sorry if you buy it. I hope their next cd sounds more like the first than this ... sequel."

0,old seeds and small qty I was sent seed packets that where packaged for spring 2010. I doubt those are going to grow but guess I'll see. There werent very many seeds in them either. And good thing I had other planting instructions because the packets didn't desplay deepth to plant the seeds or if the plant liked shade or sun. Some packages only made 2 1/2 six packs once planted. One packet of seeds should make at least 5 or 6 sixpacks.Thought I was getting a deal but got less seeds and old seeds when I could have went to Homedepot and got better stuff for $2 more. Wont be buying seeds from this Generic Company anymore.
0,"Buy it for ""Ice Machine"" The only good thing about Speak & Spell is the fact that ""Ice Machine"" (best DM song ever, in my eyes) is on it... that is, if you have the version with the B-sides on it. The rest, while catchy, are downright wussy (especially this version of Photographic; go find the Some Bizarre version or a live version). The only other remotely listenable song on here is Tora Tora Tora! (though I wouldn't buy the standard album without the extra tracks just for Tora!)."
0,"What a shameful letdown Shameful attempt at a hybrid of horror, action and suspends that cast Keanu Reeves as occult detective John Constantine in an adaptation of the vertigo comic book that loses it's edge and goes for the gusto in flat out stupidly with a boring acting turn by Keanu Reeves who just does not come across well in the role. The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness. Nether of them however can save this runaway train that should have been checked before it left the tracks."
0,"If this is the best they have to offer, then take it back Bland rip off of a great comic book not only puts the worse actor imaginable for the main character but has a script that is almost a crime in itself. The dialog is so bad that it would even make deaf children cry and the special effects are not as good as one might hope. Some of the acting is great and that's a great feat in itself because of how bad the script is. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton do great work here and for that, people should be grateful for but it's still Keanu's film and he still torpedo it with a lousy performance that is in tune with the lousy script it has.If this is the best they have to offer for the fans of the comic book, then take it back."
0,"Horrible can't begin to describe this. Lamebrain horror film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film and Peter Stormare give a great cameo that really should have been a bigger role. Weisz, Hounsou and Stormare give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does not know how to direct a movie."
0,"Another ten bucks I'll never see again Can Keanu spell ""typecast""? After those lousy Matrix sequels couldn't he have smelt the sulphur a mile away and dodged this sad excuse for a film?It's a tired formula - angels and demons are completely monstrous and amoral whereas us poor humans, the only creatures with any capacity for virtue, are stuck in the middle as their pawns. Not very original, not to mention cliche-ridden. Of course his friend (who is stereotypically geeky and likes to study arcane literature) had to die, just as he was trying to give Keanu some vital information! Of course there has to be a slow-motion scene where Keanu kills demon hybrids, a scene stolen straight from Blade. Of course he has to wear a long black coat.And suicides automatically go to hell?! Oh please. Time for filmmakers to stop adopting the dogma of a particular chuch and be more original. And what's with that horrendous depiction of the Angel Gabriel, androgynous, snooty and all but screaming fashion victim!"
0,"Where is Mystery Science Theater 3000 when you really need it? Extremely awful Keanu Reeves stinker that not only lives up to the word of mouth but surpasses it in spades. Keanu proves once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking bad performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that. Only his co-stars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare but not even their great performances can salvage this disaster. This is fresh material for the show "" Mystery Science Theater 3000"" and I hope they can get a print of this movie and tear it apart for the garbage it really is."
0,"Mindless Garbage Mindless Keanu Reeves film not only lacks a story for most of the stuff that happens in this film to make any sense but has some of the worse dialog known to man. Keanu is Keanu, don't expect much more than that and the special effects are decent but not superb. The script is a huge disservice to most of the cast and the climax of the film has no rhythm to it. The only actors in the film that manages to transcend the lackluster material given is Rachel Weisz, who gives a deep and rich performance that the film is not mature enough for and Peter Stormare, who does far more for this film than Keanu Reeves and the special effects combined.Other than them, you can skip the movie."
0,"Skip it. Moronic and self indulgent Keanu Reeves vanity project lacks the heart and the wits of the comic book which it steals most of it's ideas form and ruins them with a horrible acting performance by Keanu Reeves, which looks more like he's reading from cue cards than remembering a script. The rest of the actors do better in their roles than he does with Rachel Weisz stealing the show with a deep and strong performance , Gavin Rossdale, doing a very convincing job as an agent of the underworld and Djmon Hounsou giving a bit role more class than he should have. Tilda Swinton does well with a small role that is very underwritten and Shia LaBeouf is well, Shia LaBeouf. Don't expect any more than that.Skip it, you will thank yourself after you see it when its on cable."

0,"Other than the fine performances by Weisz, Hounsou, and Stormare, there is nothing here to see. Mind numbingly bad Keanu Reeves film that makes you want to tear your hair out with Keanu giving his career worse performance and most of the actors giving theirs as well. The story is a clear rip off of horror movies from the past and it makes even the viewer feel stupid after it's all over. Only Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare are able to transcend their badly written characters and that's because they are too good of actors to be even in this mess.Hopefully Weisz, Housou and Stormare will learn to read their scripts better after this debacle."

Pretty bad and pretty pointless Keanu Reeves vanity project that takes a well respected horror comic book and literally rips apart the complexity of it and makes it a joke with no story and no redeeming value to it.

0,"O boy, this movie was really bad. Horrible movie that leaves a very bad taste in your mouth with a bad acting performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast as a hard boiled detective who fights against demons in LA. His performance is a real misfire on the part of the people who made this film and it hurts the film in a lot of ways. His co-star Rachel Weisz is ten times the actor Keanu is and she has the most interesting character in the whole movie. Her character is so good that she should have been the lead instead of poor Keanu but we don't live in a perfect world so we have to suffer with Keanu trying to act tough. The script is an absolute mess from beginning to end and the special effects are not done properly in some scenes of the film.See the film for Rachel Weisz performance alone but other than her, wait for video."
0,"The movie was horrible. Super crappy film that not only makes you feel stupid once you have seen it but will make you want to have a drink just to forget about it right after its over. Keanu Reeves is miscast in a very very bad way and the story is not very interesting at all. Certain thing that are introduce in terms of narrative in the beginning of the film is thrown out by the end of the second act in order to put on a ridiculous third act that makes everything about the movie into a bad and tasteless joke. Rachel Weisz does do wonders with the script and her role and the universal praise she is getting is well deserved but she gives the only good performance in the entire movie while the rest of the actors in the film can't rise above the bad material they are given. I did not even know that this was a comic book before but now that I do, I know why it was so bad to begin with."

Sleeping would have been a more productive use of our time, rather than wasting time trying to figure out this film. When the old tired plot finally starts to unravel, we didn't care what was going on. I felt that the actors are an insignificant part of this movie, they don't matter. In other words, this film is so bad, it doesn't matter who was in front of the camera, no one could save this trash. The film is very dark, shot like a low budget film, with a few special effects.My friends and I can honestly say that we did not like anything about this film."
0,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans would love this movie. Super stupid Keanu Reeves monster movie that is so bad, I'm waiting for it to come on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Keanu is at his worse with this film and it shows on his face that even he thinks the movie is bad. Out of the entire cast, Only Rachel Weisz(Runaway Jury) and Peter Stourmar(Bad Boys 2) give credible performances that are way better than the movie itself. Rachel Weisz does more with her part than the screenwriters and the director did with making the movie and gives the film an unnecessary great performance that a way better movie could have used instead and Peter Stourmar gives class and dignity to an underwritten role that is only in the movie for about five minutes.See it for Rachel Weisz and Peter Stourmar ONLY, because the rest of the film is really bad."
0,"It's the Matrix all over again. Rip roaring rip off of the Matrix movies that has Keanu Reeves redoing his Neo character for a supernatural tale that does not have a lot of common sense. Keanu is pretty bad in this film and it's apparent that this was an attempt to cash in on his Matrix success and some of the things that happens in the film including the over blown ending are scenes taken directly from the Matrix films. It seems to me that they were trying to establish another franchise with Keanu but this film really does not deserve a follow up. There are some good thing to say about it like the performances of Rachel Weisz, who does do far more for this film with her great and powerful performance than it does for her and Peter Stormare, whose tem minute cameo has more meat and soul than most of the performances of the film (with the excerption of Rachel Weisz of course) . Other than them, the movie is really a vanity project for those who are looking to cash in on the Matrix movies."

0,"Forgettable horror movie that is almost redeemed by Rachel Weisz's stellar performance Forgettable horror thriller that has Keanu Reeves remaking his matrix role for an even less talented director and an even worse screenplay. Keanu's performance is a worthy effort but is not very good and he's more distracting than compelling in his role. His costar Rachel Weisz does much, much more than he does in the acting department and almost redeems the entire movie with her stellar performance but she's literally the only actor who tries to be better than the horrible script that they had to work with. A script that lacks not only common sense but a sense of purpose as well. The direction is shoddy with really bad camera work in all directions and the special effects don't hold much significance.Other than a worthy and game effort on Rachel Weisz's part. The movie is not worthy of her talent or your time."
0,"Neo VS the devil and in the end, we all lose Horrible Keanu Reeves action/horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that takes all the good this film had and destroys it with his sheer lack of talent. I feel sorry for his fellow actors which includes Rachel Weisz, (who give the movie's only real performance) for even being on the same screen with him because despite their good work, he manages to make the movie into a real choir to watch and that's in itself a crime because a better actor would have done more with the role.The bad word of mouth is justified."
0,"Unholy Crap If the Matrix And the Exorcist got together and had a baby and it came out as a turd then that would be this movie. Terrible acting, the worst script this side of Reefer Madness, and an unplausible plot revolving around (sigh) the Devil, a hippy-dressing angel, and a holy artifact found in (What!) Mexico? The only thing realistic about that was how easy it is for illegals to cross the border. Now, everyone put their forearms together and repeat after me: GO INTO THE TOILET, I COMMAND THEE! Now flush."
0,"If Hell wants Keanu Reeves, let it have him and this stupid film. Dumb, very dumb supernatural thriller that lacks a lot of brains and a credible leading man. Keanu Reeves literally sucks this movie dried with his lack of talent and makes every thing about the movie into a very bad and cruel joke. The director can't even stage a scene with tension and some parts of the movie are very dark to even see what is happening from time to time. The script is horrible with some of the worse dialog imaginable and the special effects are pretty bad. The only thing that this movie has going for it is the performances of Rachel Weisz, who gives the movie more class and dignity that it does not deserve and Peter Stormare, who does more with his small role than Keanu does with his main character.If it were not for Weisz and Stormare, I probably would have walked right out of the theater, that's how bad the rest of the movie was."

And its time for Hollywoodto find some fresh material to use.In my estamation this movie was poorly concieved and directed. I've have read one or two of the Hellbound books. They arefairly good. (If your into catholic guilt that is!)But sometimes whats just so so on paper, can be really goodon film. I was hoping this would be so with Constantine.Sadly I was mistaken. Keanue Reeves performance was nothing more that a wise cracking version of his charicter in the Matrix.I have two suggestions.1.Save your money and buy or rent much better movies.Such as the oringinal 60's film ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harrisand Claire Bloom. or ""Rosemarie's Baby"" with Mia Farrell.Or the overlooked mid 70's flick ""The Sentinal"".2.Please Keanue, find yourself some better roles. and get outof the ""Matrix""!"

What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Out Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performances that this film really did not deserved. Other than Weisz and Stormare, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie."
0,"A real stinker. Mediocre Matrix rip off with a twist finds poor Keanu Reeves trying to rip off his own series with a supernatural tale that has one bad clichÃ© after the next and doing a really bad job on top of that.. The director barely scrapes by with the bad script that everybody had to work with and the special effects are sub par for a movie of this size. I agree with the majority who wrote that only Rachel Weisz is fine here with a better than this film deserved performance but other than her effort, the movie just is not worth your time.Avoid, it's really that bad."
0,"The worse. Dull, loud and boring adaptation of the classic horror comic book lacks a real leading man for the movie to fly with its bad script and almost as bad special effects. While Keanu fails miserably in his role, his co-star Rachel Weisz does more for this movie than the movie does for her, giving her character a real sense of grace and strong will despite the lousy dialog, badly written characters and insane plot clichÃ©s that is surrounding her during the course of the movie. Weisz's performance alone is worth the price of the movie ticket but other than her, there is really no reason rush to see the bad film.My Suggestion? Wait for DVD."
0,"What a letdown. Shameful attempt at a hybrid of horror, action and suspends that cast Keanu Reeves as occult detective John Constantine in an adaptation of the vertigo comic book that loses it's edge and goes for the gusto in flat out stupidly with a boring acting turn by Keanu Reeves who just does not come across well in the role. The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness. Nether of them however can save this runaway train that should have been checked before it left the tracks."
0,"A huge disappointment. Bland rip off of a great comic book not only puts the worse actor imaginable for the main character but has a script that is almost a crime in itself. The dialog is so bad that it would even make deaf children cry and the special effects are not as good as one might hope. Some of the acting is great and that's a great feat in itself because of how bad the script is. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton do great work here and for that, people should be grateful for but it's still Keanu's film and he still torpedo it with a lousy performance that is in tune with the lousy script it has.If this is the best they have to offer for the fans of the comic book, then take it back."
0,Please... Terrible Keanu Reeves supernatural epic that even makes the last two matrix films look like masterpieces compared to it. Keanu does give the worse performance of his career with this turkey and the film itself is almost as bad as his performance with sloppy dialog and lackluster special effects. Rachel Weisz literally gives the only good performance in the entire movie and that's really because she is the only professional actor in it. The rest of the cast is made up of no name actors who make Keanu look like a genius in the acting profession.See it if you are desperate for entertainment or can't get a date.
0,"Rather be in hell than to sit though this again. Super dumb Keanu Reeves horror film lacks the mind bending fun of the matrix movies and has instead a lackluster core that makes this film as hollow as a helium balloon. Keanu gives a very tired and unsparing performance that does drag the movie down most of the time and the script lacks a voice. The second half of the film manages to go against what the first half establishes and the last thirty minutes absolutely makes no sense what so ever because it has a certain revelation that makes no sense what so ever and leave you wondering on what the hell just happen. The rest of the cast is solid with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare which the film does not expand on and the script does not give more time to because it only wants to focus its energies on Keanu's bad attitude than the real actors that are in the film.What a shame."
0,"Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most partwith a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in themain role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot hasbeen said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this moviehas to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she doesmake you care about what is going on with the movie while you aretrying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is beingtold. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movielike this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essencethere is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiececompared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at thevery best.For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie one star.If she were not in the movie, my rating would be in the negative numbers"
0,AWFUL..................... My goodness. I rented this movie expecting a scary thriller and it almost put me to sleep. This is Keanu Reeves' Sorriest performance to date...... not that he has had many good ones. His acting was horrible in this movie and the whole movie did not make sense and was just plain Boring to watch. I was very disappointed for this film is just plain awful!!!!!!!

0,"Keanu Reeves, need I say more? Has there ever been a movie with Keanu Reeves in it that had any merit to it? He is one of the worst actors on the screen today. Whenever I see that he is in a film, I know I'm going to be in for a bad time. Despite that truth, I dared to risk it once again and rented this movie. I wasn't disappointed. Save your money folks. Keanu reached his peak in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. It's been downhill ever since."

0,"Pure stupidly Horrible and down right stupid Keanu Reeves action/horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but it solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that makes everything about this film into a joke. I feel sorry for his fellow actors which Includes Rachel Weisz, (who give the movie's only real performance) for even being on the same screen with him because despite their good work and effort, he manages to make the movie into a real choir to watch.The word of mouth is justified for this piece of garbage."
0,"Really, Really BAD. Horrible Keanu Reeves action film that is as bad as the word of mouth suggests and then some. Keanu's acting is so bad in this film that he even makes the dumb script with the horrible dialog look good in comparison to his performance. Rachel Weisz does give a great and lively performance but she's the only actor in the film who bothers to give one while the rest of the actors camp it up to the point of nausea (with the exception of Peter Stormare, who was great as the devil) The direction is a joke and lacks coherency plus the screenplay does not handle the subject very well at all with dialog that is horrendous and story structure that literally makes no sense.Thumbs up to Rachel Weisz and of Peter Stormare for at least doing their best with what was handed to them but the movie itself was horrible."
0,"Pretty bad Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film."
0,"absolutely awful This is easily one of the worst movies I have seen in years. A barely comprehensible mess, with no redeeming qualities."
0,"Flimsy and incoherent. Incoherent thriller that has Keanu Reeves in full matrix mold and making a complete fool out of himself with a pretty bad script. His performance is not very good and he's miscast for the role he is in. The other actors in the film, most noticeable Rachel Weisz ( She does give the best performance in this movie, she is that good), Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton all do better than poor Keanu in there roles and manages to rise above some of the cliches and the flimsy plot to give solid performances but not even they can get pass the fact of how badly this film was made and how incoherent it really is. For their performance alone, the movie gets a star from me but don't expect much from the movie itself."
0,"most boring thriller ever written I really wish I had gone to the movies to watch this instead of buying, that way I could have walked out instead of feeling compelled to watch the whole thing to get my monies worth. The plot is fine but the acting is so stilted and the pace of the story so slow that I would prefer to watch paint dry. If a rating of -3 stars was available that would be my rank for this movie."
0,"Constantine: Great effects but no power The special effects were great; however, the plot was slow moving. I was bored with the story line. John Constantine running around using crosses and other religious items was not believable because he didn't believe in God. He cherishes and has faith in created religious objects but has no faith in God. This is equivalent to making a movie about Spiderman but not having him get bitten by the spider, or making about about Luke Skywalker without him using the force. Constantine's holy incantations seemed like a bunch of voodoo mumbo jumbo. Anyone who knows anything about the bible should know that if you are going to make a fictional work off of it, at least get the core principles down. What was good about the movie is the fact that it showed that you don't have to work your way into heaven. It showed that although you may have a lot of faults, God will accept you where you are in life. All you have to do is accept Him."
0,Much worse than I expected. Mind bending stupid horror film that lacks any form of common sense what so ever with a script that was looked like it was written by a ten year old with dialog only a child could understand and a leading man who is as bad an actor as they come. [...] The special effects are not really good and the direction seems forced in some places. The only performance of merit that this film has is from Rachel Weisz who does much more with her character than she needed to and she does lift this film pass much of it's problems but a good actor can do only do so much with out the help of the director or the rest of the cast and she's basically by herself in this film in terms of good acting.Avoid.
0,"What a slap in the face to the fans of the comic book. Lousy and disrespectful adaptation of the Comic Book Hellblazer is a travesty of a high order. Who ever thought that Keanu Reeve would have been perfect as John Constantine should be fired for sheer in competence. Keanu takes a great role and basically craps on it with his lousy acting. Of all the actors involve, only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to transcend the horrible script, which manages to contradict itself in the last forty-five minutes of the movie, and the climax is a horrible joke in itself. The special effects were decent but I have seen better on TV plus the plot is taken from an episode of Buffy the Vampire slayer. They should have just called it Keanu The vampire slayer instead."
0,"Dumb and unsatisfying. Dumb and unsatisfying horror movie that is made worse by the terrible acting of Keanu Reeves, who is extremely miscast in his role. The rest of the film is almost as bad as Reeves's performance with the exception of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a great performance thou out despite the movie horrible script and crappy special effects. I would have paid to see her character in a more serious and better horror film than the garbage that is here.The one star review is for Weisz, for at least giving a great performance despite the huge shortcomings of this film. Too bad that she was not the lead instead of Keanu Reeves."
0,"Pretty Bad. Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made.

0,"Unwatchable Bad special effects movie that has possibly the worse performance ever by Keanu Reeves, who almost makes the movie as bad as his performance. I don't know why Keanu was cast in this role but he's the worse actor in the entire movie and Shia LaBeouf is almost as bad as he is and gives a very annoying performance that reeks of stupidity. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to give good performance in this bad movie and for that, I will not totally thrash this movie but its still not very good and you should wait for cable."
0,Horrible I'm a fan of Rachel Weisz but not even her effort could have saved this extreamly bad film. Keanu Reeves should be put in jail for his horrible performance and the director should never direct again for his lack of directional skills.Avoiud like the pluge.
0,"Other than the great performances of Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the movie is horrible. Very bad Keanu Reeves horror film is a real look at how much a vanity project can spiral out of control. Keanu Reeves is just out of place in supernatural tale about a private eye that helps a cop look into the suicide of her twin sister. The special effects are not of top quality and the script is too jumbled to even try to figure out what is going on from time to time. The rest of the acting is decent with Rachel Weisz stealing the show and giving this movie more than her fair share of heart and talent and Peter Stormare doing more in his brief cameo that most of the other actors in the film. Unfortunately nether Weisz or Stormare can over come the hack like script which treats their characters and the story of the film as a joke. I like a good popcorn film but this is not one of them."
0,"Poor and rather too lowbrow for it's own good. Lowbrow and pretty stupid horror movie that lacks screenplay to not only explains what is going on but a lead actor who can act. Keanu Reeves is the gapping hole that sinks this ship and his performance will be remembered as one of the worse performances ever in a major motion picture. It also does not help the film that the director does not know how to shot a scene and the special effects are bottom of the barrel for a movie of this kind. Rachel Weisz is great but she's the only actor who seems like she gives a damn about her performance While the rest seem like they are sleepwalking.If you love to look at your watch for two hours waiting for this movie to end, be my guess. If you want to save your dignity and your eyes, skip this film."
0,"Boring Constantine is a horrible movie. The first hour of it is just unexplained occurrences. In a movie, it is good for things to be unexplained at the beginning and gradually explain themselves as the movie goes on, but when it goes on for an hour, you get bored and stop caring about the characters. Then when this happens you can't tell when the movie starts to pick up. Then, no matter what happens in the movie you don't care and it becomes a long boring escapade. None of the characters interested me because I didn't think any of them were well done and as I said before, it needs to explain some stuff earlier in the movie and when that doesn't happen the more unexplained events that go on just add on to those before, so you stop trying to keep track of it all and that's when I stopped caring. It would be a form of torture if someone made me sit through this movie again."

I got into an emergency brake, a car show up in front of me, the driver was distracted, then the tire was completely stopped but slipping because it has zero grip because the center part which that is smooth is too wide.I am planning to create some groove to them just to using some more time.If you want your life don't buy this tire.

Thrown together, arbitrary, sinfully pedestrian, this is one book that you can easily miss in your short life. Franklin shows you he's just a regular guy with regular thought processes. He drifts through life sometimes helping people and sometimes taking advantage of them. He may be an early humanitarian, but he is also an early capitalist, and he knows what he wants. Great, so does Ted Turner, but you don't see us going ape for his life story, do you? Franklin was truly one of our greatest founding fathers, but you won't get a glimmer of that from this book. Reading anybody else's account of Franklin's life would be a much more rewarding experience. Go there if you must do Franklin."

0,"The Ultra-PC Comic Book If you liked Miller's Dark Knight series, you probably won't like this one. In fact, unless you're into extreme political correctness, you won't like this one.All the good guys are minorities. All the bad and dumb ones are white. And so on. This seems like an 180-degree reversal from his Batman books, which were somewhat negative on liberal issues (well, justice, at least).But Miller obviously wanted it to be a work on par with Moore's ""Watchmen"" - why else waste Gibbon's talent on this book? Perhaps it was a catharsis, because it seems like a lot of venting - against Reagan, against white males, against evil phallic space stations, against ... well, enough said. Read ""Watchmen"" again instead. Or why waste time with comic books? Although Moore's stuff is always interesting, most comic-book philosophy is at the pop level. Sounds deep and attractively cynical ... until you delve. Read something serious. Recommendations: ""Darwin's Black Box"" (Behe), ""Nature's Destiny"" (Denton)."

It's doesn't go on very smooth either (it's not like lip balm) and seems to cake up. I used it for 2 months and the wart actually got a little bigger. I saw no noticeable change other than that.

0,"Disappointed and Shocked I bought the Olivia Body Oil just showed like the picture sevel times in Greece. My wife felt it good. So I want to buy some again.I found it and the picture showed just like the same thing what I wanted. I put my trust in it. I am so disappointed and shocked with what shipped to me! It is not at all like the picture showed me, including the bottle and the something in it. I do not know what happened. I just feel being deceived! If there is zero star I can choose, I will.Sorry for my English."
0,"Cute but not functional This bed is very cute! But the sides do not come up high enough, to at act as side rails. But high enough to cause injury when rolling around in the bed, as my toddlers do. But, your toddler will love it...and you'll need to buy a new bed soon."
0,Dangerous wouldn't advise buying I bought these beds for my twin 2 year olds. They look great and yes they are durable but they are dangerous. The wood frame is not rounded off and if they fall on to them they will hurt themselves. My kids like most roll around all the time as well and I constantly hear their heads and body banging into the wood. I don't understand why someone would make a product geared towards little children but not make them safe. The frame absolutely should be rounded off not sharp as it is. I am moving on and buying plastic car beds for them so that way they do fall or hit themeselves on it the outcome won't be so severe. I wish I would have known this when I purchased them. I thought you should know before buying.
0,"Poor quality Very cool looking bed, son saw it and was ecstatic. Instructions included were nearly worthless, multiple screws literally broke when screwing the bed; once FINALLY together, attempted to move it and the screwed in back fell off. The wood quality is similar to cardboard, not even as good of quality as cheap plywood. I will be returning this bed as soon as I can get it taken apart and back in the box."
0,"Chinese-made piece of junk When I bought this foot pump I wasn't expecting much of it, given the ridiculously low price I paid (less than 10$). However, it turned out to be even below my expectations: there is no way it can reach its maximum rating of 100 PSI since it can barely handle a bicycle tyre. This really confirms that what you pay is what you get! I guess this is the kind of product that really needs to be seen -and felt- in order to assess the quality of its construction."
0,"Pressure Gauge DOA As with one of the other reviews, this pump really is junk. The pump worked but the pressure gauge gave a limp attempt at working on the first pump, then gave up the ghost completely. I am sure 99% of these types of foot pumps are made in the same factory in China and the companies here just put their names on it. They should be a little more particular 'cause this is the last cycle force product I will buy. Of course, it is hit or miss, so you just might be lucky and get one of rare ones that works. But for $11, what can you expect??"
0,"Not an OUTDOOR antenna Beware, although this is advertised an an indoor/outdoor antenna, it is not. It is INDOOR ONLY. So I ended up returning the item and by the time I paid the shipping BOTH directions, I was within $15 of what the antenna cost!!!DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU NEED AN OUTDOOR ANTENNA"
0,"Too much money for too few channels This antenna may work for some people, but for me it was another regrettable purchase. The assembly is fairly easy, but the results proved a letdown. I bought the Terk in hopes it would work perfectly with the Samsung DTB-H260F set top box I am using to bring in free OTA digital and HD stations. But I tried two different positions with the Terk and its 10db amp was only able to bring in three or four local DT stations at best. Analog reception proved even worse. When I took off the Terk and replaced it with a coventionally-designed, less expensive indoor antenna with a 45db amp in those same positions, the difference in performance was amazing...I could get between 12 and 15 DT channels. In conclusion, my advice is to avoid the hype about unusual antenna design and go for maximum decibel amplification. It's that extra power that made the difference for me. Sorry Terk..."
0,"This is a WineGard SS-3000 Antenna The antenna pictured is made by Winegard (model number SS-3000) that is normally sold everywhere on the internet for substantially less. So you are paying a lot more for the same antenna with a TERK name on it, it appears."
0,"only hypes I bought this antenna based on good reviews here, but I really found out it works even worse than inserting a piece of wire to the coaxial jack of my TV. Returned promptly, but had to pay round trip shipping fees. Think twice before buying it."

As other readers have stated... it was very boring and 500 pages saying "" my life ..."" so you can read this book if you dont already know that life can .... if you dont know that, you should definitly read this book!!! i repeat... this book is very boring... and i dont recomend it!!!!"
0,"It Stinks No climax, no definite plot, no villain. This book breaks the definition of a literary classic and goes off on so many tangents that the reader becomes confused as to what the entire book is actually about, not to mention Francie is a one dimensional charachter who shows little growth until the end of the book where she suddenly changes into an entirely different creature. The novel would have been better if it was solely about Katie!"
0,"What a waste of time! I am usually fond of mid-twentieth century classics such as this, so when I was assigned to read it for my ninth grade english class, I looked forward to enjoying it. However, I was disappointed to find that it is a horrible and tedious book."
0,"A (Diseased) Tree Grows in Brooklyn I recently read this book for my English class at school. I have enjoyed every other book we have been required to read; however, I strongly disliked this book. From the first chapter I lost interest in the ornate, seemingly endless details. On several occasions I noted incorrect grammar in the book, and even misspellings! Never before have I seen such a poorly written book. I do not recommend this book. I would not call this book a classic."
0,"Don't read this book! This is the kind of book that has poor grammer, misspelled words, and is too long. Often times authors make their books drag on and on and on. I feel that is what the author of this book did. I would suggest that you find another book to read and not waist your time."
0,AMAZING BOOK A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a great book. I'd recommend it to people of all ages. It should be required reading for everyone! An excellent book from cover to cover.
0,"Dull The novel, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, was (in my opinion) not insightful, and completely lacked any reality needed to convince the reader of the author's position.The stories of the protagonist making up the entire novel may be uplifting to some, but those crave action or more reality are in for a snore. Of course, while some books really do a decent job of conveying their message without either of the two, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn not once persuaded me of the author's point of view.The novel was written in hopes of inspiring people by leaving out most of the details we need to hear to really understand what life in the slums is like. If you do not want to hear those details then read the book; for everyone else, however, I strongly suggest you stay away from A Tree Grows In Brooklyn."

Unless you like to read, over and over again, the words Me, I, My, Me, I, I and Oh yes, ME, don't bother. Where is the Beef? I have never seen such a narcissistic endeavor. It was a total waste of money and expectation. The hype I received from the E-Zine Queen convinced me I should buy this book. That's the one and only chance she had to gain my respect. It seems a club of mutual admirers got together and decided to endorse this shallow, boring fake. What a shame. Count me out of this network of self admirers. I have been robbed."
0,"SIGNATURE STYLE I found this book to be extremely boring. While the pictures were done well, the content was way too traditional and museum-like. The rooms didn't look like anyone could live in them, and that the furniture ought to be slipcovered in plastic like some of our Grandparents homes."
0,"Signature Style I subscribe to Traditional Home magazine and have purchased their other books. Signature Style was a terrible disappointment. It lacks the interesting, informative style for which they are known. Pictures and text are below par. Gives you the feeling this was done by some other entity who dashed it off without much thought.

0,"Not What I Expected I looked forward to this celebration CD very eagerly. However, the disappointment was great other than Gretchen Davis. I've been a fan of Kristofferson for 35-40 years and that could be the problem. There are very few people who can sing his songs - Johnny, Waylon, Willie, and Kris. I far preferred and really love the ""This Old Road"" CD.Donna"
0,"Awful. Better tributes and far better renditions available Start with ""Willie Nelson Sings Kris Kristofferson."" Better yet, get anything recorded by Kris, himself, until the last decade or so. Despite having a voice that ""sounds like a frog,"" as he once put it, the early versions are best by Kristofferson, because nobody else conveys the same feelings or sings his lyrics with such expressiveness as he does. Even his performances are just too rote in live performance or later rerecordings, though."
0,"Lackluster CD The music was very disappointing. I should have trusted my instincts when I listened to the clips, but I had high hopes for this much-anticipated CD. Save your money!"
0,"Incompatible with Kindle Make sure you view the sample first. Most of the characters particular to Spanish and linquistics show up as gibberish and on most pages the formatting seems to be lost. It is obvious that no one at the publisher even glanced at this to see if it worked when it was converted. Amazon can share responsibility. At the time of this review Kindle developers are still exclusively Anglo-centric. I hope they eventually see the value in adding some foreign language support (yes, Amazon, there are some people that read Spanish in the United States...)."
0,"Buyer Beware - Another Rip-off Buyer Beware - Another Rip-off. An hour ago I thought that I was buying this dictionary.

0,"WTF? I don't understand is this book made of gold or gasoline? Why the hell does it cost sooo much? Does the author David Moody come to your home and actually read the book to you? When you order this book do you get 25 copies? I have many more questions about this book, but I don't wish or want to waste my time. Hope this review helps, maybe when I get back from overseas, get out of the military, sell my home or first born just maybe I will be able to afford such a luxurious book. This explains why the local library doesn't have the book."
0,"Not for me At first when I realized this book had been taken up my a mainstream publisher I thought great I will definitely give this one a chance since I am a huge fan of everything zombie related.I do regret buying this book. It's not often that I have regrets about something I have purchased but this is one of those times.The story is nothing special or in fact, new. The writing reads amateurish and when I was finished reading I knew I definitely would NOT go any further into this series.For fans of the genre, if you are looking for action stay away. This book was rather mundane and boring."
0,"Abysmal I was quite disappointed after reading Autumn. Maybe it was the large anticipation I had incorporated when purchasing the book, thinking that post-apocalyptic scenarios were ""my kind of thing"" (and they still are). However, Moody's book was very poorly written. Not only did I encounter numerous grammatical mistakes, but there was absolutely no connection with the characters. It was almost like, ""here are the characters, now you must try and relate to them and follow through with their overly obvious situations."" I felt no sympathy with Carl's death, or any other middle school -written events that occurred. Overall, this was a terrible book in the sense that there was no captivation whatsoever. Although the abysmal stance of Autumn, Moody is an amateur, and will hopefully progress in later writings."
0,"Disappointment is mine I am mad at myself for wasting ten bucks on this book! The plot was slower than a turtle swimming in a pool full of yogurt. The characters were boring and I never felt any connection to any of them. The zombies were equally as boring. I grew weary of the snarky way the characters were in the beginning, when they were all still in the one depressing building together. I expected things to pick up after Emma, Mike and Carl struck out on their own but that didn't happen either.One of the best series I've read (zombie themed) was the ""As the World Dies"" trilogy by RhiannonFrater. Those books were fast paced, full of action and intrigue and the characters were interesting. Plus it also made you think about how mankind really WOULD react if some similar apocalypse occurred. I CARED about the characters in that story and immediately downloaded the second and third books in this series after reading the first. I WON'T be doing that with the ""Autumn"" series."

0,"Needs to be rated R This movie needs be rated R! The language was unbelievably bad and there were lots of passionate bedrooms scenes. Sex was brought up too many times to count. When one of the male characters makes reference to one of his body parts, we turned it off. There is also a gay character. Not sure what other characters say about him because we muted the conversation. My family and I were so disgusted. The story-line was good and interesting. Could have been such a good movie, but with all the other junk, we just couldn't get past it. VERY dissapointed!!!"

0,"Don't waste your time or $$$$$ Took this out of the box, plugged it in, and waited 45 minutes for it to heat up enough to cook hot dogs. After this adventure, I put it back in the box and returned it for a refund. Find another brand, this one is worthless"
0,Did Not Work This item is really beautiful. When I recieved it I immediately plugged it in to try it out and it worked great. So I unplugged it and put it back into the box. The day I planned on using it to keep already cooked hot dogs warm and on display for customers at a charity event. Well it never heated up when I took it out of the box the second time. Too late to send it back so oh well I am stuck with it. It is really pretty but that is the extent of the functionality I have found for this product.

0,"Don't Waste Your Money My sister has this single, and she spends all of her time whining about how she wishes she hadn't bought it. I agree completely. Kelly Osbourne is one of the biggest poseurs I've ever seen in my life. She has an awful voice, and the only reason she got into music is because someone - as a joke, probably - told her that she could make it. I did end up listening to the songs, and I nearly killed myself. ""Changes"", which was her only hit, was HORRIBLE. If you want to hear the REAL ""Changes"", buy Black Sabbath's ""Vol. 4"". This was a sad case of a classic destroyed by a new wannabe artist. I can't believe that Ozzy agreed to do a duet with her. Ozzy, how could you? I cringe just thinking about it. If you want real music, buy anything from Black Sabbath, which is the greatest heavy metal band EVER (only the Ozzy years, though), or anything from Ozzy's first two solo albums.Peace everybody, and keep rocking (to good music, though)."
0,"never worked for me I spent almost $400 including extra motion sensors. Was very excited to get it, but as soon as I put a battery in one of the sensors (never even plugged the base in), my house alarm went to trouble. I tried for over a year to get it resolved, but was continually told to try something else (move this, turn on before you reach the house, etc...) I called my house alarm guy and he said the frequency should not be the same, but they conflict for sure. I can't say if this works at all, since I don't have another house to try it out on. Super disappointed. I will say, that when I called, I always got a very nice man who seemed like he was trying to help but never offered a refund or a solution that would work. I bought a cheap unit that didn't work well, then spent a good amount on this and it still didn't work well."
0,"Voice alert system 6 I am sorry that I ever bought this thing, it is the most annoying ""toy"" I have ever bought. No matter where I put it or how I adjust it, it goes off all night long. This would be a great gadget in theory if we lived in an animal free (No squirrels) and bug free (no flying beetles, moths & etc.) world but seeing how that is not the case, it's really not good for anyone. Even the shadows of people and cars set this thing off. I thank god that I didn't buy two alert systems as I originally planned."
0,"Too much sex! Have read all the books published to date. Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep, tossed one paperback and two hardcopy) as I realized as I was re-reading them, that the somewhat graphic sex (Dominance and Submission, and Harem Girls, etc) didn't really add to the story but sure promoted things I just don't like. The March Upcountry series with David Weber had boys and girls, and talked about sex, but was what I consider more normal for SciFi, and was not graphic, did not promote ""alternative"" sex. So while I enjoy the James Bond nature of the novels, I really can't recommend them to any of my friends, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone younger."
0,Do Not Buy This item did not work and it just irritates your skin. You think it works because you see your skin being irritated and think that it's the product doing its job but it doesn't work. Not only was this way more expensive than the other corn sticks but it also was a waste of my money.
0,"A ripoff, $12 is too much to pay for a single. Although containing 3 songs, this disc is essentially a single. 'Aquarius' is a less-polished but nearly identical to the album version from 'Music has the Right to Children.' Similarly, 'Olsen' is simply a longer rendition from the album.The only remarkable track is 'Happy Cycling,' which is a really nifty hip-hop-ish mix of the non-existant track 18 from 'Music has the Right to Children.'This disc is worth owning for 'Happy Cycling,' but try to find a cheap second-hand copy instead."
0,"a total rip if you own ""Music has the right to children"" If you already own ""Music has the right to children"" and you are itching for more BoC like I was then just take a deep breath and be content with ""Music.."" becasue this cd is a money making scheme just about. All the songs on it are the same ones, there is no re-mixing at all. But, there is one exception at the end they play a 2 minute bit that gets you excited but then ends. This is hardly worth 12.99 so looks like you and me are gonna have to wait until BoC makes a new album. Awwwwwwwww hurry up guys!"

0,"Not impressed! The author never addressed what went on (if anything) between Ryan and the sister. I have mixed feelings about Ryan and would have appreciated some clarification.Tempe.....she thinks she omnipotent; she barges in to situations with no regard for her safety or the other people she drags in with her.There is too much unwanted detail(clothes, food, geography etc.)and detracted from the story. I found the ending very boring.I do like Kathy Reichs. I've read a good number of the books in this series and really like some and others (like this one) not at all??"
0,"It's boring! I totally agreed with the review of ""Summer Bore!"" and I really almost couldn't finish the book. I think that she had a lot of knowledge and did a lot of research to write this book, but the plot is really slow. There are too much coincidents and some plots just don't connect. What makes it even worse is that the auther tried to connect what seemed so far-fetched plots. After we learned about some cult culture and main characters, the author had to use one sentence as a whole paragraph to explain how the story fitted into her research. At the end of the book, we just got all the expaination of the whole plots and how every character fits in the whole story. I hated this kind of spoon-fed story. I also don't care much about Dr. Tempe Brenna. Too bad for me. I had spent a lot of hours, after putting my two toddlers to sleep, to read a very disappointed book.No comparison to Patricia Cornwell's books."
0,"Awful! This book was boring and poorly written. The plot was weak and obvious, but worse than that, the writing was simplistic and choppy- very hard to read. I always finish books that I start and this one I almost put down. I only finished it, by skimming because the reading was so choppy, because I had already bought it and couldn't return it. No character development, no characterization of the characters at all, and the dialogue is flat and boring and only serves to advance plot. Descriptions don't describe-they tell in short sentances, or they lecture. I'm a scientist and I found this book boring and annoying!This is my second Reichs novel. The other was better, but I won't be coming back. Save your money and your time!"
0,"Yuck After the baby mulilations I couldn't read any more. I am still haunted by the images from that, as the mother of three young sons it was too disturbing for me. Definitely will not purchase any more books from this author. I couldn't donate this one to our libary's book sale fast enough!"
0,"Not the best read Let me preface my review by stating that this is my first Kathy Reichs book. It will most likely be my last. I felt as though I was reading a CSI book written by Tom Clancy - way too technical. However, that may be the audience for which she is writing.The first 2/3rds of the book was dull, slow, boring and disconnected. As Ms. Reichs builds to the climatic end, I felt as though it suddenly jumped to 120 mph which did not lend itself the ability for the reader to get a mind picture of what was happening.If you like technical writings (sometimes even in foreign languages), this is the book for you. If you are looking for an entertaining mystery to read, I would suggest you look else where."
0,"This batteries are completely worthless!!! Purchased two of this batteries in September of 2007. They worked fine for a while. Stored them fully charged for about 3 months. When i tried to use them again both batteries had fully discharged, after charging them they each ran for about one minute each and died. Tried to recharge them but they wouldn't hold a charge no matter how many times or how long i put them on the charger. By comparison the original battery from canon only lost about one quarter of its charge in three months and is working the same as new. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT, they are unreliable. You wouldn't want to miss videotaping an important event due to battery failure."
0,"TERRIBLE!! I have never entered a review before, but this book was so bad I had to stop you from wasting your time. I tried to enter a 0 rating but I guess 1star is as low as you can go. The reviews were mixed, but I bought this book anyway because I run a call center and I thought perhaps that would make it more interesting for me. Total waste of time, can't believe that the type A in me wouldn't just let me quit half way through. I kept thinking the ""real"" storyline was yet to be introduced, or maybe some interesting plot twist was coming. Boring characters, unrealistic scenarios. I will never read another book by this author."

I was very please with it then as the bowl and creamer was a nice big size. as Betty Crocker no longer carries this line, I was pleased to find the set on Amazon.com. the picture was exactly like the set that I have.However This creamer and bowl that came with this set,looks like it was made for a child's tea set, they are so tiny, neither one holds a halve cup of sugar or creamer. And the Sugar Bowl is oval not round as it was on the online picture. I was very dispointed- as I had planed on giving it as a wedding present to a frend's daughter(who had liked the set each time I used it). I ended up buying something else for her. Now the Butter dish and Gravy Boat are normal size and thats makes them look even more tiny. I'll never buy this again"
0,"Cheap crystal set. As a previous reviewer stated, the creamer and sugar dish are of a ridiculously small size and are not the same as shown in the picture. One of the salt and pepper shakers was lopsided. The set is made in China and is worth $20 at best. I would be embarrassed to give this as a gift."
0,"a patchwork, not a book The authors have taken the opportunity to publish a book of which they wrote only a small portion. The plot progresses through the snippets of first-time writers. This book is not a part of the series but an attempt to milk the series for all it's worth. (See also Grantville Gazette I,II, III).Instead of a cogent style, the book is pieced together from snippets available elsewhere. As a result the book fails to tell a cogent story, forcing the reader to parse disparate language and editorial differences from section to section."
0,"1634: The Ram Rebellion Very, very disappointing. I loved 1632, liked 1633, was luke warm over the Gallileo book, and really disliked this one. Sad to see a great idea/series start go downhill so fast. The ""humor"" in this book is mildly ammusing for the first 10 pages or so then increasing sophmoric and boring for the next 50 pages. I scanned the last 50 pages and then ash canned this turkey. Save your money. I hope ""CAnnon Law"" returns to the quality of the first book, but the blurb on it is not promising. Most readers, like me, don't really care how many angels can dance on the head of a 17th century pin and get really bored with endless minutia about religious arguments. Wake up Eric and give us some fun, rousing tales of survival, war, and innovation in the unique ""world"" you created in 1632."
0,"don't buy this book...... ....unless you have nothing else to spend your money on. I am a great fan of the other books, especially 1633, but this one is a poorly, maybe even unethically, conceived project. Many of the ""stories"" contained in the book were written by non-professional writers, and it really shows. Apparently many of them are available on the web, which makes the decision to publish them in book form, without warning the purchaser, rather iffy, in my opinion. The theme that is supposed to hold everything together, ""Brillo"" and his use as a symbol for a new form of government, is just, well, lame. The songs are unbelievably tedious, and the idea is not ever presented coherently.Pass on this one, save your money for 1634: The Baltic War."
0,"What A Mess! This side story is actually an anthology of semi related tales. It is tedious, boring and an absolute mess. Unless you have a passion for the minutiea of 17th century German government this is a waste of time. I have enjoyed the other books very much but this one is so disjointed that it barely makes sense.I would suggest skipping this one and waiting for the ""real"" book to come about the Baltic War."
0,"Ponderous and Uneven I need to start out by saying I thoroughly enjoyed 1632 and 1633 and am an avid fan of alternate history novels. That said, wow, this book has been some serious work to get through. With a cast of over 50 characters (many who go by several names) and multiple stories cobbled together, this book is all over the place. I tend to read in small sessions and this book is not conducive to that at all. This book is only for the die hard fans of the series, and then only for those who like stories about tedious political maneuvering.This counts as strike two against the entire series, with 1643: The Galileo Affair being the first. Mr. Flint needs to get this series back on track and stop focusing on these side stories. The main story line is solid and makes for great novels. Save these side stories for the short story compilations where they belong. I will try 1634: The Baltic War next, but if it is strike three, then I'm done with the series."
0,"Worst in the series thus far. By far this is the worst book in the series. Maybe five pages worth of rebellion or plot development, 200 pages of dry political education, and 100 pages on ballet recitals. Dry and pointless reading."
0,"Hugely Disappointing I've read all the previous entries in the Grantville Universe and enjoyed most of them quite a bit. But where the use of various writers and short stories worked well for a time, the quality of the writing has been steadily decreasing.The Ram Rebellion reads as a book totally abandoned by Eric Flint and handled almost entirely by the Regulars at Baen's Bar. I understand Baen's practice of pairing up-and-coming writers with more established writers in order to develop new talent and further the plot of popular series. It's worked well in the past.Here it simply failed. I'm about 1/5 through the book and am so tired of the lackluster writing, the sophomoric humor and the terribly slow plot progression that I'm putting it away for good. I'm probably unlikely to read the rest of the series because it's reached a point where having Flint's name on the cover is totally meaningless and not at all representative of the quality of writing to be expected within."
0,"Don't waste your time. I loved the first two books in this series but this one is a waste of time. Stories about sheep farming and ballet, are you kidding me? Call me when Mr. Flint gets back to the struggle of surviving in the brutal 17th century."
0,"The reviews are more interesting than the book I must say that several of the reviewers that gave this book fours and fives showed a livelier imagination and greater writing ability than did the people that contributed to this book. If you've been reading the reviews, and counted the stars, the ones have it. There's little to add that hasn't been said already. I simply wanted to add my two cents in the hope that I might save one person eight hundred or so cents.This book is not an enjoyable read. Say what you will about the aims Eric had for this book... I buy books to read for enjoyment. This one I finished only because I spent money on it and I hate throwing away a book without reading it once. It was a relief to hit the last page."

The TV and DVD players started having problems 6 months after setting it up. The manufacturers warranty only covers 90 days after purchase. I find that awful since both products started having problems shortly after the warranty expired. Even though it is a ""fun"" I would recommend not wasting your money on this TV and/or DVD player."
0,Chandipath The quality of CD is hopeless. Thre are too many glitches. I could not listen all the contents. CD jumps from one song to third song. I will not recommand to buy this CD.

0,Moll Flanders This book has the honor of being one of only two books that I have ever read that I TRULY regret having wasted my time on. I really and truly did not think that I would be able to finish this one BUT I ALWAYS finish a book once I start it. In my opinion this is one of those cases when a very controversial novel gets confused with a great novel. I am however VERY grateful that I picked it up at a library sale for only 50 cents.; 0 ) Sorry Moll Flanders fans.
0,"Made me sorry to have the gift of sight. I had to read this for a book club, and a fifth of the way into it, I began to wish I were blind, so I wouldn't have to continue. I considered gouging my eyes out with a grapefruit spoon. And if someone tried to read aloud it to me, I was prepared to pour hot parrafin into my ears. And if Anne Sullivan tried to sign ""Moll Flanders"" into my hand, I would dig into my wrists and sever the nerves to my hand with a carpet knife. Then if someone tried to tap the text of this book onto my back using Morse Code, I would be left with no course of action other than suicide. As it was, I completed my book club obligation, and as soon as we're done discussing this, I'm going to bandsaw open my cranium, locate the part of the brain that remembers I read this book, and scoop it out with a melonballer. Wish me luck!"
0,"Didn't grab me I usually like books about weird science, but I have to say that this one didn't grab me-- maybe because I got to it right after reading Kip Thorne's book on Black Holes and Time Warps. It's ok, but didn't seem special."
0,"Lacks substance Scanning the reviews of ""Hyperspace"" I see that many want to give this book five stars. I find myself in the 1- and 2-star minority.""Hyperspace"" is the kind of book that makes people think they've learned something without actually having done so.This is the problem with ""learning"" by analogy. The presentation of many -- perhaps most -- of the concepts covered in this book might help one learn to talk about them, but not to actually understand them. Analogy goes only so far. Experiment is the crucible and if you don't explain the experimental and theoretical basis for results, then you have taught nothing. This is a flaw of much science writing (e.g. the second half of ""A Brief History of Time"").""Hyperspace"" started out interestingly enough, but the farther it went, the more it lost its bearings. A sense of wonder is a fine stimulus, but science is more than a word game of analogies. I read the whole thing, but the time I spent reading it felt wasted."
0,"Avoid if possible This book is riddled with mistakes from incorrect derivations to incorrect tables in the appendix. Our class has our own lengthy errata webpage. As for the meat of the book, the derivations are not really fleshed out, and there are very few examples to go by. Except for one chapter devoted to applied problems, I lack to see how this book is called ""very applied""."
0,Spk Failure - Mic jack - Charger Issue poor quality control SPEAKER FAILURES: Turns out the speaker - mic - charger jack is defective on many of these units. After a few charger plug insertions the contact that cuts out the speaker when using a headset fails to make a good connection when the charger plug is removed. Appears to be a class manufacturing problem... Jack contacts are accesible from battery compartment. Press a fine sewing needle point into the small loop contact (use magnifying glass)to make the loop buldge a little more and make a better connection with the other contact. The speaker will then start working again. Problem solved
0,"Very Dissappointed This camera comes with no instructions or warranty information. The zoom feature doesn't exist as indicated in the technical data and editorial reviews. It doesn't even seem to be the camera advertised, but then who knows for sure when no written information is included."
0,"Them folks done messed it up I was so excited to find out that this record was finally remastered until I found out that they completely changed the order of the songs how they originally appeared. To listen to an older recording is to listen to how other folks listened to it at the time. It's rather wrong to mess up the original sequence of things. It's fine to add extra tracks at the end of the album, but for crying out loud, don't mess with the song order. Marty would be rolling in his grave I'm sure."
0,"VERY disappointed!!! I thought I would like this book as the subject manner and descriptions sounded interesting. But the author would start a train of thought and then abort the idea and move on to another - I seemed like I was listening to an crudely abridged version! I will NOT read another of hers if this is the way she writes. I was very disappointed...this book could have been great!!!! The characters I felt were shallow and so much more could have been done to deepen their personalities, thoughts and feelings."
0,"Extremely Poor Quality I ordered this for my son's birthday, paid the 2 day delivery so it'd arrive in time. After seeing it in its package, I would never have bought this particular one at a store. I ordered it as new but it looks like someone has played with it and put it back in the package. The tip of the rocket is bent, the paint is scratched and smudged and has finger-like prints on it, it's just very poor quality. I expected a little better than what we got, realizing this was a $12 toy, but it should have been in better shape. I'm asking for a full refund, including shipping, as I think it's only fair since I still have to locate this rocket somewhere else and now only have 2 days to get it."

0,"American folk group sing some Spanish Civil War songs The title ""Songs of the Spanish Civil War 1936-1939"" is deceptive and deceiving.Several songs in the album seems to be, at best, ABOUT the war. Others (6, 18) were written by English/American including music by Michael Smith, the performer. Hardly a Spanish song or lyrics.Rozhinkes mit Mandlen (20), is to the best of my knowledge an Eastern European (Jewish?) song. I wonder about its relevance to Spain.Worst of all, all the songs are performed a'la the great American folk style of the 60'. I was looking for Spanish songs with Spanish flavor and rhythm not to Peter, Paul & Mary."
0,This doesn't work I bought 2 of these rumble packs and neither of them work. I have tried them in several different games and they only worked in one and then only on and off.

0,"I must have missed it Other reviewers have given the plot, so I'll skip that part. I watched this and don't understand what the excitement is about. Bergman is a prop here, with very little actual camera time. There is about 5 seconds of tension, and when the tense moments are resolved (the scene could have lasted longer), the ending becomes clear. Too predictable for me."
0,"No Light Relief The product is totally inferior to what I was expecting and advertised. I returned the item and asked for a refund. Hard to find someone to communicate with satisfactorily.

I am terribly dissatisfied with this product, the company, and the service."
0,Womeans Life in Colonial Days- free Kindle Book Didn't like the book so I couldn't finish it. I can't tell u what I thought of it since I didn't finish reading it. To me the book didn't make a whole lot of sense.
0,"Only Lasted about Three Uses The product didn't mix well in the reservoir,so I shook it up, and kept spraying. I knew it wasn't applying evenly, but that was okay. Miracle-Gro doesn't burn my plants if I get a little too much on one or the other. But then the sprayer started leaking on the second use. I made sure I had the thing closed correctly and on right, but it leaked. And then the plastic switch on top where you switch from just water to water and fertilizer mix, completely quit working. I wasn't mis-using it or switching it back and forth a lot, just watered some after the fertilizer was gone, so the whole garden would be watered. Small garden. I was very disappointed, since I'd stocked up on Miracle-Gro for plants, tomatoes, etc. I love how easily it mixes and that it doesn't burn plants, but I'm afraid to try another sprayer.Does anyone know if I can just buy another sprayer/applicator and use it with Miracle-Gro?Thanks!"
0,"Miracle-Gro 100410 lawn and garden feeder Good idea but poorly made. I followed instructions and hooked the feeder to my garden hose using city water. All was good till I let go of the trigger, then water leaked badly from the handle and trigger area. It became useless at that point. Will need to take back for a refund. Why should any product fail on the first use..... it shouldn't. Stick with the liquid feeder it seems to work better."
0,Doesn't work The connection between the hose and the sprayer seems to be missing a part or something. There's no washer and there is an obvious path for water to escape. It leaks like crazy. Only recommended if it is hot outside and you want to get sprayed while fertilizing your plants.
0,junk This contraption does not mix the miracle gro evenly. Why they put their name on something like this is beyond me
0,"The old one worked well. The miracle gro product is great, especially in an arid area with little rain to activate a granule product, but the new feeder design is pathetic. When I FINALLY got it working properly, it dribbled constantly during and in between use. I checked all washers and retightened everything to no avail. The trigger has to be contantly depressed during use, and you have to squeeze AS HARD AS YOU CAN, regardless of the water pressure. It was exhausting. Do they bother to beta test these things? The old one dribbled a little if it tipped over, but otherwise was fine. It also had one switch and stayed on without having to constantly apply pressure. I'd still be using it if the container hadn't blown away in a wind storm."
0,Very poor idea I have used the old Model #100409 garden feeder and was pleased. I used the old feeder with it's hose to hose connection. This way I could water my lawn when it was hot and dry. I cannot stand for two hours watering my large back yard with an end hose feeder.
0,"... LOOK HERE FOR THE ANSWER !!! OK, folks, the Miracle-Gro Lawn feeder doesn't work. Miracle-Gro makes GREAT plant foods -- but they just can't make feeders that work worth a darn. So, this is what you have to do. Step one .. don't buy it. Step two .. buy an ORTHO Dial 'N Spray Multi-Use Hose-End Sprayer. I've got two of 'em. One for weed killer, and one for Miracle Gro stuff. Pour your Miracle Gro lawn food (one packet) into the Ortho Dial Sprayer. Fill it with water. Stir with a spoon (one that you will use permanently with this sprayer) Put the lid (top) back on. Set the dial to 2 and 1/2, then hook it up to your hose and blast away.When the blue water in your container is all gone, you're done. No guessing; no turning upside down; no wondering ... period. YOU MUST CLEAN IT OUT WHEN YOU'RE DONE OR IT WILL BE HISTORY AFTER ONE USE. It takes two minutes. And that's how it's done, folks. It really works -- good !!! Now, JUST GO OUT THERE AND DO IT !!!!"
0,Junk I just got done using this thing and it didn't even work as expected. It takes FOREVER for it to fill with water. Then it seemed to never spray out the lawn fertilizer. I had to basically tilt the ting upside down and on its side for the water to even turn blue. NEVER AGAIN. Scotts - Please revamp this for next season. This thing is JUNK!
0,"Junk This is a great idea. Too bad it's a peice of junk. I didn't like how inexact the feeding was since you never knew how much was left in there, especially after storing it for a while. I could have lived with that, though. What I couldn't live with was the fact that after three uses, water exploded from every available orifice. Junk."

It's hard to believe that a functional one hasn't been designed."
0,"Absolutely Horrible I'd give this zero stars if possible. First, it leaks like a sieve after just a few (single digit) hours of use... as in 20% of the water lands on my foot. (And no, the leak isn't from where the hose mates to the sprayer). Secondly, it is hard to get a consistent rate of feed from the fertilizer. The first half is gone after a minute, and the second half takes an hour to disappear. Avoid it... enough said."

0,"A Pastiche of Other's Work Save your money on this one. From an average introduction, things went steadily downhill. If there was any original research in this book, it could not be found. Pictures were dated and can be found elsewhere in several other sources. All were all full body shots with little or no detail. Perhaps strangest was the Glossary of Church Terms, few if any were used in the body of the text. What that had to do with the main topic is still a mystery. About the only redeeming feature is it is an example of ""pastiche."""
0,"that's not even a nun on the cover The habit depicted on the cover of this book is that of a Daughter of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, before 1964. They do not identify themselves as nuns, since they do not take perpetual vows. They are ""sisters."" What a blunder!"
0,"Miserable mis-rendering! As one who finds Johanna Spyri's ""Heidi"" to be one of the best children's books, I find this transition to melodrama dreadful, and totally untrue to the book's text. The independent Heidi, whose warmth and faith are such that she is fearless and completely kind, is reduced to a picture book moppet. Worse yet, characters such as Dete and Fraulein Rottenmeir, who, in the book, are respectively rather self-centred and puzzled at the lower class child, are depicted as totally wicked - ready to sell Heidi to the gypsies! Clara, who in the original is disabled more because of her elders' fear and over-protectiveness than because of her unnamed illness, now is the target of a wicked governess who has a financial interest in keeping her ill and weak.This dreadful film is suited only to those who are die hard fans of Shirley Temple."

0,"THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! This movie is bad! There is so much to say about why it is bad, I do not even know where to start. First, There is really no plot! NONE! The acting In this film is also awful! The script, Awful! Everything, awful!. I am so glad I rented this, and did not buy it without seeing it! I gave this movie 1 star, but it really doesn't even deserve that! This film only has one good thing going for it, an Early appearance by JENNIFER GARNER. I have been a fan of hers since the 1999 TV series TIME OF YOUR LIFE. This movie should have been a short film, a very short film, then maybe it would have been entertaining. It is not short, it seems to never end. This is by far THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! Don't even waste your time watching this..."
0,"Pathetic I am not going to slam this movie because it is stupid. I enjoy stupid movies quite often (Amazon even predicted that I would love the movie). But I am going to slam this movie because it was flat out not funny in the least. The guy from American Pie was brilliant in that movie because of his sarcastic wit, yet in Dude he plays a different character - a dimwitted moron, and he doesn't pull it off. Ashton Kutcher is his 70's show self and is funny but can't even come close to carrying the movie. ..."
0,"Aw, don't bother Perhaps I went into watching this movie with too high expectations. Perhaps I was still on the high that was Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Perhaps I just needed to be high. Regardless, this movie stunk. Idea is great, but the movie stunk. It consisted of semi funny jokes that went all entirely too long. ""And then?"" ""And then?"" ""And then?"" ""And then?"" ""And then?"" Yeah, we got the picture. It's not funny. I also felt like the script writers thought they were just too clever by having the characters recap the movie every 10 minutes. Like we would forget the zaniness that is a transsexual stripper trying to get her money back and Hot Chick aliens trying to get the something or other Galactic refibulator.Take my word, save your money and go see Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back."
0,Waste of time This movie runs about one hour and fifteen minutes without closing credits. If you can't fill a movie for at least one and a half hours then don't bother charging me for it. I can't beleive the reviews for this awful movie. The laughs are very few and very far between. It is like a bad Disney channel movie. The music is totally wrong so much so that it is very annoying and very distracting.
0,"One of the top ten worst movies ever!!! I haven't even bought the dvd, but I have seen the movie, and I felt a need to write this after reading some of the other reviews. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It ranks right up there with that Godzilla movie from a couple of years ago, which was so bad that it actually angered me. This movie was just plain embarrassing. Either the other reviewers are having a good old laugh with their comments, or they're genuinely easy to please."
0,"I want my 10 minutes back!!! I just watched the first 10 minuts of this filth, and im contemplaiting commiting suicicide. Hands down the worst, stupidest and hideously unfunny garbage. It baffles me how people get money to make vomit like this!!! I cant imagine anyone over 10 years old finding this movie entertaining!"
0,"""Dude, Where's My Brain?"" I despise this movie. I really do believe my dog's life is more interesting than this. ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" makes you wish you hadn't paid a whopping two dollars to rent it and it also makes you wonder if anyone actually likes this. Dude, a tsunami crashing down on my head would've have been more fulfilling than sitting through this movie. It really needs to go away forever and never come back."
0,"No The writer of this film should be killed, and every copy of it should be burned. This is by far the worst film I have ever forced myself to sit through, aside from The Blair Witch Project 2. It's horrible."
0,"Worst comedy of the year This has got to be the worst comedy I have seen all year. I don't recall through the whole movie laughing more than once. The plot was totally idiotic. I really don't understand why these actors do these movies, I mean don't they read the scripts? This movie is so bad that I wouldn't even recommend renting it. The only reason I watched it all was because I payed PPV for it and didn't want to waste my money. Through the entire movie you just keep waiting for it to get funny but it just never does."
0,"One star is simply two much !!! Don't waste your time and money!! , it's not funny (but it does makes you cry , for the owfull waste ! )and the plot , well there is no plot!!! simply , don't to buy this ""film"" ."
0,"Dude, Where's My Car? So, my brother, his friends and I decided one saturday night to check this film out.The previews made sure to avoid the ridiculously stupid ""aliens"" are after them plot that takes over the movie. It really isn't even about finding his car. The acting was bad, the plot was from one of the worst scripts ever made, and the only funny parts were all shown in the previews. The only reason this has received any good reviews is that almost all the people who watched it were young kids who think it is cool to like this horrible show. Do not even waste your time.If you're into stupid comedy, watch ""Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure"".SHIBBY..."
0,"If only I could give zero stars... Yes, it's dumb, but no, it's not funny.And I love lowbrow humor. Like Dumb & Dumber...I laughed my hiney off and I'm no Carey fan. I rented this movie fully expecting something very stupid, and very funny.Well...it's very stupid, I gotta give it that... Only problem is that it never really got very funny. It looked funny from the commercials, but the problem is that those scenes were the ONLY funny parts of the movie. If you saw any commercials or reviews, don't bother renting or (heaven forbid!) buying the movie. You already saw the good parts.I just wanted to poke both of these idiots in the eye after about a half hour. I watched the whole dang movie waiting for it to ""get funny""...and it never did. No matter how much I smoked, it just didn't ever get funny. And I usually like watching idiots blunder around!Just do yourself a favor and at least rent it before you buy...this isn't a good flick to buy on the assumption it's gonna be good."
0,Dude wheres my money back? This movie was terrible....even stiffler loses cool points for doing such a horrid movie....anyone who gave this 5-stars deserves to be dragged out of their house and blugeoned with a lead pipe.
0,Dude where's the funny? This movie is not funny.Don't waste your money.I would love to give it 0 stars but apparently I have to give to give it at least one.
0,"Dude, Where's my stars? Ok, after seeing this movie, I hoped to myself that there was a way of getting those wasted hours of my life back at some point. It was a Friday night, and I figued I'll go see a movie with the boys, so they pick this film. Natually I lose the ticket, and have to buy a new one. The movie is ideal for those who like mindless slapstick humor, in fact, a group of mindless stereotypical teen girls sat next to me and made the film extra terrible with their chatter and ridiculous comments which went perfect with the film which was of the same caliber.Not a thinking film. Not much of a comedy. Interesting (...) experience on the part of the writer and producers, I bet."
0,"Movies Like this Should Not be Made I honestly don't see the appeal in this movie. I went to see it in the theater with a friend when it first came out, and I absolutely hated it. This movie is not funny. It is not even unintentionally funny because of how dumb it truly is. It is just a movie that we sbould have been spared of. I wish I could give it less than a 'zero' rating because I cannot find the words to describe my distaste for this movie. It is a horrible waste of time and money, and I'd like to have a slittle as possible to do with it. In fact, the only reason I am writing this review is to warn anybody else interested in seeing this to give it a second thought."
0,"Not worth the effort it's taking to write this. Every review here must have been written by a brain dead 14 year old. My brother recommended this movie to me (he was in 8th grade and I'm in college). I went with a friend and left after half an hour to go see ""Castaway"". THis is the only movie i have EVER walked out of. I used to think that was for pissy old parents who couldn't understand the movie. I even sat through Battlefield Earth to experience what is the worst movie of the young millenium. But this thing I could not bear to watch or listen to for it's breathtaking stupidity.Anyway when I got home I ...made (my) brother ... reimburse the 8.50 I spent on this steaming hunk of crap. Honestly if the rest of my generation finds this even remotely funny or entertaining, I worry."
0,"DON'T EVER WATCH THIS MOVIE There are only two movies that I have ever wanted to walk out on and demand my money back...Batman and Robin AND Dude Where's My Car. I rated this movie with one star, if I could assign negative numbers, I would. This movie is horrible, don't waste your time, it'll be an hour and a half of your life you will never get back!"
0,"Dude,Where's My Car? Dude,Where's the movie?First off we start with a ridiculous dream sequence opening.The movie itself makes you wish you were in a dream sequence.""Calgon take this nightmare away""It's too bad,because Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott are pretty funny in other things they've done.All in all a very dissapointing and useless experience.So if anyone says dude watch this movie,take my advice run screaming."
0,Disappointing No westerns here - and poor quality. Also does not contain 10 films as advertised. How do folks get away with advertising things like this?
0,This Is A Rip-Off The cover of this set specifically shows the two stars in a western together. There are no westerns with them together and 8 out of 10 of the movies are not westerns. This set is garbage and not even worth the 15 bucks it costs for the 10 movies.
0,"drivel A complete waste of time and money. I bought this based on a few songs I had heard on the radio. Unfortunately, the songs I liked on the radio were not on the album. Aparently the good versions are on the b-sides and remixes. You might want to look there first.I've only been able bring myself to listen to it a handfull of times. The album has no energy, no spark. None of the songs had that ""play it again"" interest. Several of the songs were of the ""let's not go there again"" variety.I bought other albums at the same time and they are wonderful: Olive 'Trickle', BT 'Movement In Still Life' and Delerium 'Karma'. I can repeat play all day and not get sick of hearing them."
0,"zZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz This CD is so boring! There are no good up beat trax on this cd, Buy this CD if you like for music to put you to sleep!"
0,"The most boring recording EVER! This is, in my opinion, techno at it's best. However, because it is techno, it's AWFUL. Every track here is about twice as long as it should be, and each gets boring after the first minute. I despise techno because it's always the same thing over, and over, and over. And over. And over. The sampling just rips off other artists, and what little new musical ingenuity exists is buried so deeply in the mix that all you hear is the damn drums and the same samples replayed indefinitely. A little bit of lyrical change would be nice too, instead of ""Rock y'all, gonna stock y'all, to the beat y'all, the bodyrock y'all"" twenty seven times over. And over. And over. And over. And over."
0,Unoriginal piece of boring work I bought this CD by reading the comments of few of the other reviewers and to say that I am disappointed would be less. This album in no way can be classified as Techno/Electronica or be compared to Prodigy/Chemical Brothers. Also the music is hackneyed and seems to be inspired by Enigma. Moby has lot more work to do to get into the genre of Prodigy or Chemical Brothers.
0,"not as good as all that this album - overated? yes. Overhyped? yes. overplayed? yes.are there any redeeming features? yes. the end.short, but to the point, this album is overated tripe, worthy of nothing but burning."
0,"Shame..... It's such a pity that so many 'top' artists today have to rely so heavily on the work of others. How can sampling the work of someone else be classed as original? Once again, this is an album created more from the effort and skill of others than from any new input. Sure, it's well put together, and it does have it's moments, but sadly, they owe their origins to other artists rather than Moby."
0,"Shallow... So I finally downloaded this entire album because of all I heard about it. Yet another shining example of why I should never trust mass opinion when it comes to music. Firstly, this is not techno. If you want techno, go listen to Underworld or Juno Reactor. This is ambient / electronic with soul / R&B samples. A rather intresting idea, but it comes off as remarkably cheesy and not very catchy either.If self-help books came with musical accompinaments, this is what they would sound like. Nice non-thought provoking, non-challenging background music for the masses to lap up. Yum!"
0,"Don't fall for it! Your heart isn't made of plastic! Why is this album held in such high regard? It sounds like some middle class white kid messing with his parents gospel records. The gritty heart-felt gospel recordings juxtaposed with the cold, synthetic, superficial beats, create an unsettling tension that sounds unintended. He should be made to leave his room and go out and get some exercise."
0,"music for car commercials i don't have this cd, but it was playing everywhere between mid-1999 and early 2001 - in stores, on tv, at work.....this is just ""pretty"" music that takes itself way too seriously. it's nothing original either."
0,"who knew? who knew that there was such a big audience for 93 style trip hop and adult lite jazz. i would recommend just about any electronic cd over this one. Hell, I would even recommend jock jams over this cd.MOBY is serious wack. he failed at his late attempt at switching to grunge rock and now hes jumped back into dance music with a seriously dated style. i gues there are a lot of people who have no clue about dance and electronic music. very dissapointing."
0,"No matter what I come up with, it's still too kind... Seriously, how can anyone like this dreck?But before I start my rantings, I must say that ""Bodyrock"" and ""Machete"" are awesome tracks. Unfortunately, in my opinion, they are the ONLY tracks worth listening to on the entire c.d.. Two tracks out of eighteen... Pretty sad average if you ask me.That is, of course, unless you like listening to old blues and gospel remixed with a techno-feel.But I do have to give credit to his label for picking ""Bodyrock"" as the first, and so far only, single to be released. Had they picked from the other anthing-but-sweet-sixteen pieces of trash, I honestly don't think that the c.d. would have sold more than 100 copys.But, to each their own."
0,"moby = genius Â¿? why Â¿? People are saying that moby is like a god, that he is one of the world best producer, people say that his this record, Play, is the album of the year, Â¿?. I have heard this is the best techno album ever. I cannot understand this things. Please forgive me, but in my view, Play is simply a bad album. The only thing moby has made, is sample some old soul vinyls, and put music behind. And believe me, that the only good things of this album are these voices, which are the only things moby has not made. The drums are simply bad produced, the music is simply, and his voice is, oh my god!, why anybody has say to moby that he cannot sign?. You could say me you like some of the album songs, but please, DON'T SAY ME THAT MOBY IS A GOOD PRODUCER AND DON'T SAY THAT PLAY IS ONE OF THE BEST 90's ALBUM!!!"
0,"Electronicrap lets put it this way: if you want to buy the juggling alchemists under the black light, or IFO by etnica/pleiadians, you can expect to pay hundreds of dallars. probably more if you want it on vinyl, or care about condition. i just saw a mint condition IFO on vinyl up for sale for a fitting $604.00. (goa). it's not a limited edition vinyl, it's not signed, it doesn't have extra tracks, most if not all of their fans have a downloaded version of it on their harddrives, and it's not pressed from solid gold. it's just a regular old IFO album. and people will buy it for that price. they will buy it because the pleiadians/etnica are genius. no one's spending $604.00 on a moby album. at this point you may be thinking that no album is worth hundreds of dallars. if so, that's because you listen to moby, and think play is a good album."

0,I pity the fool To me it is wrong morally for someone to use the work of people who have passed on in your music.the decest whose old blues vocals he samples arent able to defend there work from this evil techno machine.heres msomething original use a living persons voice for your vocals
0,"Don''t believe the hype Hearing wonderful reviews of Moby, I decided to check out this album myself. I was very dissapointing. To me, most of the first few tracks are unlistenable. The best song on the album, South Side, is terrific. A wonderful duet with Gwen Stefani of No Doubt, South Side can find a place in everyone's library of music.Porcelain is another good song, with a very relaxing string orchestra, and although it may not be better than South Side, it delivers very well.Don't be the album, just buy those two songs.It'll save you money and stress."
0,"Noise When I first listened to this album, I was startled to hear raspy voices and clunky piano sounds combined into what sounded like obnoxious noise. I thought, ""The whole cd can't be like this."" I was right: the rest of the songs are even worse. Moby has taken samples of gospel singing and thrown them together with syrupy, maudlin new-age sounds. The gritty texture of gospel voices does not compliment the wimpy, synethesized ""muzak"" - somehow, the ill-fitting combination makes both styles seem ludicrous. The best way to enjoy this music is from under the influence of some kind of mind-altering substance - but only if you're the type who enjoys having a bad trip."
0,"Moby takes a great idea out back and shoots it Is this the dullest CD of all time? I'm not sure, but it certainly is a candidate. Moby is on to a great idea -- the combination of found sound sources with beats -- but the problem is that this is well-tread ground. Many many many have been here before. Moby adds nothing to the genre. His source material is also mined from the same veins that have been used so much before. This is kind of like Fat Boy Slim -- but not as catchy.There is a great record yet to be made with this concept. This isn't it."
0,"One huge R.L.BURNSIDE ripoff--the rest pretentious drivel Another overrated record. Moby found some old blues recordings and slapped them on top of disco, probably because they are in the public domain and he doesn't have to pay any royalties. Sure he's ripping off the man, just like all the white boys of the past, and all the kids will buy it not knowing where to find the real thing. He is obviously desperate for a new direction, since this CD seems completely directionless. If you like these bogus beats, go get yourself some R.L. Burnside and treat yourself to the real thing."
0,"disappointed in the lack of ""content"" This album is just awful. I bought it expecting something completely different, like content. It's just a series of sampling tracks, as if Fatboy Slim teamed up with the mid 90's group ""Beautiful People"" for a duets album. It has one redeeming quality...I think it would be a valuable resource for an avertising exec for commercial music. I recognized two tracks that are currently background music in TV commercials. And don't get me started on the liner notes. Moby missed their audience with my purchase. My dog liked it though, he's crunching on it now."
0,"Just really terrible At first I kinda liked the album although it wasn't much to listen to . After a few more listens it just fell apart . Added to this was that the feeling you had heard all the songs before and by now it had really begun to grate on your nerves . It has the feeling of one song been sped up and slowed down and there are incidental words just thrown across it every now and then without thinking of the consequences . If you are a pop loving soul , then by all means buy this album ( if you haven't got it already ). If like Eminem ( which I also don't like but I think he's got a point with Moby ) then just don't listen to this . If you are looking for some really nice ambient dance music may I suggest The Orb or Boards Of Canada . They make music with a lot more imagination than you'll hear from this pile of waste"
0,"Lousy clock but terrific customer service I bought this clock to go in our kitchen. I wanted a clock with butterflies and they are difficult to find. I paid about $30 for it and I could have gotten a better quality clock at Target for $5. The clock was poorly built,noisy,and we could see through the faceplate to underlying numbers that had nothing to do with the clock. The first clock I received stopped working after 24 hours. I emailed the company to request my money back. The owner of the company contacted us by phone and email to resolve the problem. We should have insisted on our money back but we thought the owner was being fair so we accepted the replacement. The replacement clock unsurprisingly was just as bad as the first and now we have it in our garage where we don't care if it is poor quality. I wish the company had better quality clocks since the owner was obviously concerned about making his customers happy."
0,"burned skin, radiation? I have had this lamp for about 9 months now and I was happy with it until recently. I spend my time studying 4 to 5 hours at a time on week days. Lately I've noticed that my skin specially around my hands start burning when I'm doing work under the lamp. I tried placing it further away but the burn slowly built up as long as the lamp was turned on near by. Once I made this connection I immediately unplugged it and started using my old regular lamp and what do ya know, no more burning skin. It's a shame because I really liked the quality of the light, kind of like sun light. Unfortunately it seems to carry similar radiation properties because the skin burn from the lamp feels just like a skin burn from the sun. I make all of my amazon purchases based on reviews so I felt like I had an obligation to let others know. I hope this helps someone."

Pretty good PSU, cables are shorter than my previous GameXstream, which is good thing for me because it was really hard to fit those cable on my Antec P180. so far it works pretty goodUpdate: After 2 or 3 months this PSU just died on me for no apparent reason, I was downloading some stuff and set the computer to turn off when its over. When i got back home and tried the turn on my computer it just didn't had to buy another PSU. This is the second OCZ PSU that died on me in less than 6 months. I bought a Thermaltake this time, so far so good."
0,"Absolutely terrible This album is filled with some of the worst song writing I've heard in years. It somehow looses all its rythum after getting started, and sounds like a pop singer trying to find what the blues are. Just when you think Castro is about to get started and play some guitar rifs, he doesn't hesitate to disapoint you! How dare anyone compare this guy with Robert Cray!!! Save your money, wouldn't recommend this klunker to anyone."
0,"Ghastly If you have any interest in and concern for the written word in extended texts then this book is not for you: 95% of these designers seem to actively loathe it. It already looks out of date; grossly impoverished intellectually, this arty rubbish is of a piece with the poverty of contemporary trade book production."
0,"Could Be Better The game was almost unfinished, like they had to get it out by a certain deadline. For instance the two cars on the back of the cd case aren't in the game.

It's a new game, so you would think they would support this display, but alas, they do not. :(So, 1 star, since they don't offer good graphics support."
0,"Avoid this game at all costs. ... Roadsters is by far the worst gameavailable for the Dreamcast. Potential buyers beware, the cover artis the only thing this game has going for it.The graphics and sound are terrible, but what really irritates me is the pathetic play action. It's almost like trying to play a video game that's on demo mode. You have minimal control at best. Nasty stuff. Don't even rent it.Crazy Taxi and Speed Devils are much better driving games for the Dreamcast, buy those instead of Roadsters."
0,"Always searches for channels Has a nice feature set, but beware. Like the other reviewers, my phone sporadically and frequently goes into channel search mode, which breaks up phone conversations. Intolerable. I've had cheaper cordless phones by other manufacturers that were completely reliable (e.g., Toshiba). In fact, this was my first disappointment with cordless phones."
0,"poor sound, quality Bought this phone several years ago; should have returned it at once. Sound quality is poor and by about a year later, the LCD display began flaking out. The display and the selector wheel are now both useless. Battery has already been replaced twice and is dead again."
0,"Junk I have the exact same problem one of the other reviewers noted. The phone will just die out in the middle of a conversation. The only way to keep talking is to run over to the base and move the phone by the antenna. What's the point? Calls to Sony provided absolutely no help. When the phone works, it's cool, except the quality on the recorder is pretty bad. I'm out here looking for another phone to replace this one. I love Sony products (I've got TV, DVD, VCR, TIVO, Receiver, etc,) but I will never buy a Sony cordless again. I'm not the only one, either. Everyone I know that has had one has been disappointed. I guess they can't be great at everything!"
0,"A Very Poor Product This is a very poor phone and answering machine combo. Friends complain bitterly about the sound quality of the outgoing message. The sound quality of the phone is also substandard when compared to Panasonic & AT&T models. Finally, the incoming messages are almost incomprehensible. I own a SONY DAT machine and a television with which I am happy. But I have had consistent bad luck with SONY's other consumer electronics and I have recently learned of others who have had similar complaints with this phone. Don't buy this product."

0,"unwatchable however, being somewhat obsessive, i couldn't seem to break free...jejune, almost entirely empty, and nearly identical to a very bad and lengthy sitcom episode, except for the absence of the obligatory 50s laugh track...in the first two hours of my promised and blissful afterlife, i may very well look back upon the final two hours, and realize they were wasted in advance on this deeply malformed creature feature."
0,"Poor satire.... What a poor satire on office culture and a poor attempt on mimicing what is so successful in the Dilbert cartoons. I heard the movie was amusing, but when I watched it, I found nothing funny about it. I had to shut the movie off after 30 minutes of trying to find a good reason to laugh."
0,"By far one of the worst movies I've ever seen... EVER! If you value your time and money, don't waste 10 more seconds thinking about buying this horribly bad movie. You will want to write to the producers and ask them to give you an hour and a half of your life back. This movie is a tribute to the eternal question of, ""Why do people keep giving Jennifer Aniston movies?"" I'm not saying that this movie is the worst one ever made, but without a doubt it comes in a very close second."
0,"Not A Good Movie! Let me stress to you that this movie IS NOT funny. It may be one worst movies I've seen. I couldn't even sit through it. Don't even waste your time watching this movie, it will waste brain cells that could be used by something more interesting (like sniffing glue for example LOL...that is actually funnier than the movie gets) I suggest that if you haven't watched it spare yourself."

I expected great things from this movie based on the trilers the movie seemed like an interesting concept and something most people could relate to. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The only humor in this film are provided by two characters with about 5 minutes of screen time shared between them. I'll just say that this movie could have been done better."

0,"No. I can think of nothing right about this book. Its one redeeming quality is that it was not the movie based on itself; it was, however, only slightly less disturbing."
0,"What started out to be a beautiful movie....thrown in the trash! This was recommended to be a wonderful movie, not to be missed, in our local small town paper.Indeed it started out to be just that, even with viewing it in-between the English subtitles (German made, German language) Magnificent scenes of Africa, and beautiful people all through out. Then, right in the middle, and totally unnecessary by all standards, very graphic sex scenes between 2 of the characters. I could not believe it! It ruined what could have been a totally beautiful movie in scenery and story. I was so angry I immediately threw it in the biggest trash can I could find. I was so angry I didn't want to talk about it, let alone give time to write a review, until now. Enough said, don't waste time or money on this movie. I still have yet to speak to the man who wrote the recommendation but will the next time I see him. (I live out in the wilds of our Island, not in the town)"
0,"Not a happy customer This seller claims that if not satisfied with the product, they will issue you a refund as long as you send the product back within 30 days. Well is almost a month since I send the products back and I havent seeing no refund yet. I tried calling and sending the seller messages with no luck they wont return my calls or write. I also think that phone number given is fake, because nobody ever answers the phone."

Don't waste your time or money on this book, or any book of this author's."

Bottom line, too little too late."

0,"One star for the General Books LLC version My one star review is for the General Books LLC version and relates to the low quality of the publication. Check the publisher of the version you're buying before you place your order.General Books LLC created this book using automated OCR scanning. There are numerous typos and there may be missing pages. There's absolutely no editing done (the publishers website states this clearly). Overall, very poor quality at a higher priced than much better imprints from genuine publishers that actually edit their books. (Incicentally, the version you see when you ""Look Inside"" is from another publishers printing of this book).Unfortunately, General Books LLC is flooding Amazon with these low quality imprints. You've been warned."
0,"Horrible disappointment Perhaps I expected too much after hearing so many good things about this book. But I found it one of the most dull works of fiction I've ever read. I admit that Wolfe does has a prescient insight into the 80's greed mentality. But the writing and his use of language is sophomoric at best. This is one ""best-seller"" that clearly plays to a mass audience, but completely will be forgotten with time."
0,Totally defective The book was defective. chapters repeated themselves or were skipped all together. Evidently there was something wrong with the printing of the book.
0,Mirror Mirror I need to know the words in this song so I know what it is like before I buy it. The reason I did rated this CD with one star is because I've never heard it before.
0,"lame and wrong I was so delighted to get this book, but my happiness lasted until I read the first page. They mixed up characters with the picture of one and the entry of another. Example: Belladonna, the picture is Belladonna, Gambit's ex, but the entry is Belladonna, the minor Spiderman villian, there are other examples. Get the Official Handbooks if you want ACCURACY!! Believe me, they're much more reliable and more worth it!"

0,"Runaway very fast if your professor is using this! I am a grad student in ME specializing in thermal engineering, I've taken undergrad heat transfer and I have strong graduate level math and fluids background. Now that you know some of my credentials, let me say I HATE THIS BOOK! It skips steps and explanations! I am leaving this review to warn anyone who is learning this subject to runaway very fast from this book, you won't learn anything and you'll suffer... There are many better convective heat transfer books out there. The only good thing about this book is the numerous references to other books.On a last note: If you're learing this subject don't believe the reviewers that gave this book five stars, they must be paying off a debt to Bejan or have 30+ years experience in convective heat transfer!"
0,"A very difficult text book to learn anything from I get the impression that the reader from NH is the only reviewer to have tried to solve some of the problems in this book. There is no possible way to solve these problems. They are on subjects and situations not covered in the book, and even if they were, good luck in understanding Bejan's writing. He skips massive steps, giving only solutions and equations without explanations. Not everyone like reviewer Jeff Booth was born understanding convective heat transfer, so some of us must learn from books. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one. I only hope that Dr. Bejan reads these reviews and that they discourage him from making another failed attempt at text book writing."
0,"Waste of money Too bad ! I really thought this would help. Very cheaply made IMO. You're better off building one with a frame and some Rockwool. It'll get the job done. I didn't feel a huge difference, and actually didn't like the boxiness of the sound that I was getting. Using an old U87 + UA pre and Comp. Just not worth that kind of money, when you can DIY for less than 50 bucks. It looks cool, but I only care about sound."
0,"Don't Waste Your Money I took these new headphones on a cross country trip this week. Here's the results:1) There is no noise cancelling to speak of (aircraft engine noise was exactly the same with or without the headphones on).2) Volume level was so low I had to stop watching the DVD because I couldn't hear the sound loudly enough.3) When I was on the ground I switched to my MP-3 player and again the volume was very low (I took off the extension cord connector which helped slightly) and worse yet the sound quality was tinny, almost no base at all.There is nothing to recommend purchasing these headphones. I am frantically looking for my receipt so I can try to return them as quickly as possible."
0,"Terrible Headphones I only bought these because my cat chewed on my sony fontopia headphones and I was low on cash, and these were on sale for $25. I figured they hold me over for a week or two. A minute into the first song I regretted buying them. First of all, they're ugly as all hell. The only reason i got them is because they said they were noise cancelling and the original price was $70. The noise cancelling consists of a distracting static frequency, and there is no bass whatsoever. These are honestly terrible headphones. I should have gotten $15 sony earbuds, i would have been much happier."
0,Unreadable This book is poorly organized and written. Even the introduction requires the reader to understand material not yet introduced until later chapters. The author repeatedly alludes to subtleties and nuances which obscures clear meaning and hinders the learning process. The book is unreadable and I am returning it for credit.
0,"This Book Robs The Human Spirit Of Any Dimension For some reason, people keep recommending this book as a romance. This book mocks romance with all the cold-blooded WASPy detachment of its setting. The only interesting thing about it was that there was a character with the same name as me, which is rare, but that's not a good enough reason for anyone else to read it."
0,"Not Reader Friendly This book is hard on the eyes.I read part of it and gave up. All the graphs are printed in blue and uses different types of shading to show different regions. The font size is about 8 or 10. The size of the book is ackward more like what is suited towards an advertising pamphlet. Quite clearly, Penguin is being super cheap about printing this book. It was published in the last few years so I'm totally confused what's the issue here. I mean come on. I can print full color pages on my laser printer for about 3 cents a page. Why can't a big fancy publisher like Penguin do a decent job printing a book?Buy a different book, your eyes will thank you!"
0,"Disappointed I didn't find the music relaxing or energizing. I was too distracted by the fact that it reminded me of bad early 80s music. But on the plus side, it made me want to put on a shiny leotard and leg warmers."

0,"Boooo Harper Collins! For some reason Harper Collins specifically arranges for Canadians who buy ebooks via the Amazon.com website to get higher pricing and exclude them from sale pricing. I can't imagine why, it takes no more to deliver to us wirelessly and I'd have to assume our converted US funds are just as good."
0,"I Stopped Reading It A friend recommended this book as something that would encourage ""logical"" belief in God. I doubt he read it himself, first.Most of the claims he makes are based on assumptions, which makes for very frustrating reading."
0,"Murky Reasoning Although technically well written, Lewis' argument stumbles from one questionable assumption to the next. The result is a sad parody of logical thought.For a Christian this book is a gift, it reinforces faith that already exists. For those on the edge of faith, Lewis might be the push they are searching for. Other than that, it is unlikely to have any lasting effect on the reader."
0,"Paperback is cheaper? The kindle edition is more expensive than the amazon.com-sold paperback! This a wonderful text, but I can't justify getting it in the kindle format if it's even cheaper in the more-worthwhile paperback format. Go buy the actual, physical text!"
0,"Mere Delusion Some friends who found out that I was an atheist suggested this book. Being so highly praised in the Christian community, I decided to give it a try. It was soon apparent that the author had no deep understanding of religion, science, or logic. Mr. Lewis gives little or no justification for his beliefs. I did come away with greater understanding of how emotions can cloud one's better judgement. The only book I've read worse than this is I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FAITH TO BE AN ATHEIST."
0,"Primitive concepts outdated by todays understanding I have no doubt that C.S. Lewis was a fine man and he certainly set out to achieve a noble goal here. Making the spiritual more understandable through the application of logic has an undeniable appeal. Unfortunately, his assumptions about some of the basic concepts of human nature look positively naive by modern standards. He comes off sounding like, as one of my psych professors was fond of saying, a ""park-bench philosopher"". Behavioral science just had not developed to the point it has today, so he had no way of knowing that his basic assumptions about some things he viewed as givens were, in fact, not given at all. In the end, trying to make the subject of religion something that one can put to the test of ""logic"" is an exercise in futility. That's why it's called faith."
0,"Merely the same things rehashed I recieved this book as a gift from someone I thought to be an open-minded, good person. This book has nothing new in it. It is worthless. It is just another example of a poor deluded SOB trying to convince himself that he really likes the cage he was tricked into entering.This book is prosylazation. Prosylatizers, I have found, try to convert people because they are insecure about their faith, and think that by converting the world they will be secure in their faith. The truly faithful person does not prosylatize, for if one is secure in one's faith, why preach? If I could give this book a NEGATIVE FIVE, I would."
0,C.S. Lewis keeps on playing those mind games forever... Buy this book if you want to believe; skip it if you seek truth.
0,"disappointing and childish I bought this book hoping to find an intelligent defense of faith, given that the author is such a well respected fiction writer. Unfortunately, what I found were the kinds of arguments that I used while in grade school and discarded soon thereafter. If you've thought critically about anything at any point in your life, you're not going to get anything out of this book."
0,"Long may Lewis burn in Hell There is no way I can rate this trite negatively enough.I was forced to read this book. Even if I hadn't been, had I seen it in a book store, just that would have been enough to eliminate previous like of the Narnia series. I once thought of them as fiction, now I know they are Christian allegory.Anyone who believes this already believed anyway, because Lewis hops to conclusions without any links to his premises. Besides which, he begs the question."
0,"highfalutin drivel I was looking forward to diving into this collection after reading so many positive reviews. Sunday Times writes: ""He is admirably equipped to write spiritual biography for the plain man, for his outstanding gift is clarity"".My answer to that review and this book is this: Unless you are a scholar you soon will find yourself drowning in a morass of words you most likely have never heard before or never use in everyday life. The problem with highly intelligent people, like C.S Lewis, is this: they do not know how to communicate their ideas in plain language so that ""plain"" people can understand what they're saying. I call that ignorance.These books are mostly filled with highfalutin, pompous, non-sensical drivel.Unless you are highly intelligent don't waste your money."
0,didn't recieve that product/ credit card was billed i never received that book even though my cc was charged. it might have been sent in august but i wonder if they are still printing the book for me?? and walking it to maryland.i do not recommedn this source and had i known this would happen i never would have used amazon.com
0,"Boring I'm sorry but Mr.Lewis' writing struck me as pedantic and boring. I was initially interested in his works because of my readings in grief literature. I couldn't get into any of his stories. They seemed dry to me. I like the idea behind his ""Screwtape Letters"" but it didnt hold my attention. I am glad he is well read but personally I am just not into his books."
0,not very good.. i could only read half an hour of this critically aclaimed outline. its too wordy/complicated for even the very seasoned christian.
0,"It was lucky to get the one star. CS Lewis managed in the Chronicles of Narnia to prove his mastery of the clumsy religious allegory. And, with Mere Christianity, he tries to approach the thorny topic of God's existence and the divinity of Jesus using ""logic"" and ""reason."" It's as subtle a piece of elegant design and craftsmanship as any tractor factory in Rostok.Facile arguments are bolted together using bold assumptions and the Krazee-Glue of faith. It's amazing that anyone could send such a clunky contraption to plough furrows in logic and reason and sow the seeds of unconditional belief. I read that book and I think think the only thing he got right was the title, which is bang-on."
0,"Disappointing Though Lewis is often described as one of Christianity's best thinkers and writers, this book (actually three books combined) does not support any such description. While easy to read, this book contains nothing but overly simple reasoning, faulty logic, double-speak, and unsupported--and unsupportable--conclusions. This is a book to avoid unless you want a lesson in how to write an easy to read, but intellectually dishonest, book on religion."
0,"Book Quality This is not a review of Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis was a genius.This is on the quality or better yet the lack of quality of the manufacture of this book; the paper is the cheapest grade imagineable,the binding is also very low grade, and to top it off the publisher didn't cut the pages evenly.I thought for the price they were charging the paper and binding would be of good quality, needless to say I was greatly mistaken.Buy a paperpack edition from another publisher, you'll get a much better made book and save money at the same time."
0,"Disappointing Lewis fails to support any of this major claims and fails to take seriously any argument other than his own. I was very disappointed as many have spoken well of this book.His ""argument"" would only appeal to someone who is already a Christian; non-Christians who are looking for a good logical argument supporting Christianity will be disappointed.The book's version of a water-down version of Plato's theory of forms--spiced up with a touch of Aristotle--represents, at best, middle-brow religious theorizing."
0,"Oh please... is it something in the water? The title shoud be changed to ""I'm now a Christian and here's why...."" I won't even bother to discuss the silly analogies and ridiculous attempts at logic to be found in this ""masterpeice"" of his. This book is great to Christians merely because it is a written example of one who has ""chosen the light"" and had a PhD, hooray! Also, the mere idea that there's still a war between science and religion in 2001 should baffle everyone and those responsible should find better, more constructive things to do with their life. If you are seeking the Truth, look to those whom you trust and ask them. Or look inside yourself for the answers, most are already there. Good luck to everyone and may God have mercy on your souls."
0,"Don't waste your time Perhaps this was ""on the edge"" years ago - now it is just a very slow read. The main character needs to grow up."
0,"A disappointing book. The heroine is a bloody racist (which is taken for wit, I guess). What a turn-off."
0,"Protofeminist Psychobabble--Not Worth Your Time I tried giving it a shot but the book is (1) not sexy, as it is marketed, (2) about a lurid main character/narrator whom I can't follow, (3) filled with 1970s-style Freudian psycho-bull that attempts, amateurishly, to explain gender roles and relations, and (4) very solipsistic. It doesn't seem at all like fiction but the bickerings of a sexually frustrated woman who thinks too much about herself and who doesn't seem to be all that bright but manages to parade under some kind of feministic pseudo-intellectual banner. I just found the narrator despicable and didn't finish the book. I can't believe it has such a high review on Amazon, which means, I guess, that the majority of people reading it in 2011 are people who are already sympathetic to the book or author.Don't bother. If you want sex pick up Anais Nin or Zane or Philip Roth--anything else that has a story or good prose style, just not this."

0,"WOOF! Hard to imagine that a film with Burt Lancaster, Irene Pappas and Ingrid Thulin, and with music composed by Morricone could be so bad. However, the Video Hound Golden Retriever gives it a well-deserved ""WOOF!"", the lowest rating for those who don't know the book. An introspective Moses is fine, but the remainder of the cast is underused and underserved. What hurts most is the anachronistic expresssion of ideas expressed in equally anachronistic language. A good alternative to this and Demille's Ten Commandments glitz is Moses featuring Ben Kingsley."

0,"Typos, typos, and imbecilities There are SO many typos in the answer keys of some of the exercises [I feel that it] render almost all the sample tests useless (unless one goes back question by question to find all the errors, and since one is unlikely to go back to look at a question believed to have been answered correctly, one doesn't actually know how well one has done.) Worse, in the section meant to analyze capabilities, [I feel] it is often assumed that one doesn't know how to do a question -- and hence the only correct answer is to say that one has guessed!As a result, one may be misled to work on a course of study that is unnecessary, and miss the one that is!A shocking piece of work."
0,"I don't know, maybe it's just me. I didn't laugh. I love comedies that are cleverly made. 'Dodgeball' had all of the SNL ingredients and that's what made it old. The concept of a movie based on the game of dodgeball is brilliant, it just wasn't executed right. This could have been a marriage made in heaven with Ben Stiller and a 'Rocky'-type ending. But there's no emotion here and the jokes are stale 90's retro. How many times do you have to throw in a 'lesbian' joke or mock Asian people? I would be ashamed to even be associated with a movie that puts down people who are in the minority.Yes, the film did great at the boxoffice, but so what? The crowd went to see Ben Stiller and the concept of dodgeball. I think this film brought the American comedy to yet another low. Will someone please bring back the great American comedy?"
0,"Could this picture be worse??? I have seen some bad movies in my time but nothing compares to this stinker (well Dumb and Dumber comes close)! The film looks like it was filmed in someone's garage. The lack of any real plot, the lame hokey formulaic sentimentality and the atrocious and overdone (so-called) acting of Ben Stiller (quickly sinking his career into oblivion) leaves one in a stupor or was it nausea? I enjoy a no-brainer as much as anyone but this one requires a lobotomy to derive a feeble laugh. Stay away and please Rawson Marshall Thurber please consider a career change."
0,"A Republican Movie This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, not even ""stupid"" funny, the people that liked or loved this movie voted for Bush........The Presidential Inauguration of George Bush, now that was funny........The fact that people found this movie funny is simply amazing and reflects the lack of taste so prevalent in our society"

0,"Lose 90 minutes of your life that you'll never get back..... This movie is horrible. I saw it at a matinee because it was doing really well at the box office and I figured if a lot of people were going to see it that it must be pretty funny. Well, that was wrong; this movie was very, very stupid and I didn't laugh once. I would rather spend 90 minutes cleaning the bathroom or reading the dictionary - you get the idea. Don't waste your time. If you're stubborn, then rent it before you buy it so you can see for yourself how stupid this movie is. Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are funny guys, but this movie is like a paint by numbers (done by someone with shaky hands)."
0,"What a bunch of Bozos This is not exactly top shelf drama. Mostly very juvenile type humor, if you want to call it that. Two thumbs down!"
0,"The amount of 4 and 5 star reviews is insane. This movie is not in the least bit funny. Ben Stiller is not funny anymore he needs to stop releasing films every two months. Vince Vaughn is NOT FUNNY. Everyone in this film is so satisfied with themselves and they must certainly be cracking up after the director yells cut, but they forgot to make the AUDIENCE laugh along with them. I am sick of hollywood giving us the same three people in every comedy. Harold and Kumar is the best place to go for some fresh faces in comedy and a much funnier and much better over all film experience. Dodgeball is comedy for those smokin the wacky tobacky, or people who just find every little damn thing hilarious. I wish I was so easily amused."
0,sucks big red balls This movie is so stupid and immature. I don't think I laughed once the whole movie. The plot didn't make me care for any of the characters or the lame story. I think maybe this movie was just trying too hard to be funny. Thank God it was just a rental! Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.
0,"Weakest Link is the Star I saw this movie on an airplane, flying New York to Sao Paulo. A long flight, so I was ready for something lame to pass the time.I got it: something lame.Ben Stiller is the stupidest part of this movie: He doesn't deliver much comedy. He's a Johnny One-Note who made me tired after his first 30 seconds.The rest of the movie was passable. I would have given it 3 stars for being a pleasant way to survive a 10-hour, cramped and crowded flight.But Stiller was so boring, so pointless, so NON-funny, that I knocked the movie down to 1 star.I sense all his movies are like that: overblown, stupid, not funny.Which is too bad, because the supporting cast did OK."
0,"wow I gave it one star because two hot girls kissed at the end. Just kidding. This is a movie made for young teenage boys like me who want to see that sort of thing and also have a low intelligence level so that they will laugh when somebody gets hit in the head with a wrench. Forget the fact that they've seen it 20 times in previews on TV. Wow, maybe I took the movie too seriously. I guess it's all just a matter of opinion. Speaking of which, see Napoleon Dynamite! My friend loved Dodgeball and hated Napoleon, and I was the other way around. Go figure."
0,"Terrible Does not fit the window in our 2008 Prius at all. In fact the left side of the shade is considerable taller than the right. Not sure who was in charge of quality control the day they made ours, but they must have been drunk.It does seem to be made of quality materials, but what does that matter when it can't be used due to the incorrect size?The shade is also far too bulky when rolled up. Not a problem if you don't ever plan on having people ride in your back seat or if you don't mind storing it in the hatch and getting it out of there whenever you park or don't mind taking it down and storing it back there when you leave.All in all this thing gets an F from me.

0,"The drills are worthless, but the packaging is cute I'd love to be in a position to recommend what to buy instead of these, but I don't have a clue. I've always sworn by Irwin bits. I bought my current cobalt set about 4 years ago and they are still going strong. So I thought I was doing my son a favor when I bought him this set. That is until we dulled two bits trying to extract a broken bolt last weekend. Perhaps the bolt was made out of a new, super-hard steel? Nope. I used a bit from my set, and it went through the bolt like butter. The quality may have gone south, but the packaging on his set is oh-so-cute. Someone at Irwin surely got a bonus for making that trade-off."

0,"Do NOT buy this edition of Democracy and Education This edition of the book is absolutely awful. The type is small and printed in a grayish fuzzy font that is hard to read. The margins are almost nonexistent. There is no space to write notes, not even at the bottom of the page. You will notice that this book is only 194 pages, whereas I recently found a very good used copy that is 378 pages. Both are unabridged, but in this edition the text is crammed onto the pages. Also, just scanning through the book today I quickly found two typos. Avoid this cheaply constructed edition. I sincerely hope Amazon stops selling it."

0,"lazy publisher The edition of ""Jude the Obscure"" that I believe you're seeing on this page -- the Signet paperback, with the two horses on the cover -- first came out in '61 and hasn't been touched since then (except to add a bibliography in 1980). There is a helpful 11-page afterword by Al Alvarez, but that's it. Signet has just been reissuing and reissuing the same thing for over four decades.With the Signet, though, there are no footnotes; you're just getting the bare text. That means that you'll have zero help with Hardy's rustic or ecclesiastical terms, not to mention the abundant Latin.In short, get this one:Jude the Obscure (Oxford World's Classic), in which said defect is remedied. And unlike the Signet, in which the text has adjusted to reflect modern spelling and pronunciation, the Oxford's World's Classics is Hardy's original text as he saw it published."
0,"Fine Story, Low Quality eBook The digi reads edition doesn't even have a table of contents making it completely useless in the classroom. There is no way to navigate by book sections, chapters or anything of the like. If you are reading straight through for fun, this might be fine, but if you are reading critically and need to quickly navigate sections it's pretty much impossible."
0,Blah Not a great book. A required reading for a class and I could barely keep on reading it. Good luck.
0,Palmer blew it BIG STYLE! Throughout the 80's Robert Palmer released some great albums and thus built himself a reputation for high levels of musicianship and an air of suave sophistication. But if you ask me on this album Palmer blew it big style. The problem is he has taken on too much himself playing most of the instruments himself and masterminding the production. As David Lloyd so rightly says in his review the album has too much keyboard on it and ends up sounding to clean and clynical even on the more soulful tracks. The whole album left me 'Stone Cold.'
0,"A Wretched Production This reprint is so ugly in its typography and layout that I sent it back and bought a used copy of the 1970 edition. The reprint is smaller than the original, and to compensate, the publishers have not only cut the margins down to almost nothing, but have compressed the text horizontally so that the character glyphs are unpleasantly out of proportion. Do not buy this edition unless you are completely indifferent to typography and graphic design."

0,"Cults? This is an ongoing fundamentalist christian belief (that's been around forever) that no one can be a christian unless you came to God in their prescribed manner.If you don't, you're either a cult such as Mormons or simply (non) christian which would include the Catholic church.Meditation has been in the past and is apparently still considered evil to the fundamentalist christian even though it's nothing more than prayer.I can't understand why any Christian would promote such hate - isn't it the opposite of what Jesus taught."

The entire screen would cut out as well as the sound. Makes me wonder if this HDMI cable can fully support 1080p or not. At least it was cheap. You get what you pay for.
0,"Stopped working after 9 months I'm really ticked off about this cable! I bought it in November. And now on August 1st it stopped working today. I took the laptop downstairs to another HDMI cable and it worked fine. This Cable on 2 different tvs did not work all of the sudden. I connected a Blue-Ray today and the connection was going in and out. I thought it was my wireless connection until I realized the video out to the tv was not working on the laptop where an internet connection was not necessary. No warranty.It doesn't matter if it's a good deal if it doesn't even last a year! I have HDMI cables that have been connected from receivers, etc. to the tvs for over 5 years! I won't buy from here again!."

0,"The Studio Managed To Destroy A Classic Tale This dvd release is so horrible. This movie should have been restored to the level it deserved to be. They made it full screen with lousy, awful, distorted sound and I guess the bonus features are the extra grainy picture and ugly cover art. All of us fans of the movie deserve a re-release of the dvd complete with bonus features, 5.1 sound, complete digital restoration and more of a mystical,magical, beautiful cover to the dvd. They should know by now that they can sell more if they give us more.Studio people please rescue this film from complete destruction."
0,"The Last Unicorn VHS Actually I would like the option to give this tape a 0 star rating. I bought this video for my pre-school aged nephews as a Christmas gift. I thought a Rankin Bass video would be good/safe for children. I finally watched it with them the other day. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone. The characters in the story swear. A haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying ""Damn you, damn you!"" The knight/hero character says ""Damn."" A troll type creature says something like ""What the Hell, am I supposed to look at."" and a magician takes God's name in vain after being accosted by a tree he brought to life, which is a buxom ""woman tree"" who makes a pass at the magician. Shocking. If my nephews went up to their parents and used these expressions from the movie, they would be reprimanded by their parents who do not talk like that. I now know that I need to preview every video I buy for my nephews before giving them a present. Shame on Rankin Bass"
0,"long and weird This movie is very long, and very weird and a little too scary for my 6 year old girl who likes unicorns. It's quite dark and depressing for a kids movie."
0,"CUSS Words for children!!!! Give me a break! If you monitor what your children watch, don't buy this as it has several incidences of foul adult language! It has the word ""damn"" in it twice and other situations that are for adults. I gave it a one star because the graphic animation is nicely done."
0,"Can't Manage to think about it... The Last Unicorn is a TERRIBLE movie, for one the DVD release was very poor, and some aspects of the film weren't made for children...or ANYONE, for that matter. There isn't really a point to this film, so DO NOT BUY IT!"
0,"This is wonderful movie, but an awful release of it Let me start by saying that The Last Unicorn is my favorite movie of all time. I have loved it since I was very, very young. However, I truly wish I had never bought this DVD.First off, the movie is full screen and not widescreen--this could easily be forgiven if the DVD didn't have numerous other problems. The picture quality is awful and looks as though they ripped the movie from the old VHS master. There are also some scenes where the contrast seems to be up too high. I know that these are not simply issues with the original movie because I have the German release and its picture is flawless (not to mention widescreen) and beautiful. This release also has one of the worst menus I have ever seen. The DVD says it has special features, but I can't find them!If you're a hardcore Last Unicorn fan, don't buy this DVD. Your old VHS version is just as good."
0,"Don't Buy this dvd!!! The reason you should not buy this dvd is not because it is a bad movie. The company releasing it has taken all profits due to the author of the story. The websites www.conlanpress.com\youcanhelp, and www.unicorntears.com have all the pertinent info, don't support these thieves. I put my vhs version onto dvd."
0,"Wonderful movie, but terrible DVD ""The Last Unicorn"" is one of my favorite childhood movies, and the movie itself certainly deserves 5 stars. However, the DVD version is so poor, quality-wise, that I cannot recommend it. I read the reviews here at Amazon before purchasing it, but I thought surely it couldn't be as bad as everyone was making out. I'm no DVD expert, so I thought perhaps it was only DVD aficionados who were upset. However, I was mistaken. It really is terrible. All I care about is having a nice, clear picture, and this print is dark, dirty, and flickers strangely throughout the film. It's a shameful way to treat a wonderful movie. I only hope that it will be re-released properly at some point!"
0,not for small kids I was shocked thatthis had a G rating with the language used. Not for small kids who are impressionable and repeat what they hear. Other than that a good fanatsy story.
0,"Great movie, stunningly disappointing DVD release I have no idea what they did to the soundtrack of this release - it is horrible! There is inappropriate background music that almost drowns out the dialog in some scenes. Most of the actual songs seem normal, but the mixing levels between the voices, sound effects, and ""ambiance"" music is way, way off.The color transfer also seems very shoddy in places - too dark in several scenes, such as at the outlaws' camp.Altogether, it is horribly disappointing to see such a wonderful movie treated in this way."
0,"Shame on you Artisan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Artisan Entertainment has put out some beautiful DVDs in the past. The new T2 Extreme and Stargate Director's Cut are just a couple. This pan and scan release of The Last Unicorn is a true travesty. I have never seen a worse picture in my life on a DVD. Yes, it's that bad. Shame on you Artisan, F.H.E., Carlton, and whoever else had anything to do with this DVD. This is a classic, beloved movie and it deserves so much better than this."
0,"WONDERFUL MOVIE BUT HORRIBLE DVD RELEASE!!! I have been waiting for a region 1 dvd for a long time and I couldnt wait to watch this wonderful film on my widescreen HDTV, only to find out this has been released fullscreen, so I decided to rent this movie instead of buying. Not only is this movie fullscreen but it looks like a bad VHS transfer. unexcusable! This dvd should have never been released like this. ..."
0,"Kids will love it - parents will hate it My three year old adores this movie. It does have a good plot and interesting characters, and there are some pretty funny scenes, so I can understand her feelings on that level. However... the soundtrack is DEPLORABLE. The music is mostly done by America, in their typical depressing, 70's-awful style. The lowlights are numbers sung by Jeff Bridges (who voices Lear) and Mia Farrow (who voices the unicorn). These two just can't sing. It's wonder they didn't die of shame when this movie was released. Worst of all, the songs have a tendancy to stick in your head until you wish you were dead - they're really that bad. In fact, my audiophile college-age nephew who lives with us refuses to stay in the house while my daughter is watching this movie. His ears just can't take it, I suppose. If you want to introduce your kids to this story, spare your ears and get Peter Beagle's classic book instead."
0,"Very disappointing I remember loving this movie. Now I reget buying it due to the extremely poor quality of the DVD. Aside from the grainy picture quality and poor sound and music, I am very angry that there was no mention that this was the FULL SCREEN version on Amazon. I will keep this in mind the next time I consider purchasing something through them."
0,"Great movie, awful, censored release! I've absolutely loved this movie since I was a kid. Watched it so often that I wore out our first VHS copy and we had to buy a second one decades ago.I finally bought the DVD version, excited to at last see it in widescreen, but was shocked when I put it in the DVD player! They went through and censored out all the ""curse words."" It's not as if this was particularly filthy language, just a few stray instances of ""damn"" and ""hell."" These words are heard everyday, even on daytime television--not exactly something you are going to be able to shield anyone from anyway.Knowing the film nearly word for word after all these years, I was horrified that they would put out such a sanitized version. Sickened, really.I'm holding out in the hopes that they will re-release it with the proper, unedited version. Until then, don't waste your money on this version."
0,"Love the story, but the DVD looks *horrible* This is possibly the worst DVD transfer of a movie I've seen since the orignal release of ""Hunt for Red October"". It's dark, solid colors exhibit shimmer, there's motion blur everywhere and it's *fuzzy*. The VHS version has higher picture quality! The sound is muddy and seems to be mono, though it claims to be 2.0 stereo.I loved this movie as a kid, and I'd recommend this DVD if it didn't look awful. If you can find it, get the German import version - it's region 2, meaning you'll have to have a region-free player, and all the menus are in German. However, it's been fully remastered - sound is 5.1 surround, video is clear and bright. And it's widescreen as well."
0,"Don't buy it here Buy it from Conlan Press online for the same price. Or if you want to pay extra you can get a signed copy. Why? Because otherwise the writer of the film will get no proceeds, because the company that orignally made this film (Granada) has been refusing to pay him any royalties for the past 20+ years since the movie came out, and generally treating him horribly. Lionsgate, however, worked out a deal to let him sell some copies through Conlan Press online, so if you buy from there, he'll get a cut."
0,"Possibly the worst DVD transfer I've ever seen First things first: This is a nice movie for kids, particularly little girls. The story is compelling, though the animation is pretty lousy. The music, written by the estimable Jimmy Webb and sung by America, is quite good. I'd give the movie 3 stars on the whole, 4 stars for a little girl.Now for this particular DVD. It's absolutely attrocious! The picture looks no better than an average VHS cassette. Worse (MUCH worse), the soundtrack suffers from noticable pitch inconsistencies. It sounds like a dub from a BAD cassette tape. There is no excuse for this, and I've never seen (or heard) a poorer DVD transfer.If you already own this movie on VHS, there's no reason to spend any money to get his version. It's surely no better than the copy you have, and is (because of the soundtrack wow and flutter) arguably worse."
0,"Eats batteries and min. to start I owned this CD-player for 2 days and then returned it. I'm sure mine must have been a lemon, cause they can all be this bad. It took anywhere from 1 to 5 min. before it would play the first song, then after about 8 songs, the batteries went dead. So I put in a new pair, and again 8 to 12 songs later - dead batteries.., it also wouldn't play all the songs on the cd.Even the sound quality was poor!"

D-Link should stick to networking products...the moment i put batteries on this mp3 player, i knew something was really wrong with it...sound quality was horrible, battery life was horrible, skipped all the time, even when i pressed any button, it would reset itself all the time...i give it 1 star because i can't give it any less...DO NOT BUY THIS!!!...i returend it the next day and bought a RIO CD-MP3 player...MUCH MUCH BETTER!!!!!"
0,"Blah! Me and this MP3 player never seemed to hit it off. It skips everywhere--even in the car--so the music I'm listening to gets interupted left and right. The battery life is horrific, the sound quality is ok, but man, what's the point if you can't walk around with your portable player if it skips? I wouldn't recommend this if you like to actually move around."
0,"One of the worst products I have ever owned! Not only does D-Link make cheap generic imitations of real network products, but now this. Worst of all they are still in business. The earphones are extremely uncomfortable and it chewed up a 5 dollar pack of Duracell Ultras in less than 1.5 hours and it skips! Welp, you get what you pay for! Thank goodness for my Sony MZR-90 Minidisc with 35 hours of playback and sounds better too!"

0,"not too late for tears This is the worst quality DVD we have ever received and have already sent it back for a refund. It was obviously taped from TV with annoying cuts and missing footage. The overall quality was abysmal. We rent and buy lots of older films and this is the worst one we have EVER gotten. Whoever packaged this should be ashamed. In addition, the title was misspelled on the package (to instead of too). That should have been a tip off to the quality of the DVD."
0,the movies was OKbut the copy was TERRIBLE It looked like several generations from a scratched old film master. The worst copy of an older movie I have EVER seen -- and I'm pretty tolerant because I love old films that were produced much earlier than this (and were much better copies).
0,"Fabulous Lizabeth Scott Noir Ruined By Horrid Transfer This is an excellent film noir, with the classic cold-as-ice femme fatale played by the fantastic Lizabeth Scott. Too bad the transfer is horrid - key dialogue fades in and out, skips like a bad record, and over-contrasted picture settings that leave little, if anything, to be seen in the important opening sequences. One plus about this release is the knowledgable special features on Dangerous Dan and Lizabeth....these are great! Too bad such a fine film has such a muddy (as-in-I-filmed-it-from-a-drive-in-in-the-backseat-on-my-mobile-phone) quality to it. A real disappointment."

0,"Let down I bought this model last month; was excited about the ""triple sensor"" features. It is a let down! It's basically good for just telling time.The compass settings were off; had to be recalibrated manually.The barometer readings don't help much in predicting the weather... The manual go back and forth on its usefulness.The altimeter readings are useless; they have to be recalibrated every time you change altitudes significantly.The thermometer is accurate -- but only if aren't wearing the watch for 30 minutes!The countdown timer goes up only to 60 minutes.The backlight doesn't have the ""stay on"" feature that Timex indiglo watches have. So, when you are trying to make settings to the watch in the dark, you are constantly interrupted by the fact the the light goes off after 2.5 seconds.

0,"What a letdown!! Like others, I had to force myself to read this book to the end as it was about characters I didn't really care about. The constant use of hymns, prayers and poetry was boring and perhaps a way to stretch the book to fufill a publishing contract. It would have been far better to address readers' questions about Dooley, Kenny and Lace in the previous book and ended the series at that point. This was a hugely disappointing book as the characters loved in Mitford made essentially brief and shallow appearances. Jan Karon herself appears to have been bored with Mitford and this lazy effort cheats the loyal reader of a satisfying end to the series. I will not be reading the Father Tim novels and believe Jan Karon's reputation is lessened by her milking the series this way. Don't waste your money. Check this one out of the library."
0,Deeply Disappointing I agree with all of the reviewers who were disappointed in this book. What I had hoped for was a final visit to Mitford with stories about all my favorite characters and a nice tying up of loose ends. Instead we are introduced to a myriad of new characters who aren't very interesting especially as this is the final book in the series and their stories will go no further. What was Ms. Karon thinking? I wanted so much for the final book in the Mitford series to be about Mitford! Definitely wait and get this book from the library - its not worth adding to your Mitford collection.
0,"Very disappointed This book was a real disappointment. It just quits and does not tie up the story. The reader is left hanging. I was reading it on the airplane and thought that I had misplaced my bookmark and missed the completion of the story, but no I hadn't - it isn't completed. I felt the author just became tired of writing the book and quit. The previous book was also not as well written as the others and I won't buy another by this author."
0,"Nars Orgasm Lip Gloss...save your money $24.00 for a lip gloss, that's a pretty heavy duty price point for a lip gloss. I expect a LOT from gloss this expensive and high end.I ordered a tube of ""Orgasm"" and expected the perfect nude lip. Nope! There just isn't anything about this gloss that impressed me. It was sticky. It wasn't very opaque. There was so little color payoff! I have had comparable (or dare I say, better!) glosses for 1/5th the price. I can't believe I'm about to type this, but L'Oreal makes a gloss a million times better than this at 1/4th the price! Try NYX's glosses at 1/6th the price (and I like them better than the L'Oreal). Please don't buy into the hype of the Orgasm gloss. You won't have an orgasm when you use it, you'll be saying, ""That's it..?"""
0,"""Crippled"" Has to Go; New Title Needed While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as ""special"" or ""crippled,"" I would never recommend it, because of the title, which is bad as ""The Nig**er Lamb"" would be. Get it? I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called ""crippled"" and terms like ""special"" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause children to be perceived even more as ""special"" instead of different but equal."

You give zero extras and you ignore the theatrical R version (that is easily available!) and release the sanitized later PG version? you got it! I know others have mentioned this but I'm shocked the studios would do this. Booooo! (ok i feel better!) The film deserves 4 stars in my opinion, if you can dvr it off cable I would highly recommend. The dvd gets 0.0 stars....Mr Blutarski"
0,"BUTCHERED CLASSIC It's amazing how one cut can ruin a film. Well, here's the proof! I can understand why Barbra demanded her topless scene destroyed, but editing the 'F' word in a major key scene is unforgivable.

0,"Shallow and unprofessional book In short: Shallow, not informative and not professional. Suitable to pre-beginners, if ever. No samples at all.

After the great disappointed I experienced in purchasing this book, I stopped buying books from Amazon anymore."

If the love of your life was just kidnapped and tortured to death, your dog had just been run over and killed, and your doctor just told you that you have both AIDS and Ebola, this might be a good time to see this movie. Even with all your bad news, you could still feel good that you were not the producer or director of this movie. This movie is a triple threat: bad script, bad acting, and bad directing. Even having Tom Cruise doesn't save this flick. I wish Amazon's rating system allowed me to add negative stars rather than just give it one."

After the fact I realized it said:NON-USA FORMART(?) . I would never order an video from this company again. And I hate having to go through the return process too-such an inconvenience.
0,video what video? how can i review the movie Endless love when i cant seem to get help to buy it!! how do you buy this movie???HELP!!!if you cant buy it now WHEN????
0,"Contamination of any sound intellect...... This movie is about some guy who has a one night stand. He owns up his betrayal, to his then, supposed to be future wife. In his guilt he tells her that maybe she should date other people, not thinking that she would actually have the nerve to do it. Boy was he wrong. I'll admit that after I started to become aware of what type of movie this was and how much it stunk, I ""flipped"" through the chapters. This movie showcases infidelity and sexually immoral behavior. This movie should not only be offensive to just African Americans, but to anyone who has a thread of descency or family values."

0,"Wimperella.... I normally don't take the time out for a review, but I am now.I probably own at least a dozen different Cinderella movies, and this has to be one of the weakest.Cinderella herself is a total weakling. She is entirely passive. Everything happens to her - she really doesn't take an active roll. She lets her stepmother take everything away from her. She lets herself be bossed by the stepsisters. She lets herself be talked out of marrying the prince. This Cinderella NEVER stands up for herself.The music drags and is often inappropriate. There's a whole song and dance number in a mausoleum - the prince and his man at arms dance around the crypts of dead kings.The only good point in this is Richard Chamberlain. The one star is for him.Save your money - buy A Tale of Cinderella or Ever After instead - better music, and the Cinderella characters don't just let themselves get pushed around."
0,"the slipper and the rose the most boring version with dumb songs i had been wanting to see this movie for like forever because of everyone's opinion of it. i finally saw it on megavideo and I'd have to say this is the worst version I've ever seen. Sure the costumes are beautiful and Richard Chamberlain makes for a very handsome prince. But the story reeks with boredom,the characters are unimpressive especially Cinderella herself even though she does have a beautiful voice. And the songs! oh my god! they suck! they are not catchy or entertaining! What could have been a 5 star epic tale went terribly wrong and turned out to be a big snooze fest! I would not recommend this to anyone. What I would recommend however is the Disney animated version and all 3 versions of Rogers and Hammerstein instead. Better story! Better songs!"
0,"A Collection of Intros I hate to say this, but the cover art is the best part, by far, of this CD. I own EVERYTHING Mannheim Steamroller has ever produced, and I know what to expect from Chip Davis' eclectic arrangements. That being said, I was very underwhelmed by this offering. What it seems to be is a collection of intros that end before getting to the ""meat"" of the songs.If you are looking for something that will leave you whistling familiar Disney tunes, this isn't it."
0,"All show, no go. The key word in the title is ""unique."" I'll give it that. I'm sure the contents pass muster as ""art,"" and in that regard, I know what I like; this ain't it. Most of these tracks take forever to go anywhere and sound like Chip Davis & Co. have just discovered synthesizers and looping software. The only really listenable track is ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah"", which establishes fairly quickly and at least sounds like the song it's supposed to be. Even it, along with most of the others, is a study in ""Hey, Mom, watch this!"" sound effects generation unworthy of either the Disney moniker or Mannheim Steamroller. ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" tangled up with ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" - with neither really coming to the fore - borders on insulting; Jiminy Cricket would not be happy! Unless you're a fan of early Moog experiments, pass on this one."
0,"Do not expect this CD to rekindle your love of The Box Tops. This CD does not come close to recapturing the spirit of The Box Tops in the 60's. Of the 14 songs on this CD, only two are worth listening to. Alex Chilton has lost the distinct tones that were prevelent in his voice in his youth. As you can tell, I was highly disappointed in this CD."

0,"Brilliant reading ruined by bad mastering Douglas Adams' reading of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is truly engaging. The problem with this audio book is two-fold:1. None of the tracks has any text-encoding. This means that devices that read this information cannot use or display the CD names or track names. So, an iTunes won't read any CD or track names. Nor will any CD player that can show track names.2. CD #6 of the set repeats the same scene over and over, without ever reaching the ending.New Millenium Audio destroyed a perfectly enjoyable performance with its poor mastering of the CD."
0,"Warning - missleading title Even this CD is called ""New year's concert 2000 in Vienna"" it is NOT the popular ""New year's concert"" which can be seen all over the world. The real thing is the ""Vienna Philharmonic: New year's concert 2000"" under Riccardo Muti (conductor).I felt upset getting the wrong CD and had to replace it. This just extended to period of waiting for the pleasure of the real ""Neujahrskonzert""."
0,you have got to be kidding me I am absolutely appalled and saddened to see a book with this title.I've been lost in the 'Alzheimer' labyrinth for the past decade.I have no need for a condescending book of this ilk.The title alone makes me want to vomit.Shame on the authors and anyone associated with it.Alzheimer's Disease is too complex a disease for a 'Dummies' manual.This deeply disturbs me.~m
0,"Title of this book This book may have excellent and easy-to-understand contents about Alzheimer's. However, the title is somewhat belittling and insensitive to the patient and to the family. Yes, having worked with Alzheimer patients and families, I would say so. I would NOT recommend this book to them. Perhaps to the general public is okay......but then, should they not also go to Alzheimer's Association (www.alz.org) and their local chapters throughout the country for general information and resources??"
0,worst van damn movie he has ever made this is pure crap dont buy this movie the story line might sound really good but trust me the way they did it sucks the whole movie van damn looks pathetic and im his biggest fan which makes me sad that they put him in this movie he really isnt even the main star and he plays two rolls this is just crap dont buy this movie its not even a kicking movie till the end which fight seen was a joke why people rated this movie so good idk but trust me its his worst movie ever

Instead of making it simple, they said I'd have to send the whole thing back to them. Because of this, I asked for a refund. The pans themselves also don't look nearly as good as they do in the photo. The lesson here is to not buy items like this online. Your best bet is going to a store and seeing what you are going to buy in person beforehand. Also, if you run into any problems, it's less of a hassle to take care of."
0,"Package Severely Damaged This is a great season and both DVD discs work perfectly fine; however, there is a large slash that runs down the front cover and flaps out. The top of the DVD case usually has a sticker. This case did not have a security sticker and looked as though this item was used and just repacked as ""new"". The back is severely dented in as well. I order from Amazon regularly and this is the first time I've ever had an item shipped that was in such poor condition."
0,"Finding unworthy research to support questionable conclusions It's widely reported that the religious right makes up a little less than 40% of the Republican party...not exactly a controlling majority. To imply that they are driving all policy towards a theocracy is intellectually dishonest, but works as a great scare tactic.Please, look at some of the sources used in the research. To say that they lack credibility would be an understatement (Air America, etc?). But, books that are preaching to the choir are a dime-a-dozen these days. The author has his select audience and he's trying to give him what they want to hear and shaping the research to support his conclusions. There's nothing wrong with that, it sells books, just don't expect many of the arguments to hold water."
0,"very one-sided By using a narrow view of historical religious expansionism, Phillips almost acts as an apologist for the religious right. It would be better if it had been written from a non-biased political view point."
0,"Tactic to overwhelm This is just like the book ""Empire of Debt"", but it is doing a better job jamming a lot more data to overwhelm readers who are unprepared. Dependence on oil, religious right, and debt, we all know that. The problem is not if they are dangerous, the problem is how all these will lead to the conclusions that the author attempts to make. We keep on asking HOW, HOW, HOW; and the author just keeps on polluting with well-taken data, unrelated stories, and un-analytical information. Too many similar authors out there simply believe they can manage a political-economic topic with common sense, as long as they can overcrowd their book pages with enough data."

0,"Good Enough to be Forgotten I enjoy movies with Drew Barrymore but this movie must have had the lowest budget ever! Through most of the movie, you are not sure of the outcome. Which makes a good suspense film, again, despite the budget. The ending, well, let's say they should have ended the movie earlier as the last scenes cause the film to go from good to horrible."
0,"hysterical, and then, just bad, mostly i cannot, with good conscience recommend this movie.please, look at it! it's awful!drew barrymore, in her sad ""poison ivy"" stage, is a wretched performer. there are pothole plothole's all over the place. and it's itchy to watch the scene with her real mother, jaid barrymore. were they attempting reconcilliation through a b-movie?oh! and the guy from adventures in babysitting, father of the bride & a few episodes of friends is in it, fumbling around too. where is that guy?there's a tough broad friend, a spooky house & at one point SPOILER: drew splits in half all oogy and walks around like some really skinny anatomy horror movie thingy.hey! now it sounds kind of good again."
0,"a putrid stinker of a film This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time watching! Don't dispose a precious cent on this movie unless you are a gigantic Drew Barrymore fan and you are merely viewing the movie for the raw sex scenes and constant,random nudity. The storyline could have worked, yet the movie is pathetically low budget, the acting is horrid and the movie falls desperately flat. It is impossible to like this movie unless you are obsessively in love with Drew Barrymore and you want to watch her at her lowest point. It's so bad that I had to come here to vent about it online. The director was obviously a film school drop-out who offered the actors free cocaine and produces low budget porn."

0,"Roman Catholicism Highly unscholarly. At least one major error on every page. Pick a page, any page. And the allegations can be easily refuted. It will never be considered a ""scholarly book"". A comic book.... perhaps. A real scholar once told me, ""All the claims can be easily refuted. It would be funny, if it wasn't for the fact that so many people take it seriously"". As for sources.... none. Oh yes, they are shown, but if you follow them it goes something like this.... A points to B, B points to C, C points to A. Basically they are pointing to each other for proof. Very poorly done. I would suggest reading ""Fathers Know Best"" by Jimmy Akin if you want to study the early Christians."
0,"A very poor source of facts; a very great source of lies If writers got points for misconceptions and sneaky tricks, L.B. would be on top of them all. This book is full of twists, turns, misconceptions, and outright lies about the Catholic faith. As a Catholic, this book was enough to put me on the borderline of laughing and crying. I can personally refute most of the claims he makes, but Karl Keating, Scott Hahn, and Patrick Madrid do wonderful jobs at this on books already in print and available here. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE CATHOLIC FAITH, go read the books from the afore-mentioned authors. This book is a book of outright lies."
0,"Eye opening It's amazing how gullible some people can be.I bought and read this book when I was evangelical.I then began to examine the issues in it, and, seeing not only the inaccuracies and misrepresentations in this book, but also seeing the historical, theological and BIBLICAL cohesion of the claims of the Catholic Church, I became Catholic.Need I say more?"
0,"Full of misrepresentations, misconceptions, and false history. ""Roman Catholicism"" seems like an accurate, well-researched book, but it is nothing more than an outlet for Boettner's hate of Catholics. It frequently alters quotes and uses biased sources, because this is what fundamentalists have to do to defend their beliefs. Karl Keating's book, ""Catholicism and Fundamentalism"", completely exposes this hateful work."
0,A textbook for anti-Catholic people Boettner offers a classic presentation of what the Catholic Church DOES NOT teach.
0,"A former Beottner fan recants I once had high respect for Lorraine Beottner until I checked out the facts. This book is an absolutely atrocius work that caricatures the Church and distorts the facts. It is full of many historical errors easily verified. My faith in Protestantism was shaken after checking the facts. It is sad that so many Protestants use this as a primary source of arguments against the Church when it has long been refuted. Actually, many Protestant scholars admit that this book is unreliable. Seeing the countless errors in this ""Bible of anti-Catholicicsm"" through research had alot to do with my conversion to Catholicism."
0,"If you are an anti-Catholic, this book is for you ""There will come a time when men will no longer put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own selfish desires, they will surround themselves by a great number of teachers telling them what their itching ears want to hear."" This is the what Boettner has done in this book: what many call the ""Handbook of Anti-Catholicism."" It is filled, cover to cover, with half-truths and lies regarding the Catholic faith. If you want the Catholic (truthful) response to Boettner's book, please read CATHOLICISM & FUNDAMENTALISM by Karl Keating. Keating demolishes Boettner's ROMAN CATHOLICSM verse by verse."
0,"Good for a bookend and not much else Lorriane Boettner has no clue as to what he is talking about. I was on the verge of leaving the Church and then I read his book. Looked up the facts and realized how off-base he is. If you want inaccuracy, distortion, illogic, and straw man arguments read this book. But if you want the Truth then ignore this books and read ""Catholicism and Fundamentalism"" by Karl Keating, ""Fundamentals of the Faith"" by Peter Kreeft, and ""Rome Sweet Home"" by Scott and Kimberly Hahn. I would give this no stars, but I can't."
0,"A book for the ignorant bigot This book appeals to the ignorant bigot who is too simple and lazy to invest the necessary time and effort to explore the fascinating topic of the differences between Catholicism and Protestantism. For the thoughtful and curious people, I would recommend The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice, by Philip Jenkins."
0,"Wrong Wrong WRONG! Oh come on! EVEN if you don't agree with Catholicism (as a future seminarian, I happen to) you can find BETTER material. I mean, if any educated Catholic tells you that this stuff is rubbish, you should believe them. We are not ashamed of our beleifs nor do we hide from our history. There was an inquisition (even though it was NOTHING like most Protestants try to make it), there were and are some problems (not in DOCTRINE, perhaps in management and catechesis), but nothing to the distorted degree presented in this work of fiction. I highly recommend that this book be buried forever as it might be MORE useful as landfill!"
0,dishonest Unscholarly would be too nice a term for this book. It is intellectually dishonest. Non-academic propoganda. I would rate it a zero if I could. Enough said.
0,Don't waste your time Poorly written with little scholarly merit or research value....just validates the theory that a good majority of fundamentalists are more concerned with discrediting Catholic tradition than they are about justifying their own flawed religious beliefs...
0,"Trash scholarship I read this book some 30 years ago. I was then reading a lot of Catholic and Protestant books. It didn't take me long to discern that his book was trash then, and it is still a heap of trash today. Basically, it is a book of lies and a playground for the devil. It demonstrates how low an obstinate and foolish Protestant will go to attack the bride of Christ. Read Matt 7:21-23."
0,I worry about those who take this book seriously This book is fiction. Sad fiction at that. Ridiculous fiction actually. Note the dearth of footnotes or authoritative quotes. This book was written by a man who was clearly an anti-Catholic bigot -- often times for people who are on the same ungodly road as the author was on until he passed away and came face to face with his judge -- Jesus Christ.This book is such a horrible fabrication of hatred and lies that I truly wonder about the spiritual and intellectual health of those who actually recommend this fetid work.Don't waste your time. This is sewage. You can read these sorts of lies on the web for free...
0,"Be Careful If you read this, be sure to also read ""Catholicism & Fundamentalism"" by Karl Keating. (at the very minimum, read Chapter 2 of C&F, which deals specifically with this book.)"

0,"May God have mercy on you, seriously! Wow, what can I say? Totally ignorant, very very poorly done or just plain intentional lies to mislead people. Even those people who don't have any faith affiliations and atheists will find this book beyond poorly researched.I totally get it if one's own or other christian denomination's interpretation of the Bible is different from Roman Catholism and her teachings but when people (especially this book) intentionally MISREPRESENTS, fabricate lies that the other Church TRULY teaches, it borders bigotry and hatred which is against the 9th Commandment of God, ""Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor"".Please for humanity's sake.....read a lot of good historical books specially the other's side OFFICIAL teachings and not just from some disgruntled priest, nun or unverifiable source and lastly....be honest!"
0,"Unscholarly? Yes. Should you get it? Yes. I'm a catholic apologist and even though there are holes in this book ""big enough to drive trucks through"", the fact remains that, in my experience, many of our protestant bretheren still use the stuff in this book. I don't know why but they do. And so, you need to to know all the ""bad"" arguments that they will come up with and this book has them all. Some of it is pretty funny. Anyone who wants to defend the faith should get this book.If you need answers to this book, you can check out, ""Catholicism and Fundamentalism..."" by Karl Keating. He goes through ""Roman Catholicism"" piece by piece. I gave this book one star because of all the reasons listed in the other reviews above. He does quote pretty accurately (assuming he has a source at all), but he quotes all of it out of context. So be prepared."
0,"A BOOK OF LIES EVEN A BAPTIST (me) WOULDNT BELIEVE No, I am not Catholic, but after looking at this book I have realized that it is nothing more that a book full of lies - thousands of items and quotes taken out of context so that they seem to be the truth. This book has been turning devout Christians against their faith for a long time and I think that it is time for that to stop. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO BURN IT. As a Christian we should strive to build each other up no matter what the doctrinal differences are - so this book is a piece of trash."
0,"A Good Fantasy Mr Boettner's book has absolutely no basis in the real world. I think it is safe to say there are factual errors on nearly every page, and even when he does get it right, he often distorts the facts. Catholics should read this just to see how far anti-catholics will go!"
0,"Intellectually Dishonest or Ignorant Bigotry? You Decide This embarassment of a book has been completely and irrefutably debunked byCatholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on ""Romanism"" by ""Bible Christians""by Karl Keating. Boettner was horribly misinformed about what Catholics actually believe or was so blinded by anti-Catholic bigotry that he didn't care to get his facts straight. Any fool can knock down a straw man, which is all that Boettner does in this book. If you believe that fundamentalists are right and Catholics are sadly misguided and bound for Hell, I dare you to read Keating's book, cover to cover."
0,"Utter trash; a look into the heart of Ant-Catholic bigotry As a biblical scholar of sorts, I thought that I would find some interesting arguments in this book. However, what I actually found was a book FULL of claims with virtually no referencing to sources. This book is such a farse of intellectual trash that it does not warrant reading.The sad fact is that this book tells you less about Roman Catholicism and more about fundamentalist bigotry. His list of Catholic inventions is a ridiculous attempt at scholarly insight and he actually has factual errors in the list. Some dates are totally wrong and other ""inventions"" can be seen in practice long before the ""invention"" date, even in non-Catholic writing! Mr. Boettner, thank you for retiring. When you eventually pass on, I hope the anti-Catholic sentiment of your work passes with you."
0,"The story of two chuckleheads Two jackasses are funded for an otherwise brilliant idea. Problem is, the two chuckleheads, Kaleil (this guy is self-inflated throughout the whole movie) and Tom couldn't run a toaster let alone a business. Not surprisingly, the whole 'empire' comes crashing down on the both of them. The most work I think they ever did in the movie was film themselves and show everyone how important they thought they were.This is a typical case study of how not to run a business. It is a great behind the scenes of who was running the ""new economy"". It will be no surprise to you after watching this movie why the bubble burst."
0,Im sorry I really don't like to leave bad reviews but this has got to be the worst piece of trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. If I didn't get it as a gift I would have thrown it up it in the air and blown it away with my shot gun gathered together all the pieces and shot them again. Then after I was done with that I would have to light them on fire put the ashes in a box tie it to a brick and throw it is a deep river Jumanji style.

They sent us a new part, but it's complicated to switch, and you have to have the right tools, which we don't. We paid thousands for a brand new item, and received a faulty item with no support to fix it. We are considering sending it back for a refund. Very disappointing."
0,"Painful to Watch I am very interested the subject matter of this film, but the film is terrible. I have read Shulgins' books and many others. I was really looking forward to this movie when I bought it.This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen.The editing is bizarre and disorienting. The movie does not flow. The movie is basically a collection of video clips, randomly cut and mixed together with no sense of proper timing or coherence. The result is a jarring experience that is hard to watch. I felt it was giving me a headache.Making matters worse, there was no narration or story flow. Some of the clips had no apparent connection to the subject matter.We made it through about half the film before turning it off.Its a shame that such fascinating subject matter was treated with such carelessness.Seriously, this is the worst documentary ever made."
0,"Why does this book have five stars? I am embarrassed that I even bought this book. The first one was strangely compelling, and I found the second one on sale cheap, but I should have honestly stopped there.There is nothing really scary about these ""bodies."" They are weak and decaying. A few well-placed molotov cocktails applied regularly would have finished this series at book two (or sooner). Presumably the bodies are not reproducing. Eventually, efforts at getting rid of them would pay off.There is nothing scary about this book, that is, except the hypnotic repetitiveness of the narration. If I read one more time the long, drawn-out explanation of why the bodies were amassing near the survivors, I think perhaps I might have turned into a zombie-like creature myself.I remain flabbergasted that so many people appear to have thought this book was worth 4+ stars."
0,"A complete waste of time! I just finished the third volume of David Moody's zombie series ""AUTUMN"". I must admit to being somewhat excited after reading the 1st book in the series, but ultimately this entire series was a complete disappoinment. Here's why: Somewhere about 3/4 of the way through the 1st book the author makes the disasterous decision to concentrate his book on character development of his ""still-living"" characters. That is fine, but unfortunately Moody totally abandons his ""bread and butter"" in the book: ZOMBIES! They are completely NON-threatening and really nothing more than topics of conversations for his characters. Can you say: BORING!!!Don't waste your time on this series of books."
0,"First stories were great but I wound up wishing I hadn't bought the book.

The reviews on the back cover also claim that it is ""hilarious""? I'm sure they didn't actually read the book. So for anyone who wants a good autobiographical book, read Augusten Burroughs, Running With Scissors, Dry, and Magical Thinking; David Sedaris doesn't even compare to Burroughs."

I read them and bought the book thinking it might offer a humorous side on the everyday life of Americans...I was very disappointed. I could not even smile.

If he has read the Greeks, he will know whom I am referring to....Don't waste your money on this one."
0,"Made me feel icky I recently bought Sedaris' Carnegie Hall CD and thought it was hilarious. I am also an enthusiastic fan of This American Life and have loved his many contributions. This book proves that NPR highlights Sedaris' best work and leaves the rest. Unfortunately this is a book mostly of ""the rest"".I had a tough time finding any redeeming value in the story of his rickshaw hauling, trash picking sister and her ability to put out cigarettes with her bare feet. I was much more repulsed by the story of his budding homosexuality and the way he was able to coerce young, naked boys to sit on his lap.If I were to choose one word to describe this book it would be ""icky"". Skip the ickiness and buy the CD. Or, better yet skip the expense and listen to This American Life. It's free and it's his best material."

0,"Random rantings from a drugged homosexual The wittiest parts are in the first 3 chapters. Other than that, don't bother. This is the sad story of the product of a dysfunctional, estranged family who has many opportunities through gifts, trusts and other money sources to find his potential, get an education and make his contribution to society. Instead, through drugs, homosexuality and extreme self-absorbtion, he descends into a sad, wasted life. I regret buying this book. Again, don't bother."

It simply doesn't pack the punch of David's other books. Its routine. Its been done before. David is in danger of taking advantage of his many readers. He is clearly talented, but this book simply doesn't take chances. I know he can do better than this."
0,"stop smoking and get to work I am a huge Sedaris fan but was very disappointed in this book. First off, as a fan, I had already read half the stories put together here in magazines. Secondly, they just aren't as funny as his earlier works. Sedaris needs to broaden his horizons or if he insists on sticking to the same subjects over and over, work harder to make the stories funny.

0,"pretentious garbage i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages. i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign. i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something. the impression i instantly got was ""BEEP BEEP! PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."" guess what, mr. sedaris? i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood. millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card. check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style."
0,"Have to return it. It is poorly designed. The answer is not clear to see when the button is pushed. Even you can read the answer, it can be easily hidden by the finger. The question (A x B) are painted on top of the button, and it can be easily worn out. I can't believe a product of such a poor design can be put for sale. It is already 2011! I have to return it."
0,Bad design..Don't buy it Very poor design..The results are difficult to read as the box is semi transparent. The worst thing is the results are superimposed on the print. I forgot to read the comment before buying this. So had to return this back to Amazon for a refund.
0,"It didn't help my vision I followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind. The print is every bit as blurry as it every was before I tried the things in this book. I wanted so much for this to work, and I'll try again, but after four months of daily applying the techiniques of this book, my vision did not improve the least bit."
0,"Terrible disappointment Farberware Classic 2-Quart Saucepan This pan leaks dark soot like material from beneath the upper lip of the pan every time I use it. Even worse, the seal between the pan proper and its bottom is evidently not sealed because other stuff leaks out of it, going upward on the pan; it is very difficult to even clean it off; consequently, I used this pan a few times and now it just sits unused, making me think I may never buy another Farberware -- despite the fact that my previous pan similar to this one lasted through 56 years of marriage. Yes, it was a wedding present and used several times a week."
0,"Typical Neil I love most Neil Young but every fan knows that about one in three of his albums really sucks. After Greendale and Greatest hits, I'm very disapointed."
0,"Buy Neil's Greatest Hits Insted I don't think this is Neil Young's best CD. I look at the radiobut the Painter gets played like 2,695 times on the radio a day.Why? Plus I've heard the songs are too slow. This is too muchof an overrated CD! Buy the last album from Neil Young, GreatestHits it has better songs like his best, Down by the River, andthe great grunge, Hey Hey, My My. This is a waste of money."
0,"ENUFF I am not a Neil Young fan at all. I heard the song 'The Painter' on Q104.3 the other day. The DJ Maria Millito was raving about this song before she played it. I almost drove off the road. Sounded like a cat, who got his tail caught in a closing door... PLEASE Neil, put the guitar & microphone away and go a rocking on your porch...."
0,"More Hash, Less Rehash This album is lifeless and trite and all the more so when compared to the rest of the albums in his catalog. The hype surrounding this album smacks of the same fawning attempts to honor Dylan now that he has entered his washed-up phase. Like so many other reviewers have stated, buy the old stuff instead, its grittier, more powerful and more substantial-everything that Prairie Wind is not."
0,"What an awful, awful album If Neil had cranked out album's like this throughout his career his name would be linked with lesser singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Jackson Browne instead of Bob Dylan. I know what you are thinking, ""But he has done albums like this before! What about Harvest, Harvest Moon and Silver and Gold?!?!"". Sorry, but Prairie Wind is a pale imitation of those albums.The songwriting is weak and the arrangements are often saccharine and overbearing. I can honestly say that I enjoy ""Landing on Water"", ""Arc"" and ""Are You Passionate?"" much more than this album. At least LOW had ""Hippie Dream"", Arc took guts and AYP? had a great guitar tone. Prairie Wind just mocks all the good work Neil did wiith an acoustic guitar.If you are a collector it is a must but if you like good Neil Young music pass on this one and get the other acoustic albums."
0,"Boring I listen to this cd on his website and found it to be quite a bore it sounds like a copy cat version of his better cds but not in a good way. Before you get this make sure you have After the Gold Rush, Comes a Time, Harvest, and On the Beach these are way better albums that show Young's mellow side more effectively."
0,"Cheap rubber with smeared paint, scuff marks...Not even remotely a ""collector's"" piece. I ordered this with the intention of donating it to a Christmas toy drive thinking that a little boy or girl in the local Children's Hospital would have a lot of imaginative fun playing with a model space shuttle. When I opened the box, the space shuttle's packaging was partially opened and the space shuttle was full of dust and scuff marks. The paint job is awful, disjointed and scratched. As the package was already opened, I took the toy out to further examine it, and now my hands reak of the cheap rubber smell.This toy is garbage down to the MADE IN CHINA stamp on its underside. The only thing remotely good about it is that the patch is kind of neat but that is not nearly enough to make this worth purchasing.I would not recommend buying this product. I would be embarrassed to give this to any child, much less use it for the purpose that it was originally intended.I wish I could give it zero stars."
0,"Boring Life of the Idle Rich This is the worst book I have read in a long time. The last thing I want to immerse myself in is the life style of the super rich and clueless in modern Los Angeles, complete with a staff to provide special ""health"" diets, a personal trainer, meaningless meditation retreats, $100K cars, and an all-white sex palace on the Malibu coast. The addition of walk-on parts for Bob Dylan and Gerald Ford only makes it more unreal. Nor to I need an unbelievable series of disasters, from sink holes to collapsing houses to freeway kidnaps to a Los Angeles firestorm to try to inject some plot into this unfocused story. As a straight novel, it is a failure. Some reviewers call it a satire, and perhaps that is a redeeming perspective, but the cover blurbs take this weird tale with amazing solemnity."
0,Who is Scott Brick? Why do you have a review from Publishers Weekly that uses the wrong name of the author? Seems someone is confused.
0,Pictures not what they appear to be..... very disappointed in this item. it sits in my basement and will never be used. I assumed I ordered the entire tent structure based on the photos upon purchasing the item. turns out it was just the 'net'I would absolutely love to return this and get my money backThank you
0,Misguided Purchase The photo and description do not reflect the product. The screen panel kit I received was white. What a huge inconvenience during a time-crunch.
0,"Very few laughs! Hello World,Misguiding title and cover. Thought it would be like Rolling Kansas or Road Trip, not at all. His parents grow weed, so what! I could barely make it through the entire movie."
0,"This video is strictly a Christian perspective This video comes at the issue of occultism from a strictly Christian perspective. While I will concede that the film makers mixed in some factual information with their profoundly biased critiques, I must warn viewers that the video is NOT an unbiased (or even terribly informative) documentary. You will find a few interesting comments and clips interspersed throughout, but nothing more.Those of you who are fans of well made documentaries should know that the ethics of proper reporting were not maintained during the production of this video. So, if you seek good, informative, information then you should look elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you are a christian person who wants information on the occult from a strictly christian (and opinion based) perspective, then you have found a perfect match."
0,"DO NOT WATCH!!! this is my first amazon review, and i am writing because this movie is horrible!!! i tried to believe all the the positive reviews, but it was awful. i love psychological movies.....but this was just groundhog day with a horrible plot and no ending and leaves you wishing you had watched dora the explorer instead. seriously. i have never reviewed an item and i am telling you i threw aside my laziness just to save you from this movie. everyone who thought it was good has never seen a real film or is crazy!! DO NOT WATCH IT!!"
0,"Seems to have no point. Don't waste your time. Allowing for the possibility that I am just too dense to understand it, this seems as pointless as it is boring. With the same repetitive scenes that make little if any point the first time, any more than the rest. Certainly not plausible, even for fiction, this is bizarre film of a crew that takes a cruise on a small boat, capsizes in the Bermuda Triangle, its passengers rescued by a passenger ship without passengers or crew. One of the woman keeps reappearing, after being killed over and over again, frequently by herself (a double, triple, etc.) I watched this my wife who agreed with this. Even the genre is not clear -- not exactly a horror film; certainly not a mystery, except for the mystery of why it was even made. Don't waste your time or money."
0,No plot The story plot of this movie sucked. It started going on a boat trip it ended going back on the same boat trip. She was in this time still world that she kept re-livin. The question is WHY. The movie did not give a reason. What happened to make her go into this state. It started in the time still state and ended the same way. I will never watch this movie again. I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go.
0,lame as sin! did not like it! Boring!! wasn't expecting watching same scenes over and over! Next time I will pay attention what I am buying. Comparing to any other movies I would not recommend this movie.
0,waste of time This was a huge wasteof time. Wow. Read reviews before i wztched andpeop.e seemed to like this movie. Awful this moviegoes nowhere. Booo
0,Jacked Up!!!! Seriously???? This movie was jacked up! Like a Ground Hogs Day only worse.. way worse. I can't even explain how bad this movie is. Some of you people rated this 4 and 5 stars??? What the hell are you smoking and PLEASE send some my way so I can watch this movie again and see is it gets any better!
0,"So bad it hurt. I rented this off iTunes, and I wish I didn't. It's your basic time-loop flick. The acting sucked, writing sucked. The best part of the film was the 30 seconds of CG weather. Don't waste your money."
0,"Contrived and unbelieviable The plot for this film is completely contrived. The entire plot relies on itself for advancement and framework, and doesn't follow any sort of universal logic or boundaries.If you're a fan of mindless suspense, then you might enjoy this film, but if you expect your movies to provide you with a believable framework, don't bother.The plot to this film is so outlandish and so poorly explained that it made it completely unenjoyable for me.You basically figure out the entire scope of the movie within the first 30 minutes and then just watch what you predict unfold before your eyes in it's painfully contrived and cliche form.Save your time and watch a different movie. This one is not worthy of your time."
0,"Please do not watch, this is 2hrs you will never get back This movie was horrible. If you enjoy crossword puzzles you make like this movie if your intoxicated. But if you just want straight entertainment select something else. I have no problem with a movie challenging me as a viewer, but it repeated the same scenes several times and still did not provide a solution to the main character's problem. For a suspense/horror this movie was a straight H.A.M. (Hot A$$ Mess)."
0,wasted my ever precious time I freakin wasted my precious time watching this movie ugh!I stuck to almost the end because I was hoping it would get interesting in the end but NOPE! Im still mad at myself. I could've watched something else. As a bored mother of a newborn I am mad I wasted my time on this. I hardly get to watch a movie since my daughter was born and when I found one I just wasted it on this. I felt like I will go nuts watching the same scene over and over and over smdhAnd oh I am using my fiancee's account hence the guys name ;)
0,Waste of time Don't waste your time watching this movie. It goes around and around in circles to no where. This movie tries to do what classics like the Fog did so well but it failed miserably so find something better to do with your time.
0,"sucked This thing I won't even call it a movie. Such a waste of time. Science fiction groundhog day with no resolution. Unoriginal, stupid, what can I say. Please don't waste your time. Had to give it one star for my review. If I could give it - 5 stars I would."
0,"a disappointing bore I was so looking forward to this novel - a somewhat trashy page-turner with an interesting historical backdrop. Well, it wasn't a page-turner, and the historical backdrop was so far from believable that I had no interest. It was trashy and truly juvenile. Frankly, I'm shocked that so many people have rated this novel highly. If you want a fun, trashy, historical page-turner, try Anne Rice's ""Cry To Heaven."" That was a guilty pleasure which I loved. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" falls miles short."
0,"No zero stars? I love books! I buy them, I read them, I have difficulty loaning them out let alone giving them away. This book I will burn, if for no other reason than to spare another who might be tempted by the title (as I was) to expect a readable, historical, novel. I could forgive the historical inaccuracies if Ms Gregory had given some thought as to how they could propel the story, or if the characters were more than cardboard.Too bad there is not a rating below one star."
0,"The worst historical fiction I've ever read I am astonished that this was published...it's truly awful, historically inaccurate. It reads like the author read a couple of books about the period, took notes and then forgot all the facts on record. Anne was the younger sister, for example. There is no record that she ever committed incest with her brother George. The early years at the French court are omitted, which provide an insite as to why the Boleyns began their rise to power."
0,"very poor quality I am surprised at so many positive reviews. The prose in this book is very poor quality, it's simplistic, repeptitive and many times plain silly. It reads like a quick amateur effort. While I think that the autor is entitled to the right to fictionalize some characters or events, i can't understand why her language is so dismal."
0,"Tawdry For a classier historical novel about the Boleyns, I recommend The Lady in the Tower by Jean Plaidy."
0,"Not worth the time First let me say that the purchasing end of this exchange was excellent. The book reached me promptly and was in fine condition physically. If only the writing were at least half as fine. The conversations sounded 20th century, not remotely 16th century. Nor did they sound like genuine exchanges among the Boleyn siblings but instead like devices to let the reader know explicitly what was going on in the palaces and historically. The author's choice of starting with a wholly naive narrator (Mary in her early teens) and increasing her knowledge and perceptiveness was not unwise in itself, but was clulmsy in execution. She seems altogether too dense for too long, and even after she's much more worldly still frequently demonstrates her ""cotton head"". There's no denying that the Tudor era was racy and dangerous. If this is the only book at hand on that subject, grab it and skim."
0,"Dreadful! I wish I'd read the bad reviews first, because they're all correct. This is a dreadful book, the kind you keep reading because you hope it'll get better. It never did, and now I have lost too much time to Ms. Gregory's desperate attempt at telling a story. Inaccurate, tedious, padded, silly."
0,"soft-core porn masquerading as historical fiction I see from the other reviews here that I will be in the minority, but this may be the most moronic book I have ever read. If you care anything about history, avoid this book at all costs. Frankly, if you have any self-respect at all, avoid this book. I doubt my opinion will change the Cult of Philippa Gregory, but I feel compelled, by the very awfulness of this book, to speak my mind. It's no more than a jazzed-up Harlequin Romance with a few historical references thrown in for kicks. Absurdity on every page and an insult to anyone of intelligence."
0,I Lost It!! I lost this book after about the first 50 pages. I think that I did it on purpose. If I want to read fairy tales I will go back to the Brothers Grimm.
0,"Review Based on the First Few Pages Maybe I know too much about Tudor England. The author's placing Anne as the eldest sibling bugged me right off the bat, as I'm almost positive most historians see her as the younger sister. Or, maybe I'm too big a fan of the fascinating Anne to buy anything from boring cow Mary's perspective, I don't know. All I know is, I've only read the first few pages and I'm bored and turned off by this book. I should want to read it. I bought it. But somehow, I just can't be bothered. I recently read a book about Frida Khalo written from her jealous sister's perspective, and it was [junk], so maybe it's bad vibes. Either way, this book isn't nearly as interseting as it's title would suggest."
0,"Bored Out of My Gourd This was all plots and plans and no action. While it might have pictured what life was actually like in the Boleyn/Howard family, there was no action to it -- and I know that ""plots and plans"" can actually make a decent book, because ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" proves it!Thankfully, I didn't buy this book alone (I bought it at the same time I bought ""The Queen's Fool""), or I would've discounted Ms. Gregory as a truly boring author altogether. Hopefully, this book was just a fluke and her others (like ""The Constant Princess"" and ""The Virgin's Lover"") are just as good as ""The Queen's Fool""."
0,The Other Boleyn Girl This book is a NOVEL and none of it is factual. I am British and brought up / educated in Britain and spent years on English history and believe me this is fantasy masquerading as fact. It will make the author pleny money and leave American readers believing this drivel. If you really want to know the facts then read a history book.The Other Boleyn Girl (Movie Tie-In)
0,"Dreadful Historical Romance The Other Boleyn Girl is overlong, filled with tedious and unnecessary descriptions of Henry VIII-era women's clothing, barely touches on the genuine religious background for the novel (indeed makes it seem that the principal reason for the break between England and the Church of Rome was because of the machinations of the Boleyns) and despite the title is more about Anne Boleyn and Henry than the Mary of the title. The narrative is simply heavy-handed. Mary seems to be everywhere anything important is happening or manages by chance to overhear important information or picks it up via weakly developed exposition. It's supposed to be a historical romance, but there's precious little genuine history and and not a lot of romance. Oh . . . and the ending takes 700-plus pages to get to, but it's all telegraphed by page 350 or so."
0,"What a Load of Royal Rubbish! It wasn't the historical background that irritated me, that was quite well researched and believable in its rendering of daily life in Tudor England. What bugged the crap out of me was the characters and their motivations. The overall tone of this book was that of a particularly bad romance novel. Henry VIII's most dominant trait was selfishness, both as a King and a man, and yet here we see him portrayed as a tender and devoted lover. I was near to gagging before I was half way through this book. It takes an awfully bad book to make me not finish it, but I came close to launching this one out the window. It went to the book exchange so fast that Phillippa Gregory's head is probably still spinning."
0,"Gave a complete new meaning to the term literary license. I read this book at the behest of a friend. She said it was wonderful, and how she could not put it down. I could not put it down either, but that is just because I wanted to finish it as fast as I could to end up the torture. I found the fictional part all over, but in it's 672 pages the only historical part I was able to find were some names of people and places. I have read several books about Tudor England, and I would love to know where she got her sources, since she seems to be the only person to have come up with this theory. I wonder why!"
0,"So, so very bad I had just finished reading ""The Autobiography of Henry VIII: With Notes By His Fool, Will Somers"" by Margaret George and was interested in learning more about about that time. A group of acquaintances heartily & gushingly recommended ""The Other Boleyn Girl"".Fortunately, my copy came from a thrift store, because I cannot finish it. I'm not even at page 75 yet and I'm seriously hating it. The most eye-rolling passage for me was Mary's description of her stay at her family's country estate all by herself (with the exception of the servants), and her discussions with local farmers, plus the story about how she secured seed for a crop for some of them. Please.If Ms. Gregory is the feminist she claims to be, she would do well to write more accurately about history and and less sensationally. The truth is usually much more interesting anyway.I'll be combing these 1 and 2 star reviews for recommendations of better accounts of the time and of Anne Boleyn."
0,Utterly sleep inducing. I just don't see what the big deal is. I received this book as a gift and sat down to read it one night. It nearly put me to sleep so I set it aside and decided to come back to it the next day. Same thing happened. The story is slow moving and I found myself skipping ahead to see if it got better. It didn't. I would not suggest this book to anyone.
0,"Disappointing is an Understatement If you're looking for well developed characters, thoughtful dialogue, or intellectual stimulation, don't pick up this book. The Tudor period is fascinating and offers all you need for a gripping plot. The story itself is quite intriguing when written about by others. Despite hearing rave reviews, I found Philippa Gregory's prose to be poorly constructed and incredibly irritating. I wasn't bothered by the historical inaccuracies; after all, it is a ""novel"" and many of the facts are debatable.If you want a long read on par with a Harlequin Romance (actually, those are better), then this would be a perfect fit. I would have given ""0"" stars if I could have."
0,"Shouldn't history be somewhat correct? I only have to say this, historical facts can be correct, and still have good or even better fiction. Anya Seton proved that, with Katherine. Fact it seems, as in Elizabeth 1, if studied, is far far more interesting than any fiction made to soup up a book or even film. Philipa Gregory blurs truth and makes it sad, for I rate the book as well as the movie next to nothing.J. Schossow"
0,"cheap romance posing as historical fiction Clearly, I'm in the minority here, and I did only read 112 pages, or the first two chapters.Abominable. Painful in its lack of subtlety or craft.The language of the book does nothing to evoke the 16th century. At one point, the main character practically says ""Whatever!"" (I forget her actual comment, and I'm not going to torture myself by turning on my Sony PRS to search for one line in a crummy book.)It should be a good movie. It clearly goes for the gusto with sex and intrigue, but that's all it has: enough to float a movie for 90 minutes, but I've already wasted one afternoon on the book, which is more than it deserves. I enjoy a sexy film as much as the next girl, but I'm not going to spend hours reading this vapid tale."
0,"Fantasy This book may be fine as a fantasy, but I feel it is ridiculous to rewrite actual people's lives and rewrite history just for a buck. Much of this book is a complete fabrication, and I am afraid many will take this book as factual. Now it's a movie so even more people can be misguided."
0,"Bad Tudor Porn If OK magazine and Penthouse had been writing in the 1500's this is what they would have come up with.First, it is a badly written book. It is essentially bad Tudor porn. No characters are well written, and they are all insufferable. Honestly they couldn't behead Anne fast enough for me. Even Mary, who should have been the heroine/likeable one was a winy, annoying character.Second, if you're going to make it up just call it fiction and don't try to pass it off as history. Do some basic research. If I can refute the basic ""facts"" of your book in 5 minutes with Google, it's not history in any sense of the word.This book does not deserve to be a best seller, she does not deserve to be identified as an historical fiction writer. I look at author recommendations on books, and if she recommends it I put it down and move on."
0,"What a Disappointment ! Such a dissapointment , a true waste of money, it was clearly not a historic novel , nothing, nothing, nothing worth reading. I agree with a previous review, two-dimensional characters , the too-innocent Mary, the too-evil Anne, the too-merry George...It also annoyed me the detailed reference to sex , which was NOT adding any valuable information about the plot. I was misled from the previous good reviews, but now i know better...I read it, I always read the books I buy, but I was so frustrated, never again this writer. NEVER"
0,"Not working I have the origanal HP black ink cartridge never been refilled also the color I purchased from you, the color refill kit it works fine. the black took in the ink as did the color cartriage, same amount added to both. But the black will only print real light then none at all. refilled again but was full! have to take it out and shake it for it to print dark but that only last about 2 pages!I feel I was ripped off!They said it would work great with the origanal HP cartriages Not So!"
0,don't buy I have purchased many ink refills and this one turned out to be very disappointing. The ink dries up from the cartridge very quickly and it doesn't print full letters. It was a total waste of my money.
0,"Don't bother The third part of this book is devoted to establishing Catholic ""Mary"" as GOD. This is nothing but Catholic propaganda that is absolutely not true. ""Mary"" spews messages calling her followers her children. Let me clarify this absurdity: children of ""Mary"" are not children of GOD.Keep away from these shenanigans. This is a blasphemy."
0,"A really bad book. The book has a few good parts, but there are just too many flaws to grant anything higher than one star. Griffiths leaves many important steps out, sometimes leaving them to the problems or just not covering them at all. Some topics are covered too briefly to be of any help.This book seems to be popular among some students because of his informal writing style, but they should be more cautious. Many professionals I have talked to agree that this is not a good book to start learning QM from. There are many good books out there that you should consider before getting this one (if you have a choice)."
0,"Waste of money This text is much like Griffith's intro to electrodynamics. If you don't need to learn anything, and just want a simple answer to basic questions, buy this book. If, however, you are taking a class in quantum mechanics, don't waste your money. Griffith brings up interesting questions without ever answering them. He offers no assistance in solving the more demanding problems which would aid the learning process. If you're majoring in physics stay away from Griffith as a whole. Rholf is a much better publisher and writer. Check out his texts if you're serious about an education."
0,Complete failure I believe it arrived DOA as the instructions said that it was to have a cotton like top and mine was smooth like icing. Didn't do anything...not one shroom. We followed the directions exactly and even added ice as advise and nothing. It seems like it could be interesting but it's too expensive to be an experiment and they should have something set up to make for easy replacement given that I suspect these have a high failure rate.
0,"Where was the editor? This book has an interesting plot, but the typos and inconsistencies are very distracting."
0,"Better options avaliable I was given this by a friend when pregnant. I was quite excited and even took it to the hospital with me. I hated using this pillow. I am not a big woman at all (5'3 130) but it would not fit in the glider with me comfotably. I did use it to sit on for a while and I used it to help my son sit up when he was learning but if you are looking for a nursing pillow try the ""My Brest Friend"" or my favorite the ""NoJo Nursing pillow"" Boppy just does not live up to the hype."
0,"Buy My Brest Friend instead!!! I was given this pillow as a gift and wish I had kept the gift receipt. This pillow slowly moves away from your waist and I was often left with my baby on my lap instead of on the pillow. My back often ached if I didn't prop myself up with enough pillows. The only place I could use it comfortably was in the car. I bought the My Brest Friend nursing pillow myself at the prompting of my lactation consultant and it worked out much better. I could use it on the sofa, at night in bed to nurse my daughter and then easlly place her in her bassinet. The boppy looks nicer but not very functional at all."
0,"No good for nursing There's so much hype over the Boppy being a ""must have"" that I made sure to get one when our first baby was born. I was very disappointed. It is horribly designed for nursing a baby. The cushion was always slipping and sliding out of position. There is no way to strap it to your waist to keep it in place. For a nursing support pillow, I highly recommend the the ""My Brest Friend"" pillow instead. It's a flat crescent shaped pillow that straps around you and provides lumbar support as well. It made a world of difference for proper positioning, and latching on correctly. If you want a pillow for nursing support, save your money and skip the Boppy."
0,"tight fit, and not comfertable I think it is not comfertable around my waist and I had a 29-30 waist my babys body took the whole thing up and he was 6lb 8oz and 18in.(he was small and so am I) so I was not very happy with it. So I go a different breastfeeding pillow that is just wonderful that I would give a 6 star out of 5 stars, it is red with bears on rocking chairs(I would have prefered clouds on thi one) and it was even cheaper than boppy. also perchaced at babys r us. but everybody is different so try someone elses and see if it works for you. it just wasn't for me but it was for my friend so you never know till you try it yourself."

The author as put up a name synonymous with the great palmist St German to get more people buy this waste of a book.The information in terms of palmistry is so minimum, I could tell all what was in the book in 5 pages.Devil must have struk me when I bought it.

I don't have the slightest clue how this work of garbage ended up on the top 100 books written this century. Considering the amount of time a person wastes reading this book, say three hours, and the amount of people who have and will read it, all the time squandered away adds up to hours , days, years, centurys and eons that have been wasted for nothing. It's spellbounding."
0,lord of the flies Hated it. If your looking for a book that describes the scenery 90 percent of the time. This book is for u.
0,hard time getting through this one I know this is a classic but I really had a hard time getting through it. I read it in high school and thought to try it again thinking now that I'm older maybe i would enjoy it more. I didn't
0,ZZZZZZ This book is so boring! The only reason I even finished it was because I had to (summer reading for english).
0,"Second worse book ever! I'm sorry, but I really hated this book! It was so simpleton and complicated at the same time. And Ralph is all terrible at the beggining and everyone just forgets abut it because he's their ""great leader"". I'm really sorry to everyone who likes this book, though."
0,"Amazing, but hopeless I thought this was a horrible book.It is beautifully written, easy to read, and even real, to a certain extent. You only need to flip through a history book to see the horrible things people have done to other people. But to read about twelve year old boys killing each other is really sick. And that's what it is: a bunch of young boys are stuck on an island, they start off somewhat organized, and then, one by one, turn savage.My best friend recommended it to me, saying the ending was amazing. Perhaps it is. It is a sudden let down from the tension. Yes, I agree, it is amazingly written, but it is also hopeless. What life is left for the boys? They'll need a lot of visits to the shrink, I expect.But that's not what it's about. We are not supposed to think of the long term, only be aware of the depravity of the human race. Anyway, that's what I got out of it. And I am glad I read it - if only to say that I read it and now sort of know what the fuss is all about."
0,"Wow. Wow. Wow. I cannot believe that this has never received less than three stars. Are you guys serious?? A bunch of boys on an island who turn into savages, and then, at the last minute, when the protagonist is about to die, they get rescued?? This is, of course, after waiting the whole book for this to happen. Oh, by the way, kill all the good characters, and make a set of twins into a single person. What a fantastic idea!!I don't quite know what else to say except: really? really?Really? No girls. Really? A talking pig head?? REALLY??To put it simply: this buck sucked."
0,"Unusable book not as described This was described to be a ""good"" or ""like new"" condition (I don't remember which now) paperback of a classic book in a more recent edition. Instead it is actually an extremely ancient, yellowed & smelly paged, hard-covered, paperback-style school-copy dated 1954, that has no less that 8 student names written in it. Very Nasty! It is an older edition, stinks, and could not fairly be described as anything better than ""usable if very desperate!"" We threw it away and will be buying a new one from someone else. Allergies keep us from reading yellowed, smelly, 56 year old, heavily used, cheap books!!"
0,Poor Condition I mean I know I bought it used but it came with writing in the margins and half the book was highlighted. Someone's name and teacher written inside the cover. I bought it as a Christmas gift but that sure isn't happening.Will certainly keep in mind who I bought this from. I am pretty sure I would only buy something listed in good to excellent condition but oh well such is life. Not going to make a big deal out of it because its not worth my time but for future reference just send what people are expecting.
0,"An insight into the minds of young men with no rules This book conveyed a great message, but the naive characters were often not satisfactory heroes."
0,"desappointing although paid extra for expedite delivery, this school required book was delivered a month later!"
0,"YUCK All I have to say about this book is that it is disscusting, it is most not for little children"
0,Not what was advertised This book wasn't the edition that it said it was. On top of that it was full of markings with highlighter and pen. The pages were in good shape except for the writing everywhere. I'm very disappointed
0,"Most Disappointed Well, how can I review this product when it still haven't arrived. It has apparently been resent but once again hasn't arrived. Very disappointed!!!!"
0,"Late product This is a bad product, my package is late i ordered it almost a month ago and still haven't received it"
0,"Book was assembled poorly. Still a great story Unfortunately the copy that I recieved repeats Chapter 5, and is missing Chapters 6 and 7. We know it is a great story. Bought the book for my kid who needed it for for a school assignment. Quality control is unacceptable."
0,A very boring book. I might just be a teen in high school but I know what I like and this book was not one in my interest. Although William Gerald Golding wrote this worthwhile astonishing book it made no imapct to my opinion. The book was very well presented and had touching moments but lacked the realism that books have to maintain. Its moments of exitement were short lived and really weren't that exciting to begin with. All in all it was a hell of a book to those who actually like reading books. To tell the truth I hardly remember what the book was about.
0,"Thumbs down God this was terrible.A group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own. We see the rise and fall of their society as order is achieved; power corrupts the strongest of the group and the weakest members are dismissed or destroyed and finally chaos rules.Despite my dislike of this book, I'll admit it is a very true commentary on society. The powerful abuse those weaker than them; how quickly rules become obsolete when they become inconvenient; the set roles of people in society (the chubby guy with glasses can never be as powerful as the cool, good-looking guy).If you are not being forced to read this for school, please don't do it! The Simpsons parody of it is also a good thing to watch. At least in a cartoon it is entertaining, with just as much commentary on society as the original."
0,"An unimpressive let down I read Lord of the Flies and I can honestly say that it is thought of too highly.The symbolism is way to obvious, and pathetic fallacy is not used to it's full potential. There is no other book quite like it. Thank God."
0,SITHSPAWN-i hate this book Not sence reading the crystal Star and the Black Fleet Crisis Trilogy have i detested a book! If you want the point of the book watch the Simpsons parody. It's funnier and it makes fun of Bill Gates.
0,"Very Depressing I'm going into tenth grade at Poudre High School and this was one of the summer reading books we are required to read for the program I'm in called IB. This book was good in the sense that it focused on the faults of society through the group of stranded boys on the island, which was very creative. But I however did not like the book for the sole reason of the killings, and how the boys felt no remorse at all, except for Ralph. This is exaclty what the author intended of course, but I thought it was very morbid and cruel. I would advise you not to read this book if you are looking for something uplifting."
0,"Very Confusing and Not Very Fun I had to read this for a grade in Literature class, as did two of my other friends. Well, we all read the book and we all failed the test. Keep in mind, we are honor students. I would never recommend this book to anyone, especially not if it is crucial to your grade. It is a confusing, negative look at human nature, riddled with dreadful imagery and general savagery. Not exactly top on my list of favorite books, I don't think I could ever bear to read this again."
0,"This book is bad When I finished this book I was very depressed and somewhat angry. Most of the characters in this book remind me of the shooters at Littleton, CO. This book would probably disturb someone who had experienced violence at the hands of thier peers. Why are books like this on middle/high school reading lists? I thought we were trying to promote good values in school, not total disregard for life!"
0,"If only I could give it zero stars! This is the worst book I have ever read. It was extremely dull and violent at the same time. I usually read a book this length in three days, but it took me TWO MONTHS to read this book. I only read it because I had to for school, and I would not read this book again for anything. It was pointless and confusing. I don't care if it was figurative language or not, it was a really below average piece of work. Ugh."
0,"The Lord of the Flies I feel that this book reflects the society that we live in. In our world and the situation of the book. In their world and ours alike, we don't make piece, we have war and fights."
0,"BORING!!! This book is probably one of the most boring books I have EVER read! The book is about a group of boys stranded on an island. The author tries to show how society works, and what would happen if a group of young boys were stranded on an island, but fails miserably. His opinion of what would happen is just wrong. And even if you do agree (once you've read the book) the writing still destroys the book. It is such a slow book! Way too much unnecassary details! When it comes to an actual important part of the book, there is barely any time spent on it. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! (unless you want to see for yourself how bad it is!)"
0,"Cynicism at its best... It's interesting to see how cynical a successfull author can be, and how popular such cynicism can be. Lord of the Flies might be a suspenseful and thought-provoking book, but it's main thesis --children turning into beasts as soon as the burden of civilization is taken off them-- is utterly silly. It makes me wonder how many children Mr. William Golding really knew or talked to before writing this book. Children are always capable (many times much more than grownups) to act with common-sense and responsibility. I think Mr. Golding knew this (he can't be that narrow-minded), but simply choose to forget it since it would destroy his thesis and he wouldn't be able to write this novel. It's also fun to see how easily some authors can ignore or blur the most simple realities. I don't recommend this book to anyone who loves children and childhood, which is a period of exploration and friendships."
0,"lord of the flies bokk review ""The lord of the flies"" By william Golding, is in my opinion one of the most boring book i have ever read in my whole life. but on the other hand it did have alot to say about our ""humanly nature"" most of it was true.This book was like a little summary of our violent nature throughout history. But overall it was terably boring!!!!!"
0,the worst novel I have ever read the only reason for anyone to ever read this is for school word as it has no content to the book as well as the book is just about a bunch of kids turning into sick bastards which again makes me.... sick?
0,"Read the book instead This is a horrible audio book, read by the author. He offered an engaging prologue, but the reading of the book was just awful. The author was monotone, sighed while reading, and in general, sounded bored with the book. His reading does a disservice to the excellent story that he crafted."
0,"It's no Hunger Games! Lord of the Flies is alright I guess. I mean, I know it's a classic, but the plot is distinctly lacking in so many ways, you feel like it should be updated for today's readers. For instance, there are no touchscreen interfaces OF ANY KIND in this book. Nobody has a camelback or even an earth-friendly stainless steel water bottle. And unless I'm forgetting something, there's no suggestion whatsoever that aliens or supernatural intruders are secretly present on the island. I don't know, I guess there's just a lot of missed opportunity in this book. Maybe whoever wrote it should think about some revisions? Because as it is, there's really not much to it except a searing journey into mostly unanswerable questions about what it is to be human."
0,"Incredibly dull In my opinion, this is one of the most boring books ever written. Sure, Golding is trying to make a point about power's effect on social stability and structure, but it is lost in the mumbo jumbo style that he writes with. (The movie is also a pathetic depiction of this clichÃ©-ish message.) There are so many books out there that deal with this same topic, and because of this common subject matter, a novelist needs to be truly inventive to create a real masterpiece. This book should not be ranked anywhere near the top 100 novels on the Modern Library Association's list of the best novels of the 20th century."
0,"Wow, that was pretty bad! I think Golding really screwed up on this one...I found the plot really boaring and unrealistic. There were too many characters and most were undeveloped. And just when I thought the novel was the worst thing I ever encountered, I saw the old black and white Lord of Flies Movie. I really honestly think that a three-year old directed this...P-U."
0,"a big disappointment After all I had heard and read about Golding's Lord of the Flies I was expecting a novel story, not a Rbinson Crusoe cliche, or at least some good writing/language, but what I got was a story that could have been conjured up by my 11 year old kid: lots of repetition (the conch, the glasses, the beast, the fire)and not what one could term an erudite piece of writing. How this book gets onto college lists is beyond me. Are we actually meant to interpret/understand the vague imagery, if that's what it is? Boring. Unfortuantely this is my first Golding book, and I'm afraid it will be my last... for some time at least."
0,lord of the flies I didnt like this book.It was very boring and slow.I think that the book was very slow.The book was not good I would not read it again.I dont recommend this book to you.But you can read it if you want to.I am think that the rating is a 1. I didnt like this book at all I will not read it again.You shouldnt.I like about the book I liked. Not very muth but there is some stuff that is kind of cool like they call this fat kid piggy.
0,"The worst book I ever read This is the worst book I ever read. From the first time I read it 40 years ago, I could not imagine why it had not been banned. The viewpoint of mankind presented is so degraded and ugly that it should be. There is NO REASON to expose our young people to such negativity. No wonder they have so many psychological problems! Please, teachers, read positive works with your young students. The world is not like that, and it is our job to give them positive views for their future and ours!"
0,"I hate this book this book is uneventful and is savage, it ends poorly and overall I think it is really bad. If you really get into the philospphy behind this book, you'll find its almost depressing. On top of it, it is unrealistic."
0,"ok if you like adventure... For english class we had to read Lord of the Flies by Golding.. It was an ok book... if you like adventure stories... personally i dont. however Goldings use of symbolizm is great. The book sickened me at certain parts. The descriptions were great but after reading an entire chapter and then some more descriptions, it gets sort of boring. However i did like how Jack and Ralph TRIED to get along in the beggining you know BEFORE Jack went crazy. I also liked Goldings purpose of this book... how deep down, we are savages. And he was right."
0,"*WARNING* DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!! Hola- We read this book in our Freshman english class. The overall review was that it wasn't good, in fact it was BAD! We recommend that you do not read this book. We have nothing against the author, but we perfer reading interesting books, unlike this one. We didn't like the deaths, savagness, or irresponsibility of the children. THey needed to communicate with each other. If this book had a sequel I think that would be boring, but atleast you'd fing out what happened. THe book went to slow and the plot used too much symbolism. This book deserves 0 stars, but that wasn't an option! Hasta Luego- iSABeL and r0sA"
0,"DONT READ THIS! NO!!!! I have looked at all the reviews on this book and I have found that most of them are 5 and 4 stars!!! How could that be???? This is one of the worst books that I have ever read! The descriptions are meaningless and when the author do describes something he takes a page to describe something that should take 3 sentences at the most. I did not like the plot of this story and although it had an interesting idea I don't think the author did much with it. It is full of violence that is un-needed. If you see this book on the shelves, cover your innocent eyes from this evil, and run! DO NOT LOOK BACK! If this book was a horse, I would shoot it! It is very annoying to read and this book scares little children!"
0,What a waste of time!! I really hated this book. I only read it because I was forced to read it in school. I think that the author is trying too hard to write a good book. There must have been a reason why this was out on the market for 5 years before anyone picked it up. The author tells you too much information in a short amount of time. He starts to talk about something and then just moves on to something else. He also leaves you hanging. He also uses way too many uncompleted sentences! Reading this book was a complete and total waste of my time!!!!!!
0,"Worst required reading EVER! This is required reading in 9th grade. While there are quite a few lessons one can learn from it, storywise it is the worst book I've ever read (and the movie is not any better)!!"
0,Very boring and hard to follow. This book was not very interesting at all. Maybe if he talked about more than a couple of things it might just be interesting.
0,"I did not understand this book! I hated it, it was soo confusing. I had to read it in 5th grade and no one understood it at all."
0,"Waste of Time I was asked to read this book, and I thought the title was interesting. Well, I was wrong. The only good part was the last chapter!!! Here is a basic synopsis of the book: A bunch of boys are stranded on an Island. They know how they got there, an airplane. None of them know each other (unless they went to school with others), yet they were all on the same plane. The pilot did not survive. Some of the boys become obssessed with killing while others are obssessed with being rescued. Kids die and a few turn cannibalistic. I won' t tell you the end, but there is absolutely no point in reading this book unless you like being bored out of your mind when reading. By the way, the title has relatively nothing to do with the book."
0,"What was Golding thinking? Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature."
0,"Horrible ! I had to read this book in my English class and it was horrible. It was bloody, depressing, and absolutly vile. I found my self cringe when I thought about reading it. If you have a tough time thinking back on your high school day because people were descriminating to you because of the way you looked or acted, this book will re-open those painfull scars. Nobody should ever recommend this book because it's so depressing and wretched."
0,"Disturbed While this book was well written and created vivid pictures, I was disturbed by the the theme of this story. It was extremely odd and disgusting. After hearing that this book has recieved high ratings, I was very dissapointed with the warped ideas Golding used to express ""human nature"". I do not reccomend this book."
0,"They made us read it I first read this book 30 years ago for a high school English class. I found it to be horrible. I recently read it a second time when my daughter read it for her English class. A thing of art may be a thing of beauty, but this book is a perpetual piece of trash! My daughter who has read hundreds of books says it is the second worst book she has ever read. English teachers please take note - this is not wine that gets better with age. It is more like stale beer."
0,"Well written , but disturbing! The purpose of this book was to reveal the loss of innocence. Lord of The Flies was well written and very descriptive. I hated reading this book with a passion. I personally wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because it is disturbing.I guess there are certain types of people who like to read books like this and I'm not one of them."
0,"""Lord of the Flies"" Sinks This is the only book I've ever read that I actively dislike. I'd be tempted to say that it's an accursed book. The imagery is somewhat confusing and, when worked out, sometimes means the opposite of what I think it should mean. There is some semblance of a plot, but it does not follow a clear story line. The thoughts behind the book are garbled, the language often muddy, and one has the feeling that if there had been just one female on the island of whatever age, none of the events would have happened. These were not the actions of boys. It was not a representation of society. It butchered my mind as surely as the schoolboys butchered each other."
0,"This Isn't The John York I haven't actually listened to this CD. But, this is not the John York who played with The Byrds from 1968 to 1969. This John York CD has been linked to this along with a book on The Byrds. It's a different guy. Just thought you should know."
0,briliant This is probbably the best book i have ever read.it starts of good and gets better.it keeps geting better and the end is the best bit.if i had not read this book i would read it again.there are so many good bits.
0,"The worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read This book starts badly and gets progressively worse. By the time I had finished this ""book""(!), I just felt compelled to register my disgust throughout the world. I really do not see what all of the fuss is about. It is just too farfetched, I mean, all the book is, is ""Romeo and Juliet"" set in the backdrop of some God-forsaken island that no-one has heard of. In closing, I would just like to say that I think that this book should be ""nitrogenated"" over, as Dr Iannis so succinctly puts it."
0,Bad size Garmin GPS coverDon't make my error and assume this cover will fit the popular Nuvi series-there are none.
0,"Disappointing: Outdated and Not Useful This book was written in 1987! Technically speaking, it's completely out of date.My major criticism, though, is the low value of the content. Do we really need to be taught that soft or pastel colors appeal more to women? Not only is that kind of thinking outdated, but who needs to read a book with that level of ""information""?"
0,"Interesting, but not enough to keep me involved. I was forced to read this book for a combination honors English, History class. We were studying the Guilded Age and the teachers felt this novel would help to portray exactly what people went through. Needless to say I was very bored. The descriptions are so intense and Dreiser's style of writing was not enough to keep me awake. There were certain aspects that I enjoyed, however the majority of this novel was comprised of verbose sections. This book did not really meet my expectations and I was not very satisfied. However, I was told that you might need to read it 5 times before all of the meaning would come through. I wouldn't give it the time."

I bought it in the hopes of learning something better than the normal mneumonic techniques;however,her book showed techniques that were impractical and plain dumb. For all those out there looking for a good book on memory that will really WORK!!!! Try Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas's The Memory Book. The techniques are easy to learn, but will take time to apply to information for school. However, you will be rewarded for your efforts."
0,I Wasted 10 valuable hours of my life This book is appauling. I love horror books but this one is written in such an amateurish way that I am sure that Mr Cunningham must return either to his previous job as an art expert or take up a new proffession as an extra on the next Flintstones movie. Truly a waste of time.

0,"Major Disappointment As a lover of all things Austen, I was very excited when I first came upon this book. But this completion of Sanditon is incredibly weak. The plot wanders aimlessly, although ""wanders"" is perhaps too favorable of a term since it implies some momentum.Worse, the characterization is frightfully dull. The previous Sanditon completion in the 1970s by ""Another Lady"" is vastly superior, fleshing out very memorable characters and making you really care about Charlotte. By the end of this book, I didn't care about any of the characters as they were so frightfully dull. The climactic conclusion was more like an afterthought; perhaps the writer(s) wanted to be done with the book as fast as I did.Avoid this debacle and track down the completion by ""Another Lady"" instead."
0,"A waste of time, not worth reading I found this novel terrible and was a waste of time. I can't bare reading another page after chapter 11 where Austen had left it. This is by far the worst novel I've ever read. If you want to read the completed version of Sanditon, I would suggest Sanditon by Another Lady. It's a good novel and was well done compare to this clumsy one. This novel is not at all worth reading."
0,"Absolutely awful - zero stars! I love all of JA's work, and have also read many sequels/continuations with varying degrees of enjoyment. But this is by far the worst. It has nothing of JA's style, wit, irony, insight into human nature, etc., etc., etc. The people who gave this 'work' good reviews must only have read the fragment actually written by JA or must be shills for the publisher. For more detailed comments, I recommend reading any of the many reviews which gave 1 star, which I assume they did because they did not know one could give zero, or the amazon web site won't allow it; if you find this review listed with the generous rating of 1 star, then you will it is the latter."
0,"Pure junk I'd always heard great things about numark products, so I decided to roll the dice on the PT01, a big mistake. The good, is that it is a light weight truly portable turntable. The built in speaker provides pretty good sound for being a small speaker. Why the 1 star? b/c the player is poorly constructed. The shiny top piece is poorly glued on, and pops up rubbing against the record while its playing. This causes the record to wobble and creates a very poor sound. I had to put a weight on the player to keep the piece from popping up in order for it to play properly. Little to say I will be staying away from numark products, and I highly recommend that anyone in the market for a player such as this look else where."
0,Poor Quality Control The large silver colored base around the platter would NOT stay in place. It is only held down by a sticky material underneath it. The one I purchased was raised up just behind the platter and rubbed on the record. Very poor quality construction and no final inspection at the factory. Good luck if you buy one. I returned mine to Amazon. It's been over two (2) weeks and I have not received any acknowledgment from Amazon regarding the return.
0,"Turntable is uneven. I bought this for my roommate as a Christmas/graduation present. When she opened it and threw a record on we noticed a distortion in the sound which we initially attributed to the record being warped. Several more records later and we discovered that the felt on the turntable was unevenly applied, causing a ""hump"" in the record's path under the needle, distorting the music. To be fair, we haven't contacted the manufacturer yet to see if this is something that could be repaired or replaced. It's still disappointing to give a gift that's nonfunctional however."
0,"Unsatisfied I purchased this turntable to listen to records. However, the speaker is so faint it's barely audible. I've returned it and am back to looking for a good one. This turntable is perfect if you're looking to transfer audio or use external speakers...just don't count on it to stand on its own."
0,"Would be great if it worked I received this same record player as a gift a few years ago, and it works fine for me. But when I bought another record player for my roommate, it played for 6 days and then completely died. Flip the power switch, no light, and the machine won't turn when you move the needle. I asked for a return, but won't be receiving any refund because the box it came in isn't the box it was sent back in, because I'd already recycled the cardboard. Apparently, the company values the cardboard box much higher than the machine, so be super careful. It's a piece of crap, and they know it."
0,"Stopped working I bought the Numark PT-01 USB portable turntable in January of 2009 and was pleased with it at first. I hadn't used it for about a year and today when I tried it the turntable did not play at the correct speed. There was no difference between the 33 and 1/3, 45 and 78 rpm settings, and even at the 78 speed the rate was slower than 33 and 1/3. I have no idea how to get this fixed. When I was using it it was also very difficult to get replacement styluses. I don't think Numark still supports this product and wouldn't recommend it."
0,Wrong item sent I ordered a 2m USB download cable for a Nikon Coolpix Model 4600 digital camera. The item that arrived had the wrong connector for my camera which made it worthless for me. The item cost about $5 and I didn't think it was worth the time to send it back.

0,"Typical new Asia - trying to re-write history Anthology, like the great Communist purges of 1930s and 40s, appears to be an attempt to act as if the past never happened. Why else would Geoff Downes think he could get away with re-recording the band's best-known hits with a singer-guitarist (John Payne) who can't hold a candle to either John Wetton or Steve Howe? Payne's re-makes are embarrasing, and the new stuff is woefully poor; as dreadful as the new material on ""Then & Now"" was, I'd rather listen to that compared with anything this disc has to offer."
0,AWFUL!!!! Geoff Downes really butchered some classic songs from this classic band! Rerecording classic songs with an awful singer is THE worst thing ever accomplished in modern music. The songs even take a slight dance feel that worsens it even more! This band sucks!!!!!(BRING BACK JOHN WETTON!!!)

0,"What a Setup! I was going along with most of this until the last two chapters when it becomes very similar to the Left Behind Christian rubbish. Most of the principals the ET's present are very close to Eastern philosophies and religions. But then the last couple of chapters predicts the Second Coming of Jesus where he will collect his flock. Those not ready will have to wait another 26,000 years to be ""saved"". One of the ETs even claims to be John the Baptist. Avoid unless you are a Left Behind fairy tale fan."

0,"DRIVEL This is not a good book; if you want real mystery, read P.D. James, Conan Doyle or a host of others.Robinson's character is gimmicky; the plot is gimmicky; his writing style is gimmicky.If you have insomnia, however, this would be a good book to purchase.Also, comparing Robinson to Grisham is like comparing a painter of Elvis Presley velvets to Leonardo Da Vinci. Robinson's not a real writer, let alone an artist."
0,"Don't get this Kindle version!! This Kindle version is loaded with distracting typos, on every page. Not worth the price."
0,"Who wants to go home again to read this? Don't waste your time with this nonsense. I slogged my way through this novel a year or so ago, hoping there was something of value here. There was not. It is boring beyond what mere words can ever say. I'd rather cut my lawn with a pair of scissors than read this book. It would take less time and be more enjoyable."
0,"the absolute worst!!! Does anyone have the guts to evaluate honestly???? This book is pathetic, 100 page tangents with absolutely no relevancy litter this book. It is dull writing and so unfocused that the only reason to continue reading it is that it is a ""classic"". Well classics usually receive the title for a reason, but mistakes abound... I realize we all have different opinions, mine is that the only reason one would claim to like this book is that they are 'cultured'...i have no specific comments to make because this novel has no redeeming thing about it (and because I read it 5 years ago and no way in hell am i going to go through that again just to give a fair review). By all means, read this 'classic' and then read any hemingway you can find...and then think for yourself (or don't, I guess i don't really care)"
0,THE WORST FAMOUS AMERICAN WRITER EVER BORN Without a doubt Thomas Wolfe is the worst...I tried reading this book many years ago...it was awful and dull and boring beyond description...anyone who recomends this book must be a dullard.c
0,"Not even interesting This is the worst video purchase I have EVER made. I truly wasted by money! It was not even the least bit informative or entertaining. Although I would love to get my money back, I know it is utterly impossible. I would not recommend that anyone ever buy this mess. Thanks a lot."

0,Just use Cascade I couldn't find this locally and thought it was pretty pricey if ordered through Amazon. So I just followed another commenter's suggestion and used two tablespoons of Cascade powder dishwasher detergent. It worked great. My percolator is bright and shiny.
0,old product--past shelf date The contents of all the boxes were molded together; it was impossible to pour as a powder These boxes must have sat in a warehouse for years before being shipped. I went out and purchased the same product from a local grocery store and it was perfect. The powder poured from the box like water.
0,"Don't buy it unless you're looking for an art book This book is an art book, like the kind you can buy at art galleries. It reviews the inspiration the kimono had to modern American art. I wasted $50 canadian on this book because I thought it would be an invaluable reference for Kimono making. It's not. If you're an art teacher or student who is absolutely IN NEED of an art book on kimono art, then by all means purchase this book. If you aren't, then don't."
0,"Bastardization of a beautiful garment This book takes the beauty of the traditional kimono and turns it into an abomination as ""art to wear"". The kimono already IS art to wear. It doesn't need to be dragged down by modernization.But that is not my only problem with this book. In the history section, written by Toshiki Wada, the editing is so bad that spelling mistakes are made and repeated. Also, Miss Wada needs to pick up a history book sometime very soon. Her grasp on the history of Japanese clothing is tenuous at best and the more bad history sections she writes (like this one and the one in ""Shibori""), the more misinformation she disseminates to the English-speaking public.Ignore any historical information on the kimono written or ""edited"" by Wada. Go out and buy Dalby instead."
0,"A big disappointment The only thing I'm happy about is that I got this book from the library and didn't pay for it. It was the worst book I've ever read. I finished it because I couldn't believe it was as boring and shallow as it was and thought, hoped it might change. Some men can write from a woman's point of view, but this author cannot or did not in this book. I feel he wrote it while watching a crime drama on TV. Nothing new, interesting. The dialogue was the most trivial and boring I've ever read in a book. The characters were flat, shallow and full of the Boston cynicism that is reason I left Boston. All the softness, love and caring was focussed on the dog. People are afraid to show themselves. I wouldn't want to meet any of the characters or the author!"
0,"Woops Yeah, I am a big fan of moby, and accidentally buying the CD that almost ended his career doesn't shake that, if you want some good Moby might I suggest 18 or Play, this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise, but fail to build up to anything, everything else is Moby screaming in a traditional punk style, which were almost humorous, except, not [this much money] humorous, I am not a fan of this CD, I know he was starting out in a punk band, but his other stuff is much better"
0,Poor Quality. The seat covers started coming loose at the seams immediately upon putting them on the seats.
0,Awful The Call is set to Carnival music and is simply irritating. The scenes are disturbing (for example a fly eating someone's head). It is also dull. I was neither entertained nor inspired by this. I wouldn't watch the video again if someone paid me to view it. It is a shame to get a video and immediately throw it away.
0,"I got it to work and still hated it. I have a Nokia 5190 from Cingular and eagerly ordered this unit. Cingular charged me a flat rate of $... a month just for datalink service, and then minutes on top of that, but that's not too expensive for wireless internet access.I got it installed and running in about 45 minutes and proceeded to try it out. I got so annoyed with the speed, the bulky cable, the connect time (~30 to 40 seconds) and the intermittent service, that I gave up and returned it.Don't bother."
0,"Do NOT buy If I could give it zero stars, I would. Plain and simple, it doesn't work. I plugged the unit into my Visor Deluxe, connected the cable to my Nokia, tried connecting and received the error message ""No dial tone."" It also seems to crash my phone in that half of the time it tries to connect, my phone ends up shutting off.The Xircom website has little by the means of support for this product and nothing specifically addressing this issue of not connecting, let alone crashing the phone.I've spent nearly an hour looking for support manuals and trying to connect without luck. The only review I can find on this product is one here on Amazon. I would also like to make an observation: this product is not listed on the Handspring website, nor at PalmGear. What does this say for the product?All in all, a huge disappointment."
0,"I'd give it more stars if it worked! Well, the module seems to install just fine (make sure you move Mobilelink into flash or you'll crash your unit). I'm trying to use mine my color Prism. The only problem is that my Nokia 5190 doesn't want to cooperate, so I still haven't surfed with this thing yet. I get a ""Check Operator Services&quit; error on the screen of my Nokia, and it disconnects. Even so, I bought it because it was a lot cheaper than a wireless web module (hey, why buy the wireless hardware again - it's already in my phone), and I avoid a [monthly] charge for service. I just use my cell phone minutes, which is fine for brief email uploads/downloads. We'll see what happens to my cell phone bill once I get sucked into online surfing of the PDA-enabled websites. So, once I get around to calling Xircom for some help, I'll report back on this thing actually works."

0,"Never been so disappointed by a good concept gone wrong The concept for this series is great, but it's done really badly, without going into details all the main characters are Jews who can do no wrong and everyone else is a belligerent fool, I was looking forward to a good military sci-fi and instead got what reads like political propaganda."
0,"Good idea. Bad book. Having read the last three books (couldn't find the first) I kept expecting it to get better. It didn't. It was an excelent idea but are all Germans really evil? Are all English and Americans really good? There were so many subplots it was hard to keep track of what was going on. Each subplot was mentioned in each chapter and many had nothing to do with the main plot. Made you wonder why they were written other that to just fill paper.Turtledove missed a good opportunity here to write a classic science fiction novel. He would have been better off to mention his idea to someone else and let them write a 600 page novel than meander through 2400 pages himself.Yup, still read three of the four books and he is spending the royalies he made off me!"
0,"Glacially slow and annoyingly repetitious. The basic idea for this series was pretty good. Even in Turtledove's hack writer clutches, it should have yielded a decent book. Padded, stretched and drawn out over multiple volumes, it is an utter waste of time. Turtledove must have been getting paid by the word."
0,"Not believeable I found the characters including the historical ones to be unbelieveable. I don't think some of the historical figures would have acted as they did. The aliens are naive beyond belief. They just don't seem that bright. I don't think they could successfully invade my grandmother's kitchen. The aliens can somehow cross lightyears of space, but their technology doesn't seem to be more advanced then that shown in the Gulf War. A worthy attempt at an alternative history that just falls flat. I don't think I'll bother finishing this series. Try Harry Harrison's East of Eden for a great alternative history."
0,"Couldn't wait for it to end The idiotic plot moves at a glacial pace, and the characterizations are laughable. The book's multinational cast of characters is composed largely of ridiculous cultural stereotypes."
0,"What the crap? Sorry, but if all your band can do is take existing music and scream over it....yeah...where's the talent? Zero was absolutly ruined by this band and I, for one, think its a shame that this band was even allowed to remake some of these songs. Just horrible. If I could give it a -1 I would."
0,"Awful If you really want to hear the exact same songs played note-for-note with screaming vocals and a little more distortion, go ahead and buy it. But in all, this album is terrible. It consists ONLY of poorly rendered covers with no surprises and no artistic changes except for the hardcore screaming.Don't even bother."
0,"Ruined songs... I already hated all the bands & songs that evergreen t covered and now i have a even more reason to hate them...Why ? evergreen terrence cover those bands, the worse hardcore band ever. sunday bloody sunday by U2 ? Come now, they suck ! The worse cover song tho was zero by the smashing pumpkings...God, i remenber hating that band & song. Well, now i've a reason to hate it even more. Thanks to evergreen terrible! Hardcore music blows! Listing to some gore-grind & deathmetal. Now, thats music !"
0,"laughable I'm a fan of this genre and was looking forward to my first book by this author. Very disappointed. The idea of a plot against FDR and WC is fine (though we know outcome ahead of time) but the writing sinks the book. The coincidences relied upon to keep the plot moving are rediculous (coincidences usually play a role in spy thrillers but here seem to be used simply out of laziness or lack of imagination). The dialogue is wooden beyond belief as if taken from Hollywood B movies of the 1940s. If the book was ""extensively researched"" (see Amazon review) it doesn't show. The period touches amount to the simple mentioning of makes of old cars, military planes and weapons. For far superior WWII espionage fiction read Alan Furst."
0,"How does stuff like this get published? As with the Meade books, someone has to be kidding someone and doing something to someone for something to get this stuff into print. Really, why BS people about stuff that is boring and tiresome. Will St Martin Press give refunds while Mr Meade's connections get him another deal? I am sick of being suckered by your phony reviews."

The story line is ok but the series sucks!See the Original movie with a fetching young Fairuza Balk as Mildred Hubble.Even my niece who's 7 hated this movie but loved the original.

You'll love it !!!!!!!!!!"
0,"And Ms. Hegi's point is? Early on, I found the author's descriptions of the characters and their Bronx neighborhood both charming and (as a displaced Bronxite of the generation represented by the book's central figure) right-on. Unfortunately, the personal journey each of her characters pursues over some forty-plus years was hopelessly flat and failed to sustain my interest as I labored through to the last, unrevealing chapter. I found myself wondering what point Ms. Hegi was trying to make. Whatever she was aiming at, it never came to fruition."
0,"A family saga that disappoints I got this book because Ursula Hegi wrote an Oprah Winfrey pick ""Stone From the River"" some years ago and I remember enjoying that book.. While I love a good family saga, I cared nothing about any of the characters in this book. It was tedious, boring and repetitive. The premise of how an act in childhood affects members of several families for years to come seemed intriguing, but it was the only reason that held me to the end and then I realized that the book was actually a waste of time."

0,"Poor DVD Quality - Not Able to Watch We bought several seasons of Weeds during after Christmas sales last year. It took as a while to get around to watching them. However, on at least THREE seasons, the DVDs were damaged beyond being able to watch. Buying the seasons was such a WASTE since the DVDs are worthless. I do not recommend buying these DVDs. I have never had trouble with other DVDs purchased from Amazon."
0,"Beware: region coded Unlike seasons 1 - 3 of Weeds, this blu-ray is region coded and will noy work on European players. I've bought a useless disc.Since Weeds is unavailable on blu-ray in my country (Holland), to me this means it's another example on how the industry discourages customers that like to buy their media legally. I guess I'll have to resort to downloading the rest of the series.At least we are able to buy real weed here legally."
0,"This series went downhill after Season 2 I enjoyed the first 2 seasons of Weeds, and I tolerated the 3rd season, but I just couldn't find anything at all to like about season 4. If you can get it free somewhere, I would say go ahead and watch it, but don't pay money for it..it's not worth it. I was given seasons 5 and 6 and I watched all of 5 but only got halfway through 6..by that point the lead character is so horrible and the whole plot so tired I couldn't keep watching even for free lol."

0,"Kate Mulgrew before Voyager ""A Time for Miracles"" is an underrated gem. Showing a bit of American history that is often neglected, and showing Kate Mulgrew as a determined woman who was strong willed, clever, not afraid of anyone, and was fond of coffee. No wonder she was cast as Katherine Janeway."
0,"It really could have been more realistic. This is sweet family fare, but that is what it is -- sweet. Where is the dirt of the 18th century? Where are the stinks and the vile smell -- even from the Roman curia?Unfortunately this all reeks of one of Kate Mulgrew's ""Irish Spring"" commercials.Saints aren't usually this nice. They are rebels who seek not only to serve God, but to upturn the status-quo. Mother Seton seems to work with the status-quo quite well. Where is the persecution? Where is the burning anger a saint often feels?Isn't there more?Just too sweet for my taste."
0,"Read ""Butler's Lives of the Saints"" Instead This is a remarkably uncatholic movie that is supposedly about a famous Catholic. St. Bonaventure said that those who do not have a devotion to Our Lady will die in their sins and be damned for all of eternity. Nevertheless, Elizabeth Seton is never portrayed as having a devotion to Our Lady and indeed, never even says one hail mary that I could see. Other Catholic teachings are notably absent. The acting and production values are lamentably poor. Read ""Butler's Lives of the Saints"" or ""The Baltimore Catechism"" instead."
0,"This is Love? Julia, kidnapped by Alec to keep his inheritance, is a reformer who demands half of Alec's inheritance to help her in her Women's Society efforts. Alec should have sent Julia packing. She supposedly loved him for years but instead of behaving in a friendly manner, loving I guess was too much to ask for, is always a shrew to Alec. Why? It is logical to assume that the more shrewish and unreasonable, yes very unreasonable, she became, the more problems they would have. This is not a good love story in that I wish Alec would have found someone else. Lucien's story, which comes out in 2001, I look forward to and I hope he choses more wisely."
0,"Interesting Start.. Then really boring! This book had an excellent theme: ugly duckling intrigues handsome hero with her wit and unique character, and then she becomes a swan and steals the hero's heart. The book had a promising start with interesting dialogue and the instant attraction of the h/h. However.... the book quickly bogged down. Despite their mutual attraction, and the fact that Julia has loved the hero for four years, and the fact that they are MARRIED - the couple have hardly any physical interaction in the book. The smolder that started in the first dozen pages was all smoke and no fire for this reader. When the couple finally consummate the marriage, it is a disappointment and I almost didn't care! I skipped through pages and pages of this book - which is something I have NEVER done before. Since this was the author's first book, perhaps I will give her one more chance in a more recent work. However, I will certainly check it out at the library before I buy any of her other books."
0,"Forgettable I didn't like this book. I found it really boring. I had to force myself to finish it. The heroine was too perfect, and I didn't feel that she and the hero had a lot of chemistry. I prefer passionate love stories. They were so dull together. I don't think I'll be buying another book by this author."
0,"""Very Boring"" I lot of unnecessary writing. Too boring. I will not be picking up anything else by this author. For all the readers that rated this book a 4 or 5....they must have mistaken this book for another."

I feel fooled by the cover art and the other customer reviews."
0,"Haste makes waste This was the first book I bought when I was learning how to write screenplays. I have a finished screenplay now, but this book was not at all helpful. In my opinion this book adds to the difficulty of writing a screenplay when there is a time factor. I would suggest a period of at least 2 months, most of the time going into planning. Who really cares about how quick you can write a screenplay, isn't the real goal to see how good you can write one? By the way of all the seminars by professional screenwriters that I've been to, I've brought this book up. None of them cared for it. Suggested instead was WRITING SCREENPLAYS THAT SELL by Michael Hauge, and after that Syd Field's books which go more into detail."
0,"REALLY WIERD! I thought this book was the strangest I've ever read regarding screenwriting. Screenwriting and spirituality may or may not mix, but spirituality really has nothing to do with writing a good screenplay! I have to agree with the previous reviewer who gave the book one star and say that I, too, found little practical advice in this book and the premise is even stranger. Why 21 days? Why does the author suggest that we whip out a screenplay in only 21 days? Isn't quality better than speed. I recommend Syd Field and Lajos Egri instead. Both are real pros and their books offer much detail and useful advice."
0,Did not like it. I am unsure what I was expecting but this was not a good story. I did not care for the authors viewpoint. She was hard to relate too and not easily liked.
0,"I hate it After reading the book and having the pleasure of meeting the authors in Missouri, all I can say...nothing new here.

0,"ONE OF THE WORST VIDEOS EVER! DO NOT -- I repeat -- do NOT say you were not forewarned if you buy this video!! It is HORRIBLE!! I bought this video in anticipation of visiting Santiago, expecting film footage and information on the shrine. Instead, it contains about 27 minutes of two old men's comments on their journey through Spain and the surrounding countryside, and only about 3 minutes worth of film or information on the shrine or city itself!! VERY DISAPPOINTING if you are looking for real information, as I was. What a ripoff!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!"
0,"Faceless by David Douglas Duncan Only on very rare occasions has Henri Cartier-Bresson who has spent his adult life capturing the images of others allowed himself to be photographed. Mr. Duncan's decisive five minutes with his former associate now provide a unique opportunity to see HCB in action, but I suspect that ""Faceless"" would not have sat still for the candids if he realized that his old friend DDD was going to blow his cover and publish the off-guard moments. One reviewer of this book notes that Mr. Duncan lost his friendship with HCB because he published these photos. Even though the proceeds from the book will go to the University of Texas, losing a friendship would not be worth this book of snapshots."
0,"bad plug eventhough the add for this charger speaker said it would fit several garmin models including the 478 which is what I have, it does not work with my unit. It will plug in and if I want to hold the plug in place, will work.However if you are not able to hold the cable and the unit together, it will fall out. comparing it to my existing charger cord, it is missing a flared out area close to the end of the cord which would allow friction to hold the cord in place. This cord does not have this, it is not the same as the cords that I have purchased in the past and therefore it is useless to me.It was a good price and I liked the fact that the cord did not have a 90 degree turn at the plug but it still does not stay in place and cannot be used."
0,Dreadful quality DVD! The quality of the reproduction on this DVD is appalling and I've had to return this disc as it is unwatchable! Your other reviewers seem to think that the low price more than compensates for the lack of quality!? This disc is an insult to three 'classic' films!This disc is really very poor and it's cost me a lot of good money in returning it!
0,"pretensious While at first drawn into the lush visual imagery, I eventually found the poems, and long journal in the back, strikingly empty. Christopher seems to be a showman, constantly performing for the reader with too many sleights of hand and verbal somersaults. The basic premise of the journal is interesting, but Christopher takes the rumination of life and death to a cloyingly predictable, pretensious degree. The Dcotor, the driver are one dimensional figures trapped in Christopher's invention. The overall effect is a kind of patronizing and inaccessible work, where Christopher's characters are walking blindly through a universe of chaos, where the poet seems to mourn their darkness yet fail to illuminate much for the reader. A depressing combination, in part because the poet obviously spent a good deal of energy performing for the reader during what's essentially an empty journey."
0,"Wake Me When It's Over!! Enticed by the title, I bought this audio to help me out of the slump I've been in. While there are some good suggestions, this guy is BORING! One of his suggestions to motivate yourself is to do 2 things that you dislike doing everyday--I guess so that you will enjoy the things you do like even more. It was this thought that motivated me to get through to the end of this tape"
0,"The key in in the title: ""Yourself"" I listen to this CD several times a year. I gave the book away long ago, but I think I should buy one once a month and give it to someone who needs it. Lots of people understand this book because they understand the most effective tool left unused is worthless. Insights, many simple, put into practice will change your life. This is the gift of these thoughts. DO ONE or TWO and see if you are not changed. Four circles is my favorite; its easy and always puts a focus on the lifetime that exists within my day."
1,"Inspiring I hope a lot of people hear this cd. We need more strong and positive vibes like this. Great vocals, fresh tunes, cross-cultural happiness. Her blues is from the gut. The pop sounds are catchy and mature."
1,"The best soundtrack ever to anything. I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny."
1,Too good to be true Probably the greatest soundtrack in history! Usually it's better to have played the game first but this is so enjoyable anyway! I worked so hard getting this soundtrack and after spending [money] to get it it was really worth every penny!! Get this OST! it's amazing! The first few tracks will have you dancing around with delight (especially Scars Left by Time)!! BUY IT NOW!!

1,Excellent Product This is an excellent product. I bought this for my digital camera. It has a great battery life per charge. Charger is handy to carry.
1,"To ""Disappointed"" in Miami You said ""...but the charge only lasts a very short time.""Did you know that new Ni-MH batteries must be cycled 3 to 5 times before they hold a full charge? This does not mean that they should be charged 3 to 5 times in a row but rather that for the first 3 to 5 charge/discharge cycles, the batteries reach a higher charge level each time until they are recharged until they finally reach their rated capacity. This may be your problem. Try doing this and you might be pleasantly surprised."
1,"Awesome - wanna use dramatica? You definitely need this book It's just awesome, even better than what you can read online about using dramatica of Armando. If you want to use Dramatica - and don't want to get lost eventually - you really, really, really need this guide to get to some point you can call your plot really a plot. This book just makes you very, very happy. For it will boost your efforts to really WORK with dramatica. I only wish we had had that book ten years before. So I do highly recommend it. Even if you aren't a native speaker like me, having german as my mother tongue. I would never have made it with the DRAMATICA SOFTWARE if I haven't had this book. Believe me. It's worth every Cent (I payed in Euro). Though I tried very hard for roundabout 2 years I was coming to fail with Dramatica 4.0. This book saved my ass. Let it save yours too. It's making me happy. Thank you so much, Armando. Greetings from Germany, Cologne"
1,"Very Happy - Has ""Random"" capability for MP3s I got this machine primarily for the DVD with MP3 playback. It turns out, that most DVD players with MP3 capability don't allow you to select ""random"" playing of the tracks!??? I replaced my 12 year-old CD player and my sub-par VCR with this one machine. I'm very happy with it so far, although I wish it had another component input in the back. The DVD playback is awesome. The VCR playback seems fine as well, although since getting TiVo, I don't really use it that much. I recommend this to anyone who wants a versatile player of good quality."

1,"Great reference book for its topic It seems somebody was complaining for the printing quality. This is not a calculus book. If you take most theoretical books, and certainly most Springer's book, they don't have nice full color Barney images. This is technical (mostly theoretical) stuff. There is, in my opinion, no problem with the printing at all, clear, quality monochromatic printing.With respect to the contents of the book, it has almost everything you may want to know about Vector (and even Scalar) quantization and Signal compression. It was a great help while I was writing my doctoral thesis. Gray is probably one of the most respected authorities in the field."
1,"Here is a little secret. After you watch a few episodes, it will be fairly clear to you who the two central characters are. If you enjoy a fitting but bleak ending, stop at Season 3, Episode 5. But if you prefer romantic comedies, view through 3/5 then skip to Season 4, Episode 3, as the final act."
1,"Rochelle explains It All for You Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. A great book"
1,"Spreading a Passion for God Piper has a passion for the glory of Christ that is contagious. I've watched these videos multiple times and glean something from it every time. Amazing that he presents this MEATY material to a youth group and they are transfixed the entire time.I don't really care for the youth interviews, but I understand given the format of the original presentation. I've used this in a men's group and all enjoyed the material and we had some great discussions.I'd recommend to anybody. The humility and genuine concern of Piper toward his audience is refreshing against some of the other more famous ""christian leaders"" today."

1,"Dk Travel guides The Dk Travel guides are the best travel guides produced, each one a high quality illustrated encyclopedia on the country or city it represents. They are invaluable guides. The only disadvantage is that they are a bit on the heavy side, but the quality of printing and extensive range of color photos offsets that."

1,"Wonderful Game Got the game for my daughter when she was four and she LOVES it. She finished it rather quickly and the games are not particularly difficult or educational, but she still occasionally likes to play it. It's a beautiful game. I wrote this review because the game froze on us as well. I had to update our video card driver and it has worked perfectly since. Hope this helps."
1,"NYTimes Likes IT BARBIE AS RAPUNZEL: A CREATIVE ADVENTURE. I don't like Barbie, yet even with my negative attitude I appreciated the Barbie as Rapunzel adventure. This is a creative game in which the player must help Barbie free Prince Stefan from an evil spell by restoring a cursed and very run-down castle. The player takes Barbie around the castle and selects colors and patterns to decorate with magic paintbrushes and wands. Once each room is redecorated, Barbie retrieves a gem that will eventually be placed in the prince's crown to break the spell on him. The Barbie and Prince get to live in their renovated home - happily ever after, of course."
1,"Hamelin does it again I confess to being a Hamelin fanatic! To me, Marc-Andre Hamelin is the best pianist performing today and I anxiously await new recordings by him. The Brahms is one of the greatest concertos ever written and it's one of my favorites. Hamelin plays it supperbly and the orchestra, under Litton's leadership, provides exceptional support. This is a ""must have"" CD for anyone who loves great piano playing. The Hyperion sound is fabulous, as usual too."
1,super I just love this album. Soulwax is great but this house/rave mix is even better. Can't stop moving while you listen to it.
1,"A Beautiful Map This map is clear and informative, but more than that, it is beautiful to look at.Ordering it from the UK, I would have liked a quicker delivery option. But it arrived more or less when they promised -- if anything, a week sooner than I expected.Thoroughly satisfied with this purchase."
1,"Karen Cummings, comes through. Wonderful! Karen Cummings writes a book that tells you all thebasics of cat care and tailors it to the Birman breed. The excellentphotographs enable the reader to see what a Birman really looks like. The history of the Birman, (Sacred cat of Burma), it's mythic legend is beautifully illustrated in the artworks that appear on page three and seven; ""Mandela Cat"" and ""Temple of the Sacred Cat"". I am the artist of these artworks and I am very impressed with the excellent reproductions produced by the publisher. In addition, as a Birman breeder for over 15 years I can and do highly recommend this book."
1,"Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too."
1,"We Love This Game! I bought this game to bring down to my vacation home, a new game that the kids do not have at home. Every time we go to the house, the kids want to play Gobblet first! It is just like tic-tac-toe, but you can eat up your opponent's pieces with your own larger pieces. It is a game of strategy. My 7 year old enjoys beating her 17 year old cousins in this game, before they figure out how to do it. My 5 year old can beat his cousins as well. I would recommend it."
1,"Fabulous!!! After doing alot of researching and reading reviews I purchased Kelly's Pet Parade and it is fabulous.My four year old daughter has has no problems playing it without any supervision. Ability to use the mouse is important.She can keep the different activities as simple or as elaborate as she wants to.When you want to do a new parade you have to use a different name (susie2 etc.) or erase the saved parade.The whole thing is just darling and fun to play. My daughter has to do 30 minutes of a math or alphabet game before she can play Kelly's Pet Parade. So, she likes it so much that using it as a reward has worked."
1,"Cool Music This cd is soooo cool. Especially the non-stop megamix the transitions are perfect, but you could be annoyed by the constant voice of the announcer. Some of what he says is very corny but you should be able to live with it (Especially when you're playing the actual game). All in all it's a great CD and a great buy."
1,"ESTE LIBRO CONTIENE TODO LO QUE PENSE QUE NO ME INTERESABA SABER SOBRE EL BOX Y SUS CAMPEONES...PERO ME CAUTIVO Y LO LEI HASTA EL FINAL !AHORA SI PUEDO DISCUTIR DE BOX CON MI ESPOSO Y MIS CUÃ‘ADOS...Â¡Y HASTA CON MI SUEGRO, QUE ES EX BOXEADOR !"
1,Yummmmm Oh's has been my favorite cereal as a kid and still is an essential staple of my college diet. It's absolutely f'ing delicious.
1,Fabulous! This book has been completely instrumental in guiding my husband in his timberframing pursuits. He has read it so much the cover and binding have fallen off and broken! But he holds on to it because it's the BEST reference for a DIYer to look to when starting your structure.
1,"Great Classic Sega Arcade Racing Action! If you've played this game in the arcade and liked it, then you'll definitely like this version to play at home whenever you like. You don't need a supercomputer to run it and the graphics and controls are amazing and faithful to the incredibly fun and fast arcade experience. This version also has plenty of unlockables, which you get by playing and earning miles, as well as mini-games that are a fun diversion from the classic arcade game. It has the European-themed levels of Outrun2 and the America-themed levels of Outrun2 SP, for a total of 30 stages to race through in the classic Outrun-branching style, or sequentially, or with challenges such as beating rival racers. This game is affordable, fun, and has plenty of replay value. You may not want to play it for hours and hours, but you'll keep coming back to it if you like to get a speedy arcade fix every now and then."
1,Pyrography Desings Love this book. Lots of patterns and instructions. Can't wait to start woodburning projects. Borders and patterns are just lovely!!!
1,"Excellent - as good as it gets! Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about!"
1,"Picture Quality Still Holds Up I bought this Handycam 10 years ago. I stopped using it for whatever reason. But I recently set out to convert the video I had taken with this to digital. Not only was it easy, but the quality of the picture was amazing...even playing it on my 40 inch screen. The image is so much better than my phone new camcorder."
1,"Fun selection of blocks! Great alternative to the traditional alphabet blocks I love the Peek-a-blocks sets that are out there and I was excited to see the alphabet set available. Every child should have a set of alphabet blocks and these are so much more fun than the basic wood ones. A few people have said that the letter obstructs what is inside, but I don't really agree. While they do have the letter on the one side, you get three other sides to view the inside object just fine. And isn't the point of the alphabet block the letter anyway? It is nice that it comes in a reusable case with a handle too. Just make sure and do your research before you bought. I did some digging around online and got this set for only $25!"
1,"These are great! Love These! However, do not buy these with the big block activity center, they don't work! A bit dissapointing. But the blocks are really cute and I do like them a lot!"
1,Telling it like it is! The book came within 5 days Yeah!!! It was in perfect condition. This is a great read!
1,"Pretty Nifty! I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!"
1,"Toned If you do this video regularly, you will see results. I've used it before on weight-loss plans and I have always been able to see my body change. Because of the warm up and cool down, I never got sore. And even when I was 150 pounds overweight, I could still do the video. It's my all time favorite."
1,"This must be a must-read I surft on this book out of mild curiosity. But reviews like the three posted here convince me that the book must be well worth reading. So I'm buying it. Thanks, team! (I apologize for the 5 stars, since I haven't read it yet. But the program wouldn't let me post this comment without a rating. I'll get back to y'all when I'm finisht reading the book.)"
1,"The greenest grass imaginable I bought this book for my husband. He follows it faithfully, and you can see the results in our yard. We have the most beautiful, lush grass in the neighborhood - which seems to be a miracle, since our yard was an overgrown field just two years ago. Jerry Baker provides simple ways to establish and maintain your lawn. I also appreciate the fact that we do not have to go to a gardening store to find the items recommended in his book."
1,"Best game ever This games makes even amazing games like starcraft and warcraft redundant. Warhammer has it all and does it better than anyone else. Truly great game, total fun, great combat, graphics, races, units, a pleasure to play."
1,barbie games havnt been better!!!! this is a rockin game its fun and you can even skate in the sky. i love choosing from like 30 outfits. i ordered from online(well my mom did it for me)and it took 3 weeks to get here and when it came i was sad because people said its a bad game but it wsant dont listen t anyone its soooooooo much fun!!!!!
1,"Great gadget I bought a couple of the singles and one of the triples and they all work perfectly. I'm disappointed the triple is not available and may not be. Use them in my office where the triple handles the three lamps, and in the house where three singles are with three different lamps in the bedroom, home office and basement. Makes it nice to turn all the lights on from one place (my desk in the office) or from the door so you don't have to walk into a dark room and grope for the lamp switch. Used daily for about 6 weeks and going strong. I've had others in the past and they have lasted years and years. These are nicely made and seem durable. Mounting is a good idea so you don't end up groping for the remote in the dark!"
1,"BEST BOOK EVER!! This is 1 of da bst books dat i have EVER read! @ my school, we are doing a play on this & im playin Mary-Lynette. i cant wait 2 get to the last chapters when they finally give in 2 each other! Gr8 books!"
1,THE BEST OF THE BEST BOOKS Hey every one how did you like this book. It was the best book I have ever read of the L.J Smith.
1,"The best of the ""Night World"" series I loved this book very much!It was excellent.I absoloutly fell in love with Jeremy.He was such a sweet,nice guy.I thought it was unfair that he died.The last few times I read this book I had tears streaming down my face.I really don't think he was crazy just misunderstood.This is a must read book. Once you pick it up you can't put it down."
1,The BEST book of the Night World series!!!!! This book was great and I just loved Ash. It should have 5 stars from everyone. And you have to read it. It was great. I did not like what happened to Jeremy but it was still the best book in the Night World series! It keeps you reading to the end. You will not put it down. I hope you read it for your sake. So read it!!
1,"Daughters of Darkness-THE BEST I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK"
1,"The best book in the ""Night World"" Series Daughters of Darkness is quite possibly the best book in the new NIGHT WORLD series by L. J. Smith. It does not just revolve around one supernatural being or one singular person, it has interesting information on the werewolves of the NIGHT WORLD and the plot line is out of sight. I own all of the books in the series (Up untill Soulmate that is) and so far Daughters of Darkness is the best one. I only hope the following books in this wonderful series are as great as this one!!"
1,"It is the best book in the series. This book was the best out of the whole series. The book was pretty much about Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel, three girl vampires that just had enough of the Night World. Mary-Lynnette is a small town girl who loves to look at the stars, but has nobody to look at the stars with her. Ash is a tall, lanky, and elegant vampire that has to find his sisters and bing them back home. But of course his sisters had told Mary-Lynnette and her brother, Mark, bout the Night World. Another twist in the story is that Ash and Mary-Lynnette are soulmates. If this story couldn't get anymore exciting there is a vampire killer running around town. All six of them has to figure out who this vampire killer is and stop him. Meanwhile Ash and Mary-Lynnette has to figure out what to do about each other. If you like or are obsess with vampires (Like me!)you should read this book."
1,"If you're into vampire and romance you should read this book You might have read a lot of vampire-romance novels but this one certainly rates a 10. The story itself has a good plot and amazing characters to suit their purposes. The three sisters, Rowan, Kestrel and Jade, uncannily beatiful, are actually fugitives from Night World and their brother Ash is sent to take them home. Both male and female lead role are superb. Their roles fit them perfectly. Ash, a vampire whose whole life changed after finding his soulmate is a human and Mary-Lynette a girl with a strong character who wasn't really willing to accept the fact that Ash is her soulmate. And of course...the way the authour tells her story and the words she uses..it's absolutely incredible."
1,"READ IT READ IT READ IT! This book is incredible. It had me hooked from the very beginning. Why does everyone always say that they're in love with Ash? He's a great character, but not perfect in any way. Okay, ehough chit-chat. Read this book, I am serious. Rowan (my favorite!), Kestral, Jade, and Mary-Lynnette are just about the strongest female characters I have read in some time. I can find no flaw in any part of this book, and if you haven't already, READ IT!"
1,"the best! This book is my favorite one. I've read it eight times. All of L.J. Smith's books are fantastic; she's my absolute favorite writer. Her writing style is very natural and realistic and her characters are so real, you start looking for them in real life. I fell in love with Ash, especially in how, even though he's a fierce vampire, he's completely helpless when it comes to Mary Lynette. Smith writes the most wonderful characters. I never liked fantasy or romance novels, but her books are a notable exception. My friends think I'm crazy because I'm in college and I'm still reading YA books, but, I'm telling you, her books are ageless!!! If you haven't read this, you're definitely missing out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Vampires and Witches, oh yes! I have been a fan of L.J. Smith ever since book one of _The Vampire Diaries_. With each of her books you can honestly BELIEVE that what she is writing about is the truth, even if the characters are ficticious. Dughters of Darkness (as well as any Night World book or the Vampire Diaries trilogy) should be required reading for anyone who believes in Vampires (or thinks they are one *grin*). Happy reading"
1,great Bought it for my 2.5 year old niece and she loved it. Dinner got easier with this disc.I think it should work fine for just any kid that age.
1,"3 at night I take 3 at night be for I got to bed, it helps me rest better!! TRY IT!! AND THE PRICE IS OK"
1,APC P1T 120V Portable Surge Protector Perfect carry-along for my notebook PC. Useful grounded and protected indicators. Small investment for critical protection. I have used APC products for quite a number of years and have found them reliable.APC P1T 120V Portable Surge Protector
1,Insurance policy! This protector is an excellent value. Rated very highly in consumer publications. Great price from Amazon. I bought this to protect my new 55 inch LG flat screen.
1,"Great Pants These are great pants. They are really comfortable and easy to care for. I'm saving money too because I don't have to take these to the dry cleaners. I love the ""Individual Fit"" waste band. Who wouldn't like pants that fit a larger waste size without making you admit the weight gain by buying the larger size."
1,"Satisfied Product arrive well ahead of schedule, met expectations, and price was better than local retail."
1,Favorite Characters and Lots of FUN This is a great leap pad book. My 4 yr old son loved it instantly. The familiar characters from the Bob the Builder show make this book lots more fun than the ones featuring the Frog. I especially liked the fact that this book helps to teach that teasing is not a nice thing to do. There are at least 2 games on every page and it has the music from the show also. It is definitely worth the price and I hope they make more Bob the Builder books for the Leap Pad.
1,"helpful for decision makers This is an extraordinary compilation of texts of environment and economics that constitutes a very helpful book to decision makers. I work for environment and always check this book to take the best decision, because its contents are wide enough for diferent topics of environmental problems."
1,Delicious! I loved this book! Dating a chef now who is as passionate about his food and life as Bruno makes this book a complete treat. I was hungry with every page. The descriptions of the food and emotions are insipring and delicious.So worth the read! Have to go eat now!
1,"Why arent there more like this one!!?? why dont more rappers do what cash money does? no matter whos album it is, they showcase the best mcs and production they can pull off. there is nothing wrong with other rappers but cash money does this well, while setting asside tracks for the individuals, the group is what really shines, without the bling bling. i promised myself to never to buy the bling bling bull, but after hearing this cd, i had to get it. especially songs like i need a hot girl, and we on fire. get this cd!!!"
1,"The hot boys always will keep it real ""they on fire!!!!"" you need to listen to me and buy the hottest cd by the hot boys cause if you like rap like me and you just wanna keep it real leave it up to the hot boys all of cash money they are just off the hook Adam"
1,"IT'S HOT LIKE DA HOT BOYZ. THIS ALBUM HAS SOME OF THE TIGHTEST TRACKS I'VE HEARD IN A MINUTE. MY FAVORITE SONG IS I NEED A HOT GIRL. SICK UNCLE IS A VERY FUNNY SKIT. THE HOT BOYZ ALBUM COMES IN WITH A BOMB INTRO AND GOES OUT WITH A BANGING TRACK. I LOVE DA HOT BOYZ, ESPECAILY LIL' WAYNE, AND THEIR NEW CD."
1,"Another Cash Money Classic This album is just more proof that Cash Money is one of the best record labels out there. It has the same kind of beats as the Juvenile and B.G. LP's. The Hot Boys combines those 2 artists with 2 newer talented artists, Lil Wayne and Turk. If Cash money keeps making albums like this, they will be as famous as No Limit, an 10 times better soon."
1,A Classic CD: A must get This a classic cd. The best cash money cd ever. Every song is off tha hook. Don't nobody want to see the HOT BOY$. All I have to say is can't wait till LET EM' BURN.
1,"GET THIS ALBUM!! The Hot Boys tore it up on this one. They had hot tracks wit b.g., juvenile, lil wayne and others from cash money. Cash Money is gonna take over the music business baby!!!!!!!!"
1,"It Works!! I have been struggling to have my children be more obedient and to stop arguing with and each other. They were unhappy, my husband was unhappy, and I was unhappy. This book gave us not only some general strategies but also some suggestions on what to say in various situations. We are making great progress and the children are using it at school. We are becoming a more happy family!!"
1,"Book review This is a book for all parents or parents to be, all people thinking of having children. Love and Logic is a program to help you be a more effect parent, raising responsible children. It can also be used on co workers and the rest."
1,"WeiB FOREVER! This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop, but at night they are the White Hunters (or Byce as in the anime) they are assasins that ""hunt the tomorrow"" of Bad guys, the bad guys the police cant get . Like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason... from a strange gas substance that w/ instant contact ingulfs any object... but i couldnt resist. Its also an emotional anime at times! I think this is a Cd and Anime any anime fan should see..."
1,"The Title Says it all I should just leave it at that, but I won't. When I got this book I was completly blind to the world of HTML, but now I have mastered it. This book starts off teaching the basics, like how to start your HTML document with the HEAD and BODY tags, and goes all the way into using HTML tables to design your website and using HTML forms. By the end of the book, I knew everything, and was able to move onto more advanced subjects such as PHP or CGI-scripting. This book is the perfect way to get started if you're interested in pursuing a career in web development or application programming. However, if you are not interested in learning HTML, this book is not for you. It is a complete reference and you need to read the entire book to take advantage of it. If you really want to learn HTML then buy this book, because it will be the first and the last you will ever need."
1,"Most complete book about HTML i've ever seen. This is just the best HTML book I've got my hands on. Just about everything about HTML techniques you could think about is covered in this book. StyleSheets, DHTML, forms, frames .. it's all covered. a MUST have for the HTML-creator The 99 edition is even better than the 98 edition, because the overviews are now sorted by browser, instead of alphabethically."
1,"Could Not Put the Book Down For such a fat book, I never dreamed I would read it from cover to cover. Everything you ever wanted to know about HTML is in this book. I am a beginner and this book has given me a great start."
1,"Simply awesome This book is just spectacular!I have been a web developer for several years now, and I have read many books about HTML and related subjects. This book covers it all. But not only does the author cover HTML extensively, but he also covers XML, XHTML, CSS (extensively), CSS2, JavaScript, CGI, SSI, ASP, Coldfusion, and fonts.Many examples are given in both code and URL, discussion, and the thoroughness of the author's coverage, makes this a first-rate book, in my opinion.Most remarkably, the author discusses this subject matter very simply and in a way that anyone can understand (probably). I've honestly never read a technical book as lucid as this one. I highly recommend it!If that was not enough, the book contains about 500 pages of appendices, covering extensively every topic related to web development that one might need. I'm not saying you won't need any other books to make fabulous web pages, but this book is amazingly comprehensive. The author's web site is nice too."
1,"A very useful tool Very good product. Got my as a gift a few years ago, and it works fine. While mine has mercury thermometers, it shouldn't make a difference from red spirit filled one. I keep it in the shop drawer, dig it out when I wonder abt the temp here in NW Fla, dampen the wick, give it a twirl for a couple of minutes, then read it. I spray a lot of lacquer, shellac, and varnish, and usually have to crank up the dehumidifier in the shop, especially in the summer months. All in all, Bacharach makes a very good and reliable tool."
1,"One of the best classical music CD I have the original soundtrack for FF6 But I still love this CD. Well, since it's not OST so don't expect to hear the original music you heard while playing game. All pieces are played by symphony orchestra and, as a classical music lover myself, I enjoy this CD as much as Vivaldi's Four Season!! Every song was well rearranged and perfectly presented in symphonic style...Warning!! if you're only gamers and don't think any classical music is worth listening, don't buy this CD.. But if you're classical music lovers as well, buy it..!! Whether or not you've ever played the game, the beauty of the music will make you not to regret every penny you spend..!!"
1,Perfect glider It was easy to put together and works nice. Love sitting in it with my grandson and enjoying our time.
1,"Even a Blonde...... Speaking as a blonde I can say that this is EASY to put together.Some of the very best instructions I have seen anywhere. Great Buy and a beautiful product. It holds up to 550 pounds, so it will even hold most Americans!"
1,"We love Mercer Mayer! My kids love the little critter books, and this is no exception. Great for my 3 year old, and even my 7 year old isnt bored too much by it. He enjoys reading it to his little brother at bedtime."
1,The Scarletti curse This is a one to keep. Wonderfull story and plot. Full of dialogue between main characters with a sizzling romance. The plot keeps you turning the pages wanting more. Once again an excellent author.
1,"the scarletti curse this book was great.Like all of christine feehan's books,it holds your interest at every turn until the bitter end. you did not know who the perpetrator was until the bitter end.it held you on the edge of your seat to see if nicoletta was going to be seriously hurt or killed as were the scarletti brides."
1,WOW! My favorite of all time....Giovanni intrigued me soo much...i felt his love for nicoletta soo much i envied her..well written. GOOD WORK CHRISTINE
1,Great Cam! I love it! it is a great quality camera and does alot of stuff. It even hooks up to my computer and lets me do alot of stuff. I can edit videos or copy them off and even stream video like a web cam its great! Works well with WinXP. I bought from Amazon and they got it to me quickly even with the super saver shipping and the lowest price I could find with a free bag who can ask for more!
1,"Great primer on Bar Coding This is a great book for anybody who wants to understand what bar codes are, how they work, how to prepare a cost/benefit analysis and how to implement bar codes. Even if it is called Using Bar Codes in Distribution, it is as relevant for other applications.There are a some redundancies in this book that would need to be fixed in a reeddition. Also it would be nice if a reedition was done since it dates from 2000 and technology has evolved so much. But still, even without these improvements it is a great book."
1,Cruel & Unusual Received the book promptly and in great condition. Thank you Amazon for the opportunity to buy used books.
1,"Cruel & Unusual, was fabulous! Cruel and Unusual was another wonderful story by Ms. Cornwell. It was graphic in its detail but I stayed rivited to the end. I read everything she writes. None of it is boring and her knowledge of investigative procedures adds to the thrills of her stories."
1,"LOVED IT!!! I love reading all of her books I have read a few in the past, now I am going back and starting from the beginning and reading in order."
1,"Ronnie Joe Waddell meets the electric chair ... or does he? If you enjoy medical thrillers, you will enjoy this book. It is evident that Cornwell does her research on her subject & you gain useful information as you read."
1,"Cruel and Unusual Cruel and UInusalPatricia is an excellent writter and I love her books, but she sometimes leaves you a bit flat at the ending of the book"
1,Very nice book I really liked this book. It is a page turner for sure. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point.I think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel.
1,"Apatow's Depth Triumphs I am a stand-up fanatic. I enjoy the alternative comedians and the culture that have been cultivating in NY and LA lately. I consume the content of stand-ups like C.K., Cross, Tompkins, Glass, Jeselnik, Ansari, Posehn, Miller, and Holmes-to name a few. If you lean that way in your comedy preferences then my review will likely be applicable to you.I love this movie. You must go into it not knowing what to expect i.e. don't assume you know the movie will have the same feeling as knocked up. The characters are hilarious in their struggles and their actors are superb. Great director, great cast, and a hell of an perspective on alternative comedy.Lastly, buy the collector's edition. The bonus features are endless! If the film brings you down and you consequently reflect negatively on yourself, worry not, the second disc will right you. Just read the disc content and you'll be sold. Enough said."
1,"Lovely! This is just a wonderful graphic novel with beautiful illustrations, an interesting story set in a different culture. I had not been a fan of graphic novels, but this was one of those that have convinced me that they can, like opera, enhance the experience by using a fusion of art forms. I highly recommend it."
1,"A Masterpiece! Meet the first reconstructionist cat and rabbi from Algeria Safr's beautifully illustrated tale of a traditional rabbi who loses his faith in the face of colonial assimilation and a secular cat who tells the tale is on the level of Will Eisner's Contract With God and Art Speigelman's Maus. American readers will certainly connect to the tale as an Algerian parallel to the intellectual journey of Mordecai Kaplan, the American Jewish thinker whose Judaism as a Civilization was penned at the same time of the setting of this fictional fable. Safr raises the ultimate post-Enlightenment question: What is the role of religion in the absence of a supernatual God who acts in history? He is the first writer, I believe, to have a street-smart house cat answer this question. Rabbi Daniel S. Brenner, Director, Center for Multifaith Education, Auburn Theological Seminary, NYC."
1,"Fascinating yet tragic This was such and interesting book to read. It's about the one person who was the closest witness to the assassination of President Kennedy and how she was persecuted and finally redeemed. Namely Jean Hill. Her story needed to be told. It can't be ignored. She was filmed for Oliver Stone's movie titled JFK. She was cut from the theater production, but it is in the director's cut, which is the one you should see. It chronicles what lengths people will go to silence a dissenting witness. If you have ever seen the Zapruder film of the assassination, then you have seen Jean Hill. She was the woman standing on the curb in a red dress at the ""moment""."

1,"Great book. Not as spell binding as others in this series but still very good. It took getting to the last couple of chapters to understand the title, but that was minor. I also found a alot of typos in this book. usually just minor ones but a name was completely wrong, but correct in the very next sentence. I had to stop for a second and think....who is that? ok...off to Amazon.com to find the next one."
1,scarpetta this book is amazing. it was an all around exciting book. scarpetta definetly meets my expectations. it was a roller coster of emotions. i couldnt put the book down. i will re-read this book numerous times.
1,One of the best mysteries I've read in a while It was magnificent. I picked it up at a Border's bookstore for 3 dollars just to see how it was. ever since I've read it I've been stuck on her books. It was great a little gory at parts but it had a wonderful storyline and plot. I would highly recommend this to anyone that loves mysteries.
1,"Scarpetta rocks! I love the Kay Scarpetta series, that's how I got hooked on the whole forensics stuff! Patricia Cornwell is an excellent author!"
1,Hoping for more! Adermatt grabbed my attention from the very beginning and kept it to the end. She tells an extremely poignant and relevant story such that I felt I was watching every minute of it in real life. I hope this is the beginning of a series!
1,"a brilliant, well-written economics primer Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the ""common good."" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand."
1,"Never more needed than today Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and ""higher education"" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here's a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute."
1,"Economics even you will Understand For all who avoided economics like the plague, this is the book for you.very informative, and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject... Check it out.. next time you argue economics with uncle Fred, you wont sound like such a dope"
1,"Our Senators and Reps should read and heed This is not a new book;perhaps that's why it is so useful.There is no gobblygook, no arcane economic theories with fancy lables.What there are in this book are many examples of - - if the government takes this action to make this or that happen, the unintended consequences have proven to be and will probably be again something quite different, and usually not positive.Sound experiential economics in my view, clearly written; and a tremendous help to understanding what will probably happen if the nation takes on more debt, subsidizes this or that interest, taxes one interest at the expense of another, etc.I liked it; I could read and understand it."
1,"A common sense approach to Economics Economics in One Lesson is essentially an introduction into the Austrian school of Economic thought. Hazlitt's now renowned treatise originally written in 1946 is lauded by Libertarian stalwarts Ron Paul, Peter Schiff and Lew Rockwell among others. While some of the examples provided in the text may be dated the book is as relevant today as it was when first written. Hazlitt, from a 1940's perspective, takes on many of today's most controversial issues such as government spending, taxes, minimum wage, balance of trade, unions and inflation. In an era of big government, many of Hazlitt's economic lessons come as a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend Economics in One Lesson for those interested in learning about the Austrian School of economics and basic free market priciples."
1,"Changed my life I know it sounds stupid. I know it sounds extreme. I know it sounds ridiculous.But this book REALLY DID change my life.I used to be a bleeding-heart liberal: ""the government has to do X, Y and Z"".This book showed me how wrong I was. How so VERY wrong I was.This book should be mandated reading in all schools."
1,"Criticizing what you don't understand I have to laugh at the negative reviews of this book. They are probably written by socialists who don't understand economics, otherwise they wouldn't be socialists. Hazlitt's arguments are based on (1) a real understanding of economics and (2) facts, including that socialism has been an abject failure where ever it has been tried. In contrast, the arguments of modern liberals are based on emotions and are devoid of facts and of thinking about the world as it is.I can tell you that this is one of the very best books that has ever been written on economics."
1,"Worth the brain power This may be the only hardcore economics book I've really ever read. I don't follow through on many books period, but I pushed on through this one. The effort was valuable and worth it. From what I understand, it's held as one of the classics and rightly so. Just take it in chunks as you have time, but do yourself a favor and glean some knowledge from this one."
1,"Lives up to the hype Amazingly prophetic book. Could have been written yesterday. So far, a very educational read. I can see why so many people are recommending this book."
1,"Understanding the philosophy of economics These concepts are important for everyone to familiarize themselves with. I teach economics and it has been incredibly helpful to use these illustrations with my students. Such simple and easy to read chapters. Read one a day and really think about each one. Before you know it the financial reports and the governments budgeting process will come clearly into view. You will begin thinking in the micro and the macro with ease. If it makes sense in your home, it will most likely make sense on the national level.I highly recommend this easy to read little book. Learn these concepts and see what new world will open up for you in so many areas."
1,"A very accessible mathematical classic An excellent and lucid exposition of what we really mean when we talk about 2 houses, or 1/2 an hour, or square root of 2 meters, or that the counting numbers are infinite. It does not require any prior mathematical knowledge beyond the basics, although it probably will be of interest only to those that care about math at its most abstract. It is fascinating to realize how much we take for granted when we do math and how much ingenuity it takes to pin down the concept of number. Highly recommended."
1,"A delicious presentation indeed, packed with history and appeal Chocolate makers and company evolution are the focus of a tasty selection of historical notes in Beth Kimmerle's Chocolate: The Sweet History - but the focus doesn't end with company profiles alone. Historical details trace chocolate's Aztec origins, cocoa plant myths and usage, timelines of chocolate trade development, and more, adding depth and insights which include notes on different varieties of chocolate. Add luscious historical photos and ads in full color and you have a delicious presentation indeed, packed with history and appeal."
1,Great Camera I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. Nice going Sony!
1,"Virtually perfect folding table I've received and tried these great tables. I'm sorry I only ordered four. Even though I'm small, I can manage these tables - all 4 by myself! They fit in the back of my SUV and in my camper. My bruiser children have already started using them as a jungle gym/stairmaster -- they are incredibly stable and sturdy. My only concern is the legs don't lock in the folded(collapsed) position. If you hold them vertical it's not a problem, but when rotated, one leg drops - I'm using a canopy bungee to secure the two legs together for transport.Lori"
1,"Super handy on trips we didn't even use the magnetic feature but glad it had that option. Compact, easy to take (about size of Ipad but thicker). Would recommend for the avid backgammon enthusiasts like us who cannot bear to go too long without playing!"
1,very good product good quailty i liked this product so much i am going to buy one for my mom and another one in black for me
1,"Shapewear This is very well made, it came on time and does exactly what it is made to do, I give it 5 stars."
1,"Read Look a couple inches over ur belly button. Do you have a 'slouch line'? If no, then this is for u. Nice expensive material feel. Does wat it was made to do. It just didn't work out for me cuz I slouch all the time and it hurts where my belly fat curls. It's for those straight sitting people"
1,"GREAT THERAPEUTICALLY AS WELL AS GREAT FOR FASHION!!! I had two reasons for the purchase of this product, one was for my spine difficulties thanks to a severe injury many years ago & the other was pure vanity! But it has surpassed my expectations for both reasons! It is ever so comfortable and makes me look great so I feel beautiful!!! I just cannot express in words how great this product is!!!"
1,Love it! Help with posture and gives a mommy tummy a nice squeeze. It feels great on my ribs and seems to be bringing them back to pre-baby size. I highly recommend this!
1,"Awesome! I wear this religiously! It's extremely comfortable, I even sleep it in. I wear it as often as I can - only taking it off when I need to. So far so good. The only problem was it smelled like rubber at first since it was so new. I washed it (HAND WASHED, never put things like these in the washing machine/dryer as the item can warp!) and the rubber smell went away. I've only been wearing this for about a week so when it's been a month or so I will post an update. I wear this in conjunction with dieting and light exercise. When I started all of this my waist was 28 1/2 inches. Now it's down to 26 1/2"". I just hope I can actually keep the inches off. My goal is 24"" but even that may be too much."
1,in love I absolutely love the squeem!!!! Although it does take a couple days to get use to it....... I wear it all day at work and I already see and feel a difference I absolutely live the squeem!!!!
1,Wow I ordered my Squeem and it came earlier than promised. Mine didn't fit but it was my error and not the company's. I filed for a return and the company replied promptly with instructions to send back and offered to send me a different size. The company is very polite and courteous. It's one of the better companies selling on Amazon. The product itself from what I was able to do with it was very sturdy. The hook and eye enclosures were easy to use and the Squeem molded to my body shape. It was ridged but had give to allow for movement. The outside that goes away from your body is rubber but what actually touches you is a cotton material. It does smell a little like rubber if you put your nose to it but it's not strong enough to smell if you're wearing it. I can't wait to get my new sized one and try it out.
1,"good postpartum compression bought this over the other post-baby belly wraps marketed to pregnant women...and glad i did. the belly wraps are stiff and very visible under clothing, where the squeem is a good ol girdle and forms the mid section into a pretty shape while holding in the jelly belly left over after delivery. you have to wear the waist cincher for 40days/40nights for it to work on getting the belly to shrink; i'm on 2.5 weeks and have already gone from looking 6m prego to less than 3m prego when not wearing it. it also helps with initiating a healthy diet and losing weight b/c it makes you want to look better. but it is not comfortable to wear to sleep; makes me really hot. i have a cheaper wrap from babies r us that is more forgiving, but keeps up with the belly compression."
1,squeem is awesome!!! I love my squeem! A little tight at first but I got used to it. I lost 2 inches off my waist in 3 weeks. I love my squeem!!
1,"Love, love, love this product! I bought this with the hope I would look slimmer. It did that, and more! I bought a large, and after a week of wear, I am purchasing a medium. I have gotten complements on how much weight I have lost, and I have actually lost weight too. It gives me a shapely figure. I could not be more pleased."
1,"BEST waist cincher I'm extremely impressed with this waist cincher. I had a bridesmaid dress that I had to fit into that was about 2.5 inches too small...I was just about ready to pay over $50 for alterations which would have made the dress different than the other bridesmaids....and then this came in the mail! What a lifesaver! I contacted the tailor quickly and tried on the dress again using the squeem and it fit perfectly. I probably won't use this long term, and I can't imagine using it over diet and exercise for weight loss, but in a pinch, it works great."
1,Awesome! This CD is amazing. I am very sad that 107.7 The X in Birmingham is no longer. They made a great CD to benefit a great cause.
1,"Clever design Marie Antoinette is my daughter's favorite female historical figure. She was very smart, but not when it came to spending. She was a child bride from Austria who, as custom dictated, had to leave all her possessions at the border- including her beloved little doggie."
1,Wonderful! This book was just what I was looking for! HIGHLY informative information on each herb along with lore and magickal uses. It also explains deity correspondences and points out what sabbat you might use each herb for. I recommend this to anyone interested in magickal or medicinal uses of herbs.The product came early and the book was in excellent condition!
1,"A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe A refreshing, sunwarmed, beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of Ice Age Europe. A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. The plot line moves in different ways from other ""Woman against the odds"" novels so it is a fresh and not predictable. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel's ""Shelters of Stone""."
1,"Great Transaction! I placed an order for a book, the seller accepted payment quickly, the item shipped very fast, in fact I had item in hand in less than a week and it was exactly as described. Thank you for a pleasant transaction."
1,"An American Classic I first read The Scarlet Letter (TSL) back in high school. I thoroughly enjoyed the book then. Going back and rereading a second time still brought back the awe associated with the imagery painted by Hawthrowne. Perhaps the most striking image is that in the beginning, where Hester Prynne is about to come out of her jail cell and a single rose blossoming amidst the bleakness of her prison is used as a metaphor. Hawthrowne does a superb job describing the details and ways of life. I believe he captures 17th century Bostonian life accurately. In a way this book is a history book. I do admit that the plot is slow at times, but the book does appear to move much more quickly if you try to admire Hawthrownes writing style and descriptive language. Overall, I would say this book impressed me as much as War and Peace and some of Dickens' novels did."
1,i love books The description was exactly as written. Fast shipping and great costumer service. I would recommend the product and the seller.
1,Sad Story I love it but it saddened me. . . I will read it again . . . but will wait a while. Life can appear to be unfair sometimes. . .
1,"Excellent It is Hawthorne, of course it is excellent. Well written and worth a slow, methodical approach. Definitely a literary classic."
1,"Classic Book that I can read on my iPad Great book and it is nice to be able to read it on my iPad. Also, loved the price (FREE!) :)"
1,"The Best Of Puritans This is a very interesting book. I started reading it in my 4th period English class. I think it is a good book because somehow it relates to what people do, when they feel superior to other people. I think you should read this book, because it is very interesting. Plus, it was written by the great Nathaniel Hawhthorne!"
1,"I don't remember buying this. I did read the book in hs, so maybe that is when I bought it, but who knows. I just have to write words so that I can be done with reviewing this."
1,"The Scarlet Letter It is a very well written book. A little slow to get into, but once there it moved very well and was a pleasure to read."
1,No wonder itâ€˜s a classic. A great read that could easily be translated into modern situations. The way Hawthorne explains thing and his use of sybolism adds so much more to the story.
1,"Detailed, Beautiful, Tragic, & Engaging Hawthhone's ""The Scarlet Letter"" is literature at it's finest. The attention to detail for both settings, and especially the thoughs of the characters will chain you to this book. Sin, regret, guilt, self-punishment, and revenge are all detailed in relation to an extramarital affair resulting in a pregnancy. The symbolism is beautiful, the plot tragic, the characters engaging. The ""Scarlet Letter"" is a true masterpiece."
1,great thing I had to read this for school and since it was on my kindle I could just search a word to find the quote I needed. great book! Hawthorn's syntax is just so lengthy!!
1,"Best Tale of Scandal and Deceptjon I was required to read this book for English class, and it's my favorite book we've read all year :) full of juicy drama, scandal, and humor, the book is more like an entertaining Spanish soap than a boring classic novel some find it to be. If you look at the boon with the right eyes, you can enjoy it :))"
1,"Be true ""The Scarlet Letter"", by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a book about how keeping secrets can ruin a person. A very realistic view of how a society can treat others. Even though many of the towns people were no more innocent than Hester in many ways, they looked on her as one of the worse sinners in town, unable to be touched by the rest of society."
1,"Don't let your highschool teachers force feed you classics The Scarlet Letter is a very good book. It would be much better though if we were alowed to read it on our own and draw our own conclusions. How well can you appreciate a book if you have to hurry because you must read 40 pages in one night while making sure to remember details that may be on the test. Read it in highschool or not, it doesn't matter. But make sure to pick it up later in your life when you are ready for it, and you can draw your own conclusions instead of regurgitating what the teacher told you so you can pass a test."
1,"Scarlet Letter While I had a copy of the Scarlet Letter in my personal library, my son's teacher required the Dover edition. I was very pleased with the vendor's delivery, arriving before the due date. My son expressed ease with which he was able to read, especially when the class used the same edition as a text. Thank you!"
1,"Quite The Story ..... Where does one begin ? how does one begin ? This novel of Hawthorne is an excellent one .. a classic...a novel to be cherished . The lessons to be learnt about sin ,giult ,denial and eventual deliverance of truth ,redemption and socialization can all be internalized into real life . Yes , Hawthorne was not a perfect Writer but he portrays the language skillfully and beautifully . I must stress that to reaal understand this book, you shouldn't be cranking up the volume on your stereo and drinking caffeine drinks ....if you do . you'll fell the book is "" the worst book you could ever read """
1,"School Reading I had to read this book for the first time in high school and even then I fell in love with the story. Yes the onld english can bog you down a bit, but it is so worth it. it has a great story line. It's what can be considered old school scandalous!"
1,"The Scarlet Letter This book typifies the old English, colonialists, trying to impose their disgusting lawsThis is a must read book, for those who consider these authors worthy. The English have always been accomplished writers"
1,A Masterpiece for all times Gets better with every reading! Required reading in high school aeons ago - so it seemed terribly tedious. Am now entranced with every word.
1,An On line Read This went back to an old standard. It was a good read and easy to view on the reader. I enjoyed it as it was what I expected.
1,"Great book I love this book. It's a great classic, and I love Hawthorne's style. Very well written, and a good representation of the time."
1,"Better than the first in every way! In every way, 'Return of the Killer Tomatoes' is a far better film then the classic original. The characters, ranging from John Astin as the evil mad scientist, his clean cut news anchor servant Igor, and George Clooney in his first film role, are hilarious. The plot is more involved and understandable, and the jokes fly fast and furious. One thing potential buyers should be aware of is that this film, like the original, is presented in the fullscreen format common with straight-to-video productions, which this almost certainly was. A great film, a better sequel, and well worth the few dollars it costs."
1,great i think it is a great comidy just anther adam sandler if you dont like him then this prob isnt a great movie for you but i would still try it
1,how it works Love it. Works great. Have watched several times on at least three different players. Would like to have more movies of Adam Sandle.
1,"BEST HOLIDAY FILM IN YEARS!!!!!!!!!!! 8 Crazy Nights is one of the greatest holiday films I have ever seen in my life. It ranks up there as one of the greatest holiday films with Jingle All The Way, Christmas Vacation, and Home Alone. The jokes are HILARIOUS and the plot is so beautiful. I cried from laughing sooooo much and cried from the wonderful storyline. This movie is pure genius."
1,"Finally! Oh, my goodness. To all of you reading out there, I have been waiting for this movie's release date for almost a whole year. Ever since the film came out in theaters, I checked amazon.com every day to find out when it would be released and now, I know. Also, this DVD comes out on my birthday. That is cool. Anyway, all my friends who saw this movie and all the reviews I read said that this movie was terrible. I say forget those reviews because this movie is simply amazing. If you like Adam Sandler, then this movie is for you. If you don't like Adam Sandler this movie is still for you. This is by far his best movie ever (Happy Gilmore is his second best). This is a must buy for any Sandler fan. It is warm and witty and has the voice talents of so many people from Adam Sandler's SNL days. Classic movie. You can count on me being there at the store before school buying this. Can't wait!"
1,"Spinout Back in '66 when I was 16 I saw this film numerous times. Loved it!! Still enjoy it today. Funny. Great supporting cast. Pretty girls. Enjoyable soundtrack. Hilarious racing finale. What's not to like?To the reviewer(s) who consider this Elvis' worst film, I ask: Have you seen Harum Scarum? Now that one IS bad!!"
1,Great desk for the young scholar We bought this for our tall seven-year old and it is an excellent fit. It was not difficult to assemble and it is very sturdy and the finish is solid - it won't peel off with an accidental piece of tape or scratch. We have a similar set that is in espresso and love it. The kids spill stuff on it and stick things to it and it is still in good condition. This is a big sturdy desk and we highly recommend it.
1,"Mark of Love I would have to say that I love this movie for several reasons. First, it is a very cute story with some adorable characters. Second, my niece starred in it and produced it, and last but not least, my son has two songs in it!!!"
1,"""Brain Based Learning"" is a masterpiece ""Brain Based Learning"" suggests a new style of teaching that activates student brains and makes them an active participant in the learning process. Author Eric Jensen is absolutely brilliant with his delivery of this material. His writing style is engaging, profound and insightful. I'm so impressed with the way to weaves together a variety of sources to present his idea for personal transformation. Never before have I read a book that combines material on stress reduction, fight-or-flight, activating both hemispheres of the brain, and flow states-- and applied it to education.Seriously, this book is a masterpiece! You don't have to be a teacher to gleam something from ""Brain Based Learning"" -- it is also insightful for entrepeniurs, marketers and writers. If you listen to brain synch cds, use light and sound machines, or do any sort of AVE (audio visual entrainment), reading this book will rock your world. I highly recommend this book!"
1,"It's the Oscar buff's Bible. It's not really meant to be read from beginning to end, though you certainly can. It's a handy reference that will draw you in. You may begin by looking up the last year Bob Hope hosted, but an hour later you'll realize you're in the Billy Crystal era. Lots of fun -- dishy but accurate. Pick it up, turn to any chapter, and enjoy."
1,"I got lucky! I was able to buy this textbook for only ten dollars including shipping! My classmates were skeptical of such a low price and assured me the book would be in terrible condition. But they were wrong! There is not one note, highlight, or writing on the margins. The book looks practically new."
1,"AWESOME The book I received was in excellent condition and arrived fast. Unfortunately, my professor did not require the text only an on line Virtual Child. I returned the book and was given a prompt refund. Thank you so much for your great customer service."
1,Awesome CD and great value! Couldn't ask for a better transaction. Shipped super fast and item was as described!
1,"The Best Heart Album Ever This is the best Heart album ever made in my opinion. I grew up listening to Heart and I still listen to them. I saw Ann and Nancy in concert last year they were awsome as usual. My favorite song is ""These Dreams"". Another good song is ""What About Love"". Heart has had numerous #1 hits and it's amazing people still love to listen to them."
1,"Heavy synth, hairspray and Heart One of my favorite things from the 1980's was the synth-heavy pop-rock of Heart. Wow, how I love this album. Chock full of that classic 80's lite rock sound, with fantastic Ann and Nancy Wilson vocals. All around great stuff."
1,"A Touchstone 80's Album There really isn't any reason I can rationalize it, but this is a landmark 80's album in the same mode the recording ""Boston"" is to 70's albums. It just sounds huge, a Phil Spectorish ""wall of sound"": Great melody combined with some grit tacked on to saccharine sweet hooks. This massive aural assault has bunches of decent, though big-time AOR, songs that help it, for the most part, hold up way past it's prime. Sure it sounds dated, but infectious, so if the mood is right, it still works. Unlike Boston's ""Boston"" (undeniably their best), it certainly isn't the best thing the Wilson sisters have ever done, however it stands on it's own as a unique sonic place in time which remains highly listenable. A guilty pleasure."
1,"Good Memories If one word could describe ""the 80's"" it would have to be HEART. this cd brings back memories of when I was growing up and I would hear songs like ""These Dreams"" on the radio. Today when I that song it I con't get enough of it, I will never forget this song. If you love 80's music then I highly reccomend that you get this cd"
1,Finished it in one sitting! Keep them coming! Bantum is an appealing hero and his adventures are exciting and entertaining as he fights for his freedom and his maiden. The middle ages come alive before your eyes.
1,"this is the one! This is the Groove Holmes disc to get! The entire disc is loaded with great music; ""I Love Your Smile"" alone is worth the price, but there's much more. Get this; you'll be glad you did."
1,"A great family Christmas movie Christmas may be a time for joy and laughter, but Charlie Brown has the Blues. To get in the holiday spirit, he takes Lucy's advice and directs a Christmas play. And what's a Christmas play w/o a tree? Everyone makes fun of the short sparse ""nevergreen tree"" that he comes up with, until Christmas works it's true magic.This is a classic family holiday film. It has all the characters that we have known and loved our whole lives. This DVD also contains the ""It's Christmastime Again Charlie Brown"" story. It has English, Spanish, Japanese and Portuguese audio tracks. This is a great way to enjoy Christmas with the whole family or with friends."
1,"The best Christmas movie, ever. When I was a freshman in college, I stopped typing my term paper (due the next day) so I could watch it on TV. The next year my roommate gave me the video for my birthday so I could watch it whenever I want. There are only three things that I need for the Christmas season: A Charlie Brown Christmas, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and the Muppets album with John Denver. And then, even though I am a college student and have to spend most of December studying for finals 600 miles from home, somehow everything seems right again."
1,"Very Good Transfer to DVD Commenting on what a wonderful Christmas special this is would be superfluous: I would only be echoing the comments of all the reviews of the VHS edition. As for the DVD edition, it's a good transfer, clean, no artifacts, good sound. Skip the second feature, ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown."" It just doesn't compare. My only gripe about the DVD: they fixed the one moment in the original master that captured my attention and my heart. Every year, I watched for the moment when the Peanuts gang gathered around the newly decorated little tree and began singing ""Loo loo loo, loo loo loo loo loo"" to the tune of ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing."" As the camera pulls in on the left side of the group and pans right, Pig Pen's head disappears for one frame when they all take a breath. You can see Patty's orange dress suddenly appear where his head was. I was really sorry to see them fix that. I don't know why, but it makes the cartoon even more endearing to me."
1,"It's Charlie Brown... It's the movie you grew up with plus a bunch of other stuff. I teach kids who had never seen it before, they like it."
1,Charlie Brown Christmas I bought this movie for myself because it is a classic Christmas movie. Also it came in Blu Ray was a factor.
1,"Wonderful This Charlie Brown movie is the best, most masterful work ever made by the late great artist. This movie is part of the Christmas tradition - no less than the apple cider, the carols, and the tree - and truely captures the sentiment of Christmas."
1,"Proof that good things are built to last When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music, subject treatment and Linus's Bible reading were unlike anything else tried on TV before. Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - ""Sparky"" hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and, in true Peanuts' style, is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious. One of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season."
1,A Holiday Classic I love Snoopy. He is my favorite. And I love owning this classic and bringing it out every holiday season and watching it with family and friends. It never gets old. A timeless tradition!
1,"Christmas Tradition- Schultz was a genius! Like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" this animated film has imprinted on the American psyche the meaning of the Christmas holiday season."
1,"Amazon Fan There was more to this disc than I expected. It has several additions that were good to watch. The cartoon itself is a good reminder of what Christmas is all about. Great for the kids or grandkids, or even the Scrooge sitting on the sofa."
1,A Timeless Classic! This video has been around longer than me and has earned a place in my heart. It is a must have for every one who collects Peanuts' videos. Though it was done in 1965 it still holds true today. It is full of wit and charm and is fun and entertaining for all ages. It has become a Christmas tradition in our home to watch it every year!
1,"If you don't like this movie, you're just flat wrong!! Christmas is about more than santa and presents. It's more than just the biggest tree with the best decorations. It's about a babe in a manger, three wise men and eternal salvation. In an innocent way only Charles Shultz and the crew can do, Charlie Brown (And Linus, et al) deliver this message loud and clear. I say everyone needs to buy this DVD before everything related to God and Jesus and the true meaning of Christmas is removed from the world... It's sad when a cartoon such as this may very well be one of the last strongholds Christians have on our own identity.My own personal soapbox aside, this movie is great. It's timely, even today. It's meaningful and it's truth personified. It teaches about the things that really matter in life, not the superficial garbage most people tend to worry about during the holidays.God Bless Charlie Brown!"
1,"All time favorites I just bought the DVD to this great Christmas Special dated back to 1965. Who cannot love the Peanuts gang and Snoopy. Also, the DVD has It's Christmas Time Again Charlie Brown which is a bonus feature. Great family entertainment!! Too bad they don't make them like this anymore."
1,"Love it! I originally purchased this for my pregnancy, as I was using 5+ pillows for support, and i was tired of chasing them as they fell off the bed all night long. I loved the support and have slept with it ever since. (i even take it with me on trips.) its great because of the refluff-able fill and because you can roll over and not have to move it. I have yet to wash it in the laundermat and see how it turns out.one con, because of its size, it can be difficult to fluff... do it in the morning while you have energy, not at night when you're ready to go to bed."
1,"Exactly What I Wanted I looked at all the different types of body/pregnancy pillows on Amazon and finally settled on this one. I am pregnant and have recently gotten to the point that I just cannot get comfortable in bed. I have had this pillow a week now and I absolutely love it. It was worth every penny. It's like sleeping in a nest, it supports me beautifully and its very comfortable."
1,"Great item! The adaptor works really well on my ibook or powerbook. It has a really long extension cord. The only problem is that it is slightly more bulky than the apple one. So, for traveling around, unless you have a big computer case, it will not fit nicely. Other than that, it is great. Much cheaper than a new apple adapter and works just as nicely. It is also sturdier than the apple adaptor and does not have the annoying light."
1,"WHO NEEDS MAC ACCESSORIES Who needs Mac accessories when you can have an equally good (or better) product like Macally powerbook Ibook ac adapter? I purchased this item for my daughter when her Mac-made original AC adapter connection frayed and was not fixable. We tried to get a replacement at Mac retail stores and Mac on-line, but everyone was out of them and did not know when they would be available. This made me think that the original cords must have been somewhat defective since there was such a demand for them. We turned to Amazon to order the Macally AC adapter with some trepidation because the price was lower than the Mac-made product. That was several months ago and the Macally adapter has worked perfectly and we are very pleased with our purchase. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a new adapter and because of the lower price, would advise it instead of the Mac."
1,"Exactly what I wanted I was worried when I ordered this because there were so many bad reviews. After all, it's a power cord there is only one thing that can go wrong how can they all be so bad. I have had it for about a month now and it's a power cord. yay!"
1,"Very Good I read many positive reviews before buying this product, so my thanks to all of the previous posters. This adaptor is actually really great. I was a little upset before because I thought I was replacing my old G3 adapter with an even uglier one but was very happy to see that it isn't like the picture. It's the same shape but the chords everything is white, so it matches well with my ibook. It also has a pretty blue light that shines when the AC is connected, but it doesn't do much else. So if your worried about having an ugly adapter don't be because this is actually pretty nice. (at least much nicer than the G3 model adaper)"
1,"Great Solution! This Adapter will do the job as good or even better than the original adapter for a fraction of the price. Unless you are deeply in love with the ""cute looks"" and the Apple logo on the original adapter save your self some money by buying this one."
1,"Great replacement. We have 3 PowerBooks in the house, and 2 of them are using these cords now when their OEM powercords fizzled out - as the apple cords are known to do. While they don't light up, they do their intended job, and they do so without overheating QUITE as bad as the original cord. It still gets warm, so give it some space, but overall, a very nice product."
1,"Exactly what I hoped for My husband and I both have Mac laptops and the dog chewed his charger to pieces (yay!) and after five years of use, my charger literally started smokig while it was plugged in (yay!)I went to the Mac company store to buy new chargers, but at a whopping 79.99 I only bought one. I found the MacAlly charger on Amazon.com and decided to give it a try. When we got it and tried it out I immediately returned the Mac brand charger for a refund. I love the MacAlly charger! Its actually long enough to be practical. It doesn't fall out of the wall socket from its own weight (imagine that.) And it never gets hot enough to fry eggs.BUY IT! It's less than half the cost of the brand name, it's a more practical design, and it's still small enough to fit into my little laptop bag. Sure, its not as novel or cute, and it doesn't have the little Apple insignia on it, but I'm not paying eighty bucks for one charger when I could buy the two that I needed for about the same."
1,"Don't scrounge for the second-gen Apple adapter! This is your ticket! I don't know how long I searched and searched for a replacement for myPowerbook G4 power adapter replacement. I looked at Computer City,Apple Stores, apple.com, and even Ebay. The old adapters aren't availablein either of the two stores and online the adapters can hit you up for 80bucks! Ugh!This adapter works great with the generation of apple laptops before theMagSafe adapters and it's much less prone to malfunction and designflaws that will enable it to rip, etc. Very elegant, too."
1,FABULOUS! Recommend it over the genuine Mac alternative. Couldn't be more satisfied with this product! And the low price ...I've bought my last $80 Mac adapter. They can fook right orf !!!:-)
1,Mindcrime at the Moore Absolutely amazing. that's the only way to describe this DVD A must have for any Queensryche fans.
1,"It leaves you wondering... The Spanish version of Brian Weiss's book, ""Muchas vidas, muchos sabios"" is even more intriguing to me than my English version. (La version del libro de Brian Weiss es aun mas intrigante para me que la version en Ingles.) For those who believe in reincarnation, this is a great book (Para aquellos que creen en la reincarnacion, este es un gran libro.)"
1,"Oh, so cool! Such a cool check book cover! Seems very durable and will last a long time. Very roomy, yet slim enough to fit in my little purse! Excellent price and very prompt shipping. A definate converstion piece."
1,The most beautiful Cd I've ever bought. As a big fan of classical persian music and an Iranian I recommand this cd to anyone intersted in molavi's and nazeri's work.This very diffrent and amazing work by dastan and nazeri is for sure the best work i heard from them.I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I do.
1,"Clear and Concise Introduction to Palmistry In my opinion, Richard Webster's Revealing Hands is quite simply the best introduction to the fascinating subject of palmistry. Students will find the material to be concise and easily comprehensible, unlike many other chirological texts. This fine book is a mandatory addition to the library of any aspiring or professional palmist."
1,"..I Found This Excellent! Looking for a Palm Reading Bible you will go back to over all other pretty, colorful and modern New Age Palm Reading books? This is the one! Out of all the Palmistry books I go back to over and over when professional palm reading, this is the book I turn to. Why? Its black and white, diagrams give plenty of writing space for quick notes, writing style is down to earth and basic. For basic/intermediate study, this is a book based on old traditional rules.....Not a health study, more a realistic character study....I consider it the best I have in my Palmistry Library."
1,"Pure Funk This is just great music. Funk through the eyes of the great Eddie Palmieri. A total fusion of the time period. A mix of funky, jazzy latin rock-a little like the band ""War""."
1,Great extra pieces We always need these extra little pieces and couldn't find them anywhere. Great to find them here and good quality for the price!
1,"Reunited with Reunion From the first tune, the chills came back. And when Glen rips into the words early on in Just This One Time, I was back to the old chair with the vinyl on the stereo. The tunes are a testament to Webb's remarkable writing and arranging talents. He puts himself up for all to see and speaks as if he has read my thoughts. Such a long lost treasure found again....thanks to the Aussies for put it all together! Now I must get back to listening...and smiling!"
1,"The Finest Material Available - Period I can't express my gratitude at the reviews I've read enough - I remember finding ""Reunion"" in the remainder bin at a Caldor's a couple of decades ago. I couldn't believe what I was listening to when I got it home. How could this album not be a top seller, I thought? ""Wishing Now"" is one of the most achingly joyous, if that's the best way to put it, songs of longing you'll ever hear. ""You Might As Well Smile"" is a masterpiece of soulful humanity. ""The Moon's a Harsh Mistress"" is pure poetry set to music. One of the GREAT albums of all time - period."
1,"Plain and Simple I felt this was an extremely well written and moving little book, and I have recommended it to many friends. In fact, I bought copies and sent them out. It made you stop and think about your own life and how we complicate and prioritize."
1,"plastic globe pepper/salt grinders glass globes would be a welcome addition to thesewonderful little pepper and salt grinders, with 1 hand yet, the glass woul make it feel more professional, or legtitament if you will thnx bert"
1,"Stellar, as usual BP remains the standard for baseball annuals, with zillions of player comments both informative and entertaining, and team comments which are generally excellent.They know more about more players than anyone else.Minor quibble: Every year the back cover exhalts BP's predictive prowess and gives examples, yet for some reason the 2001 edition fails to speak of, for instance, the success of the Minnesota Twins and Jeff Kubenka. But that's just marketing, I suppose -- it is a great book."
1,"The New Standard Bearer BP sets the standard, not just for baseball books but for all annuals of any genre. The depth and breadth of coverage seems to grow each year. Whether you're a fantasy player or a hard core fan, this book is indispensable."
1,"Worth it for the Furs cover alone. Okay, a lot of this has been released elsewhere and some might find the price tag unjustified. However, this is worth it if for no other reason than the weird postmodern refraction (or something like that) of Robyn covering fellow '80s college rock casualties of the great alternative sellout of the 1990s, The Psychedelic Furs. ""The Ghost in You"" gains something in his sparse folk arrangement that it didn't have in its synth heavy/Richard Butler's limited vocal range but still great original version.Get it before it goes out of print like every other Hitchcock release.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
1,"Excellent travel book I ordered this book after visiting the Amazon and Dr. Smith's clinic. The descriptions of her work there and her clinic, local people and their community, culture, climate, plant and animal life were spot on so it was a joy to read and added depth to my travel experience. Dr. Smith's medical dedication and adjustment to life on the Amazon is inspirational."
1,"Unique and Captivating China High quality, light weight and uniquely interesting pattern. Adds fun to the dining experience and cleans up like a dream in the dishwasher. Arrived in absolutely perfect condition and was packaged exceptionally well."
1,"Wonderful book...from ex-Hoosier I grew up in Indianapolis and really enjoyed reading about all of the things that have gone away since I was a little kid. I used to love Burger Chef, and the downtown Ayres store. I remember the Riverside Amusement Park sitting closed there for years when we would pass it going out to the Speedway.The author also has a webpage called ""Lost Indiana"" which talks about some of the Lost Indy topics, but also some other neat sites in the rest of the state. You could google this to find it."
1,"It's my favorite CD!!!!!! Wow! This is my favorite CD right now. Warning, if you liked Natalise's first album this one is a little different. And it's 20 times better! The music is totally hot and there are some killer beats and really great slow songs too. Her voice is amazing. And the lyrics are really meaningful. If you listen to the lyrics you can tell that she is talking about true life experiences and not just singing the same things as other other artists. And ALL the lyrics are printed in the booklet. It's a really big booklet with LOTS of pages TONS of photos and all the lyrics for every single song! The booklet is like a bonus. There are so many good songs on this album, It's the best CD I've bought in a couple years.I give it 6 out of 5 stars"
1,"Guy Clark is the best Guy Clark continues to show what great country music really is. In these days of Shania Twain and the like where country is really a form of pop with cowboy hats, here comes Guy Clark with ""Cold Dog Soup"" that reminds you that great music with poetry in the likes of Hank Williams,Merle Haggard Willy Nelson and Townes Van Zandt still gets recorded. This is the true stuff that makes you think and tap your feet at the same time. This is an incredible production! Great work Guy! From Fort Worth Blues a Steve Earl Song to Red River, man you oughta be proud! This should be on the charts! But with the current country scene forget it.. Oh yeah what a great line "" Baby don't let um blow smoke up your dress...."" Also if you haven't written the song, you really know how to choose someone elses material and make it yours."
1,"Simply Wonderful Being a fan of progressive rock, at first listen I didn't think much of this album because it didn't sound like there was much there. Don't make the same mistake! Don't be fooled by this album's simple sounds. They belie a complexity of story and emotion - an honesty that permeates every note on this album and is beautifully woven into a harmony of voice and guitar. This is a great album that is also well recorded - nuff said!"
1,I feel like punching the Queen evertime I read his works Brilianty written with passion and fury for the common men of this historic period of time. Essays written not for the elitests but for those who could and did make a difference. Paines works are truly historical and express the point of view of the common man who day after day is raped with taxes and control by a royal family thousands of miles away who could care less for the people they take claim to.His works helped give birth to the greatest nation to bless the Earth.
1,"A Man of True Feelings For His Country. Not his Government. Paine was a patriot that believed that the country belonged to it's people, and it was up to the citizens to keep their democracy.He like the other founders knew that in order to be a truly free people they must rebel against th tyranny of England and set up a democracy where the people ruled it's government.A revoluntary, patriot whose readings is a must for anyone that is for keeping the government, of, by and for the people."
1,"A Man of Reason At the height of The Age of Reason, The United States of America was created by men such as Thomas Paine and many others who held Man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea ""Individual Rights"" down on paper in the form of The Constitution of the United States of America. Paine's contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that ""we have it in our power to make the world over again"", and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man's life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing ""We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way"". Let's work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters. To the Glory of Man!!"
1,"Suspensefull & well Written Although this is an old public domain book, it was an entertaining, well written and exciting book. You may be able to get it free on other sites or get his package of 13 novels on this site that includes this book for .99"
1,"super writer great reading. max brand has become one of my favotire authors. looking forward to reading more of his books,, great story teller."
1,"One of their best yes, but definitely their most unique. This is for sure many peoples favorite release from the band, and rightfully so, as it definitely is their most unique record in the catalog in my opinion. Epic and huge sounding, this is a classic album. Everything from killer cover art, to the lyrics... it actually transports you to the place you see on the cover of the album and makes you wonder; who is living in that cold and grim little ice castle that is sitting just on top of hell... or maybe that's just what icechests look like in Norway and they are camping and their campfire needs another log... Either way, this would be the album I would give to someone who has never heard or heard of the mighty IMMORTAL. Metalhead or not, You've never heard anything like this. IMMORTAL RULES!!!"
1,"Not just for black metal fans This is a great cd by Immortal, even though I'm not a huge black metal fan. A+.My favorite song on this cd is Withstand The Fall Of Time."
1,"A new fan of the almighty Sons Of Northern Darkness! The first music I heard from Immortal was the latest release ""Sons Of Northern Darkness"", and I was instantly hooked! I promptly picked up ""At The Heart Of Winter"", and, after hearing others in their catalog, regard this as their second greatest release. The music is varied and interesting to listen to (unlike Battles In The North...sorry guys!) with awesome riffs all over the place! It's been a while since I've been this excited about a band and am in awe of the power they incorporate into their playing. Although there are only 6 tracks, there is not a single bad song on here. You don't have to be a fan of so-called ""Black Metal"" (I'm not!) to love this album. I'm sure it will be one of my favorite CD's that I bought this year (and I buy a lot of music). Great artwork too! A must-have for the collection of any fan of real metal!"
1,"""views of the man in the street ~ Joseph Hill"" This is one of the best Reggae albums to come out for a long time ""World Peace"", featuring Culture a mesmerizing preacher-teacher who tells it like it is. Heavy bass and drums, vibrating your whole being and getting through the fibers of life with every lyric.Several highlights ~ ""WORLD PEACE"", purity of harmonies reign within this simply but true statement ~ ""NO SEGREGATION"", hits home in every part of the world, no matter where you're standing at the time ~ ""SELECTION TRAIN"", again the lyrics blend with the beat, all you need is clean hands and pure in heart to climb aboard the Reggae train...sounds good to me.If Reggae is your cup of tea, then this one is a keeper. Take a bow Rounder Records for this enjoyable release, look forward to many more of the same...gotta love it!Total Time: 50:54 on 13 Tracks ~ Rounder 7764-2 ~ (6/17/2003)"
1,Garage Door replacement Circuit Circuit Board arrived in quick fashion and in good shape. If you are just slightly mechanically inclined you can do this replacement yourself. Maybe the most difficult thing is working on a ladder. Had garage door working in less than 30 minutes.
1,"Wow! What a treat. I had no idea Dolly Parton was this GOOD. Really, seriously, this is top notch and I rate it 5 stars."
1,"Help! I can't stop playng this CD! And I never thought I would go for bluegrass, always conjuring up images of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" in my mind. Leave it to Dolly to educate me. This music is extraordinary: very intricate all-stringed arrangements headed off by Parton's lovely, shimmering vocals. The lyrics are pretty much standard, straight-on country, but the singer is so heart-felt, she invests them with so many colors and nuances, she might as well be performing Shakespeare. Thanks, Dolly, for a truly GREAT CD!"
1,"This is a stellar piece of music. Coming from someone whose musical preferences run the gamut, from Mariah Carey to Portishead to the Cardigans and back to Geri Haliwell, these words hold quite a bit of meaning. I had read reviews of the album which touted it as the ""best of her career"" and, of course, was skeptical. I can say with complete honesty that this Bluegrass was something I was unfamiliar with, but something I have come to greatly appreciate. The music is fresh and live, different from any mainstream pop we hear nowadays, and is well-deserving of a listen by anyone with an ear for music, whether they are a city boy (Bronx, NY here) or not. Good music has a way of transcending boundaries, and this is one of those discs."
1,"DOLLY IS STILL QUEEN OF COUNTRY MUSIC ! DOLLY PARTON HAS SHOWN WITH THIS AMAZING ALL BLUEGRASS ALBUM, THE GRASS IS BLUE, WHY SHE CAN STILL CARRY THE TITLE OF QUEEN OF COUNTRY MUSIC. DOLLY IS NOT GETTING THE RADIO AIRPLAY THAT SHE STILL DESERVES. SO SHE LEFT COUNTRY MUSIC AND RELEASED AN ALL BLUEGRASS ALBUM THAT IS IN NO WAY DISAPPOINTING. I STRONGLY FEEL DOLLY WILL WIN A GRAMMY FOR THIS WORK OF PURE MOUNTAIN MUSIC ART. ALSO A WARM WELCOME TO THE RECENT HALL OF FAME MEMBER!"
1,"She could be sister, friend or mother... Lhasa's music:Her music crosses language/race boundaries. As a person who bond very strongly with female singers (eg. Kate Bush, Billie Holiday, Cesaria Evora), Lhasa's music speaks to me as if she is a close female friend, sister or mother.Amazing, intriguing voice. Simple yet dramatic; dramatic yet uncontrived.her velvet resonance and the beauty of the songs will slip unnotice past your defenses and touch the private self.I heard only about 30 seconds of the song ""de cara a la pared (Face to the Wall)"" on the show ""Due South"", but that was enough to make me determine to track down singer and song. I managed to do so on the net. And to my amazement, I found ""La Llorona"" in Singapore's HMV..."
1,"bought this as a christmas gift for a friend I gave this cd to my friend for christmas & this is what she emailed to me: I've got my discman set up with the little speakers on my desk and I'm listening to Lhasa. I love that girl! Song 9 (playing now: ""Pajarol, tu me despertaste..."") reminds me a little of the Klezmatics--kind of that Eastern European gipsy feeling... Makes me want to get up, smash my coffee cup and start dancing, with the belly beads showing...."
1,"I feel my skin with her voice. Lahasa, your music touches me in places which needed dusting. your gift reminds me i have a heart, skin, teeth, beauty. thank you. thank you. thank you."
1,"A fun-filled fantasy adventure ""Castle"" is a wonderful book for children who have short attention spans. It provides adventure and re-affirms the laws of chivalry."
1,"Castle in the Attic Castle in the Attic is a masterpiece beyond childhood recognition. Ms. Winthrop has woven a tale not confined to the limits of a child's imagination, but one that tests the mature intellect. Christian parents will be pleased to discover that while magic is a recurring theme in this book, it proves to be mearly a side story to the more important and intreguing prospect of William's character development. I recomend to any parent this book for their young son. It speaks of Honor and Chivalry in the face of evil, of strength and tender souls. What this book speaks of in regard to emotional strength is something that every child, and even adult, needs to discover; That to Cry is not Cowardice, to be tender hearted is not Weakness, and that Honor and courage is the Heart of a Knight."
1,"A very good book This is one of the many LJ Smith books I read and eventhough it is not the best, it was certainly very interesting... LJ Smith's books are very original and that's the main reason why I like reading them....I prefer all her other books about vampires though..since I'm a vampire freak..but I would encourage anyone to read this book...It's simply great!"
1,"Best witch book i've ever read!!! Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends,and I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come."
1,"Thanks for the info!!! I just wanted 2 say that I'm a real bookworm and I loved this book! I also want 2 thank L.J.Smith for putting in the book actual spells.(I'm a witch.) I've been looking for some of those like,forever"
1,"Magic, Love and Witchy Women........ This book is one of the greatest of the nightworld series. This book is about gentle, nature loving Thea and her wild beautiful cousin, Blaise.Thea falls in love with a human but since the rules of the nightworld state that she can't love a human Thea finds herself in a situation that could turn deadly......Blaise willing to do anything for her cousin tries to lure Eric into her trap and get him away from Thea for good!This has to be my favorite of the series. It was interesting to see the nightworld from the witches point of view and Thea and Blaise are great characters. Especially Blaise, she's no airhead beauty but like her name a bright blaze of passion, intelligence, and loyalty."
1,Great! This book like all of L.J.Smith's other books is absolutely divine! I luved it. Blaise was a perfect witch in my opinion. The only thing that disturbed me was the awful torture chamber for Halloween in the Gym. How can people actually laugh about that (I've met people who think it's funny)?
1,"Excellent! One of the best baseball books ever! Although most of the players from the 1961 Cincinnati Reds are forgotten now (exception: right fielder and National League MVP Frank Robinson), this book remains current due to the good humor and insider's view it affords the reader. Nearly 40 years old now, it shows how timeless the game of baseball is.I'm a lifelong NY Yankees fan, but this remains one of my favorite books on any subject.One note: this is one of the only baseball books that was _really_ written by the named author. Brosnan had no ghostwriter."
1,"Great series I have several titles in this series--they're great! The recipes are easy to make and clearly set out, and there is always an introductory chapter on the herb or spice covered by the book. There are several other titles in this series: coriander, ginger, garlic, chocolate, etc."
1,Always a great book... All I can say is that this is a nice nearly complete compilation of his work. A must read in my educated opinion.
1,"Good primer. Great book for an overall look at insects. Doesn't go into great depth on any one topic or insect, but provides a great cross section of information. Purchased this for my son and will admit that as usual, the DK illustrations caught my eye and I ended up reading the book too. This is a great series of books for kids that really captures their attention."
1,"Excellent Educationl Text I'm a teacher and I find the Eyewitness books highly educational. I like the way the concepts are presented in a form without backgrounds. This gives clear facts to the reader without over taxing the attention span. The books are highly informative, presenting difficult concepts in comprehendable chunks that stimulate interest. I have almost the whole collection for my own children and they LOVE them!"
1,"REMASTER 2012! GOTTA HAVE IT! So, what I've always wanted was a clean digitally remastered version of ""Pom Pom Play Girl"" in MONO! The stereo is rechanneled with Carl singing on one channel and the guys singing on the other! The Mono ""FUN, Fun, Fun is also a ""Must Have"" in Mono to get the full benefit of Brian's Vocal. The music and vocals are very clean on this CD. The gatefold packaging is a bit weak without any details on the songs but still an overwhelming experience for anyone who enjoys surf music."
1,"Fantastic Melting Pot of Music Having seen Scruj live a couple of times, and owning a copy of their studio release CD (see their website), I would consider myself a major fan. To quote a friend, ""Are they French, Irish, or American Country?"" Good question. Answer: all of the above.Blending Irish folk music, french fiddles and lyrics, and country twang, Scruj manages to always be true to the styles they worship. Yet they are all so young! If you have not seen them or heard them, do yourself a favor and do whatever it takes! They play such wonderful music with a profound respect for it's origins and it's spirit."
1,"Great in different styles !!! The reason that i give this cd 5 stars... it's simple... different styles of house music, compiled on one cd... you will enjoy it a whole time... so it's worth for your money !!!If Jack keeps it in this way... we may expect beautiful things of him in the future !!!"
1,"Excellent quality Wonderful product - heavy weight and well made. This has been a delightful and useful addition to my 50's style, diner kitchen."
1,"Real cultured butter of high quality I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said, there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.In my opinion, the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire, etc."
1,"The Distillationof Huxley's Views on Life and Death One of my all time favorite books, glad to have a new copy"
1,"Lovely stories. Gwen Bristow is an amazing author. Her books may be a mite old fashioned, but she still packs an emotional, historical and cultural punch. Really a great read, as are her other novels. Don't miss out."
1,awsome metal dude its like code red was an album from Sodom.This album is scarey and makes me feel cool
1,"Exactly what it says it is I'm an arts and crafts director for a girlscout camp, so I read a lot of craft books. Klutz really does have the best ones around. These rings are easy, the book gives you everything you need (but scissors) and there are several cute patterns. I'm sure campers will love these projects. The only complaints I have are with the included supplies-- the bead wheel is cumbersome to use, and the colors mix easily. Also, there isn't much variety in beads-- but you can easily supplement with whatever you have on hand."
1,"Useful, witty and profound I have always loved Peter McWilliams poetry.He had the most impact on my style of writing poetry(Poems in the Key of Life...a Journey). I never knew he wrote non-fiction books. When I couldn't find his poetry books I came to Amazon to purchase them again. This is when I saw his non-fiction work. I bought one. I loved it. It is a useful guide how to go through life with less distress. He does it in a witty, amusing and easy to understand way. I think everyone should read his books. I plan on getting the rest of his work. I have no doubt I will enjoy them as much as I have this one."
1,"The most wonderful self awareness/psychology book. A must read. When I was a Senior in High School I took an AP Psychology class and the teacher used this book. This book has helped me so much in life. It helped me understand all those awkward teenage years. Helped me deal with an abusive, destructive blended family and helped me learn about myself and my own dysfunctionsd. This is a wonderful book that is very easy to read and something that every one should read."
1,"Best band no one knows End of Romance is the great new album by one of the best rock and roll bands that no one has ever heard of. The album starts out with the rocking ""I'm No Angel"" which is a vastly different sound than anything on the band's previous works. The drum beat to this song will instantly have you pounding the dashboard in your car as you drive with the windows down and the stereo blasting. Other highlights include ""Walking Years Away"" and the best song on the album, ""Northstar"". The song ""Coping"" which was on the ""Born and Razed"" album makes an appearance in a different arrangement; one that gives the song a much harder edge, on this record. All in all ""End of Romance"" is a terrific rock and roll album and one that will hopefully garner the Charlie Mars Band the audience they deserve."
1,Great Quality They were really soft and great quality. No defects (which is always nice lol). The fiance and I both loved them.
1,A lingerie must-have I hate the modern day thigh highs with the silicone bands that hold them up on your thigh. These stockings do not have them in the lace trim. A garter belt is required or garter straps on your favorite bustier. Gives you that sexy garter style without the unsightly bulging and uncomfortable pinching.
1,"Beautiful and arrived perfect! I have been wanting this pattern for some time now, so I finally ordered it (3 actually)and they just arrived, very well packed, not a scratch on them, and on time!And you can't beat the price from Amazon, I saved about $75 on each set!"
1,"Marshall Hollenzer is Driving This is a superbly written book. Witty, clever, and thought provoking, I found if hard to put down. It is filled with quirky and interesting characters, prose that flows, and subtle humor that occasionally had me laughing out loud. I cannot wait to read the next book by this promising young author."
1,CAREFUL what you order It is a great tool and glad the manufacturer stands behind their products. They exchanged the Spanish for English. The tools is worth the money just make sure you get it in the correct language. I am just to OLD to learn a new language.
1,WONDERFUL Another Winner for Belva. The characters are real and you will both laugh and cry. The story is believable. You will not be able to put it down.
1,"This book is a straight 5 starts!! I'm an avid reader of Belva Plain's books, and After The Fire is just another one of her masterpieces. I really don't understand how anyone who've read this book can think otherwise."
1,"Better than expected! For thirty bucks, I wasn't expecting much. After reading the reviews, I knew not to expect much. I went so far as to add J-B Weld to my order in anticipation of wobbly joints.I've used it on one fire so far, and I have no need for the J-B Weld yet. When assembling it, the threads all seemed to fit quite well--very snugly, tight, and firm. No wobble. Can't beat the value of these. And all it takes is to J-B weld if it ever starts to ""go cheap"" on me."
1,"This is what a management game should be! Virtual Resort: Spring Break is a highly addictive, surprisingly humorous management game with detailed graphics. True, you will need a powerful computer to get it to run smoothly, but when it does it is well worth it. It requires a decent amount of thinking and rewards you with entertaining animations. Being able to import your own music is a great feature. The level of control that is involved is what makes the game so addictive. It is actually entertaining to sit back and watch all the little things that are going on on your island. All other management games should strive to be half as fun as this one."
1,"An adult sim I have enjoyed this game. It seems easy but you'll find yourself out of time or money before you have met your objectives. You don't feel cheated, it makes you want try again and again. Maybe no one will drown and perhaps you can even turn a profit. I'm looking forward to many hours of entertainment."
1,"Great Music--Fun Game I loved the music for this game and the 20 bucks i spent on this thing when i bought a few years ago was well spent. Its the oldest game for my computer that i still play, probably because there are no sequels, but i burnt the music to a cd and can listen to it in my car. For the 3.50 the game is going at now you might as well just buy it to try it, then again you have to factor in shipping cost, but all in all a great game especially for under ten dollars."
1,BB's the Best! It doesn't matter what this Master sings; he is the best. I have been a fan of BB's forever. There is no such thing as a bad BB collection of songs.
1,"How to Own Your Home Years Sooner- without making extra inte This book should wake up more people to the opportunity to manage and take control of their mortgage instead of the bank controling you. Good information, outlined well with easiy to understand examples.As and extra bonus it was great to meet the author Harj Gill the other night as he presented his information and also showed how to apply this knowledge to your business too.Look for this book to make a difference in banking here in the U.S."
1,"What an Eye-Opener! When you understand that banks are interested in making money -- LOTS of it -- for themselves, you'll understand why this book was written. It helps you keep more of your money while still paying off what you borrowed, only faster.For a conventional mortage, most of the payments in the first few years go primarily to paying the interest on the loan, with very little going to the principal. With most people moving to a new one (trading up) every 5-7 years, they wind up paying LOTS of interest with very little to show for it. The banks get VERY rich this way.With this book, you can learn how to move out of that pool of quicksand and stand on solid financial ground. Harj writes clearly and simply without talking down to you. He lays it all out from beginning to end, and everywhere in between.More than worth the INVESTMENT in your life. Definitely read it."
1,Love this story. Well written I love this story. Loaned it to my sister and she was just as impressed as I was. Highly recommended.
1,stress reliever Co-workers stop to comb the sand and ask where I got it. Its a great time out in a stressful environment.
1,Great for office I purchased this for my new office and I love it and so does everyone who comes in.
1,"a welcome return to form I want to second everything said by Mr. Grimlan with respect to this album and Les Baxter's output in general. Although I am extremely fond of Les's 1940s-50s work in all genres, some of his 60s pop things (specifically, VOICES IN RHYTHM and COLORS OF BRAZIL/AFRICAN BLUE) continue to leave me cold. This 1970 album, however, exhibits none of the shortcomings of those earlier ones - the lukewarm performances, the generic guitar/bass work or the uncomfortably passe doo-wahs. No, this abbreviated QUE MANGO! has real energy. It crackles - and not only is there not a bad track, but some of them (""Que Mango"", ""Tropicando"", ""On a Warm Night"", ""Felicia, My Love"") stand easily with the best of Les's work from his great 50s albums. Highly recommended even as it is at under 24 minutes."

1,"BEWARE! In this book Agatha Christie refers to the murderers in Death in the Clouds, the Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Mysterious Affair at Style and the Mystery of the Blue Train, so make sure you have read all of these before you read this one, our your fun will be spoilt!Dumb Witness is one my top ten favourite Agatha Christie novels. Dame Christie has expressed the character of Hastings better here than in any of the other seven novels in which he appears. It is also one of the most amusing.One thing I enjoy about this book is that we are given a fair crack at the whip - everything that Poirot sees we see, there are no last minute envelopes arriving (which often irritates me). His explanation is convincing.Go ahead and read it! But don't forget to read the books mentioned above first."
1,"Model 1911 Lovers An excellent addition to the library of any Model 1911 owner. The book deals with the history, shooting and maintenance of this iconic firearm."
1,Greatest Box Set Ever !! This box set is a MUST-HAVE for all Elvis/Orion fans alike. Booklet is fantastic. Songs are great . Can't wait till the next Orion box set !
1,great to use with action shots or beginning photographers im glad i bought this item i could have use this years ago as i love to take pictures and video my kids sports.Darrin & Jackie
1,"Nolde Ignites Passion I'm an always learning watercolorist and this book is great inspiration for letting more passion flow into my everyday and my art. the book arrived in 'very good' condition, as requested. Nolde's landscapes and flowers are unparalleled in their joy for color and sense of spontaneous energy and expression. i'm really glad i did the market buy and let Amazon find the book over a few months."
1,Arrived in great Book looks great everything that was promised and arrived in great time too. Thanks! Will enjoy reading it and sharing
1,"Excellent software, but NOT an audio CD Amazon needs to fix its info for this product - it's not an audio CD. It's a great package of software that has helped me bulk up my vocabulary and get a better pronuncation in modern standard arabic. I learned arabic grammar a while back, but found that its hard to communicate without a growing base of vocabulary to use. THis program is helping me do that. Love the clear audio recordings!"
1,sorta wonderful this is what wilco would sound like now if they had not turned into radiohead. first 6 songs are as strong as any record in the last 10 years.
1,"The BEST PUR cd. A must have for any PUR fan, it is if full of classic songs such as ""Lena"", ""Prinzessin"" and ""Drachen sollen fleigen"". Great cd."
1,"A timeless and memorable anthology Compiled and edited by William F. Buckiley, Jr., the Treasury Of Classic Children's Literature is an anthology of enduring stories for young folk, painstakingly selected and compiled by William F. Buckley, Jr. for their lasting appeal across the generations. Works by Jack London, Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, Mark Twain, Thorton W. Burgess, Palmer Cox, and others, are embellished with black-and-white illustrations in this timeless and memorable anthology which is a welcome and recommended addition to school and community library Children's Literature anthology collections."

1,"Excellent idea, went over perfectly at Christmas This gift for my brother at Christmas got more attention than any others. My sister and I hid upstairs for a good 20 minutes trying to get it together, which for us was fun. ""No, that doesn't look like the box. Let me try."" ""Maybe the German instructions make more sense"" (neither of us read German).Our time was well-spent: my brother and his girlfriend admired the appearance, loved the caddy, until my brother became suspicious and announced ""I think it's locked in"". As my sister and I sat smug, several people gave it a try, and we heard a resounding chorus of ""I know some people who absolutely must have this."""
1,"Imagine a cross between Tom Clancy and Tom McGuane A simple premise ... a wealthy American businessman's only granddaugter dies of a cocaine overdose. He decides that he's going to kill everyone who had anything to do with it, starting with her boyfriend and ending with the head of the Columbian drug cartel. Along the way yachts are wrecked and burned, secret love affairs are revealed, priests are consulted, and plenty of smartass dialogue is emitted. Buckley obviously knows what really rich people are really like, and in addition to having a great plot and memorable charactes, it's full of consistently interesting observations. A good book"
1,"Another Fine Parsifal Recording There are many very fine recordings of Parsifal in the catalog. In fact, it's difficult to find a poor performance. The highlight of this production is the magisterial Gurnemanz of Kurt Moll--possibly the best rendition ever. He is ablely supported by the poet of the baton Rafael Kubelik and a virile James King as Parsifal, also possibly his best recorded role ever. The recording has a wide and deep sound stage with excellent sonics. I enjoyed listening to this excellent studio rendition. Wagnerian singing of the highest standards.This recording is near the top of my favorite stereo studio editions along with Karajan's also fine rendition on DG recorded the same year as this one(1980). For the historically minded, I would recommend Krauss's 1953 Bayreuth live air check or Knappertsbusch's 1951 Bayreuth live recording on Decca. Karajan's live Vienna aircheck from 1961 on RCA is also interesting, but sounds older than the earlier recommendations."
1,"First alert plug in Carbon Monoxide Alarm I was very pleased with my first alert plug in Carbon Monoxide Alarm. I like it because it is not that noticeable. It's not an ugly plug in and I like that. We received it in the time that they said it would be delivered and I would not hesitate to order again from Amazon. We have ordered many, many things from Amazon and have never been disappointed with their service.Thank you,Mary Lou Pantuso"
1,"Easy to use, trusted After opening the package, I simply plugged this in to a wall socket (making sure that it is not near a heating source, gas, moving air, dust or sunlight). I tested it, the alarm rang loud and clear. A red light lets me know that it is functional.I feel better having it in my house."
1,"Easy Easy to install, just find an outlet in center of home. Product is made by first alert too which gives me confidence in operation."
1,very good product Great product. i gave this product to my son and i feel much better that he and his family are safer from carbon monoxide. thanks.
1,"No Brainer! I chose this alarm because it was the easiest to use. Just plug it in and that's it. I have a gas fireplace and was told that I needed a carbon monoxide detector. Plugged into a regular outlet, it has a dim light to let you know that it's working and you can test the monitor at any time to make sure it's ""alarmed."" Hopefully, I'll never have to see how well the monitor works in an emergency but I feel safer knowing that I have one."

1,"High quality and so cute! We love this set -- we used it for our daughter, and now we're using it for our son. Sumersault is rated highly by Baby Bargains, and this set is well worth the money. It's held up really well for us over almost three years. FYI, it goes well with the Pottery Barn ""classic stars"" rug in blue."
1,"Strait as an arrow Great product, good price, I have shot them several times and never had anything go wrong. I did robin hood one of them but that was my fault."
1,"Wonderful Ideas I found this book to be extremely useful. The techniques were all new to me. The one that I am going to try first is the wax resist. I am a little worried about the other techniques that use solvents - I don't know where to buy them, and I don't want anything unnatural that is going to hurt my body. Overall, this is a lovely book. One department that does need a little bit of expansion is making the journal itself. However, I already have a blank journal that I bought from a bookstore beginning with Bor (they offer great blank journals CHEAP) and I am just going to use the techniques. Cheers!!"
1,great fun for the whole family I have loved Lewis and Martin since I was a child and now I share the fun with my children. My 5 year old loves the hilarious stunts Lewis does and the soda machine scene must be rewound and played over and over. He has tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. I highly recommend for the family.
1,"Provides excellent knowledge about Tibetan Medicine ITem was shipped new and arrived in excellent condition. DVD provides a beginning knowledge about the almost lost art regarding Tibetan Medicine. As indicated in the DVD, there are very few doctors that still retain this knowledge and practice. Excellent overview but it is all in subtitles and obtaining any of the medicines/herbs seems as though it would be difficult. They take a wholistic approach and specialize the medicines for the person. You would need to go to India to get a diagnosis regarding your condition. Too bad it is not closer."
1,"Just when you thought it couldn't get any better in Xanth Now look, I know Piers Anthony is a great author. I've read his Incarnation of Immortality series, all the Xanth books, the Mode books, and the Apprentice Adept series. But this, I have to say, is the best of the bunch. What do you get when you cross a young black Mundane with a magical talent, a 130 year old man who was transformed into a tree, three kings, and a mess of zombies? Believe it or not, one of the best surprises to come into Xanth in years, thanks to the devious plotting of Good Magician Humphrey, Clio the Muse, and everybody's favorite elf, Jenny of the World of Two Moons. For all of us raised on fairy tales, this one beats them all."
1,"The most complex yet potentially important yet! I have just finished this novel, and must say that it is very complex, yet sets up countless options for the future of Xanth! This book is a story of love, hate, prejudice, potential adultery, and a complete denial and rejection of the Adult Conspiracy! If you love the Xanth novels, you MUST read this book!"
1,"The answers to a serious, life threatening disease I have a friend who has a family history of this disease. He wanted the most current information so I ordered it for him and he found it very valuable.Doc"
1,"New Mexico meets Iraq I have very little to add to these semi-enlighted reviews (above).However, of all his albums, I prefer the immediacy and dialogue here between these masters of string & percussion.We're blessed here in Land of Enchantment to have Alhaj in our midst, and on Music faculty of state university, UNM. It's a secret, but he also has a delicious sense of humor..."
1,"I've told half the women I know about this one! There are very few books that I recommend to other readers, because I assume that everyone has their own tastes and their interests -- especially in the area of ""self-help."" But, this book covers such a far reaching subject, and I think just about every woman I know could benefit from it. This woman talks about body image in regards to sex, dressing, jobs, long term success, even friendships.It really is inspirational, and it changed the way I looked at my waist, hips, thighs, butt, you name it!"
1,Required for Art class Drawing Textbook by Bruce McIntyre is required for an art class I'm in. I like how it laid out and easy to follow away from class. I love that I was able to find it on amazon.com so I could get my own copy. It helps that I don't have to try to follow along with several others at the same time.
1,Alaskan Beauty This book was more than I expected...the pictures are lovely - really makes you want to visit Alaska but if you can't you can certainly enjoy this book.....
1,Fantastic Account of The Soviet Union Highly recommended. This book not only gives a stunning history of the Soviet Union but also a much more personal account of the people who live there. This is truly a must read for anyone interested in Russia and the problems it faces today
1,"IT'S A KNOCKOUT !! Mr. Remnick has given us a masterwork. He seamlessly meshes intimate portraits of Soviet citizens within the larger landscape of the last days of the Soviet Empire. He has a rare ability to blend the micro and the macro in a soul-stirring narrative. This is a profound work that is filled with compelling stories. Lenin's Tomb is so superb that even those who avoid ""history books"" will relish it. Could not more highly recommend this book. The scads of glowing reviews below are all well deserved."
1,"A respectable work of history This is a very revealing and perhaps most revealing account of the last days of the Soviet Union put forth in a concise manner for the reader. It is smooth flowing, vivid in its descriptions and captured the mood at the time in such an authentic way. The reliance on interviews gives a lot of credibility to the narration and the portrayal of the character in the the situations they found themselves in. The society as a whole is bared for he reader to understand and the system's shortcomings are exposed. I read The Union Muzhik the other day and from it, understand the hopes of Perestroika and Glasnost that the demise of the Soviet Union failed to bring to the people."
1,"Huge, high-quality binder I bought this binder to hold a 700+ page anatomy book that was published unbound, and it probably could have held at least two books that size. It's huge. The pockets, D-rings, and opening mechanism are all top quality.When measuring how much space you'll need for this binder in your bookshelf, backpack, etc., remember that the rings themselves are four inches, so the binder is even wider, close to five inches. The side of the binder with the rings will non-negotiably need that much room."
1,"Same dependable Avery quality I keep all of my equipment manuals and owners' guides in these, and needed to add a volume. The others were bought in 2005, so I was worried that I might not be able to get the same durable quality. I worried needlessly. These are up to the usual Avery standards."
1,Bat Girl with Flare This Costume was just as it says. Was a great buy. The material was stretchy so it moved easily with my active child. No complaints.
1,"Pink Child Batgirl Costume Hello,This pink batgirl costume is the best and so perfect for this halloween! It's made well and the topic in kindergarten this past week has been all about bats!!! Daughter cannot wait to wear it and decided to become batgirl since she's already been a princess and ballerina before.Sandra M."
1,Awesome Costume This is a great costume. All the extra pieces make it really great. This is one of our favorite costumes.
1,SEAL TEAM TWO Nice work. Full disclosure. Some of these guys were drinking buddies when I worked in Norfolk . I produced the first TV documentary on SEALS
1,"Sturdy, stylish rod This is a great rod if you need if for a little space. It is stylish while being sturdy. The accents on the end bring out more charater than other plain rods. Had a strong resistance so it stays up on the walls. Holds a material curtain as well as a liner and hasen't budged. Love this rod and would buy again."
1,wonderful The DVD's are a great addition and compliment to the book. This would be wonderful for any cook from novice to expert.
1,"Anything Julia... This is one of three videos that comprise the show- about 8 episodes each to total approx. 24 episodes. I don't know how many were in the original show, so I can't say what percentage of it is on tape here. Reading the back covers, I don't see Martha Stewart's wedding cake presentation, although it was in the original show and that was great just by itself. It is really interesting to watch, and her guest chefs go slow enough to be able to reproduce what they are doing. It's good to have the companion book nearby by Dorie Greenspan, as well, so it's written down for you and you can focus on technique. More recipes in the book than on this DVD."
1,"Very nice design It's light, compact, and stable, easy to slip into a shirt pocket, and easy to use. It's great for fairly flat surfaces. From reading descriptions, the gorilla tripod (I think that's the name), while bulkier, is more versatile, since it can adjust for uneven surfaces and wrap around poles etc, but I haven't tried it."
1,"Good Product The material was nice and clean, no rust and flat. Drills nicely and was easy to work with.Highly recommend."
1,"Great Update! As with his first book, this book has more great information for me as a Type 2 Diabetic. Although my wife is not diabetic, we love ALL the recipe's in both books. They have kept my blood sugar in total control and are delicious! Thanks Dr. Bernstein!"
1,"The Solution: Properly Titled Of the 3 books on this subject by Dr. Bernstein that I have read including his suggested recipes, this is the most detailled and informative. I started practicing what Dr. Bernstein preaches and while it is indeed, difficult at first-especially when you look to revamp your food choices that were learned over your lifetime. After a week, the cravings tend to disappear and I am seeing my sugars come down and I lost 3 lbs. This is just one battle, but if these results keep up, I see this investment into Dr. Bernstein's program is a small price to pay for nutritional and healthy control."
1,"The Type 2 Diabetes Answer. Of the five books that I've read on diabetes, this is the one that has all the answers. I've been on Dr. Bernsteins blood sugar normalization and weight loss program for 6 weeks and have lost 21 pounds, with no craving for carbohydrates!! The program works because the author(a Type 1 diabetic)hasworked out all the answers from personal experience."
1,"Excellent mugs, my guests all agree I have had 12 of these 16 oz. mugs for some time now and think they are the best. Have had no chips, but am careful that no glasses touch other items in my dishwasher. I have given these for gifts and the recipients have asked for more of them for xmas next year. Thanks for an excellent product."
1,"As good as the guy's new book on Horatio Nelson. I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor's. It is also as good as Hayward's new book on Admiral Nelson. Both get my high praise. Scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between, so make the most of this guy's work."
1,"impressive book on a ghastly battle I enjoyed this book very much. I got it as a gift and have now brought a copy to give to someone else. It is very, very thorough, which makes it ideal for academics, but it is also easy for enthusiasts like me to understand and get absorbed in. And I did. Even though I naturally knew how the Stalingrad battle ended I still felt gripped by the dreadful story as it unfolded. Mr Hayward managed to make the events understable and the characters believable. I felt their frustration and their pain and their growing feelings of failure and terrible disappointment. This book goes well alongside Beavor's equally important study of the battle. Stalingrad enthusiasts simply MUST own copies of both, especially as Hayward's is the first to explain air operations (and brilliantly) and Beavor's is the first to look at the fate of the ordinary soldiers from both sides."
1,"A well written and informative book I read this book as part of a study I am doing into war on the Eastern Front.I found the book to be excellently researched and well written. For those who are interested in military history and in particular German Military history, I would say it's a must on any good bookshelf"
1,"I'm keen on Luftwaffe books and this is amongst the best. I agree with what esteemed Professor Richard Overy said in his review of this book: ""This is a model of its kind, which ought to set an agenda for the reconstruction of the air narrative in this and other theatres in the greatest of wars."" But I will go further; this book isn't only or even mainly a narrative. It's a powerfully strong piece of operational-level analysis. It is written in a lively and captivating way, which makes the density of analysis easy to cope with. I rate this work very highly."
1,"AN EXCEPTIONAL WORK This volume is a major contribution to the history of the Luftwaffe during the Russo-Germano war. ""Stopped at Stalingrad"" is also a richly drawn study of the most important air campaigns in the Eastern Front. Written in an accessible style this volume will be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the WWII. I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and also the quality of its contents. The author did a masterful job of research. Joel Hayward draws on diaries of both key commanders and regular airmen. He also shows that the poorly conceived strategies of Hitler and his buffoon, Goering, dommed the efforts of men such von Manstein, Milch and Wolfram von Richthofen (an outstanding soldier) to come to grips with an impossible situation. I heartily recommended this book."
1,"Fun Learning to Dance After receiving both of the Librero's tapes (The Big Band Swing and The Latin and Argentine Tango) as a gift, my husband and I cannot believe how easy it has been to learn to dance from them. Neither of us were dancers and Blanche and Emilio have made it fun and very simple for us to learn. Now we can dance all of the dances that we always wanted to, plus have a good time practicing with our friends. We also enjoy the music CDs that were part of the package, as well as the cue cards."
1,"Great for Beginners! I am an intermediate dancer in some dances, and a beginner in others. I found the Librero's Dance Series (both the Big Band and Latin) very helpful in providing and overall understanding of the similarities and differences of all the popular dances. Their Argentine Tango section would be specially good for beginners. Most videos I have seen on this dance can be frustrating and overwhelming. The music CD is not very inspiring but the tempos are very good for practice and it is convenient. I definitely recommend the Librero's Series, particularly for the Beginner dancer."
1,"The best series available for parents I buy Wiley's guide every year and always find her to be right on the money when it comes to rating the rides, recommending hotels, and giving tips on extras like how and where to meet the characters. What separates this book from the other Disney guides is that it's realistic....the unoffical guide lays out a itinerary that would kill anyone with kids and the official guide is all sugary and light, never telling you how to handle the crowds and the heat and all the other things that are just a factor when you're at Disney World. Wiley hits the middle ground - she's positive and obviously knows (and loves) her stuff but she'll also give you the facts."
1,"excellent I bought the 1999 version and am about to order the newest edition. I had not been to Disney World in 12 years so I had no idea on what to do and where do go. The book was right on about every detail. I especially like the ride advice for little ones and the hotel recommendations. If you are planning a trip, buy this book first!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Geography Book arrived in good contition as described and in the time indicated. Very happy with the service. I would use them again.
1,"fantastic This is a wonderful book with bright cute illustrations and a good story. We got one with stickers for Christmas, it was a nice bonus. My son read it 250+ times in the past few years, he is growing up but the book never gets old or boring :o) thank you"
1,"Great Seller This 3 package DVD arrived in perfect condition and rather quickly. Had no problems with this seller, very pleased. Always would recommend you to buy from this seller."
1,"Excellect Value and Fast Service When I am in need of a product I spend a lot of time doing research. Not only are the costs of the product and shipping/handling charges important but also the speed, accuracy and dependability of the company/person involved. I highly recommend this source to be checked out when searching for specific products."
1,Spider-Man Trilogy Received promptly - unfortunately I ordered the blu-ray and this is not what my son-in-law wanted. I trust the return will be equally easy.
1,"I imagine it's good I bought this as a gift for a kid who's a Spider Man fan. He really enjoys it, but I'm not a super hero fan myself."
1,Great buy! This was exactly what I was looking for. I have the trilogy on Blu-Ray but my son is a huge spider-man fan and only has a dvd player in his room so as I gift I wanted to get this for him so he would be able to watch it whenever he wanted.
1,"Wish I could get it locally The one supermarket chain in our area that carries Quaker Essentials Oat Bran cereal closed our local store. We can get it by driving around 60 miles round trip, but that is inconvenient and wasteful of gas.I could substitute another cereal for myself, but my peach-faced lovebird loves it, and so far will accept no substitute. She eats some, and dunks some in her water bowl, then piles it on a perch. The result is a ""cereal sculpture."" Why she does this, I don't know.I ordered it through an Amazon vendor and received excellent service, but I wish the shipping wasn't so darn expensive."
1,"How a religion is Born! This was an excellent historical work on modern Pagan Witchcraft. It does tend to focus on Wicca, but it does also talk about Druids, and non-Gardnarian Traditions. If you know nothing about Wicca, I recomend you start with another book, or the very last chapter serves as an excelent summary of what Wiccans belive, and though it seams weird to suggest it, you might want to read the last chapter first. Although the author is a historian and not a Pagan or a Witch, he remains respectful in his historical endevor. This book is an excelent example of how a new religion is born, and perhapse the only such history of the birth of a new faith to exist!"
1,"Review of Triumph of the Moon I have not finished reading the book. I have, however, found it hard to put down. It was engaging, comprehensive and enjoyable to read. I heard this book recommended by sales people in my city Halifax.It is without a doubt informative and accurate in the history of Witchcraft. I know it was preferred over other books on the history of Witchcraft."
1,"Worked just like it was supposed to This product worked exactly as it was supposed to. I had tried using the cable that came with the camera (USB cord) and found out exactly what many others had said on blogs.....IT DOESN'T WORK!!!Once I got this cable, it worked perfectly. I was able to easily download video from my camera to my computer. The only frustration I had was that I would rather have paid a little more for the camera and gotten this cable with it in the first place."
1,"Awesome glasses, would buy again. Very fast shipping and excellent transaction with Amazon. Couldn't be happier with these glasses, had them five years now and they are still wonderful."
1,"A defining book. This book would be effective for grief therapy and for teaching about life cycles. It specifically answers the question: What is a lifetime?My daughter, age 4, had a lot of questions about death. She was most especially interested in finding out when her ""dying day"" would be. This book seemed to help her understand that everyone's lifetime is special to them. I wanted her to understand that because someone else died it doesn't mean her death is imminent. A common fear among the young.An exquisitely illustrated and plainly written book, it speaks clearly to the children about a complicated subject. I highly recommend it for all home and school libraries for ages three and up. It should be used as part of a comprehensive set of books on biological and familial concepts as it is not meant to answer all of a child's questions on life cycles, grief, death or dying."
1,"PSI stilll rocks I eagerly anticipated the release of this album, knowing whatever came out of it would be excellent. Musically, it was a dramatic change when compared to other albums such as pitchshifter.com, or infotainment? I like the somewhat mellow approach to many songs, but dont get discouraged, they still have the heavier stuff like ""keep it clean,"" ""dead battery,"" and ""wafer thin."" (my personal favorites) They just keep getting better and better after every release. people complain that they are going mainstream, they change for the times, and what not. At first they resembled one of my favorite bands, ministry, but look at them now, they have stepped away from that, and now have their own unique blend of techno, rock, industrial. they are on a plain all by themselves. lyrically and musically, they cannot be outdone by any rock, or industrial band out at the time. This album is their best to date. PSI ROCKS"
1,Exceeded Expectaitions! The CD was exactly what I was looking for. It arrived early. It was in pristine condition. I'm very thankful that I found this vendor as this was a very rare CD. I will use this vendor again.
1,"Another RA Gem! For those of you that read my review for ""From One,"" pretty much what I said in that review is a repeat. This is an excellent CD, though toned down ""From One,"" it still rocks. You can't go wrong with ordering BOTH at the same time (that's what I did). BTW, I think RA does ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"" BETTER than Police originally did it!!! ;^)"
1,"I don't know what is everyone so disappointed about This was my first LJS book, recommended by a friend, who is a book critic. I was hooked on LJS books ever since. I have read every one of her books and have found them excellent."
1,Underrated This book is the ultimate revenge story. Sure Gillian is superficial but shes had a rough life and deserves to have her chance to shine in the spotlight. And all those readers who do not feel it fit in with the Night World must not have been very observant cuz her place in the Night World was hinted at quite a lot. And she does go to a witches store and she also trys to get in the black iris club once...besides it would be to formulaic if each book was wrapped tightly inside the Night World...each books show different levels of impact the Night World has...plus like all the nightworld books...this deals with a certain kinda topic...Secret Vampire was a girl who was dying and needed to be changed to live...soulmate covered reicarnation and this book delt with a near life experience. Its not the best of the series but its high up there on my list at least.
1,Heavenly Music This is by far the most beautiful CD I have ever listened to. I love it so much I have given it as a gift to family friends and they all love it as much as I do and it has quickly become everyone's favorite. It is truly music to adore and nourish your sprite and soul. Aeoliah is a genius - I give this music my highest recommendation.
1,"Outstanding UFO book Having read at least 50 books on UFOs and related phenomena, ""The Mothman Prophecies"" has become one of my favorites along with those of Jacques Vallee. This classic is a must read and reaches the unpopular but most likely true conclusion that UFOs aren't from outer space but are psychic in nature."
1,"This book is a classic! I read it first in the 60's and have never forgotten it. I was pleased when it was reprinted as I had wanted to read it again. It holds up surprisingly well. Keel had realized things about the 'UFO phenomena' then that most other researchers are only now beginning to understand. If you have a sense of wonder, get it. If you are a researcher, get it. If you are an open minded skeptic, this will give you a better perspective. If you're just looking for entertainment, it's a lot of fun."
1,"Very comfortable Beautifully made and perfect for restorative yoga. I couldn't be happier. I own several other products from Hugger Mugger and always choose their product when available for bolsters, meditation cushions, etc."
1,"Buy it. She is a genius, has a lot to say, it's worth hearing, and this hard-to-categorize music absolutely grows on you and becomes your favorite album for weeks once it sinks in. Sound is fun, too, considering lots of toy instruments are used here, and there are a number of producers.M.I.A. is relevant, interesting and makes you pay attention.Buy this album."
1,Worth the Buy You can't help but respect the creativity poring out of this album. This was M.I.A.'s debut & the reason why so many love her. I love this album & it hasn't left the car in weeks.
1,"Awesomely Different This is something my ears crave; uniqueness. This album has what you need to get loose. With it's wild beats and crazy lyrics, it'll keep you dancing (and in my case, running as well. Good workout music). M.I.A.'s music is not conventional. My guess is, most people either love it or hate it. Enjoy, it's a treat!1. Banana Skit2. Pull Up The People 8/103. Bucky Done Gun 10/10 (My fav. A true dance track. On point)4. Fire Fire 9/105. Freedom Skit6. Amazon 10/107. Bingo 6.5/108. Hombre 7.5/109. One For The Head Skit10. 10 $ 9/10 (The beat is sick! Robotic, lol)11. Sunshowers 10/10 (My 2nd fav. Gives me a real island vibe)12. Galang 9/10"
1,"Take this simple test If you can listen to this album - any track on this album - for more than 4 or at most 5 seconds and (1) stay still (2) keep it clean and PG13, my condolences to your family, alas, you are dead. You can expect to be receiving the memo shortly."
1,"Love It! Who is M.I.A. and what has she done to the art of music?! The London-raised Sri Lankan MC has mixed up all possible forms of music to give us something that we can't define. You can't put a label on her sound; you can only identify her inspiration. With a combination of Jamaican dance hall, hip-hop, electronica, Brazilian funk, and Asian bhangra, her style is different from anything we're used to; it's addictive and fun. Her lyrics are filled with passion about life and society. She gets political and sexual all in the same song! Who does that? Maya Arulpragasam does... just listen to Bucky Done Gun off her debut album Arular to get a feel of her artistic flair."
1,"Wha can I get for ten dollah? Anyting you want! Definitely spend a couple of bucks more & get this. Maya Arular is one of the few hip-hop sensations who deserves all the hype. Phrases like ""raw talent"" are often used, but what also impress are the musical sophistication and biting wit. This is a hugely appealing sex-war-and-lollipops album, and fears that non-British audiences ""won't get it"" seem to have been unfounded judging by the sales. Exuberant and bursting with energy."
1,"this girl can spit! i first heard the track bingo on the radio not long ago, and that has now opened a whole can of worms for me. how can one album be so catchy, raw, fun,fresh ,chunky and funky. while so many rappers drawl on about tired blah blah, MIA just mixes the singing and ragga-ish vocals straight into the most modern type of no-category music with little effort. the style? its kind of UK grime meets hip-hop meets calypso or something. definately a british vibe here, but this is still unique. the beats and sound effects are very well implemented into the chatting. cant stop listening to this. wicked stuff"
1,"His Best? Well it so hard to pick a favorite Kundrea book because they are all so Brilliant, but I might pick this one."
1,"The Three Ds I've read the poems within, and the depth of feeling within them is impressive. What's more, the honesty in the poems is a breath of fresh air that has brought a new perspective to a lot of the ways I see things, partcularly loss and betrayal, as well as hope. Reading this book, I feel as if I truly know the poet behind the words."
1,"A wish to time travel to 1880's Rockaway. Old Rockaway, New York in Early Photographs, exceeded my expectations! I thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the 1930's and 1940's. I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960's and 70's, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930's."
1,"Lyricist, singer, and more!!!!!!! Bernie is one of the best lyricists out there!!! His vocal performance on this cd and ""Tribe"" show that he is not just a lyric writer, but also someone who loves music. His passion for music has continued on to the formation of the band ""Farmdogs"".I have a question, however. The previous reviews state that this is either Bernie's second or third solo album. What were his first attempts?Please let me know at: Robin@moonsitter.comThank you!!!!"
1,"One great album! I bought this album because I got into bands like Theatre of Tragedy, Tristania, and The Gathering. Like someone else said, however, Nightwish is not doom/goth metal. Was I dissapointed?...no! This album is a masterpiece, pure metal all the way. Power metal with a female opera singer? I can't think of two things which go together any better. It is a wonder that it hasn't been done before. The songwriting is very good, and definitely laden with fantasy. The production is excellent as well. Then there is the amazing singer. I was captivated after hearing her for a mere ten seconds. Nightwish is one band that SHOULD NOT be overlooked!"
1,"The Greatest Band To Ever grace my ears Nightwish Rules! The Music is spine tingling and melodic while powerful. Everything I thought I knew About Music has changed forever. As a long Time fan of Savatage, and other prog-metal bands.. Nightwish has become my favorite. I can play their music over and over... I never thought I would enjoy Opera but her voice seems to be meant for it...like we never should have had to listen to it any other way. The world is full of tasteless crap like eminem, and god please can we forget the boybands and all the other put together mindless gatbage we are smacked with by local radio. NIGHTWISH Thank you for the wonderful barrage of sound you have given to me. I still love my other-prog metal bands but Nightwish has something for everyone who enjoys ""TRUE"" Music. Death to the false ones! LOL"
1,"The perfect formula still to be copied Nightwish works so near perfection! None of the other similar bands (Lacuna Coil, Sinergy, Stratovarius, Angra...) even approach this. No, Therion approaches. Many people tend to compare Nightwish to doom/goth metal bands such as Theatre Of Tragedy, Tristania and Sins Of Thy Beloved. Please, Nightwish is not doom/goth metal, it's clearly high level POWER METAL! Fast versatile guitar riffs, poignant ballads and above all, intense female vocals. Wishmaster's most touching moment is the gentle ""Two For Tragedy"", when Tarja's passionate lament reaches the soul of the listener. Other highlights are the fast ""Wanderlust"" and ""Crownless"". The last song, ""FantasMic"", is divided in three parts and is also very touching. Wishmaster and its predecessor Oceanborn are without a doubt essential albums for any metal listener..."
1,"Nightwish is unique and rocks for eva Moi to you all,Nightwish est vraiment le plus cool des bands. Unqiue pis des tounes supers orginales, ca ma faite dÃ©couvrir le mÃ©tal pis aucune autre band ma faite vribrer comme eux. Ã€ tous le monde cest un must buy."
1,"Why just 4 stars? Un album tout simplement renversant, extraordinaire, sensationnelle. Il est excellent sur toute la ligne avec une voix si bien cadrÃ©, si bien mis en evidence devenant la suite de se qu'ils avaient commencer avec Oceanborn, il revienne a la charge avec une disque presque aussi parfait. Un album tout comme le deuxieme, remplis de rebondissement, remplis de moment intense et de moment plus romantique avec Dead Boy's Poem qui est sans aucun doute la meilleur toute qu'ils ont faites. Souvent comparer a Dream Theater pour leur beat de piano, d'instrument progressif, ils ont sus selon moi allez une coche au dessus et nous offrir quelque chose d'encore superieur au membre de Dream Theater... En bref, il s'agit d'un CD dispendieux, mais combien il en vaut la peine, il est merveilleux et chaqu'un se doit de connaitre se magnifique groupe Allemand."
1,"Welch Allen Suretemp Plus 690 Thermometer Finally got fed up with all small digital thermometers, none of which seem to be reliable, or require a full 3-4 minutes to be accurate, which is an aggravating long time for the (OB) patient. I LOVE this ""machine"", it is accurate and well worth the expense !"
1,"Great thermometer, long-lasting We do home care for my dad and have to take his rectal temperature every 2 hours when we turn and re-position him. We have had the same Welch-Allyn Sure Temp 690 thermometer for 4 1/2 years now. We just replaced the well and probe a few months ago. The casing finally cracked after all of this time. We have only had to change the batteries twice, too. It is still working perfectly and we would recommend this thermometer to anyone who really needs to take temperatures often. It is so reliable. This one gets 5 stars!!!!!"
1,A Great Documentary this documentary tells you the relationship of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddle. and also tells how alice in wonderland was created. this was a very intersting documentary. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
1,"Beethoven, Motzart, Sanford Townsend Band ........ Thats how music history books should be written, it was 1977, I first heard this album on a verandah overlooking the Indian Ocean in Perth Western Australia on a hot breezy Saturday evening watching the sun setting over the whitetops ..... WOW, what a old flashback that is, party goin on inside, my Triumph under the balcony, I got up, grabbed the keys, and went for a blast, that song has been a permanant source of pleasure in my old head for decades now .... mist in your eyes from the smoke of a distant fire.... da da da da ada, sounds even better with the exhaust note of a 750 Bonnie ... da da da da"
1,The Witches' God by Janet and Stewart Farrar This is a really good book for people that are studying the gods. I truely enjoyed this book. It was very informative.
1,The best book on Pagan Gods All too often the Pagan God is forgotten in favor of the Goddess. This book will bring the balance back to our lives. It gives the history of many well know Gods as well as many not so well known Ones. It also includes rituals in direct relation to the Gods listed. I love this book! It goes well with The Witches' Goddess!
1,"Beautiful Submission What struck me the most all throughout the reading of ""Beauty and submission"" is the power and bravery behind Maria Pita's prose. She is undoubtedly a wise old soul. Yet, in the same instance, her no-holds-barred honesty about the lifestyle and personal odyssey with her beloved Dom has a youthful innocence that refreshes and renews like rain in the springtime. Love is new, and forever renewed, by each other. Life obstacles faced by most vanilla lovers face are present along with the countless obstacles any alternative lifestyle will bring. Every such mountain is a challenge scaled with intelligent and triumphant results. Missa's enormous heart, and huge capacity to love and submit to her man in the purest sense, will stay with me (and I'm sure all her readers) long after this book is closed. This real life romance makes fictional renditions pale in comparison."
1,"St. Rose of Lima: the First Canonized Saint in the Americas Excellent read, for children or for any age; also for adults who want to get to know Saint Rose of Lima."
1,"Wonderful app I love reading Essence magazine, I am happy I can now read it on my kindle fire. I recommend this"
1,"Delivered As Promised I LOVE Essence and I am quite pleased with the delivery and maintence by Amazon, I receive it like clockwork each month!"
1,Koontz is always good this book is very good as I have come to expect of Dean KoontzI've been reading his books as long as he has been writing them and am never disappointedI wish the 3rd book was coming sooner but i'll take it when I can get it
1,"Best yet! I have always been a fan of Dean Koontz's books and when my flight was grounded and I was to spend the night in the airport, I figured I'd better get myself a book to keep me entertained. That's exactly what this book did. I enjoyed reading it so much that I almost missed my connecting flight back home because I didn't want to put the book down.It's unique, fresh and fast paced. If you enjoyed the original Frankenstein story, you will adore this ""updated"" and more complete modern version. You will not be disappointed!"
1,"Not into monsters...unless Koontz is The Creator One has suggested the Decaulion character lacked depth. Another has hinted that the ending lacked surprise (must have been reading a different book). Remember two things: Koontz wrote it, and it's Book One. We will get into the mystery of the original ""monster"" (Decaulion) and we readers will find many surprises and twists as the story continues to unfold.That being said, I loooooved this book. This is a fun, intriguing look at the evil Doc Frankenstein, who was certainly a monster before chopping his own body up to become yet more so. Dr. F., impervious to aging and disease after 200 years, has been a busy bee, building and perfecting more monsters. But things are starting to go terribly wrong for New Orleans and for the Doctor we love to hate.Read it, you'll love it."
1,"Koontz is getting even better over time. This is a wonderful twist on the classic. The characters are very well rounded and I was grabbed from the beginning. I now and then ponder how the biologically impossible events in the book could actually be brewing in someones own lab at this very moment. Mr. Koontz takes today's traditional underdog and makes him not someone to pity but someone to perhaps admire. My only negative on the book is that I am hooked and will make sure I quickly purchase the next in the series.If you like seeing the dark side of life let in a little light, you will undoubtedly become a Koontz addict as have I. Don't plan on doing anything else until you finish this one.I also highly recommend THE FACE. Another dark side trying to usurp the light. Excellent, excellent, excellent books."
1,"Koontz's BEST book I have to admitt that I am not as big a book reader as I used to be. However, when I saw this book in the store I couldn't resist.The idea of making a remake of the classic book was exciting and possibly to like the original. Let me tell you upfront that this book was GREAT!!!! It is the fastest I've ever read a book (4 days); I could not put it down. This book is very direct in the plot, and easy to follow the chapter changes. Koontz writes the characters in a way that you can truely understand exactly what they're feeling, and you can sympathize with even the dubious villians. I hope you take the time to read this book, IT IS WORTH IT!!!!!!!PS- The next part to this book is set to be released in July 2005 :)"
1,"Dean Koontz's Frankenstein I have loved Dean Koontz for years but his books of late have gotten away from the reason I fell in love with his stories... All I can say is HE'S BACK! I can't wait for the 2nd book!! I could not put this down,it made me breathless the whole way through!"
1,"Forget Mary Shelly Well actually, no. Of course not. Nothing can top the original. But Koontz comes at this classic tale with his own scythe ready to cause a change of faith in the fans of the original. This is not so much a remake as a supplement to the classic tale. Koontz references the story we all now and simply fast-forwards to our time, keeping the original Victor and his monster, and giving them longevity.The prose is ellegant and the speed is neck-breaking. It appears that Mr. Koontz uses 'big' words and paints detailed scenarios that may intimidate some readers, but I challenge you to read his work out loud - you'll see how nicely the words roll off your tongue."
1,A better Dean Koontz I've always liked Dean Koontz. This one however is different from his others. It is still a fast read; I found hard to put down. I have already ordered the second and have started on it. This is one saga I won't want to end.
1,book This is a gift for Christmas. I'm sure they will enjoy it. Had a hard time finding these books. Thanks
1,"Great Camcorder Excellent camcorder, does very well in all kinds of light. I have had no trouble with it indoors, and I find that it performs very well in low light. Flawlessly performs with Windows Movie Maker 2 through firewire. The sound is outstanding, considering the picture is it's strong point. I did not need the digital camera built in as I already have one. Effects are fun to play around with, especially with the handy scroll button. I have not heard the motor noise at all, so I can't see where that is coming from. My only complaint is that it shuts off too quickly if inactive, but it's really not that much of a problem. Image stablizer works really well, as I often have an unsteady hand but it is hardly noticeable with this camcorder. I just wish they made a VCR that could record the footage as well as it was taped!"
1,"Great Music, and A Lot of It, At A Great Price This disc contains Ornette Coleman's pioneering 37-minute 'Free Jazz' PLUS 40 minutes of shorter pieces recorded in the same year. So for a little less money than the American release of 'Free Jazz' you get about twice as much music, and the title track is the final piece, a fitting climax to a great set of music. That said, the jazz on this disc may be more challenging than some listeners would like, but among the extended collective improvisations of the sixties, besides being the first, this one is more immediately accessible, because it SWINGS and it COOKS! And you can tell the musicians are actively listening to each other and responding to each other's work, not just showing off or venting their emotions. So in a nutshell, 'Free Jazz' is less cosmic than Sun Ra's 'Magic City', less cerebral than Cecil Taylor, and less primal than Coltrane's 'Ascension', but probably more likely to hook you into an intensely brilliant musical world."
1,"Different isn't always good--sometimes it's better I'm a commercial pilot and flight instructor. I read many aviation related books and magazines. I don't often read books that contain a lot of poetry, which AIR FARE does.(It also has short stories and excerpts from longer works.) So to say I was pleasantly surprised by this little wonder of a book is an understatement.My advice? If you've never flown but wonder what it's like, you should read this book. If you have flown as a passenger, you'll recognize your own emotions, both good and bad, in every page. If you are a pilot, you'll see yourself reflected in myriad indelible images; you'll be drawn back by memory to a hundred different experiences; and you'll want to read-and reread-each and every privileged glimpse into the human heart of flight, and be left wanting more. It's a must-have for any aviator's library. Get it!"
1,"Give a copy to your teenage children! Read this book as soon as possible. It is so jam filled (malaprop intended) with wisdom and knowledge and so well written with passion and power. Give a copy to each of your teenage children, nieces and nephews! They need this stuff at as young an age as possible.And once you've read it, you must readYour Own Worst Enemy: Breaking the Habit of Adult Underachievementwhich gets down to the nitty gritty of breaking the bad habits that gifted people edge into because of their own gifted pride."
1,A fine novel about a forgotten time Houston exaggerates for effect--not all of the historical characters that he uses were actually at Bisbee. But how could anyone resist using the bigger-than-life leaders of the IWW?
1,Works Great! The shorter length of this rod is exactly what we needed for our shower. Tension rods in this length are difficult to find and we were glad to buy this one. Great product.
1,Recommend for young musicians This is a great book for young musicians for inspiration. It tells a brief story in an easy to read format for each musician for a variety of instruments. Good for those who have the potential to go professional.
1,"Delightful - Magic and Romance Ghosts, Time Travel, Fairies, Magic and Scotland figure in this delightful story. I liked it. I had one little wish -- I got a bit confused with the love scenes - wish they were a little more detailed and longer."
1,"Sensiblity and jarana. The fisrt time I fist met Son de Madera on a live show in the city of Oaxaca, Mex. It's a very talented group, originary from the state of Veracruz, they made a ""rescue"" of the original Jarochan Son, Laura's voice its one of the best of Jarochan Son. their music leads you to tropical and apassionated world of the mexican jarochan soul.La primera vez que conoci a Son de Madera fue en una presentaciÃ³n en cico enla ciudad de Oaxaca, mex. Son un grupo talentoso originario del estado de Veracruz. Ellos hicieron un ""rescate"" del son jarocho original. La voz de laura es una de las mejores del Son Jarocho. Su m'sica te conduce al tropical y apasionado mundo del alma Jarocha de MÃ©xico."
1,Spiritual Fitness An inspiring read which has the potential to change your life providing you actively apply the principles.
1,"enough with the exclamation points already! mr. galsworhy may have written a fine solid substantial novel, byt by heaven mr. anthony trollope who lived and wrote over fifty years before was a much more modern writer and didn't qualify every goddam sentence with an exclamation mark. (!) very dated stuff. who knows, maybe one day i'll get past all those damn exclamation marks."
1,"High Quality One of my favorite gifts I have gotten! These are exquisite and top quality glasses! I remember my Great Grandma had these in the Fire King/Anchor ""Coronation"" that is what attracted me to them. They are so beautiful and would work for any function. I plan on having them for a long time since they are such good quality. You cannot go wrong with this reproduction!!! Especially if you are into Cottage or Shabby Chic home decor. Go for it you wont be dissapointed!"
1,Excellent Excellent karaoke CD. We love it and the music of Abba just makes us happy! Recommend highly - nice collection of songs.
1,Great cable I was able to plug this cable into my video camera and download my videos in HD. This allowed me to see my videos in true HD and not just SD.
1,video cable Easy way to get video from a digital video camera to your computer. You will need a special port on your computer to use this.
1,"BEST TROMA SO FAR I thought troma was dead. i did'nt really like tromeo and juilet and i never saw terror firmer. well, as soon as i thought troma was dead the toxic avenger 4 proved me wrong ( and i am very happy about that!). Any way this movie is awsome it is sooooooo gory and has a lot of funny parts, like the retarted rebel, the ""duck"" scene, and the scene where the original melvin makes an appearence!!!!!! It is also very gory and has a head running over scene that gives the one from the first movie a run for it's money. also the scene where toxie kills all of these nazi cops....i also give loyd kaufman cridet for sticking his neck out and making fun of abortion, raceism and others.TROMA LIVES!!!!"
1,"Great Value Used this saw to cut 3/8 inch granit tile and it worked better than i anticipated. Had no leaks as others indicated..some mess, yes, but not unusual with tile cutting. The diamond blade lasted throughout the kitchen project but did show signs of wear towards the end. . Certainly a great value!!!"
1,"GREAT for my rosacea I have bought this and also the extra strength. I bought the regular then realize it came in extra strength. I alternate using them and they seem to work the same. This product has taken away 95% of my redness and flaking due to my rosacea. I have really tried everything and nothing worked in the past. Even my skin Dr suggested things and nothing worked. I saw this on a show on NBC and thought I would give it a try and so glad I did. I use it everyday. I am unsure why the price is so much lower on Amazon vs buying it directly from the Dr Gross website, seems odd to me."
1,"excellent product This skincare product has saved my 50+ year old complexion. It's like having a facial every day. Great for anybody, any skintype, even teenagers. Worth the money. Leaves the skin w/ a ""just right"" texture: not dry, not greasy. You can apply make-up right after using the pads."
1,SO Expensive BUT... Great product! I have used many a skin care product and this was by far the best one. But because its so expensive i have to buy it sparingly. (Im not a high roller) I have ordered this product twice in the last year and it works right away. The problem is you really have to use them all in 30 days or the pads will dry up on you. This is dissapointing since i really dont need to use them everyday. Nonetheless this product works...if i had the money i would keep a ready supply in my cabinet.
1,They fit Perfect.... I think that they are both nice voiced and this Cd is a great combination. A relaxive song with nice music. The only bad thing is that there is only 1 song including in this Cd. Anyway this is great Cd to buy...
1,"""When you believe"" This song, sung by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey is GREAT! Sometimes, it leaves tears in my eyes. But, the song has some contrasts. Whitney Houston has one of the most beautiful voices in the universe. So when she sings the first verse and chorus, and then Mariah Carey starts to sing the second verse... it's a HUGE CONTRAST! Mariah screeches... If Celine Dion, who has the most wonderfully beautiful voice in the universe, had sung it with Whitney Houston, the song would've been irresistible. It would have been so unexplainable beautiful. Anyway, great job, Mariah and Whitney!"
1,great book this is a great book. it was written well and read more like a story and not a manual the information although somewhat dated was great to read about and made me think about how a woodsman would have lived in the early 1900s
1,"Magic Malamud Malamud does three or four tricks in his fiction well, and here he does each one to utter perfection. And when taken together, this collection of stories almost transcends Malamud's normal limits: the stories are compressed, short, and below the surface, charged with almost unbearable tension. Unlike other collections of stories (or when you read too many Malamud stories) Malamud does not parody himself in the Magic Barrell. Everything is where it is supposed to be, and works like a well oiled machine. It is a shame that (as of writing this) only eight people have reviewed this masterpiece of a short story collection. In Roth's The Ghost Writer, Zuckerman explains that the world's morality has already passed by the E.I. Lonoff's (a character based on Malamud). Seems Roth was correct... and this is true even more today, thirty years after the publication of The Ghost Writer. We no longer live in Malamud's world, and it is a shame."
1,"The first excellent book ever written about Heinlein Finally, somebody has written a truly useful book about that most important of American science fiction authors, Robert A. Heinlein. In the past, sloppy criticism and the grinding of personal axes have ruined every single attempt to produce a book discussing Heinlein's works (I have the misfortune of having read them all). Gifford has produced what has to be the groundwork for all future studies of Heinlein: a basic categorization and numbering of every single published and unpublished work in the canon, along with the insiders' story on each entry. Readable from cover to cover, or as a reference work, Gifford has also performed the one invaluable goal of every reader's companion: he's sent me back to rereading the original works, but with fresh perspectives and insights. A perfect score, after twenty years of utter failures in Heinlein scholarship. Bravo!"
1,"An intelligent, broad-ranging book James Gifford has given us a book immense in its scope, detailing the works of one of Science Fiction's Grand Master, and one of the genre's most prolific authors.The format is very reader-friendly. The individual entries for each work are fascinating for any Heinlein lover, and the bibliography and opus list will prove invaluable to new readers who wish to delve into Heinlein's universe. Truly a landmark achievement in research and clarity."
1,"great goggles These are the best goggles we have ever tried. They fit well, do not fog up and have a good seal. No rashes from the material. The instructions for replacing the clear lenses with optic lenses are rubbish but once you pop the plastic frame off, the rest is very easy. Ignore the packet instructions and just follow your instincts!"
1,"Wonderfrul Creatures No one describes a creature like Alan Dean Foster! Hands down, the very best. His silverslith sent shivers down my arms. I've read it many times, and I even use it to teach my students how to write a descriptive paragraph. His mind knows no bounds when inventing animals, plants, and humans. Probably my favorite fantasy book of all times (though Mid-Flinx) comes in a close second."
1,"You'll read this one again and again. This book, like Heinlein's Starship Troopers, is a book I keep reading again and again over the years, and for similar reasons. As previous reviewers have stated, this book is quite compact, yet rich and complete, and operates on several levels. It's the description of a fascinating world. It's an adventure story. It's a character study. It's a parable. The concept is intriguing, and the characters are multi-faceted. It's a compact classic, and until today I hadn't realized that Midworld had shown up in any other books. Those books (all of them) are going on my Amazon Wish List today.Read this book, and read Starship Troopers. Both are SO much more than bugs-in-space. They're worth far more time than they actually take to read."
1,"Wonderful world I first read this book as a teenager, many, many years ago, and I still dig it out of my bookshelf every other year to re-immerse myself in Foster's wildly imaginative world. He has such a great talent for inventing intriguing flora and fauna!Only two little flaws come to mind:1. Midworld seems a little too lethal for any colony to survive long enough to discover the Home Trees and make use of them.2. In Mid-Flinx, the author describes fire-extinguishing flora. They apparently don't exist in Midworld because if they did, the corporation couldn't have built their R&D; complex."
1,"Treat yourself & buy it! I'd have to agree with M-Speedy, this album is great! If you enjoy Cyndi Boste this second album won't disappoint."
1,"My issue isn't with the work of fiction I love the story of Tess. Considering many of the classics I have ever read, I think Tess is one of the easier ones to understand. The work itself is a masterful story. However, I take issue with Penguin's version. The Notes are just awful- referencing back and forth from your place in the book to the back is a nightmare and many times isn't worth breaking your flow. Some of the Notes are helpful and even necessary to understand the sentence, but others are pointless and annoying. I recommend a different version, either without notes entirely or with more reasonable ones."
1,"Just so tragic! I can't believe how tragic this book is! I picked up this book with an unexpected decision. The book I was supposed to read was Queen of the Damned, but then I saw this book and the cover appealed to me. So I decided I'll read it. At first it was kinda boring, until the last 1/3 of the book, I was so depressed by it...how fate was toying with them, and how their characteristic had decided their fate............Anywayz, this is truly a wonderful book, either by plot, writing, background, history, religion, describtion, etc etc, it's all with perfection. Read it, even though the beginning part might be kinda boring, it's for you to understand it better.I'd recommend this book to anybody, and if you like tragedies, you definitely *have* to read it!!"
1,"Deliberately frustrating, occasionally profound, great read. About fifteen years ago, this book was almost universally considered Hardy's great masterpiece. However, times have changed and its relevance is not as immediate as that of Hardy's last novel, Jude the Obscure. Still, the message of this book is far from foreign. Hardy's gift for creating sympathetic characters seems infinite in magnitude. His prose is unique and at times more harrowing in tone than Conrad's. This book would be a great introduction to the work of one of the great masters of English Literature."
1,"Time Well Spent For those beginning to read the classics this one is a great hook. While the characters are complex the story is linear and the allusions are simple enough to follow. One can't help but hope Tess's life will somehow turn out right although knowing it will not. The burdens she encounters seem to do little to stop her from moving forward. Life seems so unfair to her, but Hardy handles her masterfully; indeed it is safe to say Hardy loves her more than God does."
1,"A classic frustration... Not a frustration in the negative sense, but in fact, this was a book which I could hardly put down. The fact that I felt compelled to express my thoughts here perhaps point to it's even greater impact on me. A fabulous story, and of course, tragic in the end... And why do I feel frustrated? Perhaps merely for the fact of Tess ' rash action, almost one of self defence, which closes her tragic life. And the want or need for the story to extend beyond the final close to see her defence succeed and her life prevail. However, these are not the modern times, and the chasm seems wide. Tess is a beautiful person - innocent and with only the intention of good - and suffers as a result. While not a ground breaking novel, it's eloquence and true to life appeal allows it to become part of you. I can only highly recommed this book and will read it again and again..."
1,"A classic that isn't boring or dull, actually fun to read!!! This was a very chilling and creepy book to read, I highly enjoyed it and recommended it. It came as such a great surprise that this book, written decades ago, is comparabely as scary as Stephen King novels, but more wicked (and rather a bit more difficult of a task to read).Through circumstances and the evil of others, the young just prior nymph Tess Durverfield, suffers a series of tragedies. A victim of innocence, youth, beauty, and love. THIS WAS GREAT!"
1,"Mechanical Female Tess is a very difficult book and I would not recommend it to the average old contemporary reader. There is so much more meaning behind the birth of the rapist's child, and the break-up of Tess and her ""husband"" Angel. You have to read the fine-lines and ""footnotes"". In other words, there is absolutely no way you could relate to this book, and anyways...why would you want to relate to books? The experiences Tess goes throught at such an early age has scarred her for life. Well, she doesn't live much of a life now that you think about it."
1,"MOST WORTHY CLASSIC NOVEL As the synoposis says: Violated by one man, forsaken by another, Tess Durbeyfield is a magnificent and spirited heroine of Thomas Hardy's immortal work.Written in a no-nonsense yet frilly female tone, Tess of the Durbervilles is just as comarible to ADAM BEDE, both are beloved and my most honored classics every. I enthusiastically recommend the two, these are the books that deserve to be called CLASSICS."
1,"Alec or Angel? False Morality Exposed through one Woman's Innocence ""I became acquainted with Thomas Hardy through another of his classic works, which lent to my curiosity on this one when the audio version was made available to me. It was an experience, to the say the least, hearing how the innocent life of this girl of late 19th century England played out. For no reason other than her own naivetÃ© is she rendered with injustice and prejudicial attitudes of the day - Hardy's denouncement of his own country's false morals. In my view, all males of our current day and age should find this impressive work required reading, and then determine whether they are an Alec D'urberville or an Angel Clare. It seems we all fall into one category or the other."""
1,Excellent I put this book on my ipod and then thought I'd like to be able to read it when I couldn't listen. I have a kindle and kindle fire. It went to both Kindles! Yea! Now I have the book all places so how ever I want to read it I can!! Amazon makes it all happen like magic.
1,"One of the best Victorian literature ever... Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best books I have ever set my eyes upon. I have tried to finish the book in one sitting but found out that I can't because there is just so many things to figure out in the story. No doubt, fate plays such an important role in the life of Tess Durbeyfield and it is due to her noble descent that spawns the events leading to her own demise. The ending of the story is somewhat disturbing. Should we feel happy that Angel fufiled Tess's wish or should we feel sad for Tess?"
1,"I recommend this I thoroughly enjoyed Tess, even though it left me raging and gnashing my teeth at times. No picture of Victorian life can be complete without reading this book first."
1,"Great product Great product, works as advertised. It might be a bit to heavy for me (a woman) to manage alone but I'm not sure light product would be as sturdy and secure.We are able to fit out 4 bikes on it all right. Despite some reviews saying you can't put a kids bike on it - well, we hauled our little one's 14-incher with training wheels together with three bigger bikes, no problems. No additional bars for our bikes, no safety issues, recommend."
1,"Big & heavy but great We have four bikes in our family and needed stronger rack to carry them. This is perfect for four bikes. It takes a little practice to figure out which bike goes on in which order. It is pretty easy to adjust as necessary. It is very heavy and therefore a little difficult to take on and off, but a little assistance is all you need. The locking pin does not ""lock"" in it only screws in, so for security you may need to purchase a locking pin with a key. Do not try to use this without a 2"" hitch, it is so heavy it wobbles and does not look very secure on the back of the car. The clamps that lock the bike hold them in place and do not allow them to move but they do mark up the bikes. I just use a small washcloth to protect the bike frame. For the price, this is a great rack."
1,"Perfect!!! I did alot of research before I made my purchase. For a 4-bike rack, this was the best price and quality. It is a little hard to put together because the instructions are not very detailed at all. Took my husband about 45 minutes to put it together. It is a little heavy but it is extremely sturdy. I wouldnt trust a cheap wobbly rack for my bikes. I read reviews that said it was too complicating so I was nervous when I decided to purchase despite those reviews, but other than the assembly,it is not complicating at all. It fits all types of bikes with no problem. It is perfect and I love it!!"
1,Light and easy to use The Swagman XTC-4 Cross-Country Hitch Mount Rack is lighter than other bike racks and is easy to attach to vehicle. The attachments are easy to move and adjust to each bike that is put on it. Will be enjoying using this product for a long time. Seems to be very durable.
1,"Solid Rack A little heavy, but a good solid rack. Its great for any size bike or tires! No problems what so ever! I'd recommend it to anyone but the weak!!!"
1,"OUTSTANDING! The View From the Hill was one of the most exciting books I have read in a long time. It's a touching almost love story, an with exciting battle over Sterling Castle. This is a great book for not only the historical accuracy, but also for the story behind the action. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
1,"Best Disposable Nipples I love these nipples. I've ordered so many of these because my son will only use this nipple. We have tried the Medela nipples and every other type imagineable that will fit on our Medela bottles, but this is the only one he would use. It's a slow flow which is perfect for him. We will be buying more before we head to Cancun so we can use with the Similac Ready to Feed bottles."
1,"A Great Read About Japan! I remember before I left for my first trip to Japan in 1996, reading about Feiler and his adventures in an Onsen hot springs. I remember his description of having to take of all his clothes and bathe in front of all these Japanese guys he just met. Any yet, during my trip in 1996 the same thing happened to me! I felt just like Feiler! The book is informative about Japanese culture and at the same time a great read. Its a must read if you plan to visit Japan...especially if you are a teacher."
1,"Best Book This is the best book I have read by or about foreigners living in Japan. The author has moved to Japan to teach English in a typical small town school. Quite a wide variety of situations and scenes in Japanese daily life are covered from an outsider's perspective. His interactions with the school's principal, district administrators, teachers, the students and their parents are well written in a descriptive and anecdotal way. Mr Feiler is not just a good storyteller but is a very insightful writer as well. I immediately reread the book and enjoyed the second reading even more than the first."
1,"A book on Japanese culture... This book by Bruce Feiler is not just about the Japanese educational system but about the Japanese themselves. While it does touch on how students and teachers work together, teen suicide and cram school, it also deals with the problems of racism, the way the Japanese balance their lives and their duties to society, and even a few chapters on Japanese dating and marriage. It is full of humor, insight and clear thinking. Mr. Feiler clearly but a lot of thought into his visit and is just as clear in explaining to us what he feels is the important and major issues that Japan has to deal with - not just then but now and in the future. A must for any library on Asia or Japan."
1,"Classic When I heard they were making a file of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, I thought, ""good luck!"". The main gist of the book is philosophical, a hard quality to translate on film. But Kaufman does it here, with the help of Daniel Day-Lewis - and manages to improve upon the book, adding color, humor, and a profound sense if intimacy. A touching and beautifully done love story."
1,"An investigation into the nature of relationships Why do we commit to one another? Do we really know? Would a life of independence and detachment be better? Both analytical and powerfully moving, this movie deals with these questions. At first seeming light and slightly intellectual, the movie evolves into something more felt than thought. The film shows what is going on without telling the viewer in words. This is a story about the nature of love in all its human forms. It is a heavy story that stays with you. Not for those not in touch with their inner self or who object to some tasteful nudity."
1,"Timeless This film is by far one of the best ever produced: It`s erotic, humoures, sad, poetic and the protagonists are all interesting. Now, this is why many Europeans critizise American films.... They feel most productions from the US are stereotyped, all glam and over the top, while the European productions tend to move more straightforward into our human soul.... This film is one of those glorious occasions when film is high art and linked to the freespirited human soul."
1,"Unique: Abstracting to connect I've seen nothing like it. The supreme and rich acting of Binoche and the abstract cinematography and direction manage to distance the viewers in such a way from the everyday noise of a thousand feelings, enabling the viewers to taste and sense all the emotion and ideas of the characters and the era with a vividness only accesible in dreams."
1,"The best film nobody saw The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a masterpiece, the most underrated American film of the past 30 years. Poetic, haunting, subtle, and terribly sad, it says more about the crushing impact of repressive (i.e. communist) regimes than a thousand documanteries or inflammatory speeches could tell. While idealizing the free-wheeling Prague of the late 60's the film also examines the emptiness of such a non-commital lifestyle- the unbearable lightness. If this all sounds very somber, ULOB is also one of the sexiest films you will ever see, and one of the few intelligent studies of sex in cinema. More surprisingly, it is a heartbreaking romance. Like a great novel, ULOB grows on you, and you'll hate to see the characters leave you at the end. Perfectly acted by its then unknown leads, and beautifully photographed, this is a film to grow old with."
1,"A literate, moving film I served in the Peace Corps in E. Europe in the early 1990s; this movie conforms to my experience of Prague, the Czech people, and E. European literature so completely as to take my breath away. Creating a full movie out of the first 26 pages of Milan Kundera's original novel is scriptwriting brilliance. The film's breadth and depth of each character, the larger-than-life issues played out against the seeming frivolity of the Prague Spring--and its tragic historic aftermath--never fail to impress me. This film has a very European sentiment regarding sexuality/sensuality, however; it is as woven into the fabric of daily life as a glass of fine wine. If you prefer more staid fare, I'd recommend many excellent British films."
1,"This product saved my marriage! Just kidding. It's no fruit juicer, but it made my wife happy and works well. Nice size for an apartment and when combined with a rotary cutter, my wife found that cutting fabric was a delight as opposed to working with scissors, or the katana/stump combination I bought her for the job before I bit the bullet and bought her this mat. Once you get one, you'll wonder how you ever survived without this...and you'll keep your katanas sharp and ready for impending samurai attack. Or zombies."
1,"A fabulous LITTLE kitchen -- Love it We purchased this for our daughter for her first birthday. She loves it & plays with it constantly. It is great quality and fun colors & also comes with great accessories. It is very small (perfect for her size), but note this if you are buying it for an older toddler."
1,"Very Fast for Size! I now own 3 of them 512, 1G, 2G, write to it is 6MB/sec read is about 13MB/sec for it size the best you will find. I use it with RoboForm and BART-PE Boot OS, so it stays pluged in for long periods at a time and its size and round back make it the safest USB to leave in a laptop as you use it and move around and won't get knocked out or damage your USB port due to torque. I hope they never discontinue this model. A must have for the moble person on the move.Phil"
1,Simple solution that works great! We installed these on the switches for the exhaust fans in our two bathrooms and the closet light in our daughter's room. They work great. They don't need batteries -- the low-tech spring does the job. They save energy because you can't leave for the day and leave the fan going all day long.
1,Fits in my switch boxes... Our home was built in 2003 and this fits just fine in the outlet/switch box. It does exactly what it's supposed to. We set it for 10 minutes after we're done and it shuts the exhaust fan off in our bathroom.Saves money on heat and cooling...
1,"excellent book An amazing book. Personal life stories that all of us can relate to. Attempts to answer the question""why me?"" that we tend to ask in adverse times.Inspirational and uplifting."
1,"Awesome images. I love this book. Honestly, I haven't read it. I've only stared at the images and drawn the dragons from the book. I LOVE drawing them.Perhaps I should read it some time too!"
1,For use in the Foreign Language Curriculum Excellent book for staff development within the Foreign Language department. Includes tools for evaluating both student and instructor performance with guidance on how to improve those scores.
1,"ISS Research Creatine. Good Product I HAVE SEEN ENERGY AT THE GYM, EVEN WHEN I RAN. NOT SURE IF IT'S FROM THE CREATINE BUT I KNOW ISS RESEARCH MAKES GOOD STUFF BECAUSE FIRST TIME I USE THE GLUTAMINE THAT STUFF WORKED REALLY GOOD.THEY'RE NOT FLASHY ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT; DON'T ADD CRAZY FLAVORS AND WHAT NOT, BUT THEY DO MAKE GOOD PRODUCTS.

1,"EXPERIENCE A NEW AGE. Shutters come down, safety inside, exile at home, this is more than just the best CD in the world.... This is the beginning of a new music age."
1,"Extremely rare type of pleasant ""art"" music from these ages. I first heard a track on the tv while I was doing something else. In a program reviewing new music. I was astonished. It didn't sound at all as all the other worthless types of modern pop. The first parallell I made was to the ""old"" 10cc. But of course, anyone who knows about Beach Boys, Brian Wilson and the ""Pet Sounds"" album would rather like to refer to those. I will go and buy at least two of the albums."
1,"Correction in my previous review It's actually ""Hoops Hooley"" that sounds straight off the Beach Boys ""Pet Sounds"" album. I love this stuff. Get it!"
1,"Less cold...more bouncy Wow! With ""Snowbug"", a return trip to ""Hawaii"", Sean O'Hagan and friends have created their most accessible CD yet. While retaining the Wilsonesque arrangements for the most part, the vocal aspects of the production have been honed to a more refined level, thanks in part to the inclusion of more female background vocals. Gone are the avant-garde electronic-bloop excursions of ""Cold and Bouncy"". The new direction on this CD is the incorporation of Brazilian influences into the already exotic High Llamas cocktail. These developments in the band's sound gives ""Snowbug"" a warmer overall feel than any of their previous efforts. I don't see how any critics could argue the true excellence of this collection of songs, though many have pointed to the Llamas too-strong Beach Boys influence in the past. It is unassailable in it's musical genius, a beautiful work of art."
1,"The book that initiated my addiction to beat As a Californian, frequenter of the Sierra Nevadas, as well as a college student who obsesses over fine American Literature, I found this work to be perhaps the most well written piece of beat fiction i've read. Contrary to popular belief, I feel this is a much more mature and insightful piece than ""On the Road"" (not to take anything from the brilliance of Kerouac's breakthrough work) and should be held in reverence by literature and philosophy enthusiasts across the globe. Japhy Ryder's Buddha representation, as well as Kerouac's struggle to incorporate his new discovery of traditional buddhism with his original Catholic upbringing are representative of the Western Frontier of Eastern Thought, which is becoming more popular even today, thanks to the likes of Jack Kerouac. Bravo!"
1,Favorite Liked this more than On the Road. Has a completely different feel. One of my favorite reads.
1,VIVA RUCKSACK REVOLUCION! Cracker Jack's got quite a nack at righting these shindigs about the bums in rucksacks. Dharma Bums gives you a glimpse into the life of the Beats with a focus on their cut of Zen. This really is a great story and it will inspire you. On a side note I recommend trying to find the original edition; the old pages really smell a lot better.
1,"kerouac's best This is the book that lured me into the world of kerouac. I had previously read ""On the Road,"" which was excellent, but I feel no match for ""the Dharma Bums."" This book changed my life. It changed the way that i thought. Kerouac introduces the reader to his experiences and beliefs through his novels; they are mostly semi-autobiographical. Before this novel consumed me, i had no notion of Buddhism. In retrospect this has been the single most influential thing that I have been exposed to. This book is just a starting point for a Kerouac fan. I recommend that you follow this book with Kerouac's ""Desolation Angels."" Simple, and yet so satisfying literature. I have not really encountered any other writers who are so beloved, so beautiful and poetic in few and simple jazz talk and random amusing European literary name dropping. Pick this one up, maybe it will change your life too!"
1,"Kerouac's finest, most blissful novel...you MUST read it! Yes, ""On The Road"" gets all the attention, but this follow-up work is by far his most gorgeous and uplifting...from sleeping on the beach to climbing a mountain, to the flowering of his Buddhist consciousness, Jack really takes the reader with him. Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. ""Dharma Bums"" soars as high as ""Big Sur"" dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors."
1,"Five Rule! Five are definetly the world's greatest boy band. Even though they split up, they are still awesome.""Let's Dance"" is a very poppy song, and definetly makes me want to dance as the title suggests. The extra track ""Sometimes"" is awesome and the remix is pretty good. The Megamix rules and overall ""Let's Dance"" is a good single to buy.I recommend it to any people who like dance music, pop music or anything catchy. Also, if you're a huge Five fan, this is a must to buy. A definete 5 star."
1,"Probably the best movie of the year I don't understand why people didn't like Revenge of the Fallen. I thought that was great. I thought that the first Transformers the best... Until I saw Dark of the Moon. Dark of the Moon was just a perfect movie. It had comedy, suspense, and (Most importantly) action. Some of these action sequences were just great. And there were some white knuckling sequences that you HAVE to be prepared for. And Shia LaBoef was just great with the new actress. She was better than Megan Fox. In more than one way if you know what I mean =) But altogether, this was an A+ in my book. So dissapointed that it's the final one. Michael Bay, this was your MASTERPIECE!"
1,"Transformers Excellent sequel and follow-up to the first movie. I think I still like the first one better but, either way I definitely enjoyed it. ;-)"
1,I love this series! I like the new love interest in this movie a lot. Also this is a great extension of the last two movies. i can't wait for a 4th to come out.
1,"Good I was very satisfied the product and the speed I received it I would do business with them again, I was very satisfied"
1,"More than made up for Revenge of the Fallen!!! DOTM made it easy to forget 2009's ROTF. The ""plot"" was much improved, possibly because there was only ONE writer this time. Some of the best action sequences I have ever seen were in this movie. A great way to end the series, as well. If they made any more, I would hope it would be the military and Autobots working together to hunt down Decepticons, similar to how ROTF started out.Please take my advice: how good a movie is has nothing to do with the studio wanting to get consumers to buy the movie twice. If you disagree, then spam the studio with correspondence rather than deduct stars from your review.Try it this way next time: ""DOTM was a fantastic action film, but I am disappointed the Blu-Ray release hardly has any extras. Otherwise, 5 STARS!!!!"""
1,loved it loved the movie more than the television series from the 80's.......my boys loved it so much they were characters from the movie for Halloween....my 3 year old loves cars more than ever after seeing this
1,Was a gift for my daughter She loved it when she opened it on her birthday. Now I want to watch it lol. It looks exciting.
1,"Watching it on my PS3... Great Quality! no problems at all playing it on my PS3. Not a fan of buying Collector's edition, price is great."
1,luv it Must i say more it a f****in good movie me and the kids love it.. If you dont have it ur late
1,"Awesome Action Movie!! This movie is a great movie for those of you seeking for action. It's simple, fun, and it's full of action. If you're into movies with a deep meaning, this isn't it for you, but for those of you that just love action like me, it'll be awesome! Blu-ray definitely makes this movie pop out and you'll love it if you have a huge awesome HDTV."
1,fabuloso mil gracias por el producto fabuloso recomiendo a este vendedor todo llego en perfectas condiciones excelentesaludos espero seguir contando con ustedes
1,"Great movie Like all the other Transformer movies just great, one you can play over and over and never get sick of seeing it."
1,"Love Transformers I really liked this movie. I own the first two on DVD and despite what a lot of people think of Michael Bay's movies, I took this for what it was: a fun movie bringing an iconic childhood toy to life. I grew up watching the cartoons and was really excited when I heard there were going to be live action movies. Now I did enjoy this movie more than the second one, not that I hated Revenge of the Fallen. I loved the action sequences and the special effects. I admit I watch them more for the actual Transformers than the human actors. I didn't care for Patrick Dempsey's character. I don't watch Grey's Anatomy so I have no attachment to him as an actor and I really didn't like Rosie Huntington-Whitley. Sorry, but she shouldn't quit her day job. Acting just isn't her thing. Other than that, I loved the movie. I'm waiting until the collector's edition is released later this year. I have to have my special features."
1,I enjoy these movies I've enjoyed all of these movies. Growing up with the Transformers I was very excited when the first one came out. This Blu-Ray looks great and the digital copy is great for when I travel.
1,Transformers This item worked as advertised and excellent customer service. I would do business again in the future with this vendor.
1,More than meets the eye Transformers: Dark of the Moon is an excellent movie. The adaptation of the animated series into a cinematic format has been completed with great effect. The storyline is also imaginatively and creatively thought-out.
1,kicks ass this is a must-own bluray. looks killer and sounds incredible. definitely a great way to show off your system and the story resonates with our current economic and political problems when it feels like evil has already won.
1,"What can i say, its Transformer!!! Just wondering when they are coming out with the next movie hehe. Of the 3 in this trilogy, this is my son's favorite."
1,Optimus Prime have all of them now..was a good movie..only part that sucked was them replacing sam's girlfriend w/someone else..other than that it's filled w/lots of action and all those Autobots..
1,Brand New! I am so glad I got this Transformers Video for my younger brother he is going to love it and it is in brand new condition. Thank you for this great Christmas present at a great rate !
1,movie i love it cuz it was fast delivery and my son wanted this as a movie night to add with the other two he has and plus the movie was in good condition and i was ok with it not having a case cuz the case to me is collecting dust and when you have a disc you can add inthe dvd book sleeve
1,Transformers: Dark of the Moon watched this one and the previous one several times. Like this movie lots and so did the kids! thanks so much
1,Cant wait for Transformers 4 Absolutely awesome as usual. One of the best actions series of all time!! You cannot ask for anymore than what Michael Bay and company provide here.
1,"best movie made to date, and fast shipping Seen the movie at the theatre and knew then it was going to be a must buy on blu ray when released. Amazon always delivers promptly and on the release date."
1,Great movie I bought this as a preorder from Amazon and you couldn't be the price for a 3 disc set! Movie is very good and if you like the other Transformers movies it's a must have.
1,get this movie i love this movie for the action and all the bad crimanals get what they deserve at the end.i recommend this movie 100/00 percent
1,marine thanks for getting my movie here so quick. we really enjoy and its in great shape that is great thanks
1,"Non-stop action from beginning to end! I was skeptical of this movie featuring a WWE wrestler (WWE wrestlers are notoriously bad actors) and because the movie was produced by the WWE rather a than a major motion picture company. However I was wrong. The movie was full of action and special effects. John Cena did a respectable job acting. The theme and plot were very entertaining, not cheesey or bogus. If you like action movies such as ""Arnold"" movies or Rambo movies then you will very much enjoy this movie!"
1,"This service works great! I'm really happy with this eMarker thing. I mark songs with it almost everyday on WPLJ and I download the songs from Napster. I do have to wait for about 3-10 minutes (sometimes less) to get the song name, but I'm usually in the car so it is not really a problem. It would be great if they covered NPR. It works on my Windows 2000 PC at work and my Windows ME PC at home. The technology behind it seems to be pretty simple. I think the keychain product just remembers the time. It works flawlessly for my station, which is what is important anyway. The site is a bit slow, but it is a really slick design that is very interactive. I wish it held more songs than ten."
1,"INSANELY SCARY,MAN! This book is scary stuff! I read a story, ""Me-Tie-Doughty-Walker"" that scared the stuffing out of me! Now I'm in seventh grade, and the book still gives me chills when I'm reading it alone! The pictures are so trippy and disturbingly graphic!"
1,"Scary as heck! This, along with the other two books in the series, is a classic. Alvin Schwartz's tales are so simple yet so deviously scary, and Gammell's dark, surreal illustrations greatly enhance them. Actually, some of the illustrations are midly disturbing...(what IS that thing coming up the stairs in ""The Voice""?) Once you've read at least a couple of them, you'll start to realize just how scary the world is...(for instance, ""The Girl who Stood on a Grave"", ""The Red Spot"", and ""No Thanks""). So give them a try...you won't be dissapointed!"
1,"NIGHTMARES YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW SCARY LOOKING THE PICTURES ARE IN ALL OF THE BOOKS!!!! THAT COULD DEFINETELY GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES FOR A WHILE.EVEN IN SOME STORIES. THERE WAS NOT A PICTURE OF THE WENDINGO, BUT THE BACK OF THE BOOK SAID IT WAS A FEMALE SPIRIT, AND/OR A CANNIBAL GIANT THAT KILLS FOR HUMAN FLESH AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS DESCRIBED INDIANS WANTING TO EAT FLESH AS A ""WENDIGO PSYCHOSIS"". {I'm sure that's how you spell that word}."
1,"Wow, so creepy as a child! Okay, I had all three books when I was a kid. The original ones look like their worth some money so I'll be kicking myself in the back later. If these new ones stay true to the stories from the 90's editions, then you need to buy all three of them for your kids. The stories are pretty freaky for kids, but if I recall, most of them do state some lessons to be learned. Definitely buy all three."
1,Great Jam!! This is truly wonderful gooseberry jam. It is packed with chunks of gooseberries. I highly recommend this product!! It truly met my expectations.
1,Amazingly beautiful trance cd. This is the perfect cd to put in after a night of partying. Great to chill out to. Track 5 and 6 are just amazing.
1,awesome This has to be the best group of performers I've ever enjoyed. I've seen them 4 times.. well 5 times.. once on the 55 freeway.. :P This is cd is very creative and will set you in the mood that will take your mind away from everyday life.. GET IT!!! -Darkpeace (Moontriber 4 life)
1,Nice boot I bought these for my boys for Christmas and they love them so much they refuse to take them off. They told me these are the best pair of shoes/boots they have ever had.
1,"Excellent Boots! These boots are an excellent value. They are comfortable, provide great heel and ankle support, good grip, and keep your feed warm and dry in cold climates.Purchased a pair for a vacation in New Brunswick, Canada. These boots kept my feet dry and comfortable the whole time, even while snow shoeing and hiking across a snow covered beach front. Didn't slip once in them, though I encountered ice a few times.Very good purchase!"
1,"Hi-Tec Altitude I first purchased a pair of Hi-Tech Altitude boots approximately 10 years ago. They fit me extremely well and were very comfortable from the first moment I wore them. Prior to this purchase, I have had 2 different pairs of the Hi-Tech Altitude boots and I have not been disappointed. They wear extremely well and seem to last me about 4 or 5 years. I have found them excellent for everyday wear as well as for use in fishing and hunting. I think these are excellent low cut boots for such a moderate price. Haven't ventured into buying the $100+ boots, but then why should I when these work so well, so can not comment or compare my $70 Hi-Techs to the more pricey boots. I think you will be pleased with these boots."
1,"Only shoe my husband will wear Kudos to the Hi-Tec designers & manufacturers! My husband wears these daily for all types of situations. Easy to keep clean and looking nice. VERY durable. Almost no time to ""break them in"". Design has stayed constant. Run true to size. No need to change something that already works great. Will continue buying these in the future."
1,"Great Boots Went to Yellowstone in these boots. They were comfortable, waterproof and did well on the 328 steps to get down to lower falls."
1,"Mercacia pendiente por despachar. Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Hiking BootEste producto fue comprado y cacelado junto con una cartera para caballero NAUTICA Men's Trifold Wallent y numca fue enviado, este comentario lo he enviado muchas veses pero no me han solucionado nada, no voy a rrepatir mas este mensaje, pero no realizare mas compras por esta pajina debido a lo que esta sicediendo."
1,"More than one year used a lot ! Exactly I'm using this ones from 16 months, ALL the sundays, and in some trips to the mountain and beach for a complete week, they are great in all the ways! I can't hope something better from a daily used and/or hicking shoes! Another thing to consider; I'm a ""big and heavy boy"":6 ft.2 in.and 225 lbs."
1,Great all season Boot! I've now had these boots for a month and they just continue to impress me. They were comfortable right out of the box so break in was very quick. I've worn them day hiking and have had no problems with hot spots.Even though they are waterproof I still recommend spraying them with silicone.5 Stars!
1,"Nice boots! I ordered these in fall when I was going for a backpacking trip and I could just forget about twisting an ankle or anything. Wear these, step on any kind of surface with confidence, lots of grip, good support for the ankle. Will highly recommend these for snow as well as adventure!!"
1,"A powerful anti-war film. This is not only a spectacular and stunning piece of film making, it is a powerful anti-war film. If you can watch this film today and not be haunted and disturbed by it, you are not paying attention. I watched it recently for the first time in over 20 years and came away shaken. I can't help but wonder if it is not on DVD because there are people who do not want this film to be widely available. As it is now, you have to dig for it. If more people watched this film they might be asking questions our ""leaders"" would rather have left unasked. If you have not seen this film, or it has been a number of years since you saw it last, I can recommend it. It is not an overt anti-war film with an explicit anti-war message, but after seeing it, you will not view world events with the same eyes you did before, I promise."
1,"ONE OF MY FAVORITE DIRECTORS AND FILM DAVID LEAN COULD HAVE DIRECTED ALMOST ANY FILM HE WANTED AT THIS TIME IN HIS CAREER, AND HE CHOSE THIS PROVOCATIVE AND EMOTIONAL STORY OF A LITTLE TOWN IN IRELAND. THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER OF HIS, INCLUDING THE EARLY ONES. THE CASTING IS SUPERB, COULD NOT BE BETTER RIGHT DOWN TO THE SMALL ROLES LIKE MAUREEN. I SAW IT WHEN I WAS 13 WITH MY PARENTS WHO WERE LEAN FANS. ITS HIS BEST FILM, TREATED BY SOME AS HIS WORST FILM. I EXPECTED TO SEE ALEC GUINESS IN IT, BUT THERE IS NO REAL ROLE FOR HIM. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PEOPLES LIVES IN THE FILM IS AMAZING AND I THINK AHEAD OF ITS TIME FOR 1970 FILM VIEWERS."
1,"Great Beginner Camera We had used a decent quality camcorder before our son bought this one. This one has been a pleasant surprise. Although the picture quality might be more like 4 stars, the features that are provided at such a low cost make this a 5 star product. It has all the fundamentals for a beginner and it fits well in medium size and small size hands (unlike some that require two hands or very large hands or cost five times as much for a small form-factor). We had it out of the box in minutes and were recording first videos with it in less than 15 minutes. The price makes it affordable for school kids to have all kinds of fun projects with it."
1,"YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU BOUGHT THIS!!! This album is proof that Jason Robert Brown is a musician's musician, and that he has mastered many different forms of popular music. Each of these 11 songs could stand on their own as a brilliant song, and none of these have the same style or feel as another.Brown's pure talent shines through this album, and there are several moments that are just so beautiful that I just get chills listening to them. Every lyric and harmony has been precisely placed, and the music always fits the idea of the song very naturally. There are some amazing performance moments on this album; Brown is an incredible pianist and singer in addition to his composing and arranging talents.This is probably the album that I listen to more than any other, and I would recommend it to anyone. It is packed with amazing musicality.Don't listen to this while trying to get work done; these songs will steal your attention and keep it for the whole duration of the CD."
1,RPM Sensor Assembly Great purchase. I was so frustrated and I couldn't figure out what was causing my garage door to reverse direction after just a few feet. This was an easy fix. Everything was packed well and shipped fast
1,"Easy For Me To Use This is a good,inexpensive printer.It is easy for me,stillvery gadget illiterate,to install and use."
1,"Perfect choice This CD is really awesome...the style of their songs are not exactly trance, not euro dance/trance either...they have their own way of playin their songs...AWESOME CHOICE"
1,"A wonderful helping of Brazilian jazz! This is a great CD from an extraordinary jazz saxophone player and probably the biggest name in Brazilian jazz today. We got a chance to see Leo Gandelman perform a lot of these songs at the Blue Note in June. Maracatu is a superb song...his son played it alongside him that night, it was one of the best experiences of live music I've ever heard. If you are into this type of jazz, this is a ""must have"" collection."
1,EXTREMELY RARE AND HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER! Unfortunately this one won't be on cd anytime soon. A bargain at $2400 for the cassette. So rare its worth it. You won't find it anytime soon! If you make an offer you might be lucky and get it for less.
1,"Deceptively good Just to be clear: the album is uniformly quiet and just consists of electric guitar without lots of special effects except long sustain. The genius of the record is that MazzaCane can bring out so much with minute details -- muffled string noises, minute pitch changes, perfect arhythmic timing of notes. Don't mistake apparent simplicity for emptiness, as another reviewer did. One of the most moving records I've heard, with a rare, sad, clear quality. I'd recommend this as a first album by this artist (he calls it his best too)."
1,"LUX Programmable Thermostat. Easy to setup. Looks good, great price. Shopped around a bit and this value is second to none. I have only had it for a month or so and good so far."
1,great product Works well and easy to program. Has definitely decreased our heating bills. Price of product was also very good. Would buy again
1,"Favguti is excellent !! In an age of the internet GUI store fronts, the typical on-line stores may forget the importance of quality in F2F interaction with the customer. In this regards, FAVGUTI exceeds all expectations on customer satisfaction!The product ordered opposed to product recieved was incorrect (...it happens), to final product quality / reliability was addressed daily till mutually satisfied. Need more on-line stores like FAVGUTI !!--Michael (in San Diego)"
1,"The ""goods"" make the ""bads"" look utterly insignificant! A+! Granted, most of the songs on this album are decent, but not great. However, the four songs that ARE great (Tubthumping, etc.) are so incredible that they literally blow the rest of the songs away! It is worth paying twice the price just to hear one of these amazing four songs!"
1,"HAPPY, SHINY ANARCHY'S NEVER BEEN MORE FUN! While Chumbawamba's recent musical efforts have left little or no impression on the music scene, their debut album ""TUBTHUMPER"" will remain ""thumping"" to the dance club beat of a different drum. For unexplainable reasons, I find myself coming back to this album time and time again. The music will not let you go. It's enjoyable, entertaining, and fun!""Tubthumping"" is an unrellenting statement of defiance. ""Amnesia""'s persistent guitar riff and catchy trumpets will NOT leave you suffering from ""long term memory loss"". ""The Big Issue"" contains some tatalizing chorale, and a catchy, lyrical tune. ""Mary, Mary"" is probably my favorite questioning the sanctity of Catholicism.Chambawamba may come and go, but let this be known. There was a band with a wierd name from England, whose music was fun to listen to, coherant, and made anarchy seem like fun!God Save ""Tubthumper""!"
1,"Fast and loud, that's how I like it. Even though Chumbawamba's most popular single in America was Tubthumping, that is my least favorite song on this album. It's way too slow. The rest of the songs are really fast, and have a great beat. If you like music with a beat, you must get this CD! Hey, even better, many of Chumbawamba's songs actually have meaning, for those of you that have a brain. There are a total of 12 songs and about ten mini-songs on the CD"
1,"So far sooooooo good I bought this printer two weeks ago and had it up and running within minutes of unpacking. When I first bought this PC I feared the two most commonly documented problems,paper jams and printer driver problems/OS problems, but to date I have not experienced either and the quality is as good as the laser printers I use in the office. The only thing I dislike about this printer is the high cost of replacement cartridges so I am hoping someone will deveolpe a refill kit similiar to the one I used with my old Canon BJC 250, which worked great..."
1,"Quilts from the Smithsonian I'm a quilt lover, and my favorite are old scrappy quilts. I do alot of quilting myself, but as a result of my love for quilts I also collect quilt books. One of my favorites is this little books from That Patchwork Place, Quilts from the Smithsonian by Mimi DietrichThe book has pictures and patterns of 12 great quilts from the Smithsonian collection, from a simple Plaid Patch to the more complexed Chesapeake Rose, and The Lilies of the Quilters. There are all colored pictures all through the book, and the there are easy to follow directions helping you to make your own quilts for future generations to love. Or if you are not a quilter the book si a perfect coffee table book with all it's colors and inspirations.Britt Arnhild Lindland"
1,"Your Signature Life by Dianna Booher Personal accountability, integrity, character - whatever you label it, it's doing the right thing, even when no one else is watching. ""Your Signature Life"" is a personal-development home run!Through captivating imagery and intriguing statistics, Dianna Booher challenges us to examine our lives to see what kind of character we are developing. Do we reflect light or darkness? She shows us how our experiences and relationships may help to form the way we look at the world, but they do not have to define who we are or who we will become.Although we cannot control the actions of those around us, we are called to control our responses to those actions. Personal accountability is not a thing of the past. We can and must have it today if we ever hope to look back over our lives and smile. Others are watching. God is watching.Ms. Booher's latest release, ""Your Signature Life,"" is a triumph for those seeking to live a life of integrity and total fulfillment."
1,"Never gets old Having just finished Greg Bear's brilliant ""Foundation & Chaos"", I've decided I can no longer wait to begin re-reading the original again. I wish I could take the next few months to start off with the Robot series, move on to the Galactic Empire series, and then finsh with the entire collection of the Foundation books (because it's all one big wunnerful story, doncha' know!). Well, not this year, perhaps, but in a few I may do just that. In the meantime, I will re-read ""Foundation"" with yet another new perspective of Hari Seldon and all that came before this original masterpiece... it truly never gets old."
1,"Tapes were as advertise The set arrived on time and enjoyed listening to the tapes, the tapes arrived in good condition and great sound."
1,Foundation Great book by Isaac Asimov. What a wonderful sci fi book. I'd recommend this series for anyone that likes fiction
1,It Holds up Not earth shaking or intensely mind bending but even after 30 years I enjoyed rereading the series. Asimov's storytelling is great!
1,Smart. Thought provoking. Classic. Sci-fi at its best! Asimov was one of the founding fathers of Sci-fi and to him we owe a debt of gratitude for making the genre worthy of the literary title. His messages and considerations give the reader a lot more than just something to kill time. It makes sci-fi an avenue to real soul searching.
1,"OUTSTANDING a must read and re-read (by ISAAC ASIMOV) Any coment's on this serie of books must be a positive one and if it's not then thats becouse you dident understand the story, so you should reread them all again, i stronly recommend this serie of books to anyone, not just sci fans, but to all that have the taste to read. The author of this serie wrote 470 books, he was a genius and died out of his time with the age of 72, in memory of ISAAC ASIMOV i recommend all of his books, but especially the foundation series,thaks for reading my review."
1,"The Zenith of Asimov! I highly recommend the time to read ""Foundation""...it just may convince you to continue on with the rest of the series. I believe it was the forerunner and main idea behind the concept of a galactic empire as has been expanded on by Star Wars and Star Trek. If you would like to see the genesis of the idea behind those phenomena then you'll very much be rewarded by reading the Foundation series...besides, anything by Asimov is worth its weight in gold and this is the zenith of his space operatic writings!"
1,"great read The book doesn't really need yet another enthusiastic review, so I'll keep this to the point.The stories in this book are really enjoyable. You get to learn about characters in the beginning and then spend the rest of the time reading about the legacy they created and the later events that they had a hand in shaping. I find this satisfying in a way similar to the Dune series but I didn't have to read 6 books.As with every Asimov book I've read, the plots in this book are forged and hewn into complicated machines that are disassembled before your eyes at just the right climactic moment. It makes for a hard book to put down."
1,"Excellent, but it now! I admit it, I am an Asimov-phile. This is yet another book by Asimov that is very hard to put down. I rate this, and all of Asimovs books with the highest regard. Quite simply buy it now, or you are a fool. ;-)"
1,"Always liked Asimov I always liked Asimov, but finding series books in sequence is difficult with print books. Kindle makes it easy! Now they're all cataloged in order and I don't even have to get out of bed for the next one.Reading the ""Foundation"" series in order rather than by availability makes a great writer even better."
1,"Best Book by Asimov (fiction) I have read almost all of Asimov's fiction, and this book is by far one of the best. I would recommend it to anyone interested!Boom, Done.-Jeremy Paul Gallagher"
1,"One of the best ever This book it simply one of the best science fiction stories ever written. It should be on the ""must read"" list for any sci-fi fan."
1,"Wonderful What can I say??? Asimov at his best. It's impossible to stop reading this book. The chapters are so incredible, that you can't wait to get to the finish to know how the plot ends. If you haven't read it, you don't know what you are missing"
1,"Cornerstone of Science Fiction Foundation has been called by science-fiction lovers all over the world as a cornerstone for science fiction. Isaac Asimov's all time best, this book tells the tale of the crumbling of the Galactic Empire and is only the beggining of a 7-book series. The way Asimov uses the analogy of the Fall of the Roman Empire has pleased readers for decades. Asimov tells the story of a planet alone at the edge of the galaxy awaiting a future already planned for it. Leaders struggle for the planets survival, for this planet, Terminus, holds the future of the Human Race in its hands. Isaac Asimov tells the thrilling tale of human survival in an environment that is against it."
1,"Classic science fiction I remember walking to the library as a thirteen year old with my back pack, smile on my face between each of the foundation books. Now, I have read them over again (a few times) and the only difference is that I now own them so no more walks to the library."
1,"What a Great Read! This is really an incredible book! Steven Selengut has incorporated very creative insight with some highly original thinking to produce one of the best ""investing manuals"" ever written! I wholeheartedly endorse this book!"
1,HIS SYSTEM WORKS !!!!! Steve Selengut really knows his stuff. Follow his system andwatch your net worth GROW for a change!
1,"Getting Second Degree I'm going back for a second degree after 21 years. This book is very easy to understand and will make my class a lot easier and enjoyable. Great seller, quick shipping. I would highly recommend."
1,"FINALLY--A BOOK THAT TELLS HOW TO RAISE PEACEFUL KIDS If every parent had just one book on their nightshelf this should be the one. It's packed with simple, usable ideas I can use instantly to help my kids become decent human beings. The tips for helping kids stand up to bullies and learn to fight fair are worth the cost of the book alone. If more parents would read this book we really could minimize violence and raise peaceful kids. We should read this book together!"
1,"It's what we need... At a time when confusion seems to reign, Michele Borba's book is a ressuring tool that helps to keep our family grounded. I refer to it often and my husband and I use it as a conversation builder with our four children. This book was recommended to me by a fellow physician, and I have chosen to give copies of this book as gifts. Whether a new parent or a seasoned one, this book should be in every family's home."
1,"DIRTY HARRY MOVE OVER Imagine Dirty Harry with a bad coke habit, played by Nicolas Cage in New Orleans. Cage gives us an outstanding performance as someone who goes though those violent coke induced mood swings. The iguana which appears in the movie from time to time is symbolic of the metaphor ""monkey on the back."" Cage is investigating a brutal family execution and interweaves his personal failings into the process. His girlfriend is a prostitute who he protects and supplies drugs. He has a gambling habit, and owes money (bets too much on LSU) and of course steals from the evidence locker. He also shakes down people for information, even grandmothers. Makes Dirty Harry look like a sissy. Lots of drug use, bad language, sexual situations, and some violence. Good story. Plot fairly simple to follow. The movie, at time, has the feel of a dark comedy."
1,"Not for everyone, but if it's for you - you're in luck Arguably one of Werner Herzog's best films. Cage packs a punch with some intense acting. Of course it's edgy and not for everyone as well as pushes the limits of traditional film-making. Get tranced by extra-long shots of wildlife as the music trips you into a 'though-you-were on drugs' daze. Quirky humor, crazed rants and a man breaking all the rules in a wreckless but focused and effective way. I'm not one to watch movies more than once, but have seen this one at least three times."
1,"Underbelly Regency Style This book shocked me, educated me and was truly a page turner.I purchased this book as I am doing some research into the period and it didn't disappoint. The book focuses on the darker side of life which is present in every society in some form.If you are looking to understand our history and human nature you will discover that soccer hooliganism is nothing new."
1,"Lock Laces These stand up better than other types of elastic shoelaces. Once set, the lock does not slip and the shoes fit the same way always."
1,"funny bone laughter If you want to laugh and laugh hard this is the DVD to purchase, also this DVD will bring back memories of the late 70s when Tv comedy was at it's best.i give this DVD a 2+ thumbs up. Looking 2 purchase season 2 soon!!.."
1,first season of Three Company Loved Three's Company when I used to watch it on TV Land so I had to get the first season. Would love to eventually get all the seasons of it. It is a great comedy show not like the so called comedy today that I personally think should be called sick or dark comedy.
1,"great comedy. Another funny sitcom of the 70's it's still unbelievable that John Ritter a great and funny actor is gone, order the entire series it will crack you up."
1,great item we LOVE the classic tv series. this was one of the best. can't wait to buy the rest of the seasons.
1,"This is one of the best seasons. I love Three's Company, always have, always will! The first season is one of my favorite seasons and I love all the episodes but especially the episodes where Chrissie and Janet first meet Jack and the episode where Chrissie's conservative mother comes for a visit and she worries that her mother will be upset that one of her roommates is a man and that her mother will get the wrong idea about the living conditions. This season may be short with only having 6 episodes but it's still worth buying because the episodes are funny and Amazon is offering it at a great low price!"
1,"A OK ~ Three's Company Season 1 I'm glad Three's Company was put on DVD. It was a good show back in its days and it is still a good show. I can't wait to buy the Second Season when it comes out in the spring of 2004. If you have never seen any of the shows, I suggest you start watching and own this DVD. You won't stop laughing."
1,"Fun, Fun, Fun! I love this show!!! Ritter was a comedic genius as far as I am concerned. Everyone of the episodes on this disc is a real hoot for anyone that grew up watching reruns of the show. Give it a whirl and you won't be sorry. R.I.P John Ritter...We'll miss you."
1,"How Much Better Can This Get! I'm so glad this show is finally coming out on dvd. I've been waiting for it ever since MASH came out on dvd. Mash and Three's Company have always been my all time favorite shows and i'm only 20 years old. You can't get much better in John Ritter's physical comedy in Three's Company. He's probably the greatest actor/comedian to ever walk the face of this earth. And to hear of his passing tore a whole in my heart. I never got to meet the guy, but his tv performances helped me to generate a many a laught and I can't wait till i can get my hands on this dvd. It's a safe bet i'm gonna wear this dvd set out quickly as i did MASH. RIP Mr. John Ritter, but your awesome legacy will live on in my dvd player for years to come."
1,Delighfully Entertaining I've watched all the episodes a dozen times and I never get tired of watching these three. This show is definitely the best. I forget my worries and relieves me of the stress that everyone go through in their daily lives.
1,"jack, janet, and chrissy The first season of Three's Company. One of the funniest sitcoms around. The story of two girls, who need a roommate. After throwing a party (in the first episode) Janet and Chrissy find a man sleeping in their bathtub. . .eventually, they become roommates.A lot of storylines on the show revolved around misconceptions, and misunderstandings. The on-going joke that the landlord thinks that Jack is gay. In the first three seasons, the landlords are an older couple named The Ropers. And their on-going joke about him not wanting to sleep with her. Kind of like Al Bundy, on Married...with Children.Guaranteed many laughs. Rest in peace John Ritter."
1,"hilarious, thought provoking, very aware of todays society What a shame this book is no longer in print! I adore this book to its core. What a beautiful story.The text on the back said it was a hilarious comedy about god and the devil returning to earth to see what happened to creation, but as a matter of fact it is so much more. It is about society, it is about humanity, it is about downfall. And yes, it is extremely witty.I am so glad I found it at the shelves of my favorite second hand book shopping place. I do hope it will get back into print, so more people can enjoy this awesome tale."
1,"A great and useful tool! I bought this book on a whim because I had just found my interest in photography, and I was done reading it two days later! Garrett makes all the concepts of photography understandable to those without any prior knowledge! I even found myself going through the book again and jotting down notes about film speeds and filters for easy reference later! I cannot wait to try out the things I have learned from this wonderful book! I only wish I had more to read! I recommed this for anyone who thinks he would not be able to understand the concepts of photography and the camera. This book is not written on a technical level so make this the first photography book you buy!"
1,"Definately ""NOT"" more of the same Larry with great ""4"" piece horn section.Much, much different than the Larry Carlton/Steve lukather DVD, which is great.Who doesn't love a good horn section: Mark Douthit/T sax; Doug Moffet/Baritone; Mike Haynes/trumpet; Barry Green TromboneKeyboardist/Rick Jackson/phenomenal(same as Carlton/Lukather DVD), Moyes Lucas/drums/exceptional and none other than Travis Carlton/Bass/tight.Songs:Friday Night ShuffleNight SweatsJosieSapphire BluesMinute by MinuteJust an excuse7 for yaTenor MadnessSlightly DirtyDeep into itRoom 335sleepwalkextrasThis is great, but do NOT miss the new Larry and Tak DVD. That thing is just way too much. Phenomenal.No, I am not a Larry Carlton freak/affectionado/wierdo. I just love great concert DVDs."
1,"A must for membership staff! Excellent resource. Covers all the issues revolving around membership programs. Lots of specifics, examples and ideas;for membership staff, boards, and executives. Fills a major need for specific ways to carryout and improve membership programs. Great to have input from experts on a subject that so many non-profits grabble with everyday. Covers such essential membership topics as planning, membership and fund-raising, getting and keeping members, volunteers, the internet. Also helpful examples:of worksheets, budgets, and helpful case studies, plus software information.Truly ""an action plan for results."" Recommended highly."
1,"some groovy beats This is really good stuff. Strong uplifting beats with some serious funk thrown in, sketches of twisting melodies, beautiful airy vocal overtones. It's a lasting favorite that still hits all my get-up-and-groove reflexes."
1,"one more positive note Don't know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls, painted white and sealed against moisture, but I fussed with that or drywall. I considered my own sound issues and went with wood. But after reading some of the author's comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop. Not for me alone, but for my nieghbors as well. Good book to read before, during or contemplating a shop. Hey, we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well."
1,"What a great resource! As a library administrator, and avid woodworker, I get to see and read a lot of woodworking and shop building books. This is among the best I have ever read. I even purchased a copy of this one for myself. I was really impressed with all of the common-sense advice for day-to-day problems encountered in any workshop. Many of the other workshop books on the market are either too simplistic, or serve only to showcase famous woodworking shops without detail. This book gives all the nitty-gritty that you will need to set up or rework your dream shop. It definitely helped me."
1,"The credible source for authentic ninjutsu. There is no way anyone can truly say that they study or train ninjutsu without reading Stephen Hayes' material. He is probably the only reason that ninjutsu is accessable to the masses. His work and dedication to the art without being a fringe kook or a wacko give him the highest level of credibility. This is good stuff. His master, Masaaki Hatsumi is still alive and in Japan. There are no secrets--just verifiable truth waiting to be discovered. If you want your knowledge of ninjutsu/ninjitsu/ninpo etc. to be complete, you will buy his books."
1,Mad Max special edition This is the ultimate action movie and still after more than 20 years I really enjoy watching the film again. Max has to fight crazy motorbikers with his supercharger V8 car in the futuristic landscape. He give no mercy to the bad boys after they have killed of his family.
1,"Finally the Australian version. I first saw this movie in the theatre in 1980 or 81. I have purchased the VHS version and the DVD version as soon as they came out. Since then I have been searching for the Australian soundtrack version but to no avail. When I read on a Mad Max website that the Australian version was available, I bought it immediately. Man was I blown away. This was one of my favorite movies. Now it is my favorite! How they could have released this movie with the overdub is insane. It's like watching a brand new movie. Definitely worth the price of admission. Oh and there is no comparison between this movie and it's sequels. Road Warrior was okay but Thunderdome was a joke.Turkey."
1,"Cult Classic In the near furture, the high ways of tomorrow are no longer a safe place. Gangs of bikers and kamikaze lunatics roam the long stretches of road that populate the stretch of land known as the Austrailian outback. Mel Gibson soars as the tough futuristic cop Mad Max in this extreme action thriller that started it all. Amazing non-computerized stunts make this movie a treat to watch over and over again. After his wife is brutally murdered by an evil group of bikers, Max sets out on a crazed revenge, earning his heading ""Mad"". Grinding action sequences and Gibson's cool headed attitude make Han Solo look like second hand trash. Just like what Star Wars did for sci-fi, this movie revolutionized action movies for all time, setting the standard of today."
1,"The first the better ! A true action movie with Mel Gibson as "" vigilante "" after the death of his wife and son by mad bikers : truly a masterpiece !"
1,"One of the greatest Arthur tales ever. This is the book I read as a child and loved, then read again as a man and loved more. It is part of how I see the King Arthur legend. I will never part with my copy, and I will read it to my son when I have one."
1,"Funny This movie has the little girl from Matilda and Martin Short. Good family picture , we loved it. Came in excellent condition!"
1,"Trout Does it Again! Like all of their CD's, Trout fishing in America has done it again! Fun, entertaining music that is great for adults, kids...whomever!Trout continues to be one of my favorite groups out there-- it's amazing that they do not get more national publicity."
1,MAGIC Great looking toy. I have Magic doing his no-look-pass pose towards my other Lakers greats. Good size and similar resemblance to the Magic man.
1,"ORGASM OF THE WORD Burroughs searches in his writing for the same thing he searched for in drug use, sex and the russian roulette games he played with his guns: to try and distill out of an experience the pure essence of what it means to be alive, that single moment of ecstasy when living is made real in a blinding flash. Through graphic imagery of sex and death Burroughs will play you like a miscreant attacking a cathedral pipe organ, pulling out all the stops, feet pounding all the pedals at once, hands stomping the keys, blasting the pipes. In that rush of noise he challenges you to find the whisper of truth. A Liturgy and Scripture for the Damned."
1,"Gather in the Nets Burroughs drags in the nets he has held out for fifty years or so and sorts out the information he has gathered. In his most lucid, almost straight forward prose (inspired by Denton Welch), Burroughs puts forward a trilogy -Cities of the Red Night, Place of Dead Roads, and The Western Lands- with all his loves and hates, and serves them in his most favourite genres from childhood up: Pulp Dectective; Sci Fi; Pirates; High School Theatre; Egyptian; and others.Naked Lunch may have messed with you, but it never infiltrated your thinking as much as these books will. I think the deceptively simple language and 'sense' of 'narrative continuity' help to disarm and act as a Trogan Horse.If you are easily offended you may want to skip Burroughs altogether, though, in that case, I suspect you need him to unsettle your morals, just a little, so you can reflect on your position."
1,Awesome! This was the first novel I've read by Shari MacDonald. It was great. She ranks right up there with Lori Wick and Lori Copeland. This is a must read.
1,It was the best Night World book! Compared to all the night world books this one is the best! I love how Rasheal is so brave and finds her soulmate while fighting vampires.
1,"I LOVE THIS BOOK! Of all the books that L. J. has written in this series, ""The Chosen"" is by far the best. I have read all nine of the currently published books(and am still eagerly awaiting the tenth). This book has the wonderful premise of the previous and subsequent books. However, it also has main characters with more depth than many characters in other novels and realistic motives. Rashel and Quinn spend most of the book trying to ignore their feelings for eachother and trying to kill eachother. Both things are something that the other books really lack. Niether readily admit to bieng soulmates. The two characters fellings towards the members of Circle Daybreak coin the term ""damned Daybreakers.""All of these things and their depth of character contribute to make this a great book rather than a marginally good book as the other books in this series have been."
1,Dog rescue I really loved this book. It made you laugh and made you sad. I wish I could have the courage to rescue dogs in the same manner as Randy Grim does. Truly inspiring stories.
1,"Life as a dog A fascinating account of one man's crusade to rescue the stray dogs of St. Louis, this book gives us incredible insight into the issues surrounding the stray animal problem in this country. I learned more than I knew there was to know about feral dogs and their place in our society. But this book is not just about dogs - the lessons learned could just as easily be applied to the ""capture"" and ""saving"" of all the other strays found in our cities--including those lost & homeless children who have become so commonplace. The behaviors they exhibit are scarily similar to those described by Randy Grim in this book. A gripping tale and one which should be read by anyone interested in the plight of all the strays of the world."
1,"truly beautiful Marie Curie's youngest daughter Eve has given us a gift by writing this biography of her mother. Eve manages to let us into her mother's private world while inspiring our full respect of her privacy. Madame Curie and her husband Pierre exemplify the meaning of the word integrity - a rarity, especially in our culture of constantly searching for fame and wealth at all cost. I will read this book multiple times like visiting a friend and learning a bit more about this remarkable person each time."
1,"Fantastic When my doctor gave me a choice between crutches or a walker, I chose walker. My uncle had one of these and offered me its use. I loved the ease of its smooth gliding wheels and especially the hand brake. I never felt like it was getting away from me. The compartment was handy for traveling around with a book, meds, etc. and doubled as a seat when I was tired and had to rest. I think this is the best walker on the market!"
1,Great Puzzle This is an excellent puzzle for very young children. Melissa & Doug products are well made and kids love them. This puzzle is wooden so kids wont destroy it if they try to roughly put the pieces in. The design is adorable and makes a great gift for any young animal lover.
1,Very pretty and good quality My two year absolutely loves puzzles and this has been a great addition to our collection.. It's sturdy and I don't think she'll be able to wear it out or break it.
1,"Really great shoes I love these shoes. I live in Dubai where it is currently hotter than you can imagine, yet I have 2 dogs that need daily walks. I wanted something that gave me comfort and support while walking but without the heat of socks and shoes. I bought these shoes last week and have worn them every day since. They are so supportive yet comfortable, I feel like i could run in them, yet I barely feel like I'm wearing anything! This was my first pair of Merrells - over the week I bought 2 more pairs :)"
1,"This cd is worthy of 100 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think Evita is the best music piece ever. Madonna and Antonio Banderas are the best Evita and Che. This musical is probably the only one where I listen to EVERYTHING. Even tracks like ""A Cinema in Bueonos Aires"" even though it is not even music."
1,EVITA SOUND TRACKS I ordered the sound tracks for the film Evita since the 1st of Dec.'07 I am still waiting for it to be delivered. I have been a long time customer of Amazon and I've never had any problems with deliveries before. The item ordered was meant to be a Christmas present. Since it's not here where is it? I need an answer please...P.S Happy New Year to you all.Chas>>>>>
1,"Great movie and soundtrack I loved the movie EVITA and rented it so many times, the movie store eventually sold it to me. The songs are upbeat and there's a variety, so it kept my attention. Banderas and Madonna made a great pair!"
1,"Reliable I bought this printer for my son's new computer which runs XP. No problem loading the software, no paper jams, no problems at all. For [the money]including the USB cable. I am still using an HP Deskjet 540 that I bought with my Packard Bell Pentium 75mHz over 6 - 8 years ago. The PB is gone, but the HP lives on and on and on. That's says a lot. New print heads with each cartridge I think is the way to go. Will use 825 mostly for text, but having printed a photo, it compares fairly well with my Epson 780 with glossy paper."
1,"ordered used received new I ordered an used copy and received a brand new one. Mistake? I don't know. Quick shipment and delivery. For about $10 I am very happy with this purchase.I bought it for school, and the content is interesting.I was surprized by the size of this book. It is almost like a pocket book"
1,Great value I love how high it gets - I have bad knees and have trouble getting up from a position where my knees are bent more than 90 degrees - and it is so easy to set up
1,As comfy as a regular bed Bought this for my summer cottage for extra guests. Very comfortable. Great size and built in Air Pump made it a breeze to inflate. The Velour top was also a great plus. Would reccommend highly.
1,"Fantastic Bed I bought this bed, for my niece who was visiting. The bed was so simple to put air in it, took about 3 minutes or less and very comfortable, did not have to put more air in it the whole weekend. It was much better than the Aerobed, and cost less. I have been through three of them, which didnt last past two years. It was well worth the purchase, will buy another one. Fast shipping too."
1,Great Product A++++++ It fills up really fast and is a sweet bed. Best Airbed ever!!!! A must buy item.... Fast shipping as well =)
1,Great Product. I sleep on this until I got a real mattress. Great for allergies. Will keep it in the car in case I spend the night at the kids house.
1,"Comfortable, Inflates Beautifully Does everything I expected it to. The built in pump works perfectly (for both inflation and deflation), and it hasn't sprung a leak on me yet."
1,Perfect for me I like itI was looking for it I found it I got and I am enjoying it to the fullestI recommend it to anyone
1,Excellent product! I was very happy with the airbed that I chose - it met all my expectations - service was excellent.
1,"Best Bed for the Buck For the price, this air mattress is a great bargain. Inflates fast, deflation is done via the fan motor which speeds up the process, compact and light, easy to store.....I highly recommend this as quick and easy way to accommodate the need for an extra bed."
1,"Air Bed Twin Size This item arrived on within just a matter of a few days. It sure did serve its purpose. It took about a minute to inflate and deflate I am very pleased with this product. Would buy from seller again, definitly."
1,Awesome!! I love how quickly inflates & deflates! Maintains fullness throughout the night! Love that's it's raised high enough for getting in & out of bed! Very easy to store away. Love the tote in which you can carry to anywhere you may need to travel. Totally recommend it!!
1,"Aerobed saves the day (and night) with comfortable sleep alternative! I ordered the aerobed for visiting guests, and they loved it. Also, it fit nicely in my space-challenged unit. Shipping was great! Price was great! all happy campers."
1,"Good quality bed I bought this to use whilst staying at my sister in laws house for a couple weeks around Christmas. This bed is awesome! It pumps up very quickly and is comfortable and big enough. My nephew is 6ft and 220 pounds and I'm 5'5 and 140 pounds and we could both lay on this whilst watching a movie with no problems. I used it for 2 weeks and only inflated it slightly on the second day, I think the material stretched a little during my first nights sleep to break it in and thats why it seemed like it lost air. After the second day I never had to refill it. I left it there when I went home and my nephews are still using it and love it more than their regular beds."
1,"No complaint Really good product. For this price, I give it a 5. Very comfortable and easy to use. You do have to refill the air after two nights though."
1,What a deal! This is an incredible air mattress. We purchased this for a last minute house guest. It was shipped quickly. The mattress itself is very nice and comfortable. And the automatic pump makes blowing up and deflating a breeze!!! I would highly recommend to anyone needing an air mattress
1,Thank You I bought this for my daughter to use when she visits. She found it was so comfy that it was hard getting her out of it at all. It came packaged nicely & was exactly as described on Amazon. Very pleased!
1,"Excellent product! One of the best air mattresses I've owned. Extremely easy to fill and let the air out, just plug in and flip a switch. I like that it's all one unit, the plug and air in/out take is attached and hidden in a compartment. It's comfortable and does not loose air, even over an extended period of time."
1,Most Excellent Love it! this bed fits the bill. my guess like it compliments on how comfortable it is. Easy to inflate and store. An excellent buy in my book. The built in pump is a super feature.
1,"Great extra bed or travel bed I took this with me on a vacation for our guest to use. But, it is so comfortable that it turned out that I used it the whole week and gave the guest the actual regular mattress bed and used this air mattress instead. I have used it for 3 different 1 week vacations and have had no problems with it. It even deflates electrically so it fits back into the travel bag it came with. Amazing deal."
1,"Scout Mom -B'ham I needed this for a Scout outing, had no idear about air mattress. I wanted something easy to carry and not to many items. This air mattress is true to it's word. Just like my home bed, comfort and ease of sleeping. Ease for filling and letting air out. Going to order another one that is larger."
1,"Bueno Good afternoon I would inform them that the item was received in perfect conditions, and they estimated the time, so I give the maximum score. thanks"
1,"Easy to inflate - comfortable I bought one and it was so easy to use and quick to inflate, that I ended up buying one for a family member as well. The pump is build right into the mattress so you don't have to worry about misplacing the pump as with many other air mattresses. Inflates in just a few minutes and the pump is not as loud as other pumps I've had in the past."
1,"the band you've heard their music, now hear their words. this dvd gives insight into an extrordinary album of the early 70's; a release that was polar opposite to much of the musical landscape of the era. timeless tunes created by five talented musicians. the joy on levon helm's face is rich as he recounts how the harmonies of himself, richard manuel and rick danko were structured. an impromtu version of unfaithful servant performed by rick is just as emotionally poignant now, as it was on the lp. a couple keyboard demos by garth hudson is both pythonesque, and accomplished keyboardist, in it's scope. and with much less screen time compared to the last waltz, robbie robertson has a word or two as well. after viewing this dvd, cue up the band's lp on the turntable, or tray in the cd, and relive this great work once more!"
1,"Amazing! I'm 24 years old and have never had an orgasm. It's not that it's not enjoyable, it definitely feels good, but I've just never been able to get to that state. I've had sex with enough men and tried doing it on my own, it just never worked. Then I finally did something about it and ordered this item. It was my first toy. Within 2 minutes I had my first orgasm. WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO TRY A TOY?!?!? :p Now I just have to get a few more toys and introduce them to my sex life with my boyfriend...hopefully he won't mind ^_^"
1,"jack rabbit totally comfortable, and extremely sensual i love it.i adore the bunny ears and the controls are super easyi recommend for any woman looking for comfortable, intense pleasure (:"
1,"OMG! What can I say?! I absolutely CANNOT believe how wonderful this product is! I own 5 toys and this one by far is my favorite! I have no regrets or complaints when it comes to me purchasing this product. It certainly gets the job done, and quick too. I have never had to use it for more than a few minutes, its amazing! It has 3 speeds of vibration for clit stimulation, 3 speeds of rotation in the shaft, you can change the direction in which it rotates, and it is completely submergeable! It even has a bumpy texture on the shaft to stimulate the g-spot. As far as batteries go, they do not have to be replaced very often either. This is a very well thought out invention and I can't think of any ways to improve it!"
1,Wife loves this toy! We were a little hesitant to add a toy of this nature to our collection but the wife absolutely loves this one!
1,Amazing! This was my second toy and I love it! As soon as it arrived I tried it out. I highly recommend this! It is worth the $28.06 and shipping. I've never had an orgasm that powerful (:
1,"So Good, I Bought Another I bought this to replace the same item I'd purchased 2 years ago from Amazon and, after many, many uses, burnt out the vibe portion of the toy.This product is slightly thicker than average rabbits, but definately not oversized. The motor is quiet and VERY effective, almost too much so; my husband and I like to use it during playtime, but I find I often have to turn it down or off to hold back a little...Don't hesitate to purchase this; at this price point, it's the best you can get!"
1,"A ""Must Have"" for any FleetwoodMac Fan!!! By far, one of the best videos I've ever purchased. This video takes each band member down memory lane and you get a wonderful inside scoop to what was really going on behind the scenes making Rumors. Stevie, Christine, Lindsey, John & Mick tell of how their very personal struggles with each other had to be put aside for the survival of the band. With all the emotions running in high gear, no wonder this was their best album yet. I had to watch it a couple of times...Remarkable video about a remarkable band."
1,"excellent This DVD is fanstatic, the interviews are great the band has made it through all the tough times, they are going to have with each other and come out the other side.This insight to this classic album is just great a wonderful look, into their lives and problems they where having at the time.Now we can rely see and hear the rumours album the way it was.Now all that needs to happen, is for the record company to get off there back sides and re-issue the cd digitally remastered. While there at it do a new greatest hits digitally remastered, would be great too."
1,"Awsome documentary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you love the Stevie and Lindsey era your going to love this CD!!! This is jam packed with interview with the entire band, how they got started, and all the ups and downs thru the years."
1,"It's all good! This timer is AWESOME! It's very easy to install, and because it operates on a 9 volt battery, I won't hafta replace as often as my old timer that used 3 AAs"
1,"Solid water timer I first bought a Ray Padula deluxe water timer.Returned that because it was terrible.Couldn't even keep time!Cheap cheap cheap.Ordered a couple of these and so far impressed.Quality feel and function, made in Germany.I had no problems programming this, very logical.Worked perfectly so far.No comparison to the Ray Padula Time It Deluxe Water Timer.The Claber is like a Mercedes, the Padula, a Kia.But, that is really unfair to Kia.Spend the extra few dollars and return it if I'm wrong."
1,"If I was stranded on a desert island with one album... If I was stranded on a desert island with one album it would be this one. One deep complex song after another. Put on the headphones, close your eyes and take a trip into a world where the beat never ends and melodies play with your emotions."
1,"Under Italy's Skin Virginia Ryan gives what no standard travel book could even approach: the authentic feel, taste and emotions of Italy, all interwoven in a fascinating personal story. It reads like a novel, yet takes you into an Italy that few tourists could hope to glimpse. Frances Mayes pales in comparison. I'd recommend it for anyone going to Italy, or who would like to go there in their armchair. It's a great, adventurous, authentic read. I loved it."
1,"Motifs for stitchers This is a wonderful book: the spiral bound format makes it perfect to work from. The motifs themselves are clearly presented and lend themselves to stitching on all manner of items.From bookmarks to babywear, from towels to tableclothes: there is something here for every stitcher!Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
1,"Highly recommended In this extremely useful book for understanding the poetry of Wallace Stevens, Lensing effortlessly traces the poet's life and development as those were important in determining the sort of writer Stevens would become. Many Stevens poems are explicated in terms of their original context, and a lot of fascinating information is provided about the nature of the poetry ""establishment"" of the early 20th century, and how important such sponsorship and networking was for Stevens' emergence as a major voice.This book deserves much more attention from Stevens fans that it seems to enjoy. It is very well written, a work of erudition and scholarship that avoids the all of the pedantry and other typical negatives of its genre. If you're a reader of Stevens, this is a book well worth owning."
1,"Brings Pogroms & Antisemitism into a sharp perspective. Potok, a master of the written word and an accomplished artist, recreates New York ""ghetto-life"" and makes it live through the eyes and life of a young boy growing up in New York between the two World Wars. The sensitive reader will experience unthinking hate, intolerance, love, intellect, and most of all, the perserverance of the human spirit--a vividly painted portrait of human existence and spirituality."
1,"The Gentle, Sensitive Intellectual Averse to books (and movies) with gratuitous sex and violence? Try Chaim Potok. His books tend to honor the gentle, sensitive intellectual (see Elaine Aron's writings on highly sensitive people). In this book, you follow the childhood of David Lurie, a Jewish boy growing up in 1930s and '40s Bronx (New York). An early injury leaves him physically weak and vulnerable to teasing, but his scholarly talents, vivid imagination, and tight-knit community allow him to grow into a fine young adult with the courage to forge his own way, even when that means challenging some of the religious values of his family and friends."
1,"A smart analysis of an understudied aspect of culture The movie industry in India is the world's largest. Steve Derne's book takes this idea and runs with it, using the film industry as a lens for focusing on Indian men's ideas about gender. It's a commonplace that, while people might not talk about their personal attitudes with a stranger, they are more than willing to discuss similar issues in their favorite films, and thus this report (as the very good previous review shows) reveals some surprising insights about how Indian men perceive the construction of masculinity.This book, unlike many sociological texts, is both scholarly and readable, and would make a good addition to undergraduate or graduate courses in area and gender studies. Highly recommended."
1,"PERFECT! This item came earlier than expected! It is everything I wanted and more! I speak Italian, so it was easy to read the instructions. You can change it to English if you like...SUPER SIMPLE! GRAZIE!"
1,"It challenged me to take ""my game"" of life up another notch ""A great book that motivates you to reflect on your current life and challenges you to be and do better. It made me wonder what people at my funeral would say to each other about me and the inpact I had on them, others, my profession and my community. It challenged me to take ""my game"" of life up another notch to live my life in a way that I can be proud of my signature work."""
1,"Dianna Booher is a great life coach Those most likely to read this book will be those who are basically good people and they want to be even better. This book will help them. Those who Should read this book are all people who need a shot in the arm, a feeling of hope, a renewed sense of self confidence. This book will transform them!Dianna Booher is a unique thought leader in the field of personal and professional growth. She not only knows and lives the concepts, she also fully understands the steps to take. And she shows the rest of us the paths in her many wonderful works. The sports metaphor used to structure the book gives it a refreshing and memorable flow. You will love the book and like yourself even better after reading it."
1,"That wonderful laugh! Many here have commented how more relaxed Barbra appears to be on this live performance disc compared to earlier ones.No where is this more evident than in the many instances you hear her infectious, lilting laugh.As a student of Ms. Streisand I always treasued those brief moments of hearing that laughter on earlier concert recordings.She says she has been enjoying the concert tour and all that heartfelt laughter we hear is testament to that fact. But I guess it's not surprising that someone who sings so gloriously laughs so gloriously also."
1,"BABS IS WELL AND STILL A HEAVY HITTER!! Streisand: Live In Concert (2 CD's)Her voice is stronger than ever. She's obviously had work done but still looks like an incredible diva. Surprisingly, her numbers with Il Divo are terrific and they are choreographed so she is like a Greek goddess and they are her chorus. It's also nice she does old songs from ""Funny Girl"" that she has never performed in concert before. A must have CD set at any price."
1,Like Buttah! Saw Barbra in Atlanta and this is a wonderful album to bring back the memory of an unforgettable experience! I just hope there is a DVD planned!
1,Streisand: Live in Concert (2 CD's) This is one of the best CD's of all her concerts. I was lucky enough to go to her concert in Los Angeles and it was fantastic. The CD makes you feel as if you are there listening to her wonderful voice. ILDivo performs and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a Streisand fan.
1,"A pocket encyclopedia of writing style Bring your style reference everywhere you write. An unbeatable classic. Every time I open it up, I find something to use in what I'm working on."
1,"OMG.....THIS FILM IS SOOOO WORTH UR $$$ I, personally, am not a lesbian. I would recommend this movie to any of the ""GaY Phobia"" people. The fact that Mirren turns out to be a lesbian has no baring on the emotions you will express while watching this film. It has a wonderful cast of characters and exceptional use of words. I would recommend this to anyone 13 yrs or older, of any gender, and any sexual prefrence."
1,"Great monitor! I've been using this monitor for about 2 weeks now. Easy to set up, works great! No dead pixels. I'm using the analog input for my old PC and the DVI input for me new PC. Even my 7 year old PC looks great on this using the analog input! Minor complaint: have to hit a few menu buttons to toggle between analog and DVI inputs, wish there was a toggle button so it could be done in a single push. Haven't used the built-in speakers yet. The monitor tilts up and down just fine. Overall, great monitor!"
1,Surprised This is my first Madeleine Wickham's book that I have read and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was! It was a slow start but once I got into it I couldn't put it down!!! I will definitely read more of her books!!!
1,"LOVED IT! I must say that I was very impressed with ""Cocktails for Three!"".You read about the tales of 3 best friends who meet at a Manhattan Bar the same night every month. They get to catch up on everything that is going on with their lives.Maggie is pregnant. Roxanne has been dating a married man for 6 years. Candice has such a warm heart and can't seem to say ""NO.""The end of the book will throw you for a loop. As other reviews have said, you will not see it coming.This book kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next to the (3) characters. I am sure that you will be able to identify a personal friend of yours for Maggie, Roxanne and Candice. I was able to finish in just (1) day which is rare for me.I can't wait to check out Wickman's other two books.Enjoy!"
1,"My Favorite Shakespeare The language wraps you up and transports you to a time and land like no other. It's full of love, hate, brutality, and loyalty. All these emotions get tangled up and mixed together. That lends itself to an amazing set of circumstances. There is no greater love story than Juliet and her fair Romeo. All other love stories are measured against this one and you will get lost in this classics story. It's a true classic."
1,"True Love The play's setting is the Italian city of Verona where Romeo and Juliet, the star-crossed lovers, face authorianism with a blood feud between each other's family, the Montegues and the Capulets. At a feast, Romeo notices and is struck by Juliet's beauty. At the first opportunity he approaches her; they fall in love immediately. Only after parting do they learn that they belong to rival families. The two exchange vows and decide to marry the next day, expecting that they will bring peace to the feuding families. Many deaths resulted from this relationship. Romeo and Juliet is one of the best romantic stories in history which motivated many people to rethink hatred against one another. It captures the essence of true love."
1,this book makes it very easy to understand the writing in this book. this book makes it so much easier to understand the context of this book. there are definitions of some of the words that are almost impossible to understand. there are character explainations as well. very good version for a student!
1,"Best play ever! This is definitely the best play of all time! If you have never read it, then you should as soon as possible!"
1,A Old Novel It a old novel but a good one that u can more then one time. A lot school use it for English reading.
1,"Shakespeare&#65533;s books are complicated and awful! The first time I read one of Shakespeare book was at school, I thought is was going to be amazing because he is one of the most recognised writers in history. But I couldn't understand anything; it has a very old and complicated language that young people can't understand well enough. I think that all that style is very complex for us, older people could understand it well and enjoy it. But in that case I would only recommend it to women, I really don't think men will like all that kind of love stories as this one, where two people are strongly in love and that is a forbidden one by their families. I recognise that is has a very good ending but that's all. This is my personal opinion, you may like it. I have my respect for William Shakespeare but I think he is awful."
1,Great book This book not only a classic but a real journey(not really but just saying) the only thing I dislike about this book is the names at the sides. If you are looking for a script this is the best thing told use. Plus at the book defines some uncommon words with numbers beside them that are defined in the next page. A true five star book!
1,An Amazing Compilation I stumbled upon this set one day at a store and I initially purchased it based on some of the familiar artists on the track listing. What I had purchased turned out to be probably the best compilation of downtempo music I've ever heard. From start to finish on both discs I can't turn it off. If you're not enjoying it directly the compilation makes for excellent background music if you're having friends over to enjoy some drinks. I recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of downtempo music.
1,Was great shape. Like new just little wear around the edges the binding does not have a crease and pages are cripse. Over all I'm very happy.
1,Fabulous I bought the pillow covers and the mattress covers and they are great. They wash and dry well and do exactly the job they should.....protecting pillows and mattresses.
1,"breathtaking Even though, this album was not critics' favorite, give it a try. You'll be mesmerized! Its pulsating hypnotic melodies will drive you to the ecstasy and force you to listen to it again and again. I must admit that by being Yello's fan I can not be very objective in describing their work. But after so many years since I've heard album for the first time and after so many changes in my personal taste in the popular music, it is still one of my favorites. It is quite simply THE BEST CD TO LISTEN IN THE CAR by any artist. And hey, if all you know about Yello is infamous OH YEAH, consider this: it is not even in the best five of this album. What can I say more! Enjoy."
1,"Consecrated Masterpiece. I got goosebumps in 1987 the first time I heard Dr. Van Steiner @ 1'26"", still today in 2011 the same.Let me take this CD to heaven."
1,"Another Roundup of His Classics If you're a long time Jobim fan (or just a fan of music) - you'll have all these tracks scattered across various CD's and LP's - if you want a roundup of his some of his greatest romantic/chill/ lounge and quiet bossa tracks - this is really another greatest hits package. The version of DINDI is backed by Astrud Gilberto. Elis Regina joins him on a couple tracks also. For longtime fans who might want a convenient CD to put in the car or have ready a romantic evening CD with his ""quiet"" classics, no reason not to add this to your collection. For new fans, this is a great starter CD but you'll be buying many more of Jobim's - no reason not to start with this one :-)"
1,Excellent Resource on Problem Pregnancy I have worked in an abortion clinic for over twenty years and Anne Baker's work is required reading for all new counselors on our staff. In addition her book is an excellent resource for the seasoned counselor. Her expertise and sensitivity in dealing with a host of patient issues relating to abortion becomes apparent in the first few pages of this manual. She also manages to provide useful guidelines to help clinic staff deal with the special stresses involved in working in an abortion clinic.
1,"Your child's self esteem well, what can i say? i love it because i needed it, i do believe the seller should have given the book more credit, they should have categorized it VERY good, in the ""condition"" it was.. i am more than please, i started reading it for class already and i actually did grow fond of this book its very interesting and filled with knowledge!"
1,"Strongly recommend it I am half way through the book and am enjoying every page of it. The author seems to be enlightened as well, which makes the read more enjoyable. God bless her soul. My condolensces to her loved ones (she seems to have passed away on Sep 21, 2012)."
1,NOT YOUR TYPICAL CHARLES MANSON/HELTER SKELTER BOOK MANSON IN HIS OWN WORDS ALLOWS YOU THE READER TO SEE THINGS FROM MANSON'S POINT OF VIEW. I WAS IMPRESSED HOW CHARLES MANSON DID NOT DOWN PLAY HIS ROLE IN ANY OF HIS HORRIBLE CRIMES. HE OWNED UP TO THEM AND REALISTICALLY POINTS OUT HOW HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONTENT SPENDING HIS LIFE BEHIND BARS. HE ALSO ALLOWS THE READERS TO SEE HOW THE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WERE IN FACT RESPONSIBILE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS. I'VE READ MANY BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE MANSON FAMILY AND I MUST SAY THIS WAS DEFINETELY A WELCOME DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW ON THE SUBJECT.
1,"Great Ep this rocks they are right now one of the best bands out. Mirror Spirit is one of the best songs to come out in a long time. The only band out that is better then these guys right now is silvertide, and possibly Rose Hill Drive. Sounds like classic 70's 60's rock and roll. The singer has a great voice, I believe his name is Eric Shea and there lead guitarist is a girl but she can really play. Expect to see these guys again because this completly rocks out. Rock and Roll is here to Stay.down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.The DarknessJetHurricane PartyParchman Farm (Only have an ep out but it rocks and you can find it here on amazon.)Rose Hill Drive ( have an ep out but not on amazon. They toured with Van Halen and completly rock and the guitarist is incredible.)SupagroupTokyo DragonsYoung Heart AttackBlack Keysand the best new band Silvertide"
1,"Comfort This earset must be tried; it is nothing like what you used as a kid. It fits well, is light and guess what - no hands!"
1,Great book I enjoyed this book. I needed to read a book like this. There are feelings I need to change about myself and this book made me realize it.
1,"Hard SF makes a comeback After many years wandering lost amid fantasy mislabeled SF, and turning in desperation to the oldies but goodies written by Niven, Zelazny, and their ilk, I stumbled onPushing Ice. Fabulous! Enough explanation that this non-physics major can follow (or pretend to), with plenty of action. The typical male failure (sorry, guys) to track character development, but it is quite possible (sorry, girls) for a woman to hold an implacable grudge for 50 years or even 18,000. 5 stars for the pleasure to read some really good, and new, hard SF."
1,"A vortex of ideas.... Other reviewers mention technologies and relationship to previous stories. Yes, but I would add that Pushing Ice is a major novel featuring complex, believable female protagonists. They deal with frustration and competition on an intellectual level; in a first-contact story, there is a lot of both. People change only gradually (clinging to old beliefs) as the universe changes drastically around them.Several chapters build toward crises, and I hesitated to start the next because some character faced certain defeat. But few disappeared, and new scientific concepts are thereby introduced. The last chapter really does not end the tale- you will find yourself wondering what the crew of Rockhopper will encounter next. This book really pulls you into their lives."
1,Great Book! I am a huge Dali fan and this is another one of those books that gives a great insight into the man's thoughts and feelings.
1,"This was a terrific book!!!! I have read many books about the Lindbergh kidnapping. I feel Lloyd Gardner's book is thoroughly and thoughtfully researched. I have read it twice carefully and each time I read it I discovered new information. Who was John Condon? Why did Violet Sharpe commit suicide? Why did Lindbergh act so strangely the night of March 1,1932? Does a parent call his attorney before calling the police when he suspects his 20 month old child is missing? There are so many bizarre events surrounding the disappearance of the Lindbergh baby that it is no surprise that Lloyd Gardner titled his book ""The Case That Never Dies"". The trial was a farce and a circus: an embarrassment to the State of New Jersey. Read it!!!!"
1,"Amazing wealth of info Almost 500 pages! The author, Fritz Springmeier, shares a tone of info that's mind blowing. It may not all be 100% true yet just a fraction of it being true is astounding. A highly recommended read.This book, though out of print, is freely available in PDF format, at the time of writing this review. If you search for its title on Yahoo there will be some links showing the PDF format for download. One of the sites it can be found on is ministryoflies-com.Springmeier also has a one hour video that can be freely watched. It's also under the same title as the book, and can be better found by searching with Google in the Video section of the search options. It's not as comprehensive as the book but worthwhile. God bless."
1,"Great Book This is a really great Animal Ark Pets book. A new boy named Jack moves into Welford. Mandy and James know he's sad so they try to get him to adopt a rabbit, but Jack doesn't want one. Then at a picnic the rabbit is in danger. Will Jack be able to save him in time?"
1,"REALLY RECOMMEND! I just bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it and is playing with it every day! She was very excited pulling out the puppies to see how many the mommy would have. I would really recommend this toy, especially to those who love puppies!"
1,"If you want to buy an edition of this album, this is the one When it was announced that this remastered CD version would reveal new things to even the most accustomed Klaatu fan, I was skeptical. Then I heard it. No other CD edition comes remotely close to this one! My only, _singular_ gripe is that an extra crossfade was added between True-Life Hero and Doctor Marvello (which the band insists was wanted by them ever since the first days of the album, and that they had passed on it on the original release simply because they had maxxed out their studio's capacities). Apart from that, this is an amazing reissue! And now that Hope is ready and on its way, I'm looking forward to hearing that remastered issue as well. Unreal!...Oh, and the album is really great as well. They're _not_ the Beatles, time has proven us that... but this album is worthy of the Beatles moniker! Sun King it is."
1,"A Summary of George and Joy Adamson's work This is a great summary program about all of the work George and Joy Adamson did. It features Elsa, Boy, Christian, and the lives and personalities of George and Joy. A lot of perspective from Mrs. McKenna who played Joy in the film."
1,A Mostly True Adventure One of my top books of my 7 decades of reading! Love the way it's told in the voice of the 13-year-old. Great descriptions of the French setting in the country!!
1,"Absolutely awesome service and product I ordered this card yesterday (19 Oct 2006) and received it today (20 Oct 2006), free shipping with Prime - excellent service.The card?I installed it in my Quicksilver in 3 minutes and 2 minutes later my USB 2.0 300GB external disk drive was screaming through a complete backup.No need to go to the vendor's web site for drivers - Tiger supports it out of the box. Superb value."
1,"Perfectly Imperfect If you can only afford one Ella songbook set, make Ellington the one. Ella and Duke are perfectly matched. Having her sing with the composer is a unique feature of this set. There is an exuberant spontaneity here which is unmatched by any other songbook album. This mean that there are some imperfections and improvisations, and that's what jazz is. The material is fabulous. The obvious reciprocal adoration and respect of these two legends permeate everything. It is one of the all time great jazz albums ever. Not to be missed."
1,"THE MOST UNUSUAL IN THE SONGBOOK SERIES Even if i could have done without the third disc,this tribute to DUKE ELLINGTON really hits home ,and is a must buy for anyone interested in these two legends of jazz.ELLA takes more chances here than in previous and later records of the series ,and this is probably due to DUKE himself who took an active part by creating new songs and rearranging a few of his classics.CARAVAN shows ELLA in a rare sensual mood ,and does she delivers?All the well known songs of ELLINGTON are present, from MOOD INDIGO to SOPHISTICATED LADY.The only songbook celebrating a non BROADWAY composer was indeed worth its price."
1,"Why isn't there a 6-star rating? Well... I really despise reading. I hate it with a passion. There has never been a time when I decide to just ""pick up a book"" for a good time, I usually won't even consider that in my plans. However, a few summers ago I picked up King Rat. And I picked it up again a few weeks later. I lost it, but bought it last summer. I finished it in a weekend because I just couldn't put it down. I read it again a couple weeks ago. Every time you finish that book, something just comes over you, I swear it. It's the most amazing book I have ever, or will ever read in my entire life. Now that that's done, I can go paint my nails."
1,"KIng Rat, tied with Shogun, is the best of Clavell's Asian.. King Rat, tied with Shogun, is the best of Clavell's Asian Saga. He incorporated, and illustrated the very core of what it is to be a man. What makes this book an instant classic, is the simple, yet horrific, setting. Also, Clavell was able to fill each page with such meaning, he didn't have to make a several-hundred-page-behemoth of a book in order to digest the meaning within it. Compelling was the depth that a man falls to in such a desolate existance, and the measures required to lift a man up to some degree of dignity. For his ability to depict the strength of charicter of this western man in asia, Clavell has earned a place of honor among the great novellest of our time."
1,"Enjoyed Reading It! I found this to be a very entertaining and insightful book. That the author lived through the experience is clear as one reads. Although some of the subplots died off with no explanation and the ending was a bit anticlimactic, overall it kept me turning the pages and I finished it in two days. Some of the dialogue remains with me to this day like from a dying man:(paraphrasing here) ""From nothing and into nothing with 22 years in-between, seems kind of pointless doesn't it?"" I recommend this book as one any fan of WWII fiction should read."
1,This is one of the best novels ever writen. I rated this book as high as book godfather and brave new world !
1,"Love Mozart Loved the documentary about Mozart. I learned things I never knew about him. Too bad he died so young, can you imagine the amount of music he could have written?"
1,"Children like this book My children (ages 5-10) love this book. I have also read from this book to hospitalized teenagers; when I read Oedipus I finished the story and heard a chorus of ""read it again!""I noticed that some of the reviews posted here say that this book is unsuitable for children, but I wonder if the reviewers actually tried reading the book to them."
1,"Put Ramsey in Your Musical Stocking It was never offically Christmas until my mother hooked up the Jingle Bells door chime and my father put Ramsey Lewis "" Sound of Christmas"" on our HiFi. This is a fantastic holiday treat. I have loads of Christmas music, but I place this recording very high in my December rotation. The strings that play on"" What Are You Doing New Years Eve?"" and the bouncy ""Sleigh Ride"" take me back to the Wonder Years of my youth. I believe it will become an evergreen in your collection. Happy Holidays or as Ramsey puts it...Merry Christmas Baby !"
1,"I'm in w/ the 'In' crowd' This was a real find! I've always been a Ramsey Lewis fan since I'm in w/ the In-crowd' hit of the '60's! A nice easy 'laid back' compilation of Christmas songs. Add this to your Christmas CD's, you won't be disappointed!!"
1,Excellent Sporty Shoe This is my best shoe purchase in a long time. Sporty look. Comfortable. Perfect fit. I wear them every chance I get.
1,Perfect shoes Another masterpiece from Rockport. I recently purchase these shoes and I am so happy with this product. It is very comfortable. Its worth every single penny.
1,"Gentle Explanation This book is a thorough and gentle explanation of the how the process of forgiveness works, and how completeness in our own lives (we who have been hurt and need to forgive the person(s) who hurt us) can be attained through the five stages of forgiveness. It is also a gentle and compassionate explanation of how hurts affect the various aspects of our lives. Linn's format is easy to read and to understand. A must for anyone's bookshelf."
1,"Gets to the root of the issues This book, based on Kuebler Ross five stages of death & dying, is a wonderful way to work through life's hurts, giving us permission to take our anger, pain, bargaining, to God in prayer & allow Him to show us how to stop letting the past continue to hurt us in the present. The section on the unconditional love of Christ is healing in its presentation. I have used it over & over & have loaned this book out to my friends in need."
1,Just like the other ''STREET'' Games This is an awsome game for the psp. You should definetely pick this game up at a store. There are party play games which include ''shot blocker'' and ''arcade shootout''. There is wireless head to head mode. This game also includes ea's pocket trax which is when you get to listen to any of the songs from the game. Also King of the court mode. So pick this game up its awsome!!!blue
1,"Love Mercer Mayer Every Mercer Mayer book is a hit. I try to buy all the new titles, and my grandkids love them! The art work & the stories are great for adults & children."
1,"Insight Guide Bali Insight Guide Bali is an exceptional travel guide. The history is well written and rich with interesting facts. I reads like a good novel. The maps are deteiled with plenty of cross references. There are plenty of travel tips from riding a bus to how to order food without MSGS. It appears that every possible travel issue has been addressed; from how not to get arrested to finding the swank resorts. The book is worth the price just for the exquisite pictures. I have never seen a travel book with photos as exceptional as these. Usually I purchase a couple of guide books before going to a new location, but this time I will only use the Insight Guide Bali."
1,"Valuable companion to Harry Smith This 1973 book is keyed to Harry Smith's famed music anthology, now available on CD. It is edited by Josh Dunson and Ethel Raim, and includes interviews with Moses Asch and Frank Walker, as well as song lyrics, chords (for many but not all songs on the Anthology) new anecdotes, and very nice b & w photos of artists and rural scenes (folks hanging out on front porches, etc.) Some of the anecdotes are a bit disturbing--about Bascam Lunsford's racism and anti-semitism, for example--but it'll save ear-strain trying to grasp some of the numbers. May not be worth the hefty price being asked here, but a nice volume for those of us drawn to this strange, exciting music."
1,"Feminisim restored to flesh, blood, & fire. The blockheadedness & utter insensitivity of the two reviews below, in an open forum such as this, demand a response.Frances Sherwood's reimagining of the life of the brave Mary Wollstonecraft, the woman who wrote the groundsbreaking ""Vindication of the Rights of Women,"" proves quite the equal of her subject. Sherwood brilliantly recreates her protagonist's haunted Enlightenment world, at once alive with new ideas & half-smothered in medieval fears & prejudice. Better still, however, her history goes far beyond the merely correct, investing its conflicts with the chilled yet heightened humanity they must've engendered at the time. The ""Mary"" of this book has the wallop of her namesake, providing a new testament to women's toil & tragedy while never losing her humor, her smarts, or her desires."
1,Masterpiece I've listened to heavy metal/hardrock music for close to 20 years now and this is the one record in 10 years that have made me go WOW! At first i didn't think this record was much to have but it grew on me and now i just love it. This record is one that can and will stand the test of time. I'm sure that this record will remembered as a hardrock classic if Evergrey makes it outside Sweden. Tom's voice cries with agony and you can't help to get swept away along with it.
1,"The Best Italian Vegan Cookbook Ever!!!!!!! Bryanna has created the absolute best cookbook ever! My friend originally bought this and when she told me I should get it, I remarked ""why would I need an Italian cookbook, I know how to cook vegan Italian!"" I was then treated to several meals at my friend's apt. where she used Nonna's Italian Kitchen and was I wowed!!! I couldn't believe how delicious these recipes are and how satisfying - much better than anything I've ever had as a non-vegan! Now every year for my birhday, my friend knows what I want for my birthday meal from her- the lasagna al forno Bolognese on page 113 - to die for (or to live for really!). Buy this book - all my non-vegan friends love the dishes and can't believe it's not dairy!"
1,"Like being on vacation in Tuscany! This is a wonderful book with a nice combination of quick and other more involved recipes. I love Grogen's side notes on the recipes and her comments in the beginning of the book. The recipes are divided up into courses of an authentic Italian meal, so it's easy to plan a full menu, or just a single dish. These dishes would appeal to anyone, vegan or not. These are good, wholesome meals. Grogan mentioned in the introduction that Italian was her favorite cuisine with Chinese and Indian running a close second. Maybe she could be convinced to write a Chinese Vegan cookbook next?"
1,"That's Italian! This book is not only a must for vegan kitchens but for everyone who likes Italian food. The recipes make very authentic tasting vegan versions of popular dishes. My vegan friends are enjoying this food too, always the best sign."
1,"More Excellent Instruction from the Hoopnotica Team As with their first dvd, the instruction in this is clear and detailed. The pace is faster than in the first dvd, and they do not cover as many moves, but it is still worth it."
1,"The Island Keeper Out of the hundreds of books I have read through out my life, this book remains one of the most endearing to me. Maybe it is the way Cleo triumphs over her life troubles and struggles that I like. Or maybe it was something that I would have liked to do as a girl-escape and make my own pathway toward learning about myself. We are reading this book in our book review group in March 06 and I am so excited to share this with my adult friends who maybe by reading it will have gained an appreciation for this young 16 year old hero."
1,"beautiful This was a can't-miss concept, and the result was even greater than I assumed it would be. Frisell proves himself as an imaginative orchestrator, never heavy-handed. The feeling of the album is light but substantive, effervescent but always grounded in the deep well of musicianship brought to the project by Frisell, Costello/Bacharach, and a lineup that includes such giants as Brian Blade, Don Byron and Cassandra Wilson."
1,"infinite tonal possibilities This is about the most versatile bass amp I've ever had. It's very clean and punchy and has plenty of power. with two preamps, a compressor, a graphic eq and high and low contour controls, this amp covers it all. Hard to beat for the price."
1,"Always the Best... The woman known to rock and roll history as Tina Turner proves once again why she is, and will always be, the ""Queen of Rock and Roll."" Fiery and dynamic."
1,This is super!!!!! Miss Turner never fades!!!! She will always be number one!!!. This is a must see for everyone young and old alike!!!! Grrrrrreat Show!!!!!
1,"A truly entertaining concert Tina Turner outdoes herself! She really knows how to work a stage (almost a lost talent in the MTV era), and the music is first-rate. It is no wonder that the entire tour was such an incredible success. Turner also surrounded herself with first-rate musicians and dancers. I heartily recommend this video to anyone."
1,"What a show! This is a great DVD of a great performance. If you think Tina Turner is just ""okay"", you'll be a real fan after seeing her in concert in Amsterdam. Tina is full of energy, the dancers and musicians do a magnificent job, the camera work is exceptional, and the DTS sound is phenomenal. Among the best concert DVDs out there."
1,Good Read. Book was a little hard to get started on but once into it was quite interesting. Written different than what I am ;used to
1,"A Page Turner Ivan Doag has captured my attention. After reading this great adventure story, I intend to order more books written by this author. His ability to create dialogue and tell a fascinating tale is remarkable. My only wish is for a sequel."
1,"bithday gift it was a gift for my son he use to have the smaller version years ago . so, when i saw this i new he would enjoy it. thank you."
1,Excelent product! I definitely like this. All the features that has makes this product smooth and easy to operate.Definitely recommended.
1,"Sansa View 8GB, very nice little unit. I bought it to use for taking my Unbox videos mobile. Great, clear little screen. Very easy to use, very easy to transfer media, very compatable with Unbox, Windows Media, Rhapsody and Yahoo Music (which will soon be Rhapsody, too). Can't load my photos on it, but I think that's more of a problem with my computer rather than the Sansa Media Converter. (It originally worked until I started messing a bit with it, and it was easy to use, too. Will fix the problem when I find the time. Until then, it's not a big deal.) Expansion slot is a big plus. The View automatically senses what media is being loaded and adjusts accordingly, a feature that is absent in the E250, which I also have. Great sound with the right earphones. Loads of space. What else can I say that hasn't already been said. I love my little View and hope it lasts a long time. Good price at Amazon, as always."
1,"Great little mp3 I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player! Saved myself a little money and don't look like everyone else out there."
1,"sandisk sansa I am proud that the item purchased on amazon, and therefore recommends to cybernauts to use and buy on Amazon because so far is a trusted site and find everything you need to this.SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB Video MP3 Player (Black)"
1,Years of Knowledge I loved this book. I am in the process of becoming a public speaker and wanted to be very affective with the people I speak to. This book helped me to make sure my workshop is designed in the correct order to teach from A to B rather than floundering around from one to another topic never smoothly progressing toward the ultimate goal. I am well on my way to become an excellent public speaker.
1,As Expected It was what I expected it was and told me what I needed to know. It's a very worthwhile purchase
1,"Another great book by Kin Platt! This is the sequel to Kin Platt's excellent mystery ""Sinbad and Me"". All the great characters are back: adventurous teenager Steve, his heroic bulldog Sinbad, girlfriend Minerva, her suspicious dad the Sheriff, Herk, all investigating goings on involving witches, mandrake root, and a deadly bracelet. What a great book! If you are ten on up, you'll love it! If you are an old person, you will still love it!"
1,Wonderful Recipes for a Quick and Healthy Meal! Another great purchase of the Sandra Lee cookbooks to add to my collection. Recipes so quick and easy to prepare. ~ Thank you Sandra Lee for making cooking enjoyable again for women everywhere!
1,great cookbook this is one of sandra lee's best ever. The recipes are easy to make and best of all delicious.
1,"One of the best Good variety of recipes, complete with brand names and suggestions....pictures are gorgeous. Good for the new or experienced but busy cook."
1,"Semi-Homemade I love this book! Its such a fresh concept, especially for a full time working mother of 3. Full of great time saving ideas!This is a great christmas gift for people who love to cook, but dont necessarily have the time."
1,The best and most comprehensive report of the Manson murders Who better to write a book on the Manson family murders than the prosecutiing attorney. Vincent Bugliosi captures what actually happened during those two nights in 1969. Through testimony of his witnesses he gets eye-witness truths abouy Manson and his family. The best book I've ever read.
1,"Helter Skelter I was 16 years old the summer of 1969 and remember it vividly. I didn't read Helter skelter until I was 22, when it first came out and learned for the first time many of the detail, and the book truly stays in your mind. That is what most of the other reviews say that it haunts you for many years and you actually feel that you are there on that hot summer night, Sharon and Jay talking in the bedroom and a strange woman walks in and orders them to the living room. How terrifying could it have been for Sharon watching Jay die in front of her and Frykowski and Folger fighting for their lives knowing very well her unborn child and her couldn't defend themselves. Bugliosi wrote with such compassion for the victims and we can truly thank him that these people are behind bars now. Watching Charles Manson talk on television shows how unremorseful he is and will always be."
1,"I could not put this book down... I found this book very interesting and disturbing. It's all the details you would want to know about the Charles Manson case.To think that one man could convince people to carry out such horrendous crimes. That he had such skill in story telling and making people follow him blindly. I enjoyed reading all the details of the case and how evidence would come up and start up new leads. Bugliosi did an excellent Job of walking us through the crime, and all the way through to the Trial.I could not put the book down. It's a definite page turner, and has many photo's of the victims, the killers and the evidence. Not for the squeamish, very detailed."
1,"Helter Skelter Fantastic! I have read this book twice. I love the way the author narrates the real life drama of these murders, murderers and inefficiency of the LAPD. It is probably one of the scarriest books I have read so far. The author does a great job of explaining the psychological influences of Charles Manson and the crazy/hipnotic behavior of the Manson Family. He also paints a very clear picture of the long and difficult trial and the obstacles that needed to be overcome to convict Manson and his followers. It's a very interesting book from a psychological and legal stand point. I probably will read it again some time soon because the second time around helped me understand even more, the real-life occurences and legal complexities of this case."
1,"One of the best true crime stories ever written In the begining of the book it reads ""This book will scare the hell out of you"" and was that ever an understatement. Charles Manson and his crew will always be the ultimate in evil. The only time you will put this book down is to sleep, that is, if you can."
1,"Made a great gift! My husband has always wanted to add Helter Skelter into his book collection and today he opened it as a Christmas gift. It's four hours later and he's still reading it, pausing every now and again to tell me some other disturbing connection that was made between music and the murders. This was his perfect gift!"
1,"Good, but just one objection your honor! This is a fascinating account of the Manson case from the eyes of prosecution attorney Vincent Bugliosi. Well paced, haunting, somewhat grissly, but suprisingly quite funny in places- (the defense attorney made over two hunderd objections on the first three days of the trial!). A real pager turner probably best read in the daytime so it won't give you nightmares. One quible though I feel the author has grossly misinterpreted the philiosophy of Friedrich Nietzche by affilating his philiosophy with the spread of Nazism. Yes Hitler (who shared with Manson many characteristic's; they were both loved animals more than humans, each a vegetarian, and had spent time as an ""outsider"" living on the fringes of society) had read his work. Yet those documents he read were greatly adulterated under the cursed hand of the authors sister, who, after the philosophers death re wrote his manuscripts to fit Nazi ideals in the hope of courting parties leader..."
1,"A scary, captivating tale This book is certainly not a Pulitzer prize winner, but it is definitely a must read for any true-crime fans. I found myself unable to put the book down for hours. Bugliosi carefully unwinds the horrific details that surround these infamous murders. This book is much more than a gruesome exploitive account. I found myself understanding the late sixties as the tumultuous period that could host this episode in history."
1,"America's best prosecuting attorney is also a great author. This is an excellent book on one of the most horrific crimes ever committed even by today's standards. The research, details, and explanations are absolute top-notch. It is evident that Vincent Bugliosi is one the greatest prosecuting attorneys ever to step into the courtroom. The way he can rationally reconstruct the events of a crime and get into the heads of the criminals and lay out their motives is just amazing. The courtroom drama is re-created in dramatic detail so you can feel the tension, suspense and horror all throughout the trial. We also learn alot about cult psychology and how people can be driven to extreme bahavior. What's even scarier is that there are people in this world like Charles Manson's fanatical followers ready to do his darkest bidding."
1,Most interesting This book by Vincent Bugliosi is by far the best book I have ever read. The Manson murders being the most interesting subject I have ever researched. Being the prosector in the longest trial in American history the author is also an extremly good writer! I recommend this book to anyone and it is well worth the money
1,"Outstanding writing Mr. Bugliosi has been able to make us feel we were there throuhtout this nightmare. This book will keep you on your toes, wondering if you locked all doors at night. For those who had not been born yet like me, is testament that that crazy idiotic losers have been present is every generation, williwng to do the unthinkable. The skills and genious shown on behalf of Bugliosi during this trial is enough to make anyone want to achieve excellence, no matter what the field of expertise may be."
1,"One of my all time favorite books I ordered this book to read on a road trip because I have always been interested in true crime stories.This book, of all the true crime books that I have read, was by far the most gripping and interesting. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book, and I had a hard time putting it down.Even if you do not care for true crime stories, this book is so shocking and well documented. I have since read several books about the Manson family and Tate- La Bianca tragedies and this book is the best out of them all.I strongly recommend reading this book."
1,"One of the most harrowing crime stories ever... I first read ""Helter Skelter"" the same summer I read ""In Cold Blood."" Both books left indelible images in my psyche and ensured I would never look at the world of crime and investigation the same again.I've never read a book quite like HS since. Bugliosi and Gentry have written a taught and gripping blow-by-blow account of the two seemingly unconnected streams of events, the Tate/La Bianca murders and Manson's cult, how they horribly intersected and the breathtaking resolution.Bugliosi's reminiscences provide both the personal anguish that the investigation caused him and his family and the urgent immediacy that gripped him and the community to see that justice was finally done.Unforgettable and unflinching, ""Helter Skelter"" forces us to look into the eyes of evil and learn more about ourselves.See also my reviews of the ""Helter Skelter"" TV movie and the audio book version."
1,Fierce Eden (The Louisiana History Collection) Fierce Eden (The Louisiana History Collection) ~ Another great collection by Jennifer Blake. A Real attention getter. If you like historical romances you will love this collection. I had trouble putting this one down.
1,"Fierce Eden well written, lots of historical info about a period of history that are not too well known. characters were believable, good descriptions of places and time period. was a page turner, sorry when it ended, loved the characters."
1,"Best Toy for my 8 year old son I love this toy for my son. He spends so much time manipulating it and discovering all that it is capable of. This is really his best toy ever. It is a bit difficult to assemble the tanks and green rings, but oveall I highly recommend this toy.Hydrodynamic Deluxe Building Set"
1,"great for card players Works well, especially for arthritic hands. Use it once a week with group I play cards with and having more fun due to less hand pain."
1,"LOVED THEM All of us girls loved the card holders. It did have an odor, but I sprayed them with Fabreeze and let them dry, then washed with soap and water and let them dry again. After that all was fine. We find that we even use them when we have 3 cards left. You can set it on the table and it leaves your hands free for important things--like snacks!"
1,"Boon to Boomers So, if along with inheriting your Mom's Roseville, you also got her arthritic hands, you'll want to check out these nifty card holders. No more achy palms after a hot Canasta hand, no more spilling the cards while sorting, no more locked thumbs......and you can even play relatively hands-free!The Games Dames (of the NC Piedmont Triad) love these little things."
1,Perfect for a ten year old I bought this for my ten year old daughter so she could play canasta with her grandmother. Her little hands did not allow her to hold all the cards. With the card holder she enjoys the game a lot more. I think they are grooming her as a substitute in the Canasta league!
1,National treasure What an incredible compendium. I would like to see the US create something similar to Japan's Cultural National Treasure and Robert Frost would certainly be included as such.
1,"The complete Frost- The road not taken For most of us most poets live through a few poems of theirs we have read in anthologies. It may be that in the case of a poet we especially love we have gone and read most of their poetry.This volume presents a wonderful opportunity for the devotees of Frost to have in one book the work of a lifetime.For me Frost is ""The Road Not Taken"" and ""Birches"" and ""Mending Wall"" and a host of scattered lines, "" Good fences make good neighbors"" and "" The land was ours, before we were the land's"".Frost is also however, I must admit , for me the poet whose life casts a shadow on his work. Unfortunately perhaps I long ago read parts of the Thompson biography of Frost the central theme of which was his inveterate cruelty to all those around him.All this has left me, you will excuse this, a bit 'cool toward Frost' and I personally prefer the more musical metrics of Wallace Stevens to the canny, often pithily wise lines of Frost."
1,"Frost rehabilitated Jay Parini's ROBERT FROST: A LIFE, 1999, may rehabilitate somewhat the view of Frost as terrible person, presented in Lawrence Thompson's earlier biography. See Parini, pp.452 ff. Some reviews may tend to discourage reading Frost, because of Thompson's jaundiced portrait.This wonderful, copious collection of Frost contains many of his best poems, which do not show up in popular anthologies. And his prose is filled with wit and wisdom you might not suspect. A great contribution to our Art and our humanity."
1,"crowsfoot tools never thought i would need these, but they have come in handy numerous times since i bought them. quite well made."
1,"Pure science fiction One of the foundations of SF is examining the consequences of science and technology on society. Here Hogan creates two diametrically opposed societies - those of Earth founded on limited resources and those of the newly colonized planet Chrion having unlimited resources. You won't find deep character development in this book, the focus is on the effects of technology on society - what we can become. Telling the story from the viewpoint of solders on the second colonization starship traveling and landing on the planet Chrion, Hogan explores his vision of what humanity can be. Chrionians value and trade respect, possessions are in abundence and free from automated factories. On the second colonization starship traveling from a militarized Earth, imagine the consequences to those powers to be when character matters! Unlimited resources you ask? Hogan postulates, the mind is a unlimited resource."
1,"Great ear piece adapter The Jawbone bluetooth headset is a great little device, but unfortunately, none of the supplied ear pieces fit comfortable in my ear. I was all ready to return it, when I decided to try these Jabra EarGels. Well, I got them yesterday, and they make a world of difference. The Jawbone now comfortable fits in my ear, the little piece that is supposed to be touching my cheek is doing so. In fact, it is such a good fit I don't even need the other-the-ear hook any more!The EarGels come in three sizes, and are designed to fit the contours of your ear - not just to be shoved in an held in my force. Why JawBone themselves don't make something like this to come with the headset is beyond me, but at least Jabra stepped up to fill the void!"
1,"Bought for Jawbone Bluetooth Headset I bought these to use in place of the earpieces that were included with the Jawbone. With these I am able to remove the bow that goes over the ear and just wear it in my ear. The Jawbone does not fall out of my ear, and I walk all over work without risk of losing it."
1,Good I have not really had a chance to use these but my daughter states that it works for her very well.
1,"It's a keeper! I first looked through this cookbook in another lady's kitchen. She had it all earmarked and I could tell she had tried many of the recipes. I knew this lady was a great cook, so I ordered it myself. I'm pretty picky about which cookbooks I keep. This one is very nice. I love all the seafood recipes. A classic."
1,A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This Oddysey is great for anyone that has a sense of adventure or just likes the Greek myths. It is well done and has a great cast of characters. The movie is a summary of all the adventures Oddyseus had to go through in order to get back to Ithaca- to his wife and son. I highly recommend this movie and give it five full stars.
1,Actioned packed The movie wsa filled with action and lots of special effects....I loved the plot and the sory was meaning full.
1,"The Odyssey I think the movie 'The Odyssey' was great. You would think for this movie that the special effects would be really bad, but they wern't. 'The Odyssey' is about a man called Odissius. He and his wife Penelope had a son. But on the day Oddisiusses son was born he had to go to the Trojan war. The story has many twists and turns as he goes through the jorney of trying to get back home."
1,"Armande Asante, need I say more? This movie is fabulous. Anyone who is a fan of greek mythology or the Roman era would love this movie.I cannot get enough of Armande Asante and this movie portrays him in a way that would make any woman drool.Definitely a great buy. {^_^}"
1,The Odyssey. My review was about The Odyssey.I think that this movie is a good movie to watch and you might learnt something from this story. The Odyssey is about when he had a wife with his baby and he left on a journey after defeating Troy! He met many monsters and many perils over many years! I loved the action and special effects in this movie! It was cool!
1,"Entertainment is not always accurate! I have read and re read all of the reviews for this film and I have to say my two cents. I have been studying Ancient Mythology(mostly Egyptain) for the past ten years. Yes, this film is NOT 100% correct. What film is? History is always open to interpertation. Anyone who does not understand this needs a new hobby. Anyhoo I loved it, Armand Assante was amazing in his role. The rest of the cast was great too. There was a veil of erotitisem throughout the film, which was interesting considering the film wasn't outwardly graphic. Overall, the movie was wonderful. Don't rent this film, buy it! (you'll want to watch it over and over!)"
1,"My family and other animals I read Gerald Durrell's books 10 years ago, while I was still living in Romania. I loved his books from the first page to the last and literally I couldn't put them down until I finished them. The best humour I ever met in books! His stile is unique. I am planning on reading all of them again in English. I would recommend them to anyone!"
1,"Another book of lovely excursions to the island of Corfu This is another wonderful books of Gerald Durrell's memories of his time on the island of Corfu prior to the Second World War. He takes us back to another time and place before the world changed for good.Each chapter is a separate story and rememberence of those days when as a young man he marvels at not only the natural world around him, but also the various people he encounters and learns to appreciate. It is easy to get lost in one of these stories and feel like you are there with him on a hot summer day with his faithful dogs tagging along beside him.I recommend this book to anyone who not only loves nature, but also can appreciate a time gone by when people were different and even strangers were looked as guests. This book is one that I intend to read again and again in the coming years and will appreciate the stories just much each time as the first time."
1,"GReat solution for a special space... Great solution for a special space. I know how difficult is to hang things from a modern ceiling. This item, will solve that problem. Installation is very fast and price was great. Seller was very fast delivering the item. Good job."
1,Psalms Now a moving and useful worship resource After using Psalms Now in Bible study for litergical prayer I decided to try it in a Contemporary Christian Worship setting. The response was phenomenal. Whether it is used as a basis for prayer or in a traditional liturgical style it is a very helpful book to bring the psalmists words to life!
1,"One of the best movies I've ever seen The original Moby Dick book is in some cases better than the movie.... that's true.... but the actors (instead of Patrick Stewart (normally i really love him) his role was good, but tooo nervous and toooo crazy... it didn't sypathize with the other roles... e.g. Starbuck, Ismail ...) the whale was stupid and awful, like in a very low budget film... could be much better... but it's worth to buy it and to watch ....! that's my opinion ... bye and enjoy the time you see moby dick"
1,"Exceptional Movie Just like any movie produced from a book, if you compare it to the book, it will most certainly fall short. If you take the movie in the context that its a dramatic movie made to enthrall you for a couple of hours, than you'll find this movie exceptional. I watch it about twice a year and find it one of the better movies in my personal collection."
1,"Sweet Read It's been a long time since a book kept me up on a week night, but Sweet Hush was that kind of read. I loved the characters, I loved the family, and wondering where they were all going to end up made this a un-put-downable book for me. Wish they'd make a movie of the story! I was already casting it in my head."
1,"Quriky but Fun! I acutally bought this for my kindle and fell so in love with this quirkly little story that I turned around and bought the hardback book for my mom. Deborah Smith has given us this wonderful cast of characters that believe in family and the family business. They love each other, stand up for each other, and will do anything to protect each other. I know the plot has been review by other readers, so let me just say this: it doesn't matter what your genre of reading is, this story will draw you in and keep you entertained. It is a wonder story and a terrific read."
1,Very good introduction to the field The authors takes time to explain the basic hypotheses of statistical mechanics. I believe that it is an excellent introduction to this field.
1,"No better place to start with Stat Mech If you are intrested with studing statistical mechanics then start here. Hill starts from the defintions and postulates of thermodynamics and then moves into applications and problems. You will need to understand Diff EQ for this book.The first chapter took me a week to read and work out the math but then I red the rest in 4 weeks. It is a hard start because Hill develops your background before starting with applications of the theory. I really began to grasp the subject after reading this book. Ohter books will not lay the mathout as well as Hill does. It is a hard read because Hill is so thorough, but the rewasd is well worth the struggle. It is a great introduction and I suggest all of Hill's Stat mech book. Another great bargin from DOVER PRESS.At the price I recomend it to all graduate chemical engineers and chemists"
1,"An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics- Terrel L.Hill An excellent text book for Physical Chemist who want to get sound footing in Statistical Thermodynamics.Inorder to really get a good view of the basics of statistical mechanics the reader really needs to spend an adequate amount of time in digesting the contents of the initial chapter. However, after spending some amount of time in reading those initial chapters, one can grasp the latter parts of the book in a quite interesting fashion.In my opinion, this book is a must for those who want to master the statstical thermodynamics. Infact, one would be really amazed at the standard of the book considering the fact that it is reasonably old. No new standard books on ' Statistical Mechanics' can provide such an adequate foundations as it in this book. I would strongly recommend this book along with the other book 'Statistical Mechanics' by the same author.Sasisanker Padmanabhan"
1,"Perry is now two times as classy! William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon"
1,A very informatinve book! I had to read this book for a class at school and its very well written. This book is very informative and a recommend reading.
1,"SOLID METAL!! Very gald these guys are back, this is the debut album by Hallows Eve and it's brutal, hard edged, pure thrash the way it was ment to be. When I think of the pure 80's thrash metal sound I always think of Hallow's Eve and their first three glorious albums. Solid release, Worth every cent! \m/\m/"
1,"A Fabulous Alternative History I'm not one who normally likes alternative histories, but this is one of the best, most complex Lackey books I've read in ages. The characters, as always, have depth and humor, and the plot is fascinating -- my one question -- will there be a sequel?One word of caution -- those who have read C.J. Cherryh's Merovingen Nights Series may find many aspects of the plot strangely familiar..."
1,"GREAT ENTERTAINMENT. GORGEOUS MOVIE! What a great movie! Entertaining and enjoyable with some very, very funny moments and great acting by Diane Lane. The film is so beautiful to look at on the bigscreen and the story is beautiful and avoids any cliches or sentimentality. A great movie. Very recommnded indeed! 5 stars."
1,"Funny, uplifting, inspiring, beautiful - a GREAT movie! Under The Tuscan Sun is one of those special films that comes along once in a while. It is funny, uplifting, inspiring, beautiful and above all entertaining. This is one of the most enjoyable films I've seen for ages and the acting by Diane Lane and the lovely scenery make it a modern-day classic! 10 stars!"
1,"A guy's persective - actually a GREAT movie! As a guy I was not sure if I would enjoy this film or not. It had Diane Lane in it who I like alot. It had good reviews in the newspapers and magazines. But it also didn't really appeal as subject matter AND I had never read the book either. Having said all of that - I did really enjoy this film. It is funny and enjoyable and has a pleasant, uplifting tone to it. Diane Lane was sexy and again gave a great performance like last years 'Unfaithful' for which she was Oscar nominated. The supporting characters in the movie were very entertaining and the Tuscan hills looked spectacular. This is a very good movie that I would recommend even to other guys. Give it a try."
1,Feel good movie! Love this one and have seen it many times...When you want to watch something sweet and uplifting that makes you smile when it is over - this is the one!
1,"High-art! I must say, i avoided this movie like the plague for a year. It was deemed to me to be just a sacchrine ""chick-flick."" Now I have to ask myself...what were you waiting for? This movie which I now own, definitely deserves more praise and should be essential to anyone intrested in high-art. It's a magical and uplifting tale set in some of the most beautiful locations in Italy. Diane lane sparkles! She carries the film so well you forget she's only acting. A remarkable movie, filled with poignant characters and a heartbreaking story-line. It's message is one that transcends time and gender. Watch and learn...it's fabulous!"
1,So heartwarming and entertaining. A great comedy! So entertaining and enjoyable. A masterful and beautiful comedy that is heartwarming and inspiring. Beautifully acted and shot. Wonderful. 5 stars!
1,:( :( :( I never actually got to watch this movie. It got lost on the trip from my mailbox to my dorm room on campus. I went ahead and gave you 5 stars anyway because I know it would have been in excellent condition.
1,"Magnificent movie! Diane Lane shines! A truly magnificent movie. Diane Lane shines in her role as Frances Mayes in this funny, sweet, enjoyable piece of great entertainment. The director makes this movie so engrossing and enjoyable that it is impossible to not be drawn into the wonderfully realized 3D characters and the brilliant played out scenes. The scenic locations help and so does the likable characters. Make no mistake... this is a magnificent movie."
1,A Must See A great actress and beautiful scenery. It is good to watch a woman coming into her own and growing strong from from what can be a devistating loss. Women will love this and men should watch it at least once.
1,"wonderful movie This is a great movie. Views of the Tuscan towns and other scenery make you want to hop on a plane for Italy. The movie content was both funny, entertaining, and a travel advertisement."
1,"Italy...Take me away! Destined to be a favorite of yours as well, I'm sure. It has everything a chick flick should have...romance, finding strength, empowering substance. If you didn't think you could survive life's pitfalls before...this movie will give you the strength to keep on keepin' on! Funny, entertaining, ensightful and empowering, this movie is a bowl of popcorn and a bottle of wine away from being a classic!"
1,"You're missing the point Superficially, this movie is indeed sappy. However, look beneath the surface.What I see is that Diane Lane's character is playing the Superego. Sandra Oh plays the ego. And the Fellini Fatale is playing pure ID.They all play their part to explain love, despair, dissappointment and lust.The buying and remodeling an old house is just like cleaning out the cobwebs upstairs. Clean house to move something new in.I believe this movie is made more for what it is representing than what is flat out shows you.It is a good psychological study of the human mind and the ups and downs that it goes through in a lifetime."
1,"Great movie! Wonderful story about a woman who reclaims her life. Great ""feel good movie"". I love how all her dreams come true!"
1,"It wasn't that bad!!! I don't know, but it seems a lot of people don't like this movie! Why? Because they don't like the feel good feeling at then end? I mean, sure, usually the book is ten times better than the movie, but come on, this movie should be at least a four! When you read a book, and than a movie comes out based on it, don't expect it to be as good as the book, because it very rarely is. Even the movie Lord of the Rings wasn't as good as the book for some people. And if you look at movies like Harry Potter, Ella Enchanted, Bourne Supremacy.... a lot of these movies aren't better than the book. So, if you have read the book, and you are thinking about seeing the movie, my advice to you is try not to expect too much. Think of the movie seperate from the book. By the way, I only rated this movie five stars because I think some people should lighten up, and watch a nice, family movie for a change."
1,"Much more than ""eye candy"" for the ladies!!! ILOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! THE WIDESCREEN DVD VERSION REALLY TAKES IN THE BREATHTAKING SCENERY, AND THE BEAUTIFUL COLORS IN THE LANDSCAPE. THIS MOVIE REALLY DREW ME IN FROM THE BEGINNING, AND IT REALLY BROUGHT OUT EMOTIONS RANGING FROM SADNESS AT THE BEGINNING OF HER DIVORCE, HAPPINESS IN WHEN SHE BEGINS HER NEW LIFE IN TUSCANY AND MEET THE ""EYE CANDY"", ANGER OVER HOW SHE IS TREATED, AND TEARY-EYED AT THE BITTERSWEET ENDING OF THIS MOVIE. YEP, THIS IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!!!! I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE MORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE!! HAVE NO DISTRACTIONS, RELAX, AND LET TUSCANY TAKE YOU AWAY!!!!"
1,Beautiful Tuscany I enjoyed the story and the scenery in Tuscany. It makes you want to visit there!!
1,"Under the Tuscan Sun If you like romantic movies, this is the perfect one for you. But, please don't cry! It was a gift for someone else, eventhough I personally had seen it. It arrived just in time and I could keep track (via UPS) where it was, since I purchased it being in Puerto Rico."
1,"Love this movie! One of my absolute fav movies. It's so rich looking and makes you want to go to Tuscany. I wish this had come out in blu-ray, the colors would be even more amazing. Watch with a blanket and a bottle of vino!"
1,"A really fun, smart and sexy movie! This was a GREAT and FUN movie. It was so funny and touching, yet did'nt have the 'cliches'. It was well acted by Diane Lane and it looked fantastic! A great fun movie! Highly recommended!"
1,"Not your usual romantic chick flick! Determined to rebuild her life after a sudden, unexpected divorce, Diane Lane gets away from it all by going on a gays-only excursion to Italy where she falls in love - with a house! She buys a delapidated villa to renovate and quickly fills it with an engaging cast of characters. She finds her dreams - love (sponsoring star-crossed lovers), her family (her pregnant friend, jilted by her lesbian partner) and finally hopes for a romance of her own. More than just a ""chick flick"" this movie offers a little something for everyone, including exquisite cinematography. Highly recommend!"
1,"Tuscan Sun and Diane Lane ==Perfect Match I can't say enough positive words about this movie.It was good at the show but like alot of things the second time at home it was so much better. It was a DVD gift from my daughter,and that night I watched it and noticed all the little things you often miss in a large show. As a women I could idenify with Frances in many way's. When she leaves her home she loved and goes to her tempory apartment,and lays down on the floor.. It was Diane's and her best friend performance that you ,the viewer grow to love and laugh with. But the most important message in the movie is that France's positive and helpfull attitude towards everyone is as beautiful as Tuscany."
1,Under the Tuscan Sun I saw this on TV & I just had to have it. I just love watching this movie. I watch it every yr :)
1,Canon NB-5L Great Battery. Last a long time to be depleted. I was going to get another one as second spare when traveling. I don't need it anymore. One is enough. Highly recommended.
1,"Long lasting Battery I took more than 130 photos in addition to 5 minutes movies all with LCD on without any need to recharge. it is so powerful. the battery is much powerful than the one for SD 750, NB-4L family. 1120 mAh is great."
1,Wonderful... This battery works like a charm and gives me the same life as the original battery I received from Canon. I bought this as a back up battery and I am extremely happy with it. Ships damn quick. Merchant's service is excellent. Cheers.....
1,"Same as original! A must have for your SD950IS, because you never know when you need a backup battery!"
1,Quality battery I can't imagine not having a spare battery for my camera. I bought this for my 1st Canon Powershot camera and it works exactly as you would expect. I was even more excited when I discovered that my new Canon Powershot uses the same batteries. Now I have 3...the ones that came with each of the cameras plus an extra.
1,Very Very Pleased Great price on a genuine Canon battery.Reasonable shipping cost.Arrived in reasonable time.
1,Cannon battery Not much to say it was a true Cannon battery not a generic battery which don't seem to last as long. I had bought generics before and had problems with them retaining the charge after a while. It's worth the cost to have an actual Cannon product. It was sent promptly and it works
1,Spare Battery for my SD800 Camera The battery works just as good as the one that came with my camera.
1,so easy to use love this kettle looks and works beautiful. I have no p;roblem with it being remanafactured have many other ones I higly reccommen d this to perk up anyones kitchen
1,The Pledge of Allegiance This book is beautifully illustrated with photographs that are sure to spark discussion. The text (the Pledge of Allegiance) is broken into meaningful phrases that make the reader reflect on the words that we sometimes rush through or take for granted. I highly recommend purchasing the big book version for lower grade classroom use. A gem!
1,"Beautiful photos The text is the spoken pledge, and the photos show America -- the people and places and landmarks. Beautiful photos -- did I already say that?Facts at the back -- every family with a kindergartener should be equipped with this book."
1,"Friend of the author I work with Hank Hassell at NAU and know him as a friend and kind and unassuming person who, from what I've gathered, can hike the doglegs off anyone. This book is the offspring of his love for the Colorado Plateau area. It is a well told story of a piece of our geological heritage that could only be written by someone who has been there and done that. I would recommend this book for the academic community as well as for travel buffs. Betty Lee/Library Specialist @ NAU"
1,my first REAL netbattle this PET is so cool. after I got it I started buy battlechips and fight my bro. then for some reason my computer had a virus. so I went in with megaman. Thank goodness that I had the right chips or I would have been deleted. And it was all thanks to my favorite battle chip...........TIME BOMB. Now my computer is safe.
1,The Best Handheld Game Ever I just recently got the megaman pet and it is a lot of fun. I play with it all the time and i am 13 years old. The only problem is that you only get battle chips through the toys. When you by the pet you only get 3 battlechips. The game is easy and hard to play.I think it is the best game ever
1,"I love this book! I'm a big fan of Vickery's ever since I read his previous book, Cocksure. I have to say that as good as Cocksure was, Play Buddies is even better! Not only are his stories hot, Vickery writes with real humanity, making his characters come across as real and three dimensional, out on the prowl, looking for sex wherever they can find it. As far as erotic writing goes, Vickery is a master!"
1,"Great album!!! This album is the best release of the ""New Mayhem"". Total insane, brutal black metal. Only for people that like primitive raw black metal. Hellhamer plays in an incredible way, necrobutcher give an atmospheric sound to the tracks, and maniac voice is totaly inhuman. WLA is a must have.!"
1,"""MARLOWE BY ANY OTHER NAME WOULD BE JUST AS TOUGH"" For you hard-boiled detective fans who are also intogeneology, you might like to trace Philip Marlowe's familytree. Raymond Chandler's prototypes for his now famous detective began in the mid-30's with characters from some of his early pulp magazine stories. Whether the character is Ted Carmady, Johnny Dalmas, John Evans, Tony Resick or a character named simply Mallory, they all had the qualities and charactoristics that eventually evolved into what became Philip Marlowe. Red Wind, Trouble Is My Business and Goldfish are just three of more than 40 stories Chandler wrote during his lifetime. Don't miss a single one!"
1,"What a debut! This album was not death metal or even thrash metal by today's standards. It was, however, an incredible debut that I ended up owning on cassette, album form, and finally, CD. Unfortunately, Nasty Savage sounded best when they werent trying to be heavy. Some bands do (Metallica, Possessed come to mind immediately), just check out the incredible original version of XXX (available on Metal Massacre 6) and then listen to the much faster, more aggressive, and much less interesting version on the CD 'Indulgence' and see what I mean.)This album is actually very good ""idontknowwhatyouwouldcategorizethisstuffas"" metal for this time period. For some reason, they decided to use more death metal growls and faster beats on future records and that made them sound like they were trying to do too much....This album is their crowning glory."
1,"The new ""rage"" in our hood After a neighbor girl got one for her 6th birthday, my 7 year-old son had to have one for his (birthday). He got it today as a group gift from several families and he loves it. The Trikke across the street was labled ""Trikke"", but my son's says ""Razor"", but they seem to be almost identical. My son is very athletic and took to it right away, but he has been riding his regular Razor (two wheeler) for over 2 years now. The brakes are a little tight, but my husband is just stretching the cords for a smoother brake...which I'm told is common with new brakes.We live in a hilly area, but he seems to have no problem adjusting to the ""squirlliness"" of the Trikke."
1,"MY PERSONAL FAVORITE BOOK BY MY PERSONAL FAVORITE AUTHOR!!!! This book is amazing! It provides us with great humor while taking a serious look at religion as a whole. Personally I think the Great God Om is the best character on the whole Discworld (followed by a close second of Rincewind and then Death bringing up third place) and I hope to see him again sometime soon, maybe in another Discworld book(of course). This book also has the best villian in the whole series as far as I'm concerned...he was really truly an evil man. In short...I LOVED IT!!!!!"
1,"A good basis for religion It is just as entertaining and well written as all the other Discworld Novels. The basic philosophy about the nature of religion is brilliant; it is much more credible and closer to reality than the official dogmas of most of the existing religions. Actually, it is quite close to Nordic paganism (as practiced in Iceland), traditional Shinto (not the official version practiced by the Japanese state) and religious Taoism."
1,"Best of the Best I've read nearly all of the Disc World series and have thoroughly enjoyed most of the ones I've read. SMALL GODS holds a special place in my heart. The characters are engaging. Om as a little turtle won me over completely. Brutha, the naive is one I could relate to. What a villian Vorbis! Pratchett is at his best with his usual terrific humor, but in addion -- and upon rereading I keep discovering this -- there is much much more to this story. It invites us to think and to question. If you only want to read one Terry Pratchett story I recommend SMALL GODS."
1,"Simply Extraordinary If you have the slightest inkling that you have what it takes to be a professional author, do not read Terry Pratchett. This is not because he's not worth reading, or because I don't think that aspiring writers can learn anything from his prose: that is patently false. Do not read Terry Pratchett because one chapter in, you will feel like a kid with a toy xylophone staring at Beethoven at the head of a symphony. Pratchett is one of the truly great writers today, with vivid imagery and beautiful wordplay that is unparalleled. In Small Gods, Pratchett follows the Discworld version of the Spanish inquisition, and creates a story that managed to make me laugh in the same chapter that it caused me to genuinely think about the nature of religion, belief and faith. I know I'm using hyperbole, and I know I'm raving to a ridiculous extent. But Small Gods earns the praise."
1,"A grim and gritty travel masterpiece Tabasco and Chiapas in the 1930's - not a nice place either to live or to visit. Greene's explorations provided background and some characters for his great short novel or tale, The Power and the Glory. If you are a student of fine writing, read the novel first, then read this to see how he gathered and used material. Or read this first for background that adds depth to the novel. If you are an armchair traveler or student of Mexico, enjoy Greene's adventures and be grateful he went through them so you don't have to do it yourself. This is truly a classic of travel writing."
1,"Awesome voice I discovered Anastacia on you tube and fell in love with her music. I love the CD, especially the track ""I belong to you"" and ""everything burns"". There isn't a song on the CD that I don't like. Why she is not more popular in the US is beyond me."
1,It really is the Gluten free Bible Packed with great information.Great for people like myself just diagnosed with Celiac Diseasefunny friendly fact filled! The one recommended by my nutritionist!
1,"First book for newly-diagnosed celiacs! Jax updates her ""Against the Grain"" success story! It's the first resource to get when one is newly diagnosed with gluten intolerance or wheat sensitivity. Jax writes with intelligence, knowledge, sensitivity, creativity and wit about the gluten-free lifestyle. She tells it like it is; the gluten-free diet is very do-able, but attitude is everything. You'll enjoy learning with Jax as your guide in this GLUTEN-FREE BIBLE. [...]"
1,Anyone with Gluten issues should read this! I have a family history of auto-immune disorders and have started developing them myself. This book was recommended by some other family members and I have read it and passed it on to more family who need it! Great book!
1,"Good for storage and for being less breakable than hard cases This item is good for storage of cds and is less breakable than the harder cases. Wish I'd have bought and may buy more of them than harder cases, which can crack."
1,"Pictures and Words in Perfect Harmony Diane Schoemperlen said she found inspiration for this book when her young son asked her how come her books never have any pictures. She then had the brilliant idea to wrap short stories around antique drawings, 100 year old catalogue pictures and illustrations from the original Gray's Anatomy. The results are stories that are compelling on their own but are perfectly enhanced by the pictures put in them. A great gift or coffee table book to be flipped through again and again."
1,"magic under a microscope After reading Schoemperlen's Language of Love I couldn't wait to read her new book. I was NOT disappointed. All of the magic and insight and wonder and irony is there. Later when I took a walk on the beach, everything seemed magnified. The sun and a grain of sand were suddenly about the same size and equally amazing."
1,"She's lovely I found out about this author while reading a collection of shorts stories from 1998 with a forward from Garrison Keillor. Her short ""Body Language"" was included and it was the most impacting story of the bunch. This full collection does not disappoint!"
1,"Sharing Pain... I just bought my second copy of this CD - I have loaned my first to so many friends, one finally kept it! When I first heard the CD, I wondered if something had gone wrong with Amy Grant's long-time marriage to Gary Chapman. A long-term relationship of my own had just ended badly, and the songs I was hearing, particularly ""Like I Love You"", ""Cry a River"", ""Missing You"", ""The Feeling I Had"" and ""Somewhere Down the Road"", echoed my very feelings of regret, loss, hope and emptiness. Later, I heard that Grant's marriage had ended. I had never heard a collection that so profoundly captured those feelings, as if the person on the CD was in my shoes. She writes and performs each song from her own torn heart and in words she has cried. It is the rawness and honesty which brings me back again and again and keeps me recommending it to my friends."
1,"I love this CD Leave it all Behind, I Will be Your Friend, Like I Love You, Takes a Little Time, Turn this World Around.. OMG, pretty much all are my favorites!! Gotta have it!"
1,"Amy's Best! Amy Grant's albums are like a soundtrack to all of our lives. Out of all of her albums, ""Behind The Eyes"" is definitely the album that shows us the real Amy Grant, of who she is as a person, not a personality. Personally, I thought this was going to be another ""Heart In Motion"" (which I still love), but boywas I wrong. I remember when Iheard her doing her version ofJoni Mitchell's ""Big YellowTaxi"" (from ""House Of Love""), I kind of guessed that will bewhat this album would sound like: Very earthy, acoustic, and organic. ""Lead Me On"" was just like that too when it came out in 1988. I love ""Takes A Little Time."" It has a Tom Petty-like sound that you would never her on an Amyrecord. I like all the songs,especially ""Somewhere Down The Road,"" ""Missing You,"" and ""I Will Be Your Friend."" This album will stand the test of time."
1,"The REAL Amy Grant has come forward Truthful. Dark. Uplifting. - call it what ya like but this isindefinitely her most personal and emotional powerful record to date. Behind the eyes captures sheer honesty from within Amy Grant and the best part is, it's very relatable. From Like i love you, to the ""Feeling I had"" and then "" I will be your friend"" it's apparent that Amy has come through many changes. But what is Strikingly interesting is how she toned down the ""fluffy pop"" sound and got accoustic. She's showing the listener that this record isn't about sappy love songs, it's about life and making peace in her life. I think we all need some peace in our lives every now and then..don't ya think?"
1,"tremendous skin flick - one worth owning No plot, very little talking, tons of high-quality flesh - all you could hope for from this genre in one package"
1,"Out of the Garden of Eden . . . To many people Mr. Young's thesis will seem to be outlandish. Yet, he is the one author I know of who actually tries to seek out the origins of religion using modern research into chimpanzee behavior. I wonder what Jane Goodall thinks of it? First there was Freud's Totem and Taboo, a mere root to Young's amazing tree. As he writes, "" . . . the Darwinian-Freudian-Foxian root-stock on to which I would graft the story of alpha-shaman."" I'm not sure exactly how to take him, but it is dazzling stuff. Since there was no impartial observer in the Garden of Eden, perhaps he is correct."
1,"Dell E207WFP Monitor This monitor, when it first came out, received rave reviews and I have not been disappointed. Since first buying it a few years ago, I have since added two additional ones as well. I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a older model that performs well."
1,"Your Child Your Child is one of the best books I have ever picked up to read! My toddler and I were experiencing some difficulties at home, which is why I purchased the book. After reading this wonderful map through childhood, I believe we are both going to be just fine. It gives hope to parents that we really are doing a good job at raising our kids in todays world. And if we aren't, it gives great advise on how to seek help. This isn't your typical ""self-help"" book!"
1,Hard Times Book was in excellent condition and service was excellent. It's not the seller's fault that the book is boring.
1,"To Jake Song Jake Song ""Jake"" (New Jersey USA) this is for you remember when you said ask you if anyone wants to know the glich to get any battle chip you want. [...]"
1,pretty outfit this item was fantastic and neat. it arrived on time.it was worth the money. I will buy more items like this again.
1,cooker This is a book I had when I was in the first grade. I recently started cooking with my eight year old and hoped this book was still out there. I have never seen it it a bookstore and there it was on Amazon and for less than three dollars!! It was exactly the way I remembered it. We have already made several of the things in the book. We have a lot of fun looking at the pictures and following the directions and the together time is great! A classic forever!
1,"Regina Carter., Motor City Moments, I'll Be Seeing You, Paganini After A Dream. I'm reviewing all three Albums together as they are by the same artist; Regina Carter. Again I purchased these Albums on the basis of a 30 sec listen. They all lived up to my expectations. If anyone is familiar with Stephane Grapelli, Regina Carter's style is very similar. She really swings. I love these albums and play them over and over again."
1,"excellent praise and worship CD I really enjoyed this album, especially the songs ""I can't live without you"", ""King of Glory"", ""More of You"", and ""One God"". There were a few songs that would be good for choirs or dance ministries. I'll play this one for a while."
1,"un livre pour comprendre la vie / a guide for life En rÃ©sumÃ©, si vous tes dans une pÃ©riode de votre vie oÃ¹ tout semble arriver sans raison et but prÃ©cis...ce livre pourrais bien vous redonnez de l'espoir et vous aider Ã  comprendre ''le pourquoi'' de la vie.In resumÃ©, if your stuck in a rut, and you feel like nothing is going like you planned out in life; that your wondering why ''this or that'' is happenning....this book will give you hope by allowing you to understand ''the why'' of life."
1,"Wonderful! Consider what might have happened to England if Dracula had survived Stoker's novel. This is the premise upon which Newman's story is built. Fortunately, his knowledge of Victorian history and literature is matched only by his brilliant ability as a storyteller. Newman is one of the best!"
1,"As advertised The seller presented the title accurately and honestly. The book arrived in a timely manner, in tact."
1,Crucial Confrontations Excellent book. Easy directions and explanations to implement the Crucial Confrontation Model.
1,"Best Business Tool Ever! Knowing I had to face a crucial confrontation I looked for answers to help me in this uncomfortable situation; and, I found them!! Not only is the information valuable in business but it applies to family and life in general. Recommend it to anyone that has a hard time facing confrontations. It is written in a way that is both easy to understand and to apply. The information flows in a format that makes total sense."
1,"Great for individuals or companies The follow up to ""Crucial Conversations"" this book has some great tools and insight into dealing with those crucial confrontations that we all have from time to time."
1,Best on this topic! This is the most practical and best researched book on conflict resolution. On my top 10 best management/leadership books. Must read!
1,WOW!!!! Great reference book! I bought this as an inspiration for my wife who makes boxes. We both love the book and have come away with some great ideas!
1,"Great Music This is a great music DVD I love it. Lot's of rock stars and loads of songs, I am very pleased. Money well spent, If you like this DVD you will love ""A Concert For George"" that was a ten plus+++++"
1,"Music for Montserrat The most amazing music DVD I have ever seen. I have had many a party when this DVD was played that captivated the crowd. To have Paul McCartney, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Sting, Phil Collins, Mark Knoffler and more all playing together is an historic event.DC"
1,Fantastic! This is one of the best music DVD's I've ever seen. If you likeany of the artists listed on the sleeve -- and particularly ifyou like most or all of them -- you'll love this DVD. Claptonplays rhythm guitar on Money for Nothing. Knopfler playsbackup on Layla. Everyone plays on Golden Slumbers -- whichfinishes with The End and Carry That Weight. Awesome!
1,"All-Star Lineup This is a very good recording of a fabulous concert. The sound and picture are first rate and the list of performers is, simply, a stunning collection of British rockers. McCartney singing ""Golden Slumbers"" is alone worth the purchase price. I highly recommend it."
1,"A page-turner! I could not put this book down! The story is riveting and heartbreaking, and the writing is fantastic -- this reads like a novel more than a true crime. I felt like I was right there as the horrifying events unfold, and as the family deals with the tragedy and the injustices that follow. What I admired most is how the author, herself in the center of the story, manages to be so generous in its telling. We go into the heads and viewpoints of each family member as well as the four killers, and as a result we get a nuanced, thoughtful and balanced portrait of that fateful night and resulting tragedy. The killers are living breathing men whose lives and personalities converge to create this crime -- a senseless tragedy that robs the world of two amazing, spirited young women. The author calls the book her ""personal memory stone"" to her cousins, and it's a beautiful, heartbreaking tribute."
1,"Strange Twists This true account is well written, riviting, and perfectly clear. What happens to the young man is beyond understanding. Crime on top of crime is what comes to mind. But he survived to tell the story."
1,"headphone extension. almost a year of use, and it still works great, this runs from our tv, to my treadmill, I exercise 6 days a week, and this is a fantastic extension."
1,"Love it I am allowed to listen to music with headphones when I'm at work, but my computer is on the floor and it's too far for my headphones to reach, so I bought this extension cord and it has saved my life. I'm happily listening to music as I type this!!"
1,"Free at last! This headphone extension works great. I bought it for use at work, and it's wonderful not to be tethered to my desk. I may now move freely around my cubicle without constantly having to take off my headphones. It may be my imagination, but I swear the sound quality has improved too."
1,"The BEST book I have ever read. This book has everything! Romance, intrigue, deceit, Religious persicution, War... with a discription and belief in honor, love and God that parellel my own beliefs. This book has been a multiple read for me and I will probably read it many, Many more times."
1,Awesome!!! Very good book! Well written and a def must have for all collectors!!!! It's a little off from the movie but still as exciting as it gets you to want more and more Rambo!!!
1,"Rambo III: This Time It's for his Friend Co-written by David Morrell (FIRST BLOOD AND RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II). Based on a Screenplay by Sylvester Stallone and Sheldon Lettich.John Rambo. The most dangerous man alive. His country has called him once again -- this time for a mission he will not accept. Living in exile in a Buddist monestary, far from home, he is finished with the glory and the blood of war.Now, his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman, the only man Rambo trusts, is in trouble. On a mission meant for Rambo, he has been captured by Soviet troops on the Afghan border.For John Rambo it's a call to arms. And an invitation back into Hell...with the help of Afghan rebels."
1,"Um album excelente I know that this wonderful band delayed five years to launch this album, however was compensatory. The quality of this material is surpreedente. The style of the band is gothic/atmospheric. In some passes of the CD, we perceive the influence of the Dead Can Dance. For who it does not know, the songestress of the band, Francesca Nicoli, is the same songstress of the band "" Ataraxia "". The vocal masculine is for account of the Andrea Zanetti, where the gothic style predominates. All the CD is excellent, the instrumental part is sufficiently melancholic, but gorgeous. The bands prettiest of the CD are, instrumental:""Battesimo: Nero Opaco "" (introduction), "" Consuming Jerusalem "", ""Fade to Grey "", "" On perspective of Spiritual Catharsis "" (Title) and "" Nephtali "". Who to want to acquire this CD, with certainty will not go to repent itself, valley to confer."
1,"strangely wonderful If you've seen that strange and wonderful movie, The Triplets of Belleville, then you should order the soundtrack. If the triplet's song plays over and over in your head, then you need the cd, because not only is it there three times (twice in French and once in English), but the French Mafia' s theme shows you those horrid clones perfectly. If you've ever wanted a recording of music by a vacuum cleaner, a newspaper, a bicycle wheel and a refrigerator, this is the cd for you."
1,"Small but contains the universe.. Another treasure from one of the world's greatest-somewhat-unknown poets...more more more is all I can say! To see his translations in his own hand is the greatest thrill, as well as the brief but wonderful interview at the end conducted by the editor and publishers. A true touchstone for living dharma and freedom."
1,"The real deal. I ordered this charger for my Canon PowerShot SD 880 IS. Fortunately, I ALWAYS go to Amazon when looking for anything. I found an ORIGINAL Canon battery charger for a lot less( half off!) than the Canon site's price & with Amazon Prime shipping & it's guarantee. I was able to order two for the price of one charger. They both came in authentic Canon boxes & sealed new. I have two Canon batteries for my camera, so I immediately popped them into charge. They went into the charger perfectly and charged within two hrs. I'm SO glad that Amazon had these chargers on their site. They're authentic & backed by Amazon's guarantee."
1,Great Service for My Charger Thank you for great prompt service for the Canon camera charger.I misplaced mine a month ago and was in desperate need of a new one> Thank you so much!
1,Oem replacement This is the perfect replacement to your lost charger. Not much to say about it. I like that it doesn't have a long wire. The electric prongs slide in and out of the back. Good compact and portable.
1,Works great This was a replacement for our original recharger and it was a wonderful price. We are happy with it so far after a charge or two. We just bought some super cheap replacement batteries and will see how they fare. Was happy to bring the camera back to life with these purchases!
1,"Exactly the charger that came with the camera If you lost your charger that came with the camera, this is exactly the same one. I looked for cheaper versions at Best Buy and other stores, but those chargers were all so much larger in size. This Cannon charger is so compact that it is easy to keep with the camera, and it seems to charge faster than the cheaper brands as well."
1,Happy with a Canon product again This is a well made battery charger and very easy to use. No long cord with a plug. It plugs right into the electric socket. Handy to carry with you. I am happy with the Canon SD700IS digital camera and not surprised that any accessories would also merit a 5 star rating.
1,"Works great! Got this to replace the missing one from my daughters camera. It works perfectly! We really shopped around but found that Amazon had the best price on the real Canon charger. There were many others that, when examined closely, were not actually Canon brand. We were not willing to take the risk of an off brand just to save a few $$. Would recommend to others."
1,Works as expected I lost my original charger and needed a replacement. Works as expected. Charges the battery quickly and the battery holds a charge for a good amount of time.
1,Just like the original one. I lost the battery charger that came with my Canon camera this Christmas. Looked for a while for a replacement and found this one. Looks exactly like the original one and works just as good.
1,"Great solid performance / Great Action / Great Music I first saw the HBO Special, and looked forward for the DVD to come out with Dobly 5.1. Fun to watch, and dance too. They did a great job on this DVD."
1,"Excellent Concert By Excellent Artist! Janet is one of the best artists in music and she knows how to get a crowd going, even when it's home viewers with their DVD's. I saw Janet in concert as well and it's really this much fun. This is also a great DVD as well. Great motion menu's and animated chapter selection. Get the DVD now!"
1,Janet!!! Janet is at her best in this excellent concert! I love this video and have seen many concerts... This it top entertainment!! I recommend it highly.Janet Jackson - The Velvet Rope Tour (Live in Concert) (DTS)
1,"All Hail the Queen of Pop Okay, I'll admit it...I'm a Janet fan. But you've got to give it to her, Girlfriend is a fantastic performer. This video proves it. I've seen her live twice and this video brought me back to the great times I had at those concerts. She gives so much of herself that you don't mind the price you paid for the tickets. With that in mind, this video is a bargain at any price. Madonna who?"
1,"An awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists... Simply an awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists (Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Hound Dog Taylor, etc.) from an Austrian label called Wolf Records."
1,"Another Great Addition To The Buddy Holl(e)y Story! If you are a totally out of control Buddy Holly fan (like I am), then this book is a ""must have"" for your library! It adds a great deal of information about Buddy and his performances in England and is well written and researched with some great bibliographic information!"
1,The last Xbox book you will ever need! This book describes how to do anything and everything you could ever want with an xbox.It starts of very simple by describing how to open up the xbox and take out the parts. But by the end of the book you will have covered such things as;-Installing Mod chips on all versions of xbox-Choosing the right dashboard-Learning the Xenium OS-FTP your computer and xbox-Flashing a bios and installing a dash board-Customizing your own dashboard-Replacing the case-Installing hard drives over 137GB's-Custom lighting-Xbox Media CenterThese are just a few of the many things that fascinated me about this book. A person who has never seen an xbox before could pick up this book and read it and have a completely pimped out xbox in a week.It is FULL of very detailed explanations and it has tons of very useful photographs.I would HIGHLY recommend this for ANY one who is going to open up their xbox.
1,Working cable I had no issues running this cable through a drop ceiling and connecting it in to my devices. The connectors seem solid and had no issues during connection.
1,"awesome!! Makes the speakers portable, without this harness the speakers are difficult to handle.Altec Lansing IM7 Speaker Shoulder Harness"
1,"IM7 Shoulder Harness - Great! Besides being so happy with the IM7 Speaker Boombox that I got for my daughter (the sound is terrific, it rocks), the shoulder harness is great. You put it on the IM7 and just leave it on. It makes the IM7 much more portable. I love the IM7! And the harness. What a team!"
1,"Could be Crawford's Best! Joan Crawford & Jack Palance are sheer perfection in this tightly directed film noir suspense film. Not for a moment does the tension ease! Crawford has done excellent work in many of her large library of films, but this ranks right at the top. This is one to own!"
1,"Quit your whining, this DVD rocks! Alright, there are no special features. Alright, so there aren't even any subtitles. And there are a couple of seconds where the picture had grain- ok, I give. But overall, this film is excellently presented. I don't have any complaints about the sound or the picture- in fact, I thought it was remarkably clear considering that it hasn't been preserved as well as a lot of other pictures. Trust me, the plot more than makes up for any minor annoyances.In an Oscar nominated performance, Joan Crawford plays successful playwright Myra Hudson. When she falls in love with a handsome actor named Lester (played by Jack Palance, nominated for Best Supporting Actor) everything seems perfect. But when she discovers her husband's plot to murder her, she designs a plan to reverse the gun.This movie is great, and if you're not one of those people who whine when they don't get all the bells and whistles, you'll love it too."
1,Honestly Raw It makes us look at our lives as Africans living in America...trying to assimilate into mainstream America or maintain our Blackness. One thing that affirmed what I've always said is that we have to try to help whomever we can to realize their potential.
1,"classic every young lady and young man should read this book in high school or freshman year in college. easy read in one day, get it, read it ,enjoy it, i did twice:)"
1,"Life Changing Memoir I was in my early twenties when this book found its way into my heart; I will never forget the sound of Sister Souljah's voice in my head, I could hear her words and feel the pain rising from the pages. Though it has been since the early nineties that I read No Disrespect, I will always heartily recommend Sister Souljah's grand debut; this book is pure heart; not easy to come by in these plastic times. I say, pick it up and give it a read, you won't be disappointed, and something might change within your soul, a new perspective, or even a song within your heart might be born and you might chance to sing along with No Disrespect ~ I think it takes guts to write like this, and this author has my full respect for putting herself out there. Not an easy thing to do. Sometimes its not easy to read a book chock full of opinions that one may or may not agree with; and that is the glorious thing about this book; new perspective, new horizons; freedom to think newly."
1,Simply Excellent There aren't enough words to explain how much I enjoyed this book. Everyone should read this joint! I read it twice!
1,"UNDER-RATED Fates Warning's Inside Out is hailed by a majority of their fans as one of the band's weakest, if not the weakest album. I dont agree with this feeling.Inside Out is similar to Parallels, but generally lighter. The lyrics are more focused on euphoric feelings. Its a light progressive fans dream. If you like the melody and passion of No Exit, and the lighter feel of Parallels, this is the Fates Warning CD for you. But do not buy this CD if you expect Fates to bring the Metal, because they dont.Inside Out is my second Fav Fates, next to No Exit."
1,Amazing An amazing book that I couldn't put down. The Shuberts have compiled a great tribute to Broadway theater. It's worth the money if you are a theater history buff!
1,A Real Page Turner Jack Polidoro has a writing style that will keep you turning the pages. This book is a fast read. The plot is exciting and moves. Jack has a way of making the tale come alive in your head. This book should be made into one of those disaster movies starring George Kennedy. It would be a knock-out! Jack included a generous helping of juicy sex too.
1,"Excellent The Freddie Slack collection is especially well assembled. It's great to hear these tracks again, particularly his work with Margaret Whiting."
1,"great I thought this was great. The complaints about sound and video quality I thought were unfounded. I didn't find her annoying and both my husband and I did laugh and learn. The breathing techniques are helpful and clearly taught, and being a dvd if you miss it or somehow just aren't getting it you can always rewind. I especially like this format compared to a class as I can review this any time I feel the need."
1,"The Perfect Shower Gift! Soon after my baby shower our doctor ordered me on bed rest. She said I wouldn't be able to attend a regular lamaze class and recommended this DVD. Happily, my sister had just given it to us as a shower gift. It was a joy to watch and very informative."
1,Great product This is a great product. We watched a couple child birthing videos and this one was by far the most informative and entertaining. Great money saving idea too with birthing classes costing over $100 these days. Highly recommended. Other videos in the series are great too (breastfeeding and newborn care). Good luck!
1,Very Informative Video! I am so glad I did not sign up for in-person classes. This video fulfills that need. I now feel very well-informed.
1,"Learn About Birth at Home: Convenient, Easy Love it!This DVD includes real couples in classes by Shirley (who is teaching the classes)In a nutshell she walks you through women anatomy, birth (or labor signs), do's and dont's; breathing exercises, and labor.Because each sections is separated in chapters, you can choose which ones to view; The best part is to be able to view this in the comfort of your home with your partner or husband, at your convenience; ask questions to you doctor or midwife as well."
1,"Complete classes at your convenience As a ""first-timer,"" I knew I needed to take a childbirth/lamaze class. Since I'm still working full-time, however, I couldn't imagine having to drive into town and actually sit through scheduled lessons. This DVD was truly the answer. We learned just as much as we would have if we actually went to a live class, if not more (I know this because I did actually go to classes with my sister a few years back). Yes, the instructor has sort of an unusual sense of humor--but she gives you tons of information, answers the questions you'd ask if you were there in person, and addresses the issues you were unaware of or might be afraid to ask about. The best part is I could sit on the couch in my PJs and hit ""pause"" if I needed a potty break!"
1,"So Much Information plus You Can Watch at Your Own Pace I am pregnant with my first and this DVD was great. It was easy to understand and gave all the important information I need to know before I go into labor. I especially like the fact that I could attend classes at the local hospital, but my schedule is very hectic. This way I can watch it as many times as I need to and in the comfort of my house."
1,"Definitely worth getting We chose to get this DVD prior to enrolling in any local class. I'm glad we did. I've never gone to a class on this information so won't really compare a class to the video.This DVD was extremely informative. Yes, there are some antics and humor in the DVD that may not suit all tastes, but this is not a comedy DVD. The purpose of us buying this was to gain understanding of what's in store for our first childbirth, not to be entertained. If she didn't have some of the comedy and antics this would be a really boring dump of straight knowledge like a college course or something. I think she does a great job overall in the DVD mixing facts, concerns, choices, questions, and keeping us paying attention with some comedic examples and editorial.I would recommend this to any of my friends/family. It's great to own because I know we will need to watch this again at least once. There's a lot of content for review."
1,"Well Worth It! We did not take a birth class, they were too expensive, cost too much, and who's got the time?! I did a lot of reading, and thought I was good-to-go... Women have done this for 1000's of years right? I don't need a class....Wait... Maybe just a short class. By the time I found this DVD I was 37 weeks along!I saw the reviews that the instructor was annoying, and tried too hard. So what?! I didn't want this women to be my new best friend! I wanted to see what she had to say, and I'm glad I did!After watching this DVD set I went on to have a natural labor & delivery! I knew how to breath, I knew how to push, I knew when to go to the hospital. She covered all the key points, and I would reccomend this to any pregnant women, and her coach. No doubt, it's well worth it!"
1,"Required Purchase for all Pregnant Mothers (and Fathers) A major challenge of preparing for childbirth is the immense volume of information you are required to digest in a relatively short period of time. Most people have huge networks of people who give them tons of advice, which often serves to confuse rather than to enlighten since it is often contradictory. Enter Sheri Bayles.This product is amazing. It provides vitually everything you need to know, in a super efficient format. And with Sheri Bayles' witty presentation, the DVD is engaging and entertaining. Sheri Bayles has a way of making you feel comfortable and confident, by being honest, upfront and absolutely comprehensive.This DVD should be required viewing in all OB/GYN waiting rooms and hospitals. An absolute must buy."
1,Very Helpful...........! I loved this Dvd. It had so much info that I found so very helpful. I would tell all my friends to buy it. It was very intertaining and funny. It awnsered all my questions on child birth.
1,Good Down Home Blues I enjoyed listening to Big Wheeler. He played his harmonica and sang like the old Delta blues I grew up with. Thumbs up!
1,"You did it! I had to priviledge to get to know Izzy while he was recording his album in orlando, FL. He is an extremely talented and anointed young man. Most of all he is a christian behind the scenes and in his real everyday life. His production is super hot and his lyrics are uplifing. I hope that everyone who listens to his samples will buy the album and support my boy. You did it Izzy!"
1,How To Speak and Write Correctly It has been a long time since high school and college English classes. This book helped me remember things I did not realize I had forgotten. Order it today. See what you forgot!! I would give more stars if it were possible!!!
1,"Masterpiece. Excellent album, a masterpiece of this guys (and the shipping was absolutely great). A must in every music collection."
1,"AN INCREDIBLE BOOK!!! This book was riveting from the first page! I couldn't put it down and ignored children, laundry, and dishes until I reached the end. Adams brilliantly weaves her characters through an 'end of days' experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat (At least it kept me on the edge of mine!) Can't wait for book three!"
1,WOW! This is an awesome CD. The title track will put you in a state of mind that makes other music become just noise.A truly talented man.
1,"This One Will Surprise You I was so happy to see this came out on DVD, finally. This is a longtime favorite movie of mine. I love to share it with friends who have never seen it; they invariably enjoy it as much if not more than me. Believe it or not, it's a great ""date movie"" to cuddle up with....there are enough plot twists to make the story, at one time or another, enjoyable for just about everyone, and yet nobody will be turned off by them. This movie is great fun....enjoy!!!!"
1,Great Great movie. I had to watch it for class and I actually enjoyed it!! It's in French but you won't even realize you're reading the subtitles
1,"Delightful and funny This was a really funny movie. I usually don't like reading sub-titles, but I hardly even noticed them because the movie was so good. The humor is understated and well-done. I highly recommend this movie."
1,Daniel Auteuil is fabulous I've been a fan of Daniel Auteuil for some time and look forward to each new movie. This one is very funny and entertaining.
1,"If you didn't already know... This whole series of books is magnificent. So unique, such a wonderful heroine. There are a lot of details in these books, and it's easy to get bogged down in them, but you just have to look at it as a learning experience. Other than that, this book is fantastic. Moving and inspiring. Could teach people today a thing or two about racism. The only thing I would caution is that I bought this to go with my set, which are the normal size for novels and this book is like a foot high. Not what I thought I was getting. But the text itself is fabulous!!"
1,"Captivating and fascinating! From the moment you open the book and begin reading the first page, you will most likely be hooked to Auel's first novel in the Earth's Children series. Auel did wonders with this first book! Not only is the story of Ayla, the blonde-haired orphan raised by Neanderthals, touching and, at times, exciting, there is a wealth of knowledge about Ice Age plants and animals. The first installment of the series can, at times, move along more slowly then I would have liked. However, I never found myself bored when reading this book. The ending won't necessarily leave you on the edge of your seat but you will be longing to read the next installment as soon as possible."
1,"The Clan of the Cave Bear An excellent AUEL written story that you cannot put down, Many suprises, and life as it was thousands of years ago. EXCELLENT RECOMMENDATION."
1,"I'm going nuts! PPLLEEAASSEE HURRY UP! I read this book when I was in grade 5, am now in grade 8 and have read it 5 times since then! Okay, so I'm a literiture junkie. I have read the whole series twice and have thought about the fifth book for so long that I think I could write it myself!"
1,"Take a walk on an awesome journey into the past It's a wild ride that you will take with Ayla as she learns what the world around her is all about. This book is a real treat. Start with this one (it is the first in a series of four, soon to be five books) and keep going. Jean Auel is definitely talented. Enjoy"
1,Great book if you like the ice age........... I loved this book. I have read it and the rest in the series at least 5 times. Not only were they fun to read I also felt they were educational and Jean Auel did so much research to try and make the books as accurate as possible.
1,"The Clan of the Cavebear The book was listed as used but was in perfect condition. Excellent book, I would recommend it highly. It is evident that the author did extensive research before writing the book."
1,"These stories are fascinating! I have the whole series on my Kindle Fire, and I love to read them over and over again. THey are really good reading."
1,The Cave Bear Series The Claln of the Cave Bear. I had lost the original book that I had purchased so I chose this oneTo replace the first book of this Earth's Children Series. I love this book very much and reread it immediately. This soft cover volume is easier for my elderly fingers to handle while reading. This is a series that will never grow old and one that I will pass on to my grandchildren in the future.
1,"Wonderful Description Of Life During The Ice Age Auel's story of Ayla who lived at an earlier time during human evolution is very exciting. Auel's description of life during the ice age is well researched and her writing is filled with description of life at that time. This is the first book in the series and, in my opinion, it is the best of the bunch. For the reader, it is thrilling to learn and imagine what life must have been like during this earlier age.I ""read the book"" on an unabridged audio by Brilliance Corporation. Their version was very well produced so that the listener feels like he is right there with Ayla at that earlier time."
1,"The Clan Of The Cave Bear Loved the story. And have now read the next book Valley Of The Horses, and am in the process of getting the third book, The Mammoth Hunter. Great Author."
1,Great book! I love this book! The entire series!=) Everyone should read it. You feel you are actually there through the story.
1,"Fabulous book, couldn't put it down! I loved this book, and I can't wait to buy The Valley of Horses. The way Ms. Auel could create such an intricate culture amazed me. Her writing techniques combined with a wonderful plotline make for an incredibly enjoyable book."
1,"Excellent! Non-stop reading, I couldn't put it down. This book was the first ever I had read of its kind. Not usually into the prehistoric era, I found that I fell in love with the characters. I cried and laughed with them. I am looking forward to her fifth book of the series."
1,"The Clan of the cave bears I read almost all of these books many, many years ago and found them so interesting - am loving The Clan again, and will probably order the entire set in time. So nice not to have the usual voilence, although the primitives were sometimes pretty rough, but in a more natural way! Just lovely night-time reading whilst the hubby snores!!! So good to have something to read in the dark."
1,"MY WIFE ABOUT FELL OVER! She had a older book in paper back, but the ex tore it up in spite. I got her the hard back, and she nearly broke my back with excitment!!! She was nearly in tears she was so happy."
1,"Great. Really Great. I really liked this book, I have always been interested in early man, and I think this book sheds new light on the way it could of been back then. I found this book facinating, and I think that it was a wonderful experence.Although she didn't have any facts she still did a good job of filling in those empty spaces."
1,Very good I rated that good because this book grabbed my attention inmediatly. Not only is intersting but also instructive. I recommends it to everybody. Regards.
1,"Neato This is unlike my usual choice of reading, but I really enjoyed it. It contained a lot of interesting events and information that really stimulated my anger (such as the cruel treatment of Broud to Ayla). I disliked Broud and would have done everything in my power to annoy him if I were Ayla. i am disappointed that Ayla left her son behind with the clan, but he would have slowed her down. I reccomend this book for any avid reader that can handle long yet interesting books. Also, if I were a district official of a school, I would make it mandatory for prehistoric history students."
1,"The details in this book will blow your mind. I loved this book so much. Ayla is sure to be a classic in liturature to come in the next decade or so. She is a great role modle. I think this woman has major courage! If this is your first book in the series, keep reading it's worth the time and effort, I promise!"
1,"A GREAT book. The Great Book. I got this book for Christmas, and was hesitant to read it, because it sounded a little boring. But I brought myself to read it, and loved it! I loved every word! It is 500 pgs, and I read it in 3 days. It was so excellent. Jean Auel expressed Ayla's feeling, Broud's hatred, Iza's love, and Creb's frustration. It was a wonderful story!"
1,"The Best Book Ever! The best book is this one right here! Ms. Auel's story makes you feel as though you right there next to Ayla the whole time. You're there when she's in the earthquake, during her time with the clan, when she leaves and all the way up until the end. When I read the first story, I couldn't put it down and when I finished, I ran to the bookstore to buy the others. I can't wait for the fifth one to come out. And as long as there are more books of this series coming, I'll be reading them. Two thumbs up and a must read!"
1,Stunning What an amazing and visually stunning book. It has been years since I have read anything that has shook me to the core of my humanity. This book has done just that. Will be reading this entire series. Such a prolific and dynamic writer. So glad my mother in law introduced me to this author.
1,"Classic While some people complain of inaccuracies in Ms. Auel's novel, it is important to remember that this was written in the 70's, back before much of our archaeological technologies existed. Much of what we know today we did not know back then, especially in the field of genes. However, with what she researched back then, we're presented with a solid and enjoyable read. The descriptions are lush (and sometimes overwhelming) and you definitely get a very good read - I find this better than many novels today by sub-par authors like Danielle Steel and Fern Michaels."
1,"A tour de force in literature I read this book around 30n years ago, and have read it several times since. The amount of research that Ms. Auel puts into these books make the story really shine. I had no problem envisioning the settings and surroundings of the Clan and their territory. Sometimes Ms. Auel could get heavy on descriptions, but better than some authors who rush through this vital element of any story. Ayla's struggle to fit in with the Clan and learn their ways is not always easy, especially with the constant antagonism of Broud, a man who hates Ayla for no apparent reason. In the immensely patriarchal society of the Clan, where it is okay for a man to beat a woman, Ayla has a hard time, but there are also good moments, and she finds a place of value within the Clan. This is a book I will never forget, and it is a shame that this enthralling saga came to such a pathetic end in 'Land of Painted Caves', the sixth and final book of this series."
1,"I've read it countless times This is one of the few books that I've read *many* times. It's one of my favorite books. It tells the story of Ayla, that, due to an earthquake in her childhood, is adopted by a group of people that are both like and unlike her. In order to fit in to her new society, she must go against her own instict. She learns to hunt, though it's forbiddin, and she learns to heal..because her family thinks that this is the only way she will have any value in the patriarchal society. She is raped at a young age, and bears a child, which she nearly loses.Many people are critical, because Ayla is TOO perfect, and discovers too much. Well...so what? It's fiction. She isn't perfect in every way, and she is full of self doubt, and frequently makes poor decisions in her life.Ayla is a strong character, and Jean Auel is a great writer, and the imagery in her books is fantastic. They are well researched and enjoyable. I loved it!"
1,"Fantastic series....have read every one This is one of the better book series out there. You grow to love the characters, and they are quite realistic. Talk about going back in time because of a book! Jean Auel has a wonderful way of doing that for the reader. Excellent series in which I've anxiously read every book."
1,"clan of the cave bear It will be difficult to keep once step ahead of ms aurels. I never gave any thought to people of this time in our history. But from the first paragra your mind carries you away to a new adventure, which gives promise to a long and happy union."
1,"Amazing book Finished reading this last night. Amazing story!!! It was a bit difficult getting through the 1st chapter but after that, I was good to go! Totally imaginative, riveting, touching & pretty much leaves you with a kinda obsessive focus even when you're not reading. I loved the language; can't remember the last time I read a book that taught me SO many new words!!! & the story line? good grief....... I totally had NO idea the book was going to be that intense! or amazing! It's one of those moments where I realize & appreciate that you really cannot judge a book by it's cover/name. Some things you just MUST read! Auel is so descriptive and thorough in her writing. I'm so happy I came across this series... it realllllyyy makes you THINK and pulls on all your emotions. If you're reading this on your kindle, you will truly indulge in and love the dictionary! Every few pages I will hover my kindle cursor over a word and get the definition. Good stuff!"
1,Clan of the cave bear This book came within a week of when I ordered it. It was in good condition and I am enjoying it.
1,Absolutely wonderful! Jean Auel is a wonderful writer! Her books magiacally come alive. Impossible to put down once it has been started! The best book I have read in my lifetime!
1,"Absolutely Breathtaking!!!!!!!!!!! I first read Clan of the Cave Bear when I was prompted by my mom.I thought ""another one of your lousy stories"" I read the first page and I was enthralled!! I simply could not take my eyes off the page!!I am a 12-year-old living in Kars,Ontario,and I reccommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!!!!Nobody writes like Jean M. Not ever.This book made me laugh,as well as cry. I have read all of her books,and am eagerly awaiting her 5th book.I love this book! I would give it 10000000 stars,if possible. If anyone dares to insult her work in my presence......."
1,Where is N 5 and 6 I've read the 4 books by Jean M. Auel (twice). I'm sure the story has not ended yet. I cannot sleep because I want to know what happens next. Please Mrs. Auel could you finish the other books as you entended to do ? A suggestion : the story is very strong on its own. No need to waste paper by inserting a full description of their love-life every twenty pages. I'm sure you did it for commercial reasons and not because the story is incomplete without these descriptions. Thanks for the many hours of joy I had with your books. Hope I did not make to many mistakes in English.Anita
1,Clan Of The Cave Bear by Jean Auel A beautiful story. Couldn't put it down. So well written that I felt like I was there with Ayla and the clan.
1,A novel you will be reading into the early morning hours While reading this series it seemed to always slip into my mind throughout anytime of the day. It became so facinating that I would ponder it constantly. I am marveled at the talent Mrs.Auel has been blessed with and grateful she has shared her blessings and given us a true heroine in Ayla. This will been a series I will treasure and will love to read again and again.The time she has put into researching truely paid off.You feel as if you are right there treking along on the steppes. Reading this series has been such a wonderful experience.
1,"Excellent!!! My best friend first introduced these books to me probably when I was 14 or 15. Since then, I have not been able to put them down. I don't know how many times that I've read, and re-read these books. They still get me every time. The detailing and description really makes me think, and visualize what Ayla sees. I often wish that I could be her, sees what she sees, and Jondalar! How cute is he? I know every book almost off by heart. I know what's coming, and how they will all end, but I still anticipate and agonize every time. I haven't bought many other books because the Earth's Children Series always satisfies, and leaves me wanting more. I too, am anxious for the next book(s) to come out. Hurry up already!"
1,"MAJESTIC, AMAZING, CAPTIVATING I read this book for the first time when I was 14 years old. Since that time, I got the others in the series. I cannot tell you how many times I have read and reread this story, as well as the others. At one time, they came together in paperback, and I bought it. Now, they are so ragged they are held together by tape. I have been awaiting the time when Mrs. Auel comes out with another book. I would definetely be in line for that one."
1,Excellent Book One of the best books I've read. It brought tears to my eyes especially at the end. Strong and touching it made me really think. The book is excellent to the very last word.
1,"A Must-Read book and series I purchased this copy of ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" to help complete the set of ""Earth's Children"" books. My first reading of it was a library book. I loved the series and decided to own and reread them all. Jean Auel is amazing and I look forward to another book."
1,Excellent compilation on Leadershipattributes for innovation Excellent compilation on Leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well written articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon. I enjoy reading Peter Drucker's books and the content of the book has Peter Drucker's flavor to it. The Clarity and style of this book is truly outstanding.
1,"Love My New Orleans Saints Floor Mats I am a New Orleans Saints fan and have been since the franchise began. I no longer live in New Orleans but I do still support the team. I wear Saints gear when they play and so does our dog. My entire family are die hard Saints fans. I fly my Saints flag on my car, so why not have the Saints floor mats. Every time I get in my car, I say ""geaux Saints!!!!"" The color is perfect for the interior of my vehicle. I would recommend the Saints floor mats to all Saints fans. I just wished there were mats for the rear."
1,"book i have this book and bought it for my best friend. It has a lot of easy, inexpensive ideas; great reference book."
1,"A Civilization Swept Away The son of a Russian general, Prince Serge Obolensky grew up at the court of Nicholas II, and served as an officer in the Chevalier Guards in WWI. This is a remarkable tale of Obolensky's long and varied life - from student to soldier to City stockbroker to soldier again (this time as Lt. Col. in the US OSS in WWII) to hotel impresario in New York City. Married first to a Russian princess and later to Alice Astor, Obolensky was one of those rare 20th c. characters who ""knew everyone"". Yet he comes across in print as humble and self-deprecating. He was a leading representative of a civilization that was completely swept away by the 1917 Revolution. This is a good read; it is a pity it is not in print at present."
1,"Un libro importante Por favor, no te importa mi espaÃ±ol pobre, pero en serio no soy hispanohablante. Cuando tuve trece aÃ±os esto libro mi mejora amiga me dio, y imediamente fue enamorado con su idioma, tema, y jugadores en una historia complicada y intimo. ""Mas Que Humano"" es un libro de los mas importantes del siencias, y de los libros intelligentes."
1,"Not your usual romance movie This movie has a wonderful and fully devloped story that reveals itself slowly during the first part of the film. It is filled with family drama, sexual tension, and one mans deep love for his family when he knows he is dying. Well worth the long movie time, and being dubbed in English (I am American and don't speak Danish). I am still thinking about it today, after watching it yesterday evening."
1,one of my favorite films Great film. Interesting narrative that is easy to follow. The story of a past love reintroduced and how a twenty year gap has effected those involved. A new family is melded as the original partners story is revealed. Beautifully shot and cast.
1,"Superb Movie Great acting by all, love all the characters and the story, a real love story. Watching the deleted scenes and listening to the director interview really fills in the whole story and adds to the character motives. I enjoyed the spoken Danish. I'll enjoy watching it many times."
1,Great Movie!!! Flawless... great movie with lots of heart and a beautiful perspective. Thoughtful story line that makes life hit home! Enjoy!
1,"Ridiculous replay value Path of Radiance is an incredible game that I've spent waaayyyy too much time on, simply because there are so many characters to choose from, and thus so many different tactics to use. It's an excellent turn based strategy game that requires much more planning and attention to enemy movement capabilities than other similar games (e.g. FF Tactics). The only real gripe I have with the game is the fact that you cannot revive characters once they die, so you may find yourself in the position of nearly complete with a stage when an enemy gets a lucky critical hit on one of your guys and destroys him, leading to you beating your controller against your head / swearing liberally as you reach for the reset button and prepare yourself for another hour of the same exact stage. Thus, I only gave it 4 ""fun"" stars, because having your characters die is definitely NOT fun. Otherwise, I love this game, and highly reccommend it."
1,"A Fantastic epic! This has got be one of the best games out there for the gamecube. The combat is simple and easy to learn, yet later on it soon get,s very complicated and fun at the same time. About 3% of the story is done through cinematic cutscenes and the voice acting is good. The graphics are beautiful and colerful and look great. everything also sounds good too. The story is showstopping and full of surprises and in terms of epic it can be compared to lord of the rings. Overall 10 out of 10!"
1,"The BEST Fire Emblem! I don't know why this does not have 5 stars as the overal rating! Path of Radiance is fantastic!!!1: The charecters names are atleast sane unlike many of the other charecters in Fire Emblems.2: The charecters are also different from eachother and interesting!3: The storyline has much more to it than the others as well! I never get board or try hard to get to the fighting sequences like I did in Sacred Stones.If you have any interest in games, get this one it will definately be among your top 5!"
1,"Pros and Cons This may be one of my favorite games ever. Here are its pros and cons.Pros:1. It has a good plot.2. There is also a strong main character that you don't have to worry about dying.3. You need to use at least some strategy to win.4. Pick who you want to fight in each battle from out of a possible 43 characters.5. Good art and cut scenes.6. A lot of hours of gameplay.7. Good replay value. If you're bored you can make a new game and try using different people and strategies.Cons:1. Can be confusing at first.2. A little to much talking between the battles. Sometimes, when I would be in a hurry, I would have to skip the plot in order to save the game.Can go either way:When a character dies in battle you can't get him back. Instead you have to restart the level. However it also adds more strategy to the battles.9/10I beleive this game is worth buying."
1,"what hard rock is all about Cut the crap! it's motorhead, it's rock n' roll, loud, dirty, agressive, but also a singalong album.By far, my favourite Motorhead album, actually the only one that still survives in my collection nowadays.many eternal hard rock classics that must be listened by every metal, hard rock, stoner fan of the XXI century.check out Overkill, stay clean, no class, i'll be your sister, metropolis."
1,"Awesome noise....Metallica deservers thanks for introducing me to this band... I decided to buy this album because my good friends Metallica told me they really liked this band. They covered four songs of theirs on their garage, inc. album, so I thought they couldn't be that bad. And Motorhead are awesome! This is wonderful noise, especially the title track (which feels like it can go on forever, which is OK by me), and Stay Clean, which has a great bass solo in it. Lemmy can't really sing, but that's OK, I still dig the crazy vibe this album has. It's also hard to believe this guy are only a trio, as they sound larger than that. Overkill is a perfect introduction to the genius (?) of Motorhead."
1,"One of the Better Mars Books More similar in its simplicity to a Princess of Mars than Gods/Warlord. John Carter's son engages in search for abducted Thuvia, while he remains the prime suspect in her abduction. Usual strange meetings and stranger neighborhoods, but this story is a little less frenentic than Gods/Warlord, and both Carthoris and Thuvia are solid characters."
1,"Blissfully arranged, elegant easy listening music..... Something of a Cult band insofar as their albums (although critically applauded) are usually stumbled across by word of mouth. The unashamedly `Easy Listening' tag associated with their music, probably deters people. But if you actually listen to the tracks, there's a preciousness to they very accessibly music, that although features lyrics of hushed sighs & several instrumental tracks feature throughout. You'd have to be a cynical listener not to smile when hearing the catchy guitar pop of ""Afternoon Speaker"", or indeed the acoustic lounge of ""The Leaf"".....not an album to impress your friends with. But for music that evokes positive expression & sunny afternoon on every turn, restrained, Bittersweet indie Pop has rarely been so well composed."
1,Tried it and then bought it. Simple to install and easy to use the software does not eat much memory and works without much intrusion in your daily life and fore that I give it 5 stars.Updates are done often or as often as you wish and take only a very short time to download...try that with other programs of this nature.I would buy again.
1,"Panasonic 1GB SD Memory Card (133x) This card was free with my new Panasonic Lumix TZ-3. It came pre-formatted, has plenty of capacity and is certainly fast enough for my needs. I don't shoot movies or multiple-frame sequences very often. All in all, I'm very pleased with it."

1,This movie was GREAT if only for the end Overall the movie had what might be considered a plot but I do have to say the blonde in the movie was simply awesome. The ending blow my mind WOW if anything get the movie just to watch the ending over and over.....
1,"Flyboys [ Blu-Ray ] The disc was send in fast time,and made it in perfect shape.Info was great between Amazon and me,Thanks for a great job well done."
1,Movie fan Excellent documentary drama. If you enjoy history you will love this! Would have liked the happy ever after ending though.
1,"Excellent dogfight While the story drifts at times, it is still an entertaining movie with great dogfight scenes. Makes you wonder what early fighter pilots went through."
1,"Great Movie I went to see this in the theater with tempered expectations based on the ""average"" reviews the movie received from the critics. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a great movie about a subject and period that is largely ignored by Hollywood."
1,"Missionary Pal Reference Guide for Missionaries and Teachers I've wanted this book for a gift. It's in excelent shape except for a dedication in side front cover, It alteady arrived today, which made me happier. This is ""Missionary Pal for Missionaries and Teachers"". 1/11/13."

1,"New favorites! These socks are my husband's new favorites. And he has tried LOTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS of socks. He used to wear the Gold Toe Windsor Wool OTC for many years, which were beautifully made and stayed up and came in 4 colors. Gold Toe changed them more and more so they became so tight that they'd leave marks/indentations on his legs. My husband bought numerous different Gold Toe styles and finally loves these. They only come in black and navy, so he is wearing only the black for now and uses old brown, navy, or gray ones when he needs those colors.These are very soft and stretchy but durable feeling. They stay up and do not make your feet sweat like many fabrics do. For the time being this is the new favorite at our house. (Gold Toe, PLEASE make more colors!!!) Two thumbs and 10 toes up!"
1,"an excellent tune Here they are again! German deejay and producer Yanou and the Dutch goddess Do(minique). If you liked Heaven, you will love this song even more! Radio edit is a nice trance tune. Extended version is even more powerfull. Piano version is a nice ballad. Even your mom will like it! Dj's@work remix is the best version, and the Flashrider remix is the least commercial version of this tune. My favorite remix is Flashrider meets Yanou remix. Buy it! (Unfortunately, there is no enhanced video. It is an interesing story about the dancer (Do) and her admirer (Yanou).)Yanou and Do, please be here for us!ON & ON!"
1,"Exceptionally helpful to someone in their first year I found this book to be very comprehensive: addressing what MS is, what causes MS, symptoms of MS, diagnosis, symptom management, treatment options, and social aspects. It includes the technical description, but through the use of analogies, makes each description very tangible for the layperson. I found the section on medications (and their evolution) particularly helpful. This book reinforced much of what I've learned through doctors, websites, and support organizations and filled in the gaps where information was lacking. It's an excellent resource for someone who has been newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis."
1,"Not really a review, sorry I do not own this book, and am not reviewing it. But there is a quote from the essay ""On Living In An Atomic Age"" that is going around once again, following the London bombings of July 2005. I am putting it here on Amazon so interested parties Googling to find the source of the quote might have an easier time of it:""If we are . . . going to be destroyed by [a] bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things--praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts--not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.""--C.S. Lewis"
1,Maturity in his writing After reading his earlyworks you can see how Chandler used his previous stories and ideas to develop these incredible novels featuring his most famous detective Philip Marlowe.
1,"New and Brilliant This film is exactly as it says on the box, ""A historic lock, stock and two smoking barrels""! I sat down to watch this film with an open mind as to wether I'd like it or not as it is different to anything i've ever watched before but as soon as the movie started I was mesmerised by the excellent acting, complex,yet easy to follow storyline and excellent soundtrack! Carlyle and Miller both never fail to (Stand and)deliverand Liv tyler as support is also excellent. If you like LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS you're bound to like this!"
1,"The finest! Novak is another of my all time favorites. I have all of his recorded orchestral music, which is my passion. I thought, this one won't hold up to my favorites, In the Tatras and the Eternal Longing. Wrong. They do hold up, they are as beautiful as all of his other compositions. Creative, inventive, runs the full gamut of emotions from tiny delicate passages, to the full beautiful storm. Don't miss this composer!"
1,"Brownie ""Brownie"" was a true genius. Although he died in 1950 at age 25, he was one of the fathers of hard bop. He could play the fastest bebop tune with ease, he was also adept at the ballad, i.e., ""You Go to My Head."" He was also an accomplished composer, i.e. Daahoud"" & Sandu.Brownie was taken from us muchy too early. No, he was not into the Parker influenced drug scene; he died in an auto accident.I guess my favorite tune he wrote was ""Joy7 Spring"" & he plays it on this album.If you're into jazz at all, get some of his albums. The ever present Max Roach was always with him, & on this one Sonny Rollins has a lot to say. The interplay between them is fascinating."
1,"Beautiful Photos, Great Info I am a beginner backyard bird watcher and I really enjoyed this book. It has some great pictures to help you identify birds, or even just to look at. The book doesn't stop there, however, it gives you nice detailed information of bird behavior, sounds, nests and habitat. I recommend this book to beginner or intermediate bird watchers."
1,Old Time Favorite This purchase was made as a replacement for a copy that was ruined when it got wet. Exactly what I wanted.
1,"Outstanding trilogy The notion of three different books by three different authors about the same story, each from a different character's perspective is new to me. I'd enjoyed the Diary series, and thought it was worth picking up the three books just to see how well the concept worked.I actually thought the books by the other two authors were better than this, but only by a small margin. They are all excellent, and reading the same story three different times never got boring because they are all so different, while remaining consistent.In many ways it's so true of life - we really don't know what's going on in other people's heads, especially when it comes to subterfuge and illicit behavior.Three different authors, three different characters, three different styles, one terrific story."
1,"Perfect Love this, amazingly sexy. bought it in white for our wedding night so my future husband has something to rip through ;)"
1,Fantastic I use this product to pickup chopped vegetables from my chopping board. I saw it used on a food show and I thought I would try it. I love it.
1,"The Best Any fan who appreciates the Everly Brothers has to havethis album. The remastered sound is superb of course, butthe deciding factor on this one should be the inclusionof their last hit, after more than 20 years had passed sincetheir previous one.After the team reunited, one of their biggest fans wrotea song especially for them. Paul McCartney wrote ""Wings ofa Nightingale"" for them, and it is a truly beautiful songthat displays their harmony at its best, and the song isnot usually found on other collections.Get the best of all their classic early hits, plus thislast hit.A must have for any fan."
1,Excellent addition to Holocaust Literature Well written with a sense of humor about a very tragic period of time. I liked his style of writing with a story told from a different point of view.
1,"Ballet anyone? Franz von Suppe (German form of Francesco Ezechiele Ermenegildo Cavaliere Suppe-Demelli, which I like better) is known for his ballet music, but the CD series 1-6 contains even more wonderful music. All his music is very conducive to movement, whether ballet or other calisthenics (beauty and strength). Enjoyable when sitting still, too! He is a relative of Donizetti, so he had great musical examples to help him along (probably good genetics, too)."
1,Grat book! A must have for those wanting to know about the growth of civil aviation in the 1920's and beyond.
1,"This is REAL hockey!!! I have been playing hockey games on the PC and on consoles since NHL95. Until now I have not found a console game I could tolerate. I have now found it! NHL 2k3 is the closest to real hockey I have ever played. What makes a game good is flexibility. The sliders in this game make it fun for anyone. The designers have given us the ability to modify the AI even after starting a season, franchise, or even in the middle of a game. You can tweek this baby until you find the right skill level for you. The controls are more like that of the PC. I can chose the setup that lets me use the right trigger for speed burst, to me that's the only way it can be done comfortably. There are just too many good things to mention about this game so I will just finish by saying...EA Sports has just fallen way behind. This game sets the standard for video hockey games."
1,"A Must Have I recently purchased NHL2K3 and I must say I am impressed. Being a loyal follower of the EA NHL franchise I was a slightly apprehensive. But after two games were under my belt I quickly came to the conclusion that this is the best console hockey game to date. The game play is far more realistic than the EA version. That combined with the fact that the game is supported by X-BOX live make this game a must have for any sports console game enthusiast. The live interface does leave a little to be desired when choosing opponents, but the online game play is smooth. Go out and get this game you won't be disappointed."
1,"Very imaginative and mysterious Did you ever wonder what may have happened to Tiny Tim, the Cratchett family, or old Mr. Scrooge? Bayard answers that question in a very imaginative and mysterious way. Part historical fiction, part mystery, and part psychological thriller, this book is a wonderful read."
1,"My favorite album, period This album is just so great that it's a crime that so few people know about it. Sometimes just gorgeous and sometimes really crunching cathartic stuff, all combined with the kind of odd murky and haunting sonic atmosphere that you expect from 3MP. This was album was clearly a slapped-together job, comprising of new material plus B sides and outtakes etc over a period of years. And yet the material outdistances anything else they've done. The bass work in particular is phenomenal -- he plays it like a lead guitar. Also, if you're a fan of Pinback then you really should own this. One caveat: I almost never listen to CD2 -- except for the song ""The Trail"", which is great -- and the very first song on CD 1 is really the worst on the album. So don't let that put you off, because the rest of that first CD... wow. Wow! If my desert island disc was limited to one choice, it might be this one. (Well, okay, a Beatles disc might win instead, but only just.) Really, it's that good."
1,Best CD for the bathroom I LOVE this CD! I listen to it whenever I'm on the can. It helps me do my thing.
1,RICKY MARTIN LIVE! REVIEW IT WAS EXCELLENT. VERY HOT! HOT! HOT! IT BROUGHT BACK MANY MEMORIES OF THE CONCERT I SAW IN NOVEMBER '99.

1,"compelling, riveting and inspiring In 1980, I successfully climbed Mt. Rainier, reaching the ""true"" summit. It took several attempts because of weather. It was hard work. But after reading Lene's book, I came to realize how strenuous and physically challenging it is to climb Everest. I was not aware of all the work and risks that are taken just to prepare for the final assault. Lene proved herself, showing incredible strength, fortitude and emotion. There must have been such a terrible sense of despair and fear knowing that death was probably inevitable and no help available.Lene gives the reader another perspective of this awesome event, using her professional knowledge as a clinician and writer. I would recommend everyone who has followed this climbing event, either from past magazine articles and stories, or from the several books written about this Everest climb, to read this book."
1,"Great Video!!! I have a 22 month old son who LOVES this DVD. He is really into trucks, fire engines, and ambulances. Basically, any vehicle that makes noises. He begs for me to put this in every day. He was not afraid at all in the beginning when Elmo shakes. They do show Elmo very afraid, but the adults in the DVD really do everything to make him feel better and let him explain his feelings. There are catchy songs and good fire safety information. You should preview this DVD and judge for yourself if your child is to sensitive for the part where Elmo shakes in the beginning. If you feel that part is to scary for your child then skip to the next chapter of the DVD. It's a small part of the DVD and the rest of the DVD has so much educational material. I highly recommend this DVD."
1,"Elmo When my granddaughter was small, she loved this video and squealed with delight when the fire truck drove out of the Fire House. Alas, she grew up. My grandson is now 2, and I may have bought this prematurely for him. He loves Elmo, so I know he will eventually get into this video. Video also includes some good information as to how to act if there is a fire in your home. Very instructive for small children."
1,"A Master Teacher! Avery Dulles takes the untrained reader on a journey through the complex thought processes of a religious scholar, in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step manner.He sets up criteria and begins building five philosophies or models of revelation theology that are most commonly embraced by Christians today. These models serve as a great eye-opening tool in the final compare-and-contrast stage of his analysis.Perhaps more fascinating, Dulles expands his search to include specific historical periods, so that the reader gets a better understanding of how theological thought evolves and changes, as one generation of Christian believers builds on the knowledge or misconceptions of the past, and how meaningful dialogue with historians, scientists and other religious groups have enhanced our traditions and affirmed our convictions.This book represents a rare opportunity for one of the laity to peer into the mind of a great theologian. One can not help but be impressed."
1,"Trigger steals the show Quentin Tarantino lauded William Witney's directing of this movie and Roy's performance in a New York Times interview this year (2000). Trigger is blamed for a killing done by a wild horse, and Roy confesses to the crime to save him and serves three years for manslaughter. Witney once again handles animal scenes with finesse as the wild mare dies after giving birth to Trigger Jr. A beautiful story, in color showing off both golden palominos, in which Roy temporarily loses Trigger to a band of diamond smugglers and recovers him in a typical Witney action climax."
1,"Simply the Best Show! I got introduced to CSI this year and have been addicted ever since. It is a great show. Great characters and great cases that all you need to have a great show. The mysteries are so well put together and thought out. Buy this box set and in the future, you will be buying others."
1,"exactly as advertised The DVD arrived quickly and exactly as advertised. Plus, the pricing was better than retail. Thanks!"
1,"Amazing.... she is an Excelent and great violin player, her music is unique, if you love instrumental music, you can't miss it."
1,"Excellent, sophisticated. I read this book several years ago. One of the better, more cerebral espionage books I've ever read. Been trying to find his other spy book (i.e., ""Zolta""), but its out of print. Too bad the author does not appear to be writing this type of fiction anymore--while his nature stuff is good, I'd love to see him fill the void left by Adam Hall."
1,"Wonderful Upgrade I have purchased this knife as an upgrade from a Farberware Pro Chef's Knife. Kershaw is a lot thinner, lighter, and infinitely sharper (buy some Band Aids). It has enough curve for a rocking low motion and long enough for high cutting technique. I love it.P.S. Still love it after half a year, recommend dulling the blade corner near the pummel, it will reduce number of little cuts with out sacrificing usability."
1,"Bonus Tracks Not Much A Bonus The additional songs aren't that great, so if you already have the original album, it's not much worth buying this CD solely for the bonus tracks. The original album is one of the better Cranberries albums, but all Cranberries CDs are great, and that includes this one, a must have to complete your Cranberries collection."
1,"Buy or steal....no matter what method, Get these tapes. You cannot go wrong with Mr. Stuart Wilde's teachings. Each book he writes or tapes/CD he produces is a jewel. He's a great teacher and these tapes will really help the one who seeks knowledge in living courageously with awareness."
1,"Great Album I down loaded this for my Mother for Christmas. She loves the harmony of the songs. I burned a CD for her to play in the car while they travel. We all love it, I plan to make a CD for myself so I can listen to it in the car. Another Christmas Album that is wonderful is The Singers Unlimited Christmas. They are a Jazz group, but their harmony is even closer than that of the Mills Brothers. They are both very good albums."
1,"My Favorite Book Enter a world where there is no past. Where the past is the present. Follow Winston as he thinks THOUGHT- CRIME, works on fake documents, and plots to shut down the system. Big Brother's eyes follow Winston Everywhere he goes. If you want to see wether Winston accomplishes his mission, you must read the book. After you read this book go check out the 1984 Movie. But don't see the Movie unless you've read the book or else you will have no idea what is going on in the movie."
1,Great read!!! This should me a must read for everyone. It will make you think twice about things that go on in our government and those around the world.
1,"Just what I expected It was a good book. It was not my favorite book ever, but I feel more cultured because I read it."
1,"Science fiction? To call 1984 a work of science fiction is, while technically accurate, somewhat a disservice to the book. 1984 is a chillingly accurate glimpse into a future of hellish totalitarianism, and quite amazingly, with each passing generation it actually seems to become more and more relevant. It should be regarded not only as great literature, but also as an oracle of the very real storm clouds that are consistently looming just overhead. But perhaps most importantly, it should also serve as a much needed kick in the groin to anyone who is constantly blinded by the bright lights of patriotism, war, greed, fear, and all forms of propaganda.1984 is not science fiction. 1984 isn't fiction at all."
1,"can predictions really come true? read and make up your own George Orwell has another hit. Animal Farm was only a glimpse at his intellectual genius. This story takes you on a carefully regulated emotional rollercoster. You will go from intense shock to indignation for the characters involved. This small glimpse into what Orwell considered to be our inevitable future has left me with a strong sense of denial. Everything from the telescreen that watches your every move to the mere thought of a ""thought Police"" force gave me the shivers. There are several interesting implications for example the use of a term called ""doublethink"" which implies that people can hold two contradictory thoughts in their heads at the same time and beleive them both to be true. overall this book was an amazing peice of work, there was never a time that i put it down unless i had to. i would definitely recommend this to any person who wants to take their mind for a ride."
1,"Time to think George Orwell is a master of the English language, his superb style of writing and the intensity of the story is sustained throughout.The novel covers a timeless issue. Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius."
1,"An amazing and thought provoking novel George Orwell had my attention from the first to last page of his novel 1984. 1984 is a fascinating and mind-inducing novel. The story of Winston Smith's struggle through life in Oceania is extremely captivating and thought provoking. Orwell's sharp, detailed descriptions paint an image of an unforgettably unique society. His story is a detailed description of a man living in the worst case scenario communistic society. Orwell's ideas and images are extremely brilliant. His extreme communist society brainwashes their citizens to become emotionless, violent, and thoughtless. I was mesmerized by the way the society dehumanized its citizens. People had no freedom what so ever. The concept of people having the inability to think, loves, and express themselves is engaging. I found 1984 to be an extremely thrilling novel, I recommend it to anyone interested in a classic and contemplative piece of literature."
1,"Definitely a must read 1984 is the biggest achievement of Eric Blair as a novelist and anybody even slightly interested in politics, history or the future should give it a read. I think 1984 is one of the few books which you can't skip reading and just watch the movie. Very detailed, very thorough, very challenging - the book is more than 50 years old, and yet very very current. I've read it more than 5 times now, but the paperback copy from amazon is definitely the nicest edition I've had - printed on something that looks like recycled paper, roughly cut and printed in weird, but nice font - I recommend buying it."
1,Perfect This is such a great book! I ordered it on cassette so that I could listen to it on a long road trip and the product arrived right on time in great condition.
1,"oh yes. this is a good one. this was the first novel ever that i have finished (i tend to read the first few pages and quickly move over to the end). yes. like a winter in london under heavy smog, this novel has a gloomy, cold, and a bit cynical perspective. but there's something pulling you in. it's the secret love between winston and julia. so beautiful. soon to be crushed like a flower under some fat tires, though..."
1,Early Perspective - take warning 1984-A good example of what government can and may do. Good warnings of what may happen when government is given too much power and how it may completely take over without being noticed. Depressing but gives good insight. READ IT!!
1,"The best book you should read, but don't in High School Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come."
1,"Deserves SIX stars! I wish there was a way Amazon would let you rate ONE book with six stars, your all-time favorite. If they did that, 1984 would be my pick. I've read it at least four times, once when I had insomnia I read the whole thing front to back again. The first time I read it was in high school, and I was disappointed because it didn't have a happy ending, because Smith didn't manage to somehow smash Big Brother. But now I recognize the book for what it is: a timeless statement on totalitarianism and individualism. Don't let the title fool you: if we're not very, very careful it can happen yet."
1,"A Brilliant Warning About Totalitarianism George Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty Four"" is a brilliant warning about totalitarianism. It is certainly about communism. You can tell from their physical descriptions that Big Brother is Stalin and Goldstein is Trotsky. At a time when many people admired the Soviet Union, George Orwell saw the Soviet system for what it was- a brutal dictatorship based on fear. However, it is not just about communism. It is a warning against all totalitarian systems of thought that seek to impose forcibly a particular ideology on people and to mould people at will. Winston Smith's struggle to hold on to objective truth in a world of lies and human decency in a world of cruelty symbolises the real life struggle to do just that of so many people in this century that has brought us the horrors of the Gulags and Auschwitz."
1,This Book gives you Insight of Human Mind This book tells us about how one person's Total thinking can be altered by means of a simple tool called Torture.
1,Very realistic! In my opinion this is Orwell's best novel and is also my favorite book. It can happen to us as long as their are power hungry human beings in this world.
1,"Engrossing, horrific read Wow is the first phrase that came to my mind after finishing this book. It is one of the best I have ever read and certainly my favorite read over the last year. I am sure everyone knows the plot by now so I will not rehash. But I knew the general plot beforehand i.e. ""Big Brother"" and the thought police, and I was STILL overwhelmed by 1984. Orwell's writing makes you keep coming back for more, always eager to find out how the current situation will turn out, and what will happen next. Besides the sketch of a tyrannical government using mass propaganda to literally brainwash its citizens, Orwell also shows how powerless the ordinary citizen becomes, how much trouble must be gone through to engage in illegal conduct, and how brutal the aftermath of getting caught is. And the love story, which I expected to be the weakest part of the book, is actually fascinating and heartbreaking. A Must-Read if there ever was one!"
1,More than just entertaining... There are many works where the story is the content. These books are usually for entertainment. This book uses the story to deliver its content. It uses the story to illustrate some awsome philosophical ideas. By presenting the ideas in a story they are easier to understand and they are more entertaining.I could not put the book down as I got towards the end. This is the only book I have ever read that has given me the shakes.
1,"a must read one of the best books i've ever read. makes you think about what is true and what isn't. though written in the 50's i believe, the concept can be applied to the present and the future."
1,"Amazing! This book was amazing! I've never read anything like it, not even other Orwell. After this I read every book and paper he'd ever published. An ominous vision of his future and our present."
1,"the 2nd best book ever this book was unstoppable!i couldnt put it down.i suddenly felt like i was being watched from everywhere just like the folks in the book.ive read it twice.the 1st time i was on winstons side but i learned to love big brother by the time i was done the 2nd time.big brother is watching!writer george orwell gets a lot of props for ""animal farm"" but this ones way better!"
1,"Outstanding. This book is the most amazing, influential, disturbing, wonderful, and sickening, nightmarish, fantastic book I have ever read in my life.Don't read this review. Read the book. now, by whatever means."
1,"Chilling Book!!!! It is hard to belive that a totalitarian government can happen, People say it can't, but in truth it has. George Orwell's book has almost in a cense read the future. Take what happened in Stazi Germany, it is identical. And i belive that anyone who can guess at the future like that and be so right is deserving of some complement. And for the people out there who think that the readers of this book are all paranoied they are wrong. Read this book and then take a look around, how close are we really?"
1,"George Orwell : Modern Day Prophet It takes a lifetime to read this book. It's packed with symbolism and meaning. Few people will be able to absorb it all in one reading. Probably one of the Top Ten greatest literary works of all time. An excellent example of clear, concise, efficient use of the English language. Not one word out of place, not one word more or less than is needed. No 'Newspeak' in this book. It should be required reading for everyone who wants to live in a free society."
1,"This book scared the living daylights out of me Orwell crafts one of the most absolutle horrors of a future world in this celebrated novel.Written in the late 40's, Orwell crafts the tale of a bureaucrat in the future whose job along with countless other mindless peons, is (in essence) to erase history.Bombarded by slogans that hammer the totalitarian nature of the state, he finds some comfort in a woman who shares his ambition to break free from the controls of ""Big Brother"".Parables abound in this book, to a world and people seemingly oblivious to what is going on around them. Orwell has managed to create one of the most frigthening environments put to paper and weave a future world bleaker, but more importantly, theoreticaly possible in any day or age. So ingenious in usage of slogans, and terms made up by the author, that they are culturaly refered to still in this day and age.An astounding piece of fiction."
1,"Harrowing, thought-provoking, powerful I just finished 1984 about a week ago and loved it. Orwell showed his maturity as a writer and his evolution from Animal Farm (also great). 1984 shows the force of totalitarian governments and the faults of human nature. This should be read by any progressive-minded persons in the world."
1,"A Dictionary for 2003 Doublethink and Newspeak need no explanation to people growing up with a Patriot Act that takes away liberties. We don't need the brilliant economic explanation that Orwell provides for the state of perpetual war with constantly changing enemies...But it's amazing how ""1984"" keeps popping up on enigmatic posters at recent antiwar rallies with references to doubleplusgood wars and war equalling peace and freedom equalling slavery. On February 15 in New York, I saw a young man holding a poster with the ultimate reference to this great cautionary novel: ""1 + 1 = 2"". If you don't know what that's referring to, please read this book today."
1,"Horrifyingly prophetic Orwell was dead-on in his vision of a possible future for the Western world. Indeed, according to recent events, Big Brother is HERE and voting Republican."
1,"Amazing I read this book to kill some time at work, and I have to say that the time I ""killed"" was some of the best time I ever spent with any work of fiction. I would re-read this book in a heartbeat. This novel is one of the most worthy of five stars ever published.To all students: If this is a book you were assigned in a class, definately give this one a chance. You'll come out of the assignment with a new favorite novel, and thoughts and ideas that will challange and haunt you for weeks, if not years to come."
1,"If you read just 2 books, read the Bible, and this! This book is extremely powerful. That isn't a secret. The power of this book is that this is now happening in the freeworld as it had been happening in radical dictatorships. First it was western europe in the 70's and 80's. Then it began in the US in the 90's during the Clinton's reign and the rise of the NSA and ATF. Now it is spreading because of Terrorism. The bottom line is that many in the governments in these free countries mean well but don't comprehend what is coming. The current Bush administration is just answering the call because of the power that technology has given our governments and global terrorist. We must either accept that we are always at risk or give up some of our freedoms. We just have to hope that when this risk dissapates, if ever, we can get them back. Lucky for us FDR died before he became king... If you think this is about facism you are thinking too liberal-1984 can occur in a pure democracy."
1,"If you only read one more book, read 1984 If you only read one more book, read George Orwell's ""1984.""Other reviewers including the ... reviewer, has captured the essence of this incredible, disturbing, poignant, an accurate view into the mind of the totalitarians - and yes, folks, they live among us even today.I'll only add this: the ""book-within-a-book"" by Orwell's fictional author, Emmanual Goldstein, should be required study by every single high school and college student in the world. Don't know what I'm talking about? Read ""1984"" and look for Emmanual Goldstein within this book's pages. Then ask yourself the questions you dared not ask yourself before.Then go read ""Brave New World"" and ""The Probability Broach."" The first is a different, altogether more pleasant version of Hell. The second holds out the real promise of freedom-loving people (""Broach""). Then tell others what you have learned."
1,"I read this in 1994 -- after visiting Russia I read this book in 1994, just after a trip to Byelorussia, Russia and Poland. Life under the Soviet regime must have been a nightmare. This book helped me appreciate what it must have been like."
1,"the end is near!!! a ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!! Just as high lord Orwell predicted, the world is at an apocalyptic state. Constant war, no privacy, thought police, the world is truly at its end. Though this lowly species has somehow managed to survive 15 years longer than lord Orwell predicted, surely this feeble race will extinguish itself because of its own greed and blind hatred. The contempt of the aristocrats has finally backfired as all knew it would. Creating ignorance and superficiality amongst the masses has finally gone too far, and there are no functional human beings left to survive. The contempt for nature and human ideals has led us to the brink of destruction, by our own hand."
1,"A classic that should be read by all An excellent and horrifying view of a possible future for our world. Written in 1949, ""1984"" takes place in a future ruled by a rutheless and violent governemnt that watches all its citezins. The story's main character is Winston Smith, who's life is changed after buying an old journal and simply writing the words, ""DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER"" From there, paranoia turns into realised fear as everything Winston does makes him a target for the governments thought police, who are everywhere. Orwell does not hold back in his warning to the citezins of a free world of what may happen if one day we stopped watching ourselves and those who govern us. Don't take advantage of your feedom."
1,IT LEFT ME IN A SLEEPLESS DAZE this is one of the greates books i have ever read it goes along with orwells great reputation of pplitical novles it left me wondering on how the human race is so week and breakable once you pass the first page you will not put it down till you finsh it
1,Great Symbolic and Incredibly Smart Book Stephen Bradley: I first read this book and now Im 15 and I still haven't read another book. Every time I read it again I find another piece of clever symbolism. I would recommend this book to anyone! I am incredibly awed by the clever uses of English and symbolic meanings. For example I have been told that Gin was thought to be the downfall of the British Working Class. It would be a shallow understanding of the book to claim it as an anti-socalist book as Orwell (Eric Blair) obviously cared about the working class and was only against pretentous totalatarian states. I invite any like minded people to discuss the book with me. I apolagise for carless grammar and spelling (Im only 15 :) )
1,"Life Altering Here is the book that first got me thinking about politics and philosophy.This is Orwell's dystopia of how he feared the world would become run by a group of cahooting despots by 1984.The main character, Winston Smith, lives in London in a dictatoeship run by ""big brother"". In this state there is no love but love for big brother. There is no excitment but patriotism. Chocolate is rationed and orgasms are banned. In this world smith somehow manages to fall in love.. and that's just the start of his problems.1984 warns us to be wary of those who might take our freedom whilst trying to convince us we are actually gaining extra liberty. Buy it."
1,"Much better than ""Brave New World"" Although Brave New World has been written before Orwell's masterpiece - which is the great merit of Aldous Huxley - and these books show different views of the future, I consider 1984 much more mature than the other. When I started to read it, I couldn't stop. It's intelligent, interesting and VERY well written. Besides, it deals with many, many issues, not only totalitarism, as people use to say. It deals also with loneliness, mass media and the power of verbal language. I really like Orwell's description of a profesional ""building"" a new language, a language so limited that would control human's thought. George Orwell was very inspired when he wrote this book. Congratulations to this sensitive writer."
1,"Best book I have ever read To this day, no other novel has changed the way I look at society as George Orwell has done with ""1984."" I highly recommend this book."
1,"Classic Message in a Modern World Winston lives in a world of constant survelence and secret police. Truth is what the government says, not what actually happened. According to the ""facts"" produced by the government, the country is getting better, but according to memory, the country is getting worse. Society has been brainwashed by fear of its own government and also by incited anger at its enemy country.1984 yields the (very) far extreme of a society that many fear some current societies are headed. Although fiction, it is fascinating to look at certain similar aspects to current societies (again, nowhere near as extreme as the book's society), and is a good book in terms of where we should keep our society from heading. Truly a great read in terms of perspective.The only downside that I took from the book was that I was so bothered by what Winston endured and especially the last 50 pages of the book. Never a regret reading it, but definitely not a ""happy book."" I like my eyes wide open."
1,"1984 - A Book About the Future What can you say about this book that hasn't already been said? It's dark. It's real dark. It's real, real dark. Get your flashlight. The future is not a nice place and this is no fairytale. It is, however, a classic and a must read."
1,"Masterpiece of Satire I believe there are some people--many of whom are artists-- who arrive on this earth to warn us of the future. George Orwell--a Humanistic Socialist--is one of those people. I write in the present tense because although Mr. Orwell has left us, his masterpiece works such as 1984 and Animal Farm, remain, and probably will--as all great artistic works--for a very long time.The warning that 1984 represents is that of impending dystopia--evil in its abject, Senseless, Self-Serving brutality--that threatens to take hold of our human society whenever people become complacent. The question is will we heed the warnings and begin taking responsibility for creating heaven on earth-- or will we wallow in this dangerous complacency and thereby enable the bullies to take over for the sheer love of power?"
1,Covers Redness Bought this to disguise redness occurring with rosacea. It does a good job when used over a moisturizer and primer covering the redness but not cracking. Recommend using it with a primer and moisturizer.

1,"Don't you get it? What a brilliant movie about incest and how it leads to the devastation of a woman. A woman who can't feel anything, who is trying desperately in every way to feel...something. And when someone presents himself to draw her out of her withered self, all she can do is re-enact her adoloscent despair. Come on, folks -- her mother tells her she's filthy, she berates her for giving in to a man -- this is Psychology 101, but brilliantly acted and compelling. Of course, she wants her student to be damaged, because she is both jealous and trying to protect her student from her overbearing parents. I doubt that I'm going to sleep well tonight."
1,"now this is a great psychological portrait Bound to become a classic of world cinema, 'the piano teacher', is Michael Haneke's most perfect film.. It tells the story of a women so repressed and abused by her mother that she explodes with sexual tension..it comes out in her music.. and in a sort of chaotic relationship with one of her students.. at times incestuous and at times perverse this is a truly disturbed women who is as rigid as her own philosophy of music- this is a must see - a modern classic from a powerful new cinematic voice.."

1,"Like silky, velvet dreams The moment I put this cd on and heard the light, lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sun-kissed Gregorian chants, followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat, I knew this was going to be one journey I'd be willing to take for many years to come...and that was the impression I got from the first track alone! Imagine what ensued... It only gets better from there!Every song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood, and while I find this exotically soothing debut album by Black Ether (an astonishingly overlooked group) extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles, I'd have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnic-world flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea."
1,"Put it out on DVD,PLEASE See my review of this movie on vhs.Some day before I'm dead,maybe this will come out on dvd.If you want this movie out on dvdthen click yes."
1,"""A Majority of one"" I have been a big fan of the movie ""A Majority of One"" for many years. I have a ""tape"" of the movie, but was thrilled when the movie came out on DVD. Rosalind Russell is superb. The interaction between Rosalind and Alec Guiness is extremely pleasurable to watch from the time they met on the ship to their relationship in Japan. The scenes with Rosalind dressed in the Japanese Kimono were priceless. The ending was extremely enjoyable leaving the audience to draw its own conclusion on where their relationship would go."

1,"May I borrow your Penquin? Not only is this 5 stars, it should get a rosette in the Peguin catalogue.It's simply the best since the 1970's superb Emi recordings. Thanks Emi for putting all this material on one disc. Mr Cleobury's has directed this music in a somewhat faster pace than the 70's versions, thus rendering these works absolutely fun to listen to, especially the ""Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem"". It's just astonishing. I've followed Purcell recordings since Yehudi Menuhin, Schwartzkof...Baker...Britten...Deller Consort...James Bowman...Elloit Gardiner...Will Christie..I am quiet intimate with Purcell. And, this one stands right up there with the best of them. Intense, passionate and very singable. This one could revive the Purcell Society or maybe, even start one in the states."

1,"Excellent! Movie was okay, I liked it. Never realized there was a book for it. I was buying more Anne Rice's books and saw Exit to Eden, I picked it up knowing if Anne Rice wrote it, it would be good. But... it was even better! A MUST READ! It was completely different than the movie! But totally BETTER! I recommend this book with no problem. You must be open-minded. I like the fact it went from The Club to real-life. I have read most reviews. I agree with people saying its the best. For those who say it ""trash,"" you may need to open your eyes and see the true world out there. It's not the 50's anymore. You have your opinions, but I have mine and this is an EXCELLENT BOOK TO READ. I have read the Witching Hour and the books to follow for the series. Anne Rice continues to amaze me with her works, specially considering this is a earlier written book! Amazing. Read it!"
1,"Completely changed my life A friend recommended this book to me. Once I started, I couldn't put it down - it captured so many ideas I'd already been thinking. I then gave it to my wife, who, to my surprise, also loved. Needless to say, it has completely changed our lives for the better."
1,"Wonderfully Erotic I was not able to put this book down. If you have ever been interested in s/m, you must read this. Anne takes you to the point of being sexually submissive like no one ever will!"
1,"WOW! I can't believe I read this book in one sitting. This is the first novel by Anne Rice I've ever read. Her words are so descriptive, I found myself just painting the images in my mind. Even my body shivered as I read some of the encounters between Elliott and Lisa. It's a good story. I don't really get the S&M stuff, but still a good book. Most memorable section...the butter and cinnamon in New Orleans."
1,"The hell with princesses; I'm saving the world! I think this is enough to tell you that the game is great. This game resembles Mario64 and Banjo-Kazooie, but has the better graphics and more mature gameplay that you would expect from XBOX. The graphics are amazing, and the controls are easy to use. The characters in this game are amazing, each with their own unique traits. There are several levels in which the game takes you to places far and wide. From a Snowy Winter Wonderlad to a Firery Desert, you get the feeling of visiting places all around the world just by a move of the joystick. With a resemblance to the old and happy Mario64 and Banjo-Kazooie, this is a must buy game."
1,"Nice quality necklace I get a lot of compliments on this necklace when I wear it. The chain is heavy enough to be sturdy, but not too bulky. The amethysts are very deep in color and have good clarity. Recommended."
1,Fabulous book! I read this book many years ago and wanted to read it again.My order was handled quickly and professionally.Great service. Great book.
1,"The near future is here! Come on - a classic. Montag is iconic and impervious to criticism; c'mon, he hates burning books and he's a 'fireman.' Bradbury has created one his best stories in this tale of the near future, which tragically, is beginning to mirror our own. How many young people to I hear say 'I don't like to read, not my thing.' Are we so far away from Fahrenheit 451? Five stars."
1,"Hauntingly realistic! I'm a sophomore in high school, and I just finished reading F451. I may be slightly bias, since I love to read, particularly Sci-fi (Star Trek rules!), but this book was really good. I know many read this book in their junior high years, but I think it's better if it's read a little later, when it can be ""digested"" more thoroughly by a more mature audience. So many people, regardless of high school levels, hate to read, and I sincerely believe that is one of the most dangerous things in today's society. Schools do not stress music, art, and literature nearly as much as they should. We learn to THINK--we gain WISDOM from what we READ, not from playing sports and playing games on computers. Even many colleges give out more sports scholarships than academic scholarships. Western Civilization had better watch out, or Ray Bradbury's sci-fi book will become REALITY..."
1,"Ironic & Captivating This book was short, and deep. It was amazingly deep in fact, for the length. Bradbury captures something about our nature both to believe in something passionately, and to ignorantly become sheepish. There is lying, betrayal, and small glimmers of home, in a macabre future. One of my favorites by far."
1,"Best Book This book just sweeps into the world of so called happiness.I think the book is warning us about the dangers of technology.I love the way he portrays life in the future and how liberal and lazy the people have become.I especially love Captain Beatty's personality, he can burn books but yet he knows quite alot about them.Captain Beatty's name is kind of ironic in how it incorporates the word beatific, which means to show extreme joy or bliss,when in the book they all are trying to stay happy when really they're not.They are not happy in my opinion because they always have to be doing something they can't just think or have a conversation with a human being.This book is very interesting and I recomend it to teens so they can learn more about life itself."
1,"I really enjoyed this one! For grade levels 11th and up, Fahrenheit 451 is sure to please readers of all intrests. Fireman Guy Montag is deeply troubled when he meets a local girl and watchs a women burn in her home. He then realizes the importance of those books he keeps burning and within a few days, he is a totally diffrent person.Author Ray Bradbury predicts the future and successfuly holds the reader's intrest. Frightingly, Ray predictions are quite acurate. Read it and see for yourself."
1,"Farenheit 451: The relevant and haunting masterpiece Guy Montag is a hero of heroes in this masterpiece of a book. He is a misguided soul who never wonders whether his and his companions' actions are just and right. When the idea of the flaw of his society is introduced, Guy goes on a difficult journey for the truth. This is a book that will stay with you forever."
1,"Breathtaking This book was the most breathtaking, jawdropping, and eyeopening phenomenon. I have read this book several times and every time I see something that I didn't see before and gain one more level in the battle against ignorance."
1,Great book All theses years later this book still holds up. Loved it. I would recommend this book to anyone. Somebody should do a modern movie remake of this story.
1,"Fahrenheit 451 I read this book as a teenager, and I wanted my students to read it as well. Although I loved it, I did not get the same reaction as when they saw the video. However they did think the video was cheesy... :D"
1,Great Sale! I bought this book for my personal library and was thrilled by it's condition. It was in mint condition and the seller was great to work with. The book was delivered really quickly and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Thanks!
1,"A Great Read...Thank you! Grateful I stumbled upon this book. A fantastic read. Timeless and incredibly thought provoking.If the summary grabs you at all, give it a chance."
1,"One of the Best Books EVER! This is such an amazing novel, everybody should read it because of its message. While some books become outdated, this novel is still relevant today."
1,"Chilling To you reviewers who had to read this book for school and hated it: I too was forced to read it when I was in 8th grade, and felt the same way about it that you do. I thought it was the dumbest most boring book I'd ever read.I'm telling you now: wait 5 or 6 years, and pick this book up again. I promise you will enjoy it. It's a story of an oppressed society and a man with the courage to try and break free. Please, give Farenheit 451 another chance. You won't regret it."
1,"A Great Summer Read Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a book that will make you think. As you are reading this book, questions pop up that you would have probably never thought of. Set in the not so distant future, Bradbury plunges you into the life of Guy Montag. He is a fireman who was always taught to ask how, not why. His job is to burn, not put out flames, never asking the reasons behind the burnings. He goes through life happy, not knowing anything is wrong. He lives in an unperfected utopia. Due to one event, his whole mentality crumbles and chaos emerges as he goes through a transformation, making everyone around him his enemy, except the few people who have gone through this metamorphosis. No longer ignorant he becomes isolated, pushing for some way out.This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read; it might even be my favorite. If you like books such as The Giver, or the short story Harrison Bergeron, then this is definitely a book to read."
1,"My Favorite Book I love the writings of Ray Bradbury and this book tops them all.Although decades old, it's message is loud and clear. And I still think that the allegories and themes in this are still prevelant in today's society."
1,"Thinking is for LOSERS! This book was really good and made me think a lot more about society and censorship. We are already at the point where everything we think about has already been thought for us(news, magazines,media,etc.). I guess as long as one is happy with society we will always be ruled and brainwashed by the government. Anyways...read this book it'll make you think about real life and how lucky we are that society isn't as screwed up as it could be."
1,"Mike's Review Farenheight 451 is an extrordinary piece of literature. It contains a number of symbols. Ray Bradbury has written a deep complex piece of literaature in Farenheight 451. It is set to take place in the future. Everything isin a fast pace, and there is not a second to breathe in the world that it takes place. You can not walk along the road. Also you can not talk. The most odd things in this book are firemen start fires, and it is illegal to own books. After reading this book I am left to wonder... will the future really be like this?"
1,"A Perfect Quick Read A great story to pass the time during travel, such as on a plane or in car, because it should only take 2-and-a-half Hours to read. It starts with Guy Montag, a fireman whose job is to actually start fires, primarily to burn books and their owner's houses. After being encountered by a strange 17-year old girl who asks not only ""what"" things are about but ""why"", and witnessing a woman commit suicide by lighting her house (bearing books) on fire rather than let the Firemen do it themselves, he decides there must be something else to books than just words and paper. The story is about his struggles to revive the book world and save it from certain destruction."
1,"Thesis Statement For Fahrenheit 451 Ray Bradbury in his classical novel Fahrenheit 451 uses symbolism, imagery, and literary devises to create an abhorrent world filled with censorship. In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury gives a frightening vision of the future where firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury paints society as holding happiness as there highest goal, where trivial, useless information is good and ideas and knowledge is bad. One of the most reoccurring literary devises in this novel is symbolism. We often see symbolism in the character's names. For example, one of the main characters, Guy Montag can have two translations. Guy signifies Guy Faux a famous man we associate with effigy, and Mischief Day (Nov.4), and Montag is the trademark of the Need American Paper Company, also a brand of furnaces. More symbolism is shown when we meet Faber. Faber is America's leading pencil company and it is going to be the pencil that writes on Montag's paper."
1,"Incredible literature (I am only 11) I thought that this book was great and it really makes you wonder. This book was written by a person who had a great imagination, the best. And like Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important that knowledge."" Which I thought was the moral of the book. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants to read where one page makes you read the next."
1,"None I am reading this book in 7th grade advanced language arts. Most students don't like it and think that it's confusing, but i love it."
1,One of a kind masterpiece! This is a marvellous book. I found it full of compelling text and did not want to put it down. I recommend this book to anyone whom likes a good can't put down book.
1,I'm a big fan of Bradbury I think his writings are amazing. I know many differ on that opinion but I truly enjoy his works. 451 is my favorite of his writings. I think it is fascinating to see how much the time influenced him. How so many things you see in the movie are now in creation like the wall tv (our flat screen now). This book was required reading in my youth and I feel it should be required today as well. It's a view of a world which could easily occur if we allow our rights to be flushed basically. How we could easily fall into a dystopian world if we become complacent and lack knowledge. I highly recommend this book!
1,"Sweet, sweet irony The irony of this book always slayed me. Here is a book of a future where books are like drugs: outlawed, sold on the black market, and if there's a ""library,"" firemen destroy it. And the added bonus is that the main character, a loyal fireman, has a library! The irony that gets me is that this book is about banning books, yet it is a banned book, so nobody read it! (Ha ha, just kidding folks!)"
1,"Philosophical This book should not merely by its face value. It is a ""good"" book on its plot and development alone. Its insight into life, however, knocks it up a step. It is very profound and warns us of an ignorant, entertainment society."
1,451 This was a fantastic book. Felt like the quality and price were fair as well. I would recommend this book.
1,"Quite an achievement I read this book as an assignment when I was 11 or 12, I believe. The reason I write this is because all the moronic kids who were ""forced"" to read it seem to think it sucks; well, let the record show that not *all* schoolchildren are idiots who must interpret every line of every book literally. I was duly impressed by the book even in 7th grade (?) and it gets better the older I get. The fact that I, an impoverished (well, you know what I mean) teenager, am willing to pay double the price of the book for a signed copy says something."
1,The best book in the world If you haven't read this book you have to do so now. I know you are thinking its science fiction but once you read it you'll be thinking how can they burn books and kill people who do. You will agree bradbury's ideas. I hope a movie comes out of this book eventhough bradbury doesn't like it.Maybe the book can be remember by a movie.
1,"Excellent! It's definitely one of the best movies I have seen in the past 5 years. Amazing performances, great cast and story."
1,The Dead Girl (DVD) I really like this movie. It is one that I would stronglyrecommend to my friends and all good movie buffs. It is bestthe first time you see it as there are surprises in it thatyou don't want to know before you see it. Watch this movie.
1,It worked Yep. Motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord. Has a convenient on off light that you'll never miss. It's big and bright.
1,"Excited I am very, very pleased with the car charger. It came packed very well and in a very timely manner. The price was great compared to retail stores. No worries now when traveling long distances."
1,"Slick unit. Wish all chargers had coiled cords like this on has, stays out of the way. Very nice looking unit, well made and works great."
1,"Eye-opening, profoundly moving Who are these people who beg by the side of the road? What has driven them to so desperate a measure as panhandling? How much money do they collect? Where do they go and how do they live when they are not on the streetcorners? While Bruce Moody's book cannot speak for all street beggars, it does provide a thoughtful and penetrating glimpse into the hidden world of the down and out. In reading this account, one must perforce give up the well-worn cliches and stereotypes about those inhabiting this netherworld. Moody's tale is one of raw adversity, yes, but also one of redemption. The kindness of strangers he encounted in one year is, I daresay, more than most of us will experience in a lifetime. ""Will Work For Food or $"" shines as a bright beacon of hope through the darkness of despair."
1,"Wow! You gotta hear this! This entire album is great! In particular, ""The Chant of the Islands"" is a breathtaking song. Its what paradise sounds like.Do yourself a favor and purchase this album."
1,"Balrog! I am such a huge fan of author J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderful Lord of the Rings book trilogy and I must say that Fellowship of the Ring for the Game Boy Advance is a remarkable adaptation to Tolkien's book trilogy! But, beware of the glitches in this game! I got past them, but it wasn't easy. The game crashes in the Old Forest and the Mines of Moria levels. Other than that, this is a stunning game!"
1,"The best game I have ever played. JoeF-k This is by far the best game I have ever played. You may get stuck in the Mines Of Moria ,but this game you won't be able put down! The frist time I played it I played for 7 hours strait!"
1,Great memories My grandmother gave me this book when it was first published. I loved it then and I love it now. My grandmother lived in similar conditions and now I am too. Its a wonderful read. Full of laughter and smiles.
1,"Who says Old Folks don't have fun I just saw this book at a yard sale, the title caught my interest and I am not sorry I bought it. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my Daughter-in law's birthday"
1,"Elder adventure and northern California history I've read Dear Mad'm three times and am still amazed at the author's ability to transport me into the Klamath mountains. She skillfully paints a detailed picture of her late-in-life adventures amidst enchanting mountain forest life and people who take care of each other around the mid-1900s. You'll learn a lot about small-scale gold mining, the beautiful plant life of the area and the ability that one can have to change his or her destiny with the simple phrase of, ""I'm going to do it!"" I hope someone turns this into a movie!"
1,"Both Stuart Little 1 & 2 on one ""little"" PSP UMD Disc! WOW! This is a great PSP UMD Video!!! Includes BOTH Stuart Little and Stuart Little 2 on one tiny PSP UMD!!! Two great family films!!! Will keep the kiddies(and adults too!)entertained for hours!!! Recommended!!! A+"
1,"I agree... I know this isn't the most helpful review but I would justlike to concur with the other reviews. I have had these bootsfor a year now and except for a few scuffs, they still are ingreat condition."
1,"A Great Contemporary Story I had my doubts that I would even like ""Baby Oh Baby"" due the fact that I saw it advertise in the back of another book that I didn't like, but I took a chance and bought and I am glad that I did. ""Baby Oh Baby"" is a great story about losing love and finding it again. The one thing that I really liked was the fact that the secondary characters also had a storyline to, that help to contribute to the main story. Can't wait to read more by Robin Wells"
1,"A gem amidst a pile of rocks ""Dreams were nothing but diving boards for disappointment. The higher you climbed, the deeper you plunged."" This sentiment could describe my reading experiences this year, until Baby, Oh Baby. In fact, it gets my early, albeit imaginary, vote for Best Contemporary for 2001. The characters were deeply realistic, yet likeble. Jake's return to the fertility clinic (""The clinic was sterile. Just like the patients who came here."") made me choke up. Annie's attention to ""signs"" and intuition was touching, not silly. Her steadfast resolve not to be second place was admirable: ""I want a no-holds-barred, not-holding-anything-back, in-it-with-everything-I've-got kind of love."" The ending scene at the courthouse was perfect, and had me singing along...""Baby, oh baby..."""
1,"a real gem This is one of those rare romance books that just suck you in from the very beginning. There are actually two romances in one in this book. I actually found the secondary romance as good as the main one and that is not easy to find in a book. Usually you find yourself skipping over the second relationship because the first one is so much better.Actually, I think this book would adapt well as a movie. There were enough humorous parts to rival any of today's romantic comedies.If you haven't read this one, you're missing out. I'd give it 10 stars instead of the 5 allowed."
1,Worth every penny Can't say very much about this.Cord doesn't tangle and there is no noticeable loss in sound quality compared to plugging phones directly in to stereo.
1,Great addition to camera I am very happy with this product. It keep the camera completely dry and still allows full functionality of all the buttons!!
1,"Great for your camera! I really like this housing, it's light, easy to use, easy to clean. Takes great underwater pictures from simply snorkeling to deep (30m) diving."
1,"AWESOME I just had to write and say how wonderful this CD is. The kids and I love it so much. As a matter of fact, I listen to it when the kids aren't even with me! We have purchased it for all of our friends!"
1,He knew he was right A far better book than the BBC movie. i enjoyed it immensely even though it is long. Some of the characters are not real particularly some of the young women
1,"Video Violence (Howard and Eli crapped) Video Violence is one of the greatest horror movies ever. Howard and Eli crapped their pants in a bad way. Video Violence is just so tight. Steven has a vicious mullet, and the movie just kicks diaper butt."
1,Excellent British Movies This set of 8 movies are top notch entertainmentyou will enjoy some great stories with excellent actingso do your self a favor and order this set of movieschfancierFancier of fine movies
1,Excellent Collection I am a great fan of Colin Firth and bought it for that reason. A fortunate purchase because there are some great films that I may have missed.
1,"Movie It was brand new as stated and received very quickly. I love BBC and historical pieces. This is a good one, especially for this price."
1,"A Fabulous Surprise I never thought I would get addicted to this book in the way that I did. As a hetero female, I assumed I wasn't the target audience. And I'm not. But that's besides the point. The stories are so engaging, so honest and funny that they transcend gay porn or erotic fiction. They're fascinating stories--a truly spectacular entree into the world of the penis."
1,"Great performances!! A very interesting compilation of wonderful performances, from several heavy duties of the prog rock scene in the 90s. The progfest was an amazing opportunity of enjoy our well beloved bands, old and new! The John Wetton Band is at its best in this concert, and also are specially inspired the intervention of Spock's Beard and Arena. The Flower Kings is always a great presence, and watching Le Orme after so many years, was a wonderful surprise.Thanks to the progfest! To have the video is at least a good consolation for all of us who were not able to be there. Only problem is that you want to watch more of the performances!!"
1,"If you know what Atari is, buy this! I've been searching for a gamecube game that is like the old style Atari-Like video games I grew up with and here it is! Plus, when you succeed with a pac-man game (not sure how many levels), you are given a bonus game of Pac Man to try which was a wonderful surprise. The galaxia games are pretty much like I remember. Pole Position is still hard for me to maneuver. Also no directions onscreen so plan on figuring out the game for yourself. I love it because it's simple w/ no frills!"
1,"Love the classics This game is simply amazing and flawless! There are some unlockables, and all the games have multi-player action! It's seriouly like a classic arcade, rooled into a updated game system. Before I go on with the posative, I have one just one, the entire reveiw, I promis this is the only negative...In some of the pac-man games, if you play on a small TV (like me) then it's hard to see everything in general.*gasping for air* I'm so glad that negative part is over! Back to the posative!With three totally new games: Pac-man Arrangement, Galaga Arrangement, and Dig-Dug arrangement. These are all great games, that are so much fun!In addition, there are two games you can unlock:1. Pac-attack - Unlock by scoring 20,000 points or more in Pac-man2. Pac-Mania - Unlock by scoring 15,000 points or more in Ms. Pac-ManPros -EverythingCons -Read above"

1,"Don't write a review until you read this and waited... Don't write a review until you read this and waited.Finnegans Wake takes time to penetrate the mind.At first, it makes no sense. But keep trying, and try, and try...and then you will get its awesomeness."
1,"Cross-world O.k. this book is unreadable. It is not enjoying and it definitely shows you your limits in all categories. But what power must lie within a text whose first 5 or 6 lines could be the subject of 100 dissertations or 1000s of interpretations that make sense too. Just hand the first paragraph to a student class and let them brainstorm what could be meant by ""riverrun,... commodius vicus or recirculation, ...etc."" and you will see and feel it."
1,this book is cool this book is like so cool man i mean it is like watching the spice girls movie cept its in a book i really like it so i think you should buy it
1,"Nursing as a Ministry Again, Sr Mary Elizabeth O'Brien has writeen an excellent book. I give this book to nurses when they graduate. It truly puts nurses in an angelic and spiritual perspective which they deserve."
1,"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life I purchased this book as ""used"". It is in excellent shape. At the moment I am still reading it. Great."
1,"Best Spiritual Disciplines Book There is a lifetime worth of practical advice on developing spiritual disciplines. Chapter on Bible Intake 1 & 2, Prayer, Worship, Evangelism, Serving, Stewardship, Fasting, Silence & Solitude, Journaling, Learning and Perseverance in the disciplines."
1,"Fantastic! Any Christian, new or old, needs to read this book! It will absolutely change the way you go about life!"
1,"Your lap will never be the same The comfort, the ease of use, and finally, a protective surface for my tender lap that was being burned off by the heat of laptop! Lapinator to the rescue!I'll be honest, this isn't my first lapinator. I have bought two before and used them for meetings. When I got a new house, I had to have one for here too, so I got the ultimate! With a mouse holder! Way cool and good for either righties or lefties! :)I've tried them all, every product to protect my privates, and this is the only one I'll trust my tender thighs to!"
1,"Hatebreed I read a reveiw on here from a customer named xtestosteronexsupplimentsx and he seemed to think that Hatebreed stole their sound from such non-hardcore bands as Slipknot and others. Well, seeing that Hatebreed was formed in the early 90's I don't see how that could be. Sorry man, but you just don't know. Hatebreed is a brutal hardcore band with in-your-face hard hitting riffs and relentless vocals. I love the music of Hatebreed. Being a Christian I do find some of their lyrics confrontational but the music is great. It can get a bit repetative but nonetheless good. This band is for those who enjoy true hardcore, not what has recently been attributed as hardcore (for example bands like Korn, Slipknot, Kid Rock....these are pop bands that are very heavy...not hardcore bands. hardcore is different). If you have any comments just write me an e-mail."
1,The best I bought this cd when it first came out. It has not left my cd player yet. The only problem is that it's kinda short. But I can deal with that because it's heavy. The bigger problem is that I haven't heard of them touring. I hope they do!
1,"outstanding... Im ussualy into something much more brutal & insane & gore then the likes of hatebreed but i can't deny tha fact that i enjoy their music alot! I seen this guys at ozzfest & i did enjoy their performance alot & i just like how their music attracts all kinds of people...Some how that makes me like them even more! I quess that's hatebreed for you! Okay, hatebreed's new album ""rise of brutaly"" as well as the one before that ""perseverance"" are also pretty amazing in itslef...Support hatebreed!PS: I hate the fact that they put slipknot in the same category as hatebreed...F*ck slipknot--they suckkk!!!!!!! Only posers listing to slipknot,f*ck 'em!"
1,"Brutal!!!! Wow!!! Just insane and just how I like it. NO rapping. No singing. No slow parts!!!!! It is short but it still well worth it!!! Closest thing to what they sound like is probably Soulfly. EVERY SINGLE TRACK IS GOOD!!! I cant even say that about Slipknot! Although, Slipknot is the best band out there. Another band to check out is Mudvayne!!"
1,"Why does nobody seem to care about this album?! People call themselves a huge Hatebreed fan, but they don't have this, let alone the fact that they have probably never heard any of the 25 minutes of brutality that is Hatebreed's indie-debut. I won't say their new stuff sucks (it rocks), but this is even better. Go down to a Newbury comics or somewhere where you can find some great underground metal and check it out, especially if you like Perseverance or Rise Of Brutality."
1,"The best of the best This CD works wonders on people. If I had to fight Mike Tyson, I would make sure to have this CD with me before the fight. This CD is sick. My dog likes it, too."
1,"Score true to movie Many piano-vocal reductions for musicals are completely different from the original score. This one stays surprisingly true, though the left hand is missing a lot of interesting rhythms, and not many vocal harmonies are present. The keys of all songs are the same as the movie, and all intros, choruses, and verses are intact. Some of the interludes and dances are shortened or omitted, however. If you're looking for the karaoke CD, try iTunes."
1,"Another Winner by Jackpine Bob ""Born to Pull"" is vintage Bob Cary, maybe his best work ever. As always the question is, is it Cary's marvelous prose or his illustrations that make this book great? Wait. It's illustrated by someone else - Gail de Marcken. But Bob, please don't try to tell us you had no hand in the art work.Even if the reader is a die-hard dog sled fan there are things to be learned in this book. Even die-hard Cary fans will be moved by the stories of mushers and their dogs.This is a beautifully put-together book. It even feels good to hold. The centerpiece is the collection of great stories. Cary lets his subjects speak for themselves as he guides the reader through the details; he is the master of this technique.Five paws up."
1,"Great fit for 70# lab mix I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a 70# lab-shar-pei mix. Even though this dog's head is a bit smaller than the one pictured on the front of the product, it fit perfectly and my friend has seen great results in her walks with her dog, who used to pull like mad, but is now behaving really well thanks to this little contraption."
1,"This product is superior to the gentle leader! After our new furry family member chewed through two of the Gentle Leader collars in three months, I went in search of something new. We have had this collar now for over nine months and it is still in one piece. The nose loop does not slip off like with the other collar, so he can't eat it! And even if he managed to do so - the material is thicker and stronger. Our dog is a 75 lb lab/bulldog mix, who can out-pull me or my husband on a standard neck collar. But this head collar really minimizes his ability and desire to pull. I can control him with two fingers on the leash - HUGE difference! LOVE this one!"
1,"Love it I bought the Halti brand first... This brand is better... has a soft piece of material that goes over the nose of your pet.. This is the best thing I could have purchased for my dogs.. It DEFINITELY WORKS... I have 2 strong-willed Boxers that try to control me... but this product is a lifesaver... Thank you, thank you, thank you !!!!"
1,"Great product - Must have! My dog is a puller and I being a petite woman with a bad back found it difficult walking my spunky 65 lb lab. Prior to purchasing the Holt, I had been using the Gentle Leader from Premier and truly liked it. Both collars are similarly designed. The only dislike I had with the Gentle Leader was with the nose loop. It didn't have the supportive cushion my dog required leaving her skin very raw.The Holt collar is designed with a cushioned nose-band which adds extra protection.What I did appropriate with the Premier Gentle Leader was the informative DVD they provided that instructed how to properly fit the collar to the dog and how to properly use it.Transitioning between the two leaders was minimal to nothing. I would recommend either one of these products, they are a life saver!!!"
1,"Perfect size 3 for doberman/shepherd mix What a great invention! Not only it fits on my doberman/german shepherd mix dog, it also works! My dog tends to pull during the walk, especially when she sees another dog. This training collar distracts her from pulling because it is positioned under her mouth. She did not like it initially and tried to take it off, but then she concentrated on the walk itself.Another nice feature of this collar is that it is adjustable in the front under her nose, so if it is hot outside and the dog has to pant she can open her mouth.The collar is supposed to attach to a regular collar that the dog wears all the time, although I used it as a single collar on my dog."
1,LOVE THIS WALKING COLLAR This walking collar has the greatest design. I do not have to have great upper body strength to control my excited boxer. She walks next to me like she is supposed to. No more pulling me down the street. Bravo
1,"simply magick!!! perfect pictures and no extra cost I cannot estimate the endless fortune this will save me. I have a SLR and developed my own film, till I got so tired of the darkroom and the cost! Still, having it developed even from 'quickie' mail order sites cost a fortune. Worse, when you are trying to take a good picture of kitty and she goes zoom zoom zoom and ruin nearly a whole roll of film you want to scream. With this, pop it into my camera and click all day. I held on to my SLR for so long because I felt there was no way something so simply could have such quality! Wow!the colours are true, the images brilliant and SO SHARP. Too a picture of kitty four foot away and you could see a flea on her nose in the picture!Get a good camera like the Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom, get one of these cards and takes 100s of pictures. It puts the fun back in taking pics!!"
1,"If you liked StarGate at all, you'll want to see Continuum. GREAT movie. I hope they keep making these direct-to-DVD Stargate films. The TV show was outstanding and I loved all ten seasons. The previous ""Ark of Truth"" direct-to-DVD movie was terrific and this one maintains the high production quality, storyline and acting.Somehow, they managed to get practically all of the actors portraying the various heros and villians over the years back together for the story. For example, there are lots of cameos by all the best ""System Lords"" we loved to hate in the TV show.If you're a Stargate fan, you won't want to miss this.My only regret is that I just bought the DVD last week for $15 at Best Buy when I could've rented it here for $3.99, but at least the DVD includes a few hours of bonus material about the production.Two Kentucky thumbs up to the Stargate cast and crew!"
1,Great movie. If you are a fan of the Stargate series and want to see an end to the series as a movie this is a great movie and a must see and I got this fast after ordering it.
1,Great Closing to stargate sg1 Wonderful movie to close the stargate sg1 saga. A must see for your whole family. Guaranteed wonder and amusement once again
1,"Continuum makes the grade! A fan since the beginning I've seen every show there was..loved the final 2 hour wrap up of StarGate, even if you never watched a show, this would be fun for some who like Sci-Fi! I enjoyed several of the fun things Ben Browder slipped in while taking Command of the starship... and the fact that many of our past ""bad guys"" come back for one last peek.. Love owning this... nothing like a rainy day with some snacks and a great Stargate to watch!"
1,"Great Movie Loved seeing Jack again, this is for all of the stargate addicts! I'm not a big fan of the new SG1leader but the movie is still a good watch"
1,"Wow! Great Movie What a great addition to the SG-1 series. This is one of the best stories of the series. I've watched it twice and am eager for a third time.It's great to see Jack back, of course. The story line kept me guessing, and the action scenes were very good and not overdone. The CG is absolutely amazing and fits in without looking gimicky.This movie really brought me back to the feel of the first few series, yet we have characters that span all 10 series. I think everyone from the writers, actors, and production crew were spot on with this movie."
1,"Excellent indeed ! When I saw it first time I was under the impression that I was looking at some Oscar prize movie so I had to seen it once more just after ending... Sometime after first 25-30 minutes of the second view I realize that is on DVD... so no Oscar, too bad. It's better than the ""ARK"", better than ""Children of the Gods"" sometimes better than first one ""Stargate"" (Kurt Russel). Rick is great again, as usual... What can I say, it's not only for Stargate fans, it's for anyone and anything...It's just great. And I guess right now O'Neill asked ... what?!"
1,"Sure hope this is not the end of the road! Really enjoyed this. Got it a couple of weeks ago and have watched it twice already, actually did a whole SG1 thing with this film and The Ark of Truth this past weekend, told the wife is was all based on fact, so she left me alone. Sure hope this is not the end of it all. Anyway this film and 'The Ark of Truth' are well worth the money and you will not be sorry you bought them."
1,"None stop action with a twist From the opening scene, until you realize the movie is already over, this is a great film. Very well done, and worthy of having in a collection for Stargate SG1 junkies!"
1,"Miss the series I was very upset when they took this series off the air. I'm glad to have these movies but still wish the series was still around, Love this movie."
1,"Stargate Pleaser If you are a Stargate fan, then this movie is a must for you. When a couple of the team begin to disappear into thin air the remaining team hits the Stargate and end up in a 20th century when the Stargate has not yet been invented. We have all of our favorite and familiar characters who, of course, go to the North Arctic and Russia to find the frozen Stargate, make things work allowing them to return to their own time and things are made right and all is right with the world. We watched this as a Prime Member free through our computer/TV 60"" monitor. Wonderful."
1,"coolest movie ever!!!!! i have the entire stargate sg-1 box set and the ark of truth movie... this one is my favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the continued story line of the evil but suave gould Bal is just so well crafted and keeps you on the edge of your seat/sofa/bean bag... what ever your setting on:) if you are a huge sg-1 fan, you have to watch this!"
1,MOVIE STARGATE CONTINUUM Movie arrived quickly. Just as good as new. A+++++++Surpassed my expectations. Bought the movie cheaper than what I could have rented it.
1,"great item SG1 Continuum, is a great movie. The CGI is flawless and over all a great movie. I hope it isn't the last MGM does."
1,"Great cooker This is my first rice cooker...it was rated one of the best as I did my research and decided to buy based on feedback from other owners. I must say that I totally agree with the majority of owners, its a fantastic product. The cooker is easy to use, easy to clean and delivers a reliable pot of rice every time. I have no idea what would make a cooker better, but for the average person, I doubt you will need anything more than this...you can have TOTAL confidence that you made the right choice when you hit the 'add to cart' button."
1,Perfect Cooker This is one of the best electrical items that I have in my home. It cooks steel oatmeal as well as rice. All these cooked perfectly. It is a breeze to clean and is small and portable. I loved it so much I bought one for my married daughter in Minneapolis. AND she loves it too. I use it at least 2-3 times a week.
1,"Excellent cooker I've always cooked rice in a saucepan on a stovetop before but got tired of the pan bubbling over all the time. This cooker is great. It is capable of making quite small amounts of rice too. I routinely cook about one-half a cup of rice in it and it turns out great. Brown rice needs to be soaked for six hours or longer prior to cooking or it really won't turn out very good but that is usually recommended anyway. I use one rounded half-cup brown rice that has been soaked, rinsed and drained, and two-thirds cup water, letting it stand for fifteen minutes while still covered after the cooking cycle is complete. It turns out fluffy and perfect every time. Very easy to clean too, just a quick wipe of the inside cover with a damp sponge, pop out the steam vent and rinse it off, and wash the inner basin with a non-abrasive sponge or cloth. I couldn't possibly be happier with this cooker, I use it nearly every day."
1,"Yuki It's easy to use. It's easy to clean up. Functions are simple to understand. I haven't had it for long, so, I don't know anything about it's durability yet."
1,"I like it Before your first time of cooking, you have to hold the rice cook in your chest and wash the inside of the lid under hot water from the tap. I didn't do that until my third time cooking. The first two were terrible with my cooked rice filled with awful plastic smell. After I washed the lid with flowing hot water from the tap, I don't get any plastic smell in my rice any more. The manual should have that instruction. Also I tried to cook my porriage with the lid shut, it is also OK. So far I'm satisfied with it. If it has timing, it would be perfect."
1,"mu-sic , n.: Musiq Soulchild This is the first album I've heard from Musiq and my breath was taken away. The man of neo-soul created a great 3rd album. With songs like Whereareyougoing, Youloveme, Womanopoly, Thereason, there is no doubt that Musiq is music's prodigal son."
1,"Musiq does it again!!! When I first bought this album, I wasn't sure how I felt about it, unlike my immediate love for the first two. But recently I had the pleasure of seeing Musiq in concert and he made me go and reevaluate/rediscover this classic that I had been sitting on since it first came out!! The entire album from beginning to end is very well put together. Out of the 15 tracks, 11 of them are my favorites. Musiq, keep doing what you do best!!"
1,"I am not surprised!!! I love this main. He is the Stevie of our time. His music remains soulful and is entrenched with meaning. I love the beats and lyrics. He continues to explore more of what soul music is, and can be.The intro is bangin'. I love #5 and #10 especially. I can honestly put all 3 albums in rotation and be entertained for hours. Cop this album!"
1,"A Five Star Album Musiq has put to together one solid project with his third effort Soulstar. The album is incredibly self assured and focused. It is rare that I enjoy a CD on first listen, but Soulstar is worthy of such recognition. In addition the use of guest stars such as Cee-lo and Kindred on Momentinlife and Carol Riddick on Soulstar do not seem forced, but a well throughout and executed idea. As I said in the review over a year ago for Juslisten, It took a while for it to grow on me. Soulstar grabbed me on first listen, and I plan to continue to hear what Musiq has to say."
1,"Incredible A great movie, fast, moving, totally capturing. It makes you think, it makes you dance, it makes your heart beat faster, and most important of all it makes you realize how important ""a second"" of lifetime can be and how it can change everything."
1,"German ground hog day. A well done ground hog day type movie. A very well done movie, that keeps up the interest all the way through."
1,"BE SELFISH AND ANTISOCIAL. This film made my heart stop. I subconsciously held my breath in parts, for fear of disturbing its incredible movement and beauty. What an innovative succession of events! Just when you think it's over, Lola stuns you again. Watch this film ALONE. Pay attention. The first experience is key."
1,"WOW The best film of 1999 in my opinion. It made me think, it held me spellbound, it leaped off the screen, and it was totally fresh. I was very disapointed when it was not nominated for best foreign film by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."
1,"If you haven't seen this movie yet, turn off the PC and go.. Run to your neighborhood rental house and rent it! What a wonderful contemporary film."
1,"Captivating! The only thing upon which I can agree with the previous viewer is that the character of Manni is indeed a bit annoying--not too bright, and all too willing to blame Lola for his own predicament. This film is so taught, however, that it hardly matters.Run Lola Run is imaginative, mesmerizing, and take-your-breath-away exciting. The amazing visuals work perfectly with an outstanding soundtrack and a highly engaging storyline to create a truly exquisite film experience. Highly, highly recommended!"
1,"Startlingly Unique ""Run Lola Run"" is a masterpiece so unlike a movie - a movie in the traditional sense, that is, that it's difficult to follow at first. On second and later viewings, it can be viewed for the marvel that it is. It is ingenious in its subtle nuances of passing characters and seemingly throwaway moments that turn out to be so much more, and build the suspense and anticipation, as well as the opprtunity for brilliant twists, throughout the movie. The pulsating sound-track is a stroke of genius, and falls right in step with the relentless pacing of the movie. If you are intolerant of unusual or innovative filmmaking, do not see this movie. But if you have a genuine taste for the bizzare, the creative, the attention-grabbing, and the deviously intelligent, ""Run Lola Run"" is a movie for you."
1,"Direct Hit This is the best action movie I've ever seen. I've never been a big fan of techno music before, but it is used so effectively in this movie that I found myself drawn to the soundtrack afterward. If you can appreciate cinematography like a fast-paced music video, you will absolutely love this film - guaranteed."
1,"A good film...and an amazing work of art This film is one of the best films I have seen, in many ways, you can't describe it, but it is fast-paced and you will not be bored. The German language in the movie actually adds to the movie, it would not be so good if it was in English. This movie is so innovative. 5 stars from me."
1,"My Favorite Foreign Film I usually don't like foreign films but this one is great! This is a fast paced, high energy film. Interesting plot and 3 surprise endings. (Side note:It's nice to see Germany from a everyday person's perspective and not a travel brochure.)"
1,"Classic cult flim It was good. It is good. and the next I watch it, it will still be good. It's a what if i can go back a hour or two and change events before time run out."
1,"The most fascinating movie I have seen in years The people here have already summed it up quite well, but I must chime in anyhow. I went to see this movie in the theater twice (the FIRST time I have EVER done so with ANY MOVIE). Needles to say I loved it and am awaiting the dvd release.BUY THIS MOVIE YOU WILL LOVE TO WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.Don't let the German language version scare you the subtitles are easy to read and it makes you feel as if you are running through Berlin yourself!!!!!!!"
1,"Postmodern Kieslowski Very inventive movie and reminds me of Kieslowski, without the Catholic baggage, in that we see how randmom life isand how small encounters and slight changes in timing can significantly alter one's life and others (without our even being aware of it).This is an interesting ( but not new ) idea to think about, yet it is cleverly presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner in this film. This movie has all the elements of a classic cult film."
1,"SEHR GUT I really liked this movie. Visually, it is a very beautiful movie. The characters, even the minor ones, are intriguing. The plot is exciting and revolutionary. And finally, the soundtrack is wicked awesome.Franka Potente is an amazing actress,there is more evidence of this in the Bourne Identity. She has lots of charisma and pulls you into the movie. Manni actually wasn't too bad. He and Lola are both pretty weird people so its ok.Applause to the Germans, you've come up with a really good one here! Sehr gut!"
1,"A cross between ""Sliding Doors"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It was so fast-paced and interesting. Oh my god, you absolutely have to see it!!!"
1,"Brilliant This is a brilliant film. Lola the played by Franke Potente is a Red Haired (not natural if you know what I mean)freaky type who gets a call from her boyfriend Manny who is frantic telling her he lost a bag of money that he was taking to Renni a bald headed cimminal type. He states he has 20 minutes to get the money to Renni or he is a dead man. Lola tells him to stay where he is and she rushes out of her home to find $100,000 or is it in Deustch Marks? Anyway this is a very clever story that takes place in real time. So you may be thinking if the movie takes place in real time does it only last for 20 minutes? HMMM, you will have to see the film. The highest recommendation. I would watch it w/o subtitles first then watch it with subtitles. German film 5 plus stars No need to watch it before you buy it. It is easily worth the money"
1,"An exhilirating ride! Run Lola Run would have to be one of my all time favourite movies. It is one of the most innovative, and original movies I have ever come across. I could never really tolerate euro-techno until I rented this DVD. The music was composed by talented director/writer Tom Tywker and performed by his leading lady (on- and off screen) Franka Potente, who is brilliant and charismatic as Lola. The story is simple: Lola has 20 minutes tomake up for the loot lost by his hapless boyfriend Manni or Manni will be killed. There are three alternatives to the story, each detailing how one's actions could have consequences on others who cross their path. Many have compared this to other what-if flicks such as ""Sliding Doors"". But this film benefits from not having a terribly self-conscious Gwyneth Paltrow having another bad attempt at a British accent.The movie is fast, euroccentric, and you wouldn't believe that you'd been staring at the screen for 90-minutes. More exciting than a soccer match."
1,"Great Film I borrowed this movie from my friend to kill some time at work and though he had explain the plot; I still loved it! What he told me didn't exactly tell me what to expect. Espeically how well the music is cordniated with the film. The speical features include a great video; which is of the lead actress's song. The other features didn't interest me so I didn't check them out. If you liked the books that you can choose the outcome like go to page 8 or 16 you'll love this movie. I intially watched it in English Dub audio but the lips were totally off and the voices sounded so weird, so I watched in German with English subtitles. I didn't mind the subtitles. I do enjoy forgein films, so if you like them too, buying this DVD would be a great addition."
1,"A Perfect Film I dont think I can actually say enough about this movie to tell you how fantastic and perfectly grand it was to watch. I think having over 50 customer reviews with an average 5 star rating says it all! I bought the movie just off the basis of my friends reviews, and now the movie is on my top ten list of the best movies I have seen. The cinematography, the plot, the music, the actors....all were excellent. I couldn't find a single flaw or even a ""they should have done this..."" This one is just too good to miss."
1,Nice mp3 For me the PA-2 is great. i dont have any problems with it and it was for a reasonable price. There was one problem but that was due 2 my stupidity. So i just wanna let everyone no to get this product if youre lookin for a mp3 player!!
1,"SanDisk 128MB Memory Stick I purchased this product as a generic alternative to the more expensive Sony original. The two memory sticks are so similar that they may as well have been from the same manufacturer - I can detect absolutely no difference in performance between the two.The Sony memory stick format is useful but somewhat overpriced, so it is a real pleasure to find such a reasonable alternative. Strongly recommended"
1,"The one to start on! The basic text of the most exciting playwright of recent decades. The place to start when discovering the American drama as reader, actor, or teacher!"
1,"Great purchase The book arrived on time and in good condition. This is an excellent collection for both theatre enthusiasts, teachers and for a comprehensive sampling of what Shepard is so gifted at constructing."
1,"The best and most essential Shepard collection This collection features his finest and most mature work (Buried Child, Curse, True West) plus the best of his earlier plays (La Turista, The Tooth of Crime). They all showcase his great humor and startling use of language and imagery. Th more mature works deal, unflinchingly with american families. Tongues and Savage Love, which he did in collaboration with Joseph Chaiken, are wonderful, poetic meditations of existence and identity. If you are interested in Shepard as a playwright this is the finest collection of his best work. After this, I recommend seeking out the plays Fool for Love and A Lie of the Mind, for more of his ""mature"" work and then also Angel City as another prime example of the imaginative flights he took with his earlier work. In case you don't already know, Shepard is one of the most important American playwrights. Period."
1,"A great afternoon! Loved this book. I'm a newbie to golf, and this book was full of charm. It's not going to really teach you how to golf, but it will teach you to appreciate the intricacies of the game, and a great personality in it.Plus, it will inspire you to practice, because Hogan was a true student of the game. And that never hurts."
1,"Great Advice for Guys These guys make a great case for finding Miss Right or Miss Right Now on the Internet. There's lots of common-sense advice that literally saved me hundreds of hours in wasted time and thousands of dollars in wasted dating money. The ""Women of Internet Dating"" section had some very funny stereotypes and I even learned something from their astrology section. Following their advice helped me find my future wife in less than 30 days! This little book is worth it's weight in gold."
1,"In French or English, she's Queen Celine If you think Celine Dion is fabulous in English, you should hear her in French. Her sound is much more original, less commericial. 1F4T is a fantastic album. It has an organic, rock sound. You don't need to know french to love this album or any of her last few french albums (d'eux, s'il suffaist d'aimer, chante plamodon). I don't know any french and i'm not some obsessed fan. but i love the french albums anyway because they are the best of an incredible artist whose english output can be quite bland and uninspired sometimes.The track listing:tout l'or des hommesapprends-moile vol d'un angene bouge pastu nagesje t'aime encore (english version with french title is on ""One Heart"")retiens-moije lui diraimon hommerien n'est vraiment finicontre naturedes milliers de baisersplus the bonus ""ghost track"" not listed anywhere on the cd:valse adieu"
1,Celines hit Celine dion is magnificent on this album. Even though its french she's still great. She hits very high notes. Its Just an amazing album. Its very great. It Deserves a grammy award. Its Fantastic you should really bye it.
1,"10 stars! This album is brilliant! If you buy it, I guarantee it'll be the best album you buy all year!"
1,"""1 fille & 4 types"" est superb! Without a doubt listening, enjoying and understanding the passion that Celine pours into each one of her songs is one of the great prizes of speaking French. There are no power-ballads and not so many high notes in this album as it is a more intimate and personal. I love it, this is the perfect mixture of pop, rock and country like rythms. I love it, from ""Tout l'or des hommes"", to ""Le vol d'un ange"", ""Je lui dirai"" to her superb performance of ""Je t'aime encore"", every song is unique and wonderful. Well produced, mixed and arranged, no wonder it was an instant hit in Quebec and France!"
1,"Great tea in a really nice presentation. Bentleys has some of the best teas out there. This box makes a great gift for tea lovers. It has a great variety of green teas (papaya, pomegranate, blueberry, etc.) and each comes individually bagged for freshness. Just steep and enjoy!"
1,"Memories of Cab 804 and much more Taxi is an outstanding sitcom and having Bob James score the music is like finding 500 bucks in the back seat of the Sunshine Cab they call ""old whip and chill"" (no power steering, no heater)--just the best! Bob's music sets the mood and elicits emotions for all the scenes. And, ""Angela's Theme,"" the theme of the show, is like getting a 100 buck tip on a 5 buck fare-amazing! So, if you want to know more, just ""gimme a buck,"" and you'll find out! And meet me at Jim's Mario's for a beer. Or we can go to the Tidepool, where after having several ""monsoons,' we'll be three sheets to the wind."
1,Gossip Girl: The complete Third Season I purchased this item for my grandaughter to update her collection. She was well pleased with the gift which gave her many ours of relaxing enjoyment.
1,Gossip Girl Season 2 I think this is a great series. One can watch it and not really have to think too much - I find it very relaxing.
1,"i love CHUCK AND BLAIR!!! Season 3 was mostly about chuck and blair in a relationship and while i ADORE those two, I kept waiting for the next episode where there will be some HOT chuck and blair sex like in season 1 and 2 but alas, it NEVER happened! this royally PISSED me off but like the title of this review implies, I love chuck and blair and they are the ONLY reason I watch gossip girl. there were a lot of sweet moments and that was why i bought the dvd, also there were some slightly hot scenes between chuck and blair that were in deleted scenes. I LOVE CHUCK AND BLAIR FOREVER, NOW AND ALWAYS!!!!!!"
1,"West Point For those who want more than the Ivies ---- not only an Ivy-rated undergraduate education, but, virtue, leadership training, personal challenge, proving what you're made of, pride in giving something back to your family and America ---- the answer is West Point. EVERYONE has a good chance at the full scholarship. If this sounds like you, go for it.Recommended reading: ""West Point: Character Leadership Education..."", Norman Thomas Remick."
1,"Cheap, works. Need memory, want it cheap? Why buy Sony and pay more? Save some money and get this one, works just like any other."
1,"Great companion to ""Rites of Passage"" It makes no sense to purchase this workbook without ""Rites of Passage"", the companion job search book by John Lucht. If you purchase this workbook on its own to try and save money, you'll find youself going back to order Rites of Passage anyway.This workbook is extremely useful at helping you put structure around following the advice dispensed in ""Rites"". It forces you to put down your thoughts using a logical and organized approach. This leads you to constructing a far superior resume and cover letter than you would have done otherwise.A very valuable tool for someone seeking a new job in the $100K+ range."
1,"Encyclopedic detail and accuracy fleshed out into stories. Bill Dahl is often consulted by other authors to check facts before they publish their works. Now we get the direct line. This book can be read as a reference work or for entertainment, as all the names and dates are seamlessly and accurately included in the real Motown story: Who made the music, from the biggest stars to unsung virtuoso session men; when, where, and, how. A must for any fan of popular music. Oh yeah, lots of great photos, too."
1,"Get this card... your digital camera will thank you! The low capacity cards that digital cameras come with today are such a joke! By getting this card, I can spend more time shooting pictures, which is perfect for getting cutting edge images on to my web site. Oh yeah, get the Flashlink reader, it will save you so much time getting those images off your digital camera and into your PC!"
1,"My 8th Girzone read...LOVE IT! After reading my 1st book by Father Girzone I knew I was hooked. Yes, His writing IS simplistic but you must consider that he is reaching out to a targeted audience. His writing is easy reading for all! Joshua is Jesus come to help the children in a religious torn community. This makes a wonderful bedtime story as well. Need help finding Jesus in your life....find Joseph Girzone 1st!!"
1,"A deeply moving sequel to Joshua. Another beautiful story. Joshua, whom we soon realize is someone very special, returns in this book to a town torn apart by religious intolerance and violence. A parable for the situation in Ireland, as well as other places, it continues to answer that question ""What would happen if Jesus returned?"" This deeply moving book will make you laugh, bring a tear to your eye, and, most importantly, give you and your heart something to ponder"
1,"Joshua & Children This is an easy reading, but profound, story of what children can do to change the prejudices of their elders."
1,Great service Truly love the writing of Joseph Girzone the series of Joshua books. You get so wrapped up in them you don't want to put them down. Great service; had in less than a week. Thanks!
1,"Great Collection, Please read review All original hits and songs.This collection has gathered together two separate music disc's and slipped them into one cardboard sleeve. The titles are:1. Absolutely the Best of the Sixties2. The Psychedelic SixtiesThese two are complete with their own artwork and disc's. Great way to get both titles if you don't already have. I already did so be careful."
1,"A Depression-era tragic romance that's quintessential Altman Keith Carradine as Bowie and Shelly Duvall as Keechie inhabit the mouldering hamlets of the 1930s south so naturally and unaffectedly that your throat tightens. This softer, dreamier Bonnie & Clyde-type tale (filmed in 1941 by Nicholas Ray as ""They Live By Night"")stands, with ""The Long Goodbye"" at the pinnacle of Robert Altman's extraordinary 1970s body of work -- even above ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" & ""Nashville."" Shot like old sepia photographs by Jean Boffety, the film boasts extraordinary supporting work by Bert Remsen, John Shuck, the pre-""Cuckoo's Nest"" Louise Fletcher, and one unforgettable little girl. Why this masterpiece is all but forgotten is baffling: it's in a royal line of American movies dealing with average men and women trying to live in the twilight between decency and crime."
1,"The Shawnee Menance This book grabs your attention from the very beginning and holds it to the ending. A must read adventure of the life & death struggle that early Americans faced in the late 1700's on our own soil. We are anxiously awaiting Roy Hays' next book in ""The Kentucky Scout Series""."
1,"My son loves this game! I wanted to say that I just bought the Rugrats game for PlayStation 2 for my 10 yr old son. Although I have not played it, he enjoys it if I sit in the family room and watch him play. I must say, every time I glance at the TV he is playing some new adventure. He is hooked to say the least! He likes it because it has the real Rugrats Nickelodeon characters and I like it because it is not obnoxiously violent like some other games. Two thumbs up from a parent!"
1,best of brenda lee brenda lee little mis dynamite what a voice she used to visit australia to packed houses and is one of the best early rock nroll artists of all the girls this c.d. has most of her hits and a few extras on it its a pity she doesnt still perform as i am sure she would still pack the house wherever she performed another great record from amazon for my well played collection. jack darby australia
1,"Pricey, but they are the best. The bulbs are a little higher in price. However they are quality and stand up to rough use..You will get what you pay for.It was easy to find on Amazon."
1,"Great value, brute force First off let me help you novices out there a little bit. Don't buy a video card because of its price, its hype, or its look, do your research! This card is excellent, it is blazingly fast, (it beats geforce 3), and it is a steal... BR>A key feature in the radeon 8500 is the programmable pixel shaders. Let me tell you a little more about them. Geforce 3, 4 and radeon 8500 all share them witht he exception with the Geforce 4 MX. The newest games will use programmable pixel shaders and if you don't have a video card that uses this, then you can't play it. The radeon beats its competition while being half the price! but be cautious because there has been driver issues with ATI and what seems to be ""cheating drivers""Pros:blazingly fastcomes from a respectable companyexcellent image qualitycons:driver issues"
1,"Never cease to AMAZE me OK! Sugar Rush was never my favorite song, but this CD has increaced my enjoyment of this song like 50000%!1. Sugar Rush- Like I said, not my favorite A*Teens song2. Sugar Rush (Earthboun's Sugarcrush mix Short)- O my gosh! Earthbound has taken a slower song and made it one of the BEST techno song i have ever heard!3. Sugar Rush (Earthbound's Sugarcrush mix Long)- As i have said in other interviews, this song only gets better as it gets longer!4. Sugar Rush (M 12 Mix)- Can you say, ""The Best remix EVER!"" It's like dance style, and the best. I can't say that enough!"
1,"The Haunting Catherine Zeta Jones and Owen Wilson star in this creepy thriller! This is one scary story of a haunted house that wont rest! Its not like House on Haunted Hill where the house locks you in, this one is just trying to scare you to death while you reside in it! Watch this movie!"
1,Good Movie This is a good movie with a star packed cast. With many twists and turns you never know what is going to happen next. Love It
1,"Genuinely worthy of five stars I have had this book on my shelf for quite a while, and finally got around to reading it after watching a documentary on Columbus on the Discivery Channel. I got inspired to overcome my intellectual laziness, and how pleased I am I did! This book really deserves its reputation as a timeless classic, and the author, a giant of maritime history, did such a fine job that I now want to read his well known biography of John Paul Jones. The text is gripping and the author's insights abound. This is a fine book."
1,Great Piedmont Blues This is a great dvd if you like acoustic blues. The camera work is great and the tunes are classic.
1,"best group ever! Take a travel through your mind, body and soul as you listen to any of the albums by the Art Ensemble of Chicago. I highly recomend that you not only check Urban Bushmen out, but as well as all the other albums. I love the music because I can hear all the love and power behind the music that the Art Ensemble of Chicago creates. It's a definate must in everyones cd collection."
1,"A Romance of a Different sort. Excellent reading! This was my introduction to George MacDonald's books. Not a soppy romance as today's authors tend to write, but even one that men would enjoy reading for leisure! As I am a GREAT fan of C.S.Lewis' and Tolkien's writings, I was fascinated to find that both these author's drew a lot of their inspiration from MacDonald's writings. I have since read ""The Princess & the Goblin"", ""The Princess & Curdie"", ""The Golden Key"", and ""The Light Princess"". My husband is currently reading Phantastes and we have also bought Lilith, still to be read. I look forward to getting ""The Marquis' Secret"" if I can, as I really would like to follow the full story!!"
1,I LOVE this CD! It's got all of the great skating prorams AND its' the full piece of music. It's not some lame edited version. Love it!
1,"THE MUTHALOAD If you have a house full of sh*tkickers, and your beer is disappearing from the fridge, and they're starting to make bathtub gin in the outhouse, and your next door neighbor is with the County Sheriff's Department, don't put this CD on the stereo. You'll never get 'em to leave. And granny will tan your hide in the woodshed with a switch.Hmmmm... ON SECOND THOUGHT, TURN THIS UP REAL LOUD, SO'S THE NEIGHBORS WILL COMPLAIN, YA'LL.THIS IS HILLBILLY GRUNGE AT IT'S FINEST."
1,"Likable music that you enjoy as much as the kids do! We bought this disc after seeing Ralph Covert open for the kid's band ""Hi-5"". The kids love these songs. The adults in the house love the ""Big Rig"" song and the ""Coffee"" song just as much as the kids do. I can respect a song that hits that close to home: ""and tonight I think I'll have a little vino"".Buy this disc for your kids, but you can enjoy it, too."
1,"Soon to be your kid's favorite As a Chicagoan, I am so proud to boast about Ralph's World. These songs are witty, catchy and have great messages. My one year old daughter just loves listening to them in the car. When Tra La La comes on, she starts singing ""la la la."" My husband cracks up at the song about the eighteen wheeler every time. The only track we don't like it is Harry's Haunted Halloween Circus, but it is easily skipped."
1,"Positively WONDERFUL! My son is 4 and just absolutely LOVES the songs on Ralph's World At the Bottom of the Sea. He sings the songs all through out the day. His favorites include: The Banana Splits, Surfin in my Imagination, and Eighteen Wheel on a Big Rig, as well as the Coffee Song. Great album and not one that grates on parental nerves either. I enjoy the songs just as much as my son does. Two thumbs up!"
1,"Excellent CD! What a fantastic cd! Our whole family enjoys it and actually sings along when it's on. Our 1 year old even sings along to the Bean Soup and Rice song ~ he loves it! We bought it after owning Happy Lemons, which is another very ""happy"" cd....I really hope he makes more."
1,"Our all-time favorite CD... I'm amazed we haven't worn the darn thing out. Our three-year-old loves this CD (better than the first, haven't yet heard the third!) and we ended up buying one for each car, and one for all our friends...guess I shoulda bought 'em in bulk! I disagree with the reviewer who said this is for 4 years and up--Laura's loved Ralph since she was six months old."
1,"Excellent follow up to Big Game Hunter I played Cabela's Big game hunter ultimate challenge, and enjoyed it very much. I immediately bought this as soon as it came out. The graphics are even better than Big game hunter, there are tracks behind the vehicles, everything has shadows, and the hunter even leaves footprints behind. The new 'deer finder' arrow is a very cool new feature and gives the game a more arcadey feel. The mission based play of this game is very cool, and the range of levels and deer are just right. The models for the hunters are improved also. Lots of great gadgets and hunting gear are available to the player including a 'predator' style heat vision and a night vision scope ! All in all a lot of fun. A little easiser than BGH but BGH was kinda hard. You can change the difficulty to suit yourself. I am so glad that activision are supporting the genre on consoles !"
1,"Excellent Service The book was in excellent condition you can't even tell that it's been used. Also, it came very fast. Excellent Service and reliability! I would definantely purchase from this person again in the future!"
1,Great stuff I really like this book. It helps me to refresh my mind in a lot of stuff I had forgot! Good book.
1,"VERY HELPFUL THIS BOOK WILL HELP PREPARE YOU FOR THE MILITARY ASVAB TESTS. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AND IT WAS HELPFUL TO MY TEENAGE BOYS,"
1,This book helped me get a good grade This book helped me achieve a 95E-95M-80G-80A. Electrical and Mechanical were part of my background so I can not attribute all knowledge gained to this book. I am now a 2W151 at Nellis AFB and am glad to be in the USAF
1,"Awesome Reviewer This book is easy reading. My daughter used this to review for her ASVAB exams - and yes, she passed with flying colors. Hightly recommended."
1,"Better than the higher rated ARCO one I was pleasantly surprised because I had begun studying from the ARCO textbook, and I noticed that the explanations for arithmetic problems were not always the easiest to understand. Dummies gave me a thorough explanation for each problem, and its vocab section seemed to have more difficult words, which prompted me to study up on that section. Vocab was the least of my concerns until I saw the words in the practice exams in THIS book as opposed to the ARCO one, and luckily, I saw some of the same words on the actual ASVAB. I didn't study the other portions of the textbook, such as autoshop, and electrical, because my focus was the General Technical score, but as far as arithmetic and verbal, this was very helpful."
1,"A Very Sweet Story This tale is sweet and heartwarming, but be forewarned that it is VERY short. I read it in only a couple minutes. It is bittersweet and touching, not a ""happy ending"" story, but worthwhile reading."
1,"Beautiful Yoga DVD As Peggy Hall takes you through each exercise, you feel energized and at the same time more at peace with yourself. I have her other DVD's and really enjoy the pace of this one, especially if you want a bit of a challenge. Beautiful scenery too!"
1,"love it I've been doing this (2) times a week, along with swimming a 1/2 mile at the public pool for the past 3 weeks and feel so good. This video really works your body in all the ways you need for strength and flexibility in surfing. I can't wait to get back in the ocean soon, when it gets a little warmer ! And take the power and flow of this yoga, to help me improve my surfing. Instead of working so hard to catch a wave and paddle out, at my age of 57:)"
1,"Good Buy The toy makes an appealing ""crinkle"" sound, and it's a little bit smaller than other similar books on the market -- so my 4-month old grandaughter can handle it a bit better. I was extremely pleased with this toy (as was the baby)!"
1,"Haunting Deer Wheeler's Deer Wan is perhaps the best showcase for his dual talents of writing and playing. The melodies are stunning and Wheeler gives his sidemen ample room to stretch. He's assembled a Who's Who from the ECM stable: Richie Beirach, John Abercrombie, Ralph Towner & others. The rich orchestrations support the tunes with perfect touches throughout.The soloing on 3/4 in the Afternoon by Wheeler is itself worth the price of the CD. Wheeler's heartfelt take on the melody floats above his accompaniment, building a head of emotion as it reaches its final statement.Anything but 'wan!' Six stars!"
1,"Good Product I bought this product earlier this year to replace my old OE foot pedal cover. The product replaced the OE with no problem. it was easy to put on the pedal. I would buy again , if needed."
1,'The Greatcoat' is the finest short story ever written I have read 3 translations of this story and I like them all for different reasons. The story is very readable and has interesting interpretations on several levels. All the friends I recommended the story to loved it.
1,Great Book! I really enjoy this book! I love the Japanese art work in it. It's one of my favorite coffee table books.
1,"A pop standard This is another one of those CDs that you pop into the stereo and know within moments that it's one you will be listening to over and over again for a long time. It feels like a staple in my music collection by the second song.The production is high quality. The songs are thoughtful, emotional and well written. The voice matches the songs beautifully with power and feeling.This CD has it all: outstanding vocals, exceptional musicianship, intelligent lyrics and gives the listener an all around wonderful feeling.(read full review at collectedsounds.com)"
1,"Beautiful Movie, Great Deal Price!!! Been looking for this DVD for years! I'm glad I finally found one at an affordable price!! I had read that in the Korean Edition, there was a scene in the movie that was blurred, when Manon is bathing, and wondered how important that would be to the movie, or my response to the story, and IT IS NOT. The scene where Manon is bathing is like 2 seconds, or less! Now, I have seen both versions and let me tell you that in the unedited version (US Edition) you still dont see much more so why pay 70 dollars for something that is not crucial and you can barely see when you can own the Korean version DVD for half the price?...So my advise is get the Korean DVD, save your money and get yourself another movie instead! Enjoy."
1,"Please re-release the DVD already! Needless to say, I love this movie (and Jean de Florette.) I would just like to say that if anyone has bought the rights to it (Criterion?), kindly release it already, since these movies have been out of print for years now. Available used from $90. Get outta here."
1,Great for the price. I'm real pleased with the results of digital images shot using the SimpleTech 256MB compactflash as storage. It's speed seems to be on a par with my Microdrives or perhaps a slight bit faster.I think it's great for the price.
1,"Fast, high performance cf card. Got it in a well packaged unit, took it out, put it in my canon s110 and start taking shots. The pictures takes 1 or 2 seconds less than my other cards(Sandisk and PNY) to write. Able to take about 250 shots in HQ mode at max resolution. Download from a card reader is also super fast. Did not do any specific test but it is at least 20 or 30 seconds faster than the other cards I have when downloading 240MB of jpegs to my PC. Again, amazon is prompt with the service and I am a happy camper. Thanks again amazon for giving us outstanding service and products."
1,"You can't beat the bang for your buck 256 MB of storage. That's like 5 million photos or something. (I haven't had the chance nor the reason to fill it up yet...) Huge storage space for a really reasonable price. You really won't need another Flash Card once you've got this one. I've had no problems at all with this. Make sure to get a good Flash Card Reader too, so you can easily transfer your photos from the Card to your hard drive."
1,Well researched and informative I found this book to be an easy read. It sufficiently covered the topics indicated with what appears to be a very objective point of view.I think that this book should be a must-read for anyone on either side of the ongoing debate.
1,"I keep returning to re-read this book This is the most LUSH book I have ever read. The content is heady like the humid air of the rainforest. It is dense with wise, human understanding, the style straddling poetry and prose. I'll often re-read a paragraph in breathless amazement of what I've just read. I must take it in small bites - as if it's simply too rich, like a steak with bernaise sauce. But each re-reading brings joy."
1,"A linguistic masterpiece Marquez has such an eloquent way with words. He canalso spin an excellent tale as evidenced by this book.But, what I enjoyed most about the book was the strengthand depth of emotion which he was able to convey throughthe written word. This book pulls you into a magical andmorbid world and holds you hostage until the ending. It isan immense book, but well worth the committment. I wouldespecially recommend it to young developing writers. Thisbook will definitely increase your artistic perspectives."
1,"A mirage of life One Hunderd Years of Solitude left me disturbed.From the happy tale of two young lovers, who carveout a new village for themselves, to the incestousaccount of the last descendants of the family,the book has the power to unnerve the reader. Thestory rambles, so that you feel that time issuspended in Mocando. And yet as charactersgrow older, you notice that time is in fact movingin a circle. The same members of the family are reborn in theArcadia family, reincarnated as the 100 years passby. The forces compelling them to act as theydo, attract and repel you at the same time. Youtry and understand the events and thecharacters, but sheer incredulity and awe asthe story unfolds, leaves you stupefied. I amnot sure I love the book like I do ""Jane Eyre""or admire it like I do ""War and Peace"".But I am powerfully attracted by it, and I'd like toread it again - if only to marvel at a magicalfamily, banished to one hunderd years of solitude.<BR"
1,"Deeply moving and extremely interesting Recently in my college English class we were discussing books that we read in high school. My professor asked us to list the ones that we hated on the board and someone listed ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"". Many people agreed with her, but I must say I do not. I absolutely loved this book! I actually was not required to read it in high school, I was learning Spanish at the time and was looking for a book with elements of Spanish culture. It is long, and drawn out, and confusing and that is what makes it amazing. After finishing it I felt like I had lived it instead of reading it. I highly recommend it. If you are required to read this book in school give it a chance before you toss it aside because it is long, or it looks boring. It takes some time in the beginning to get into it but once you do, if you go into it with an open mind, you will not regret it."
1,"A Victory of Literature A professor suggested Marquez's novel to me a few weeks ago. He has a doctorate in English (creative writing is his specialty) and suggested the novel to a graduating Master's student that felt undereducated. I found the work to be profound, enjoyable, and magical. Marquez is unparalleled in his art. Reviewing some of the previous comments, I am saddened by some of the negative comments. I encourage anyone to read the novel and to allow themselves to be pulled into Marquez's Macondo, from which you may gain new perspectives on time, age, personality, knowledge, details, worth, courage, fear, history, beauty, perception, magic, life, and love. I hope you will enjoy this novel as much as I did and praise it as long as the stars shall shine. This work is a victory of literature.-Foolish Buddha"
1,"A Sea of Latino Enchantment I have read this extraordinary book in Rabassa's excellent translation...and now wil read it in Spanish to compare....like many others, the book took several attempts on my part to make it through...but once I did, I was drawn into a world that seemed to breathe outside of town and yet not so far from our reality...here the world is seen with eyes outside of linear time. beholding things such as ice for the first time.. you will find even eferences to the Ascension with Remedios the Beauty rising upward lost beyond the reaches of the birds of memory...or the plague of insomnia, with forgetfulness and reality slipping away with the meaning of words...here you will find passions celebrated among butterflies and scorpions...it is epic, full of revolutions, passions, discoveries, magic, all flowing from the banana town whose solitude was to be wiped by the winds...."
1,"Perfection This is by far, the best novel i have ever read in my whole 29 years . . . I was dreaming through the pages of this epic story of 7 generations , , wonderful by all means."
1,"Boys with the tails of pigs This book frustrates me, but in a good way. Reading it, get this feeling of how difficult life is to understand. It's just such a great book-- it makes you laugh, it depresses you, it makes you think and it just leaves mesmerized. Go ahead and buy this book, read it, and you won't be left feeling disappointed."
1,"One of the greatest I have ever read This book makes me want to learn Spanish so I can read it in Marquez's original language.This story is an epic of a kind you've never read. No heroes, no great voyage - just a family and their town. It's a kind of Book of Genesis for the Buendia family, a family that you will know intimately by the end of the novel as if it's your own.Marquez skillfully blends the tangible realities of hard life with supernatural interludes that help make this book one of the most beautifully poetic that I've ever read. It's the kind of book that when you finish - incidentally having one of the most perfect endings put to paper - you will sit back and think about it for a while. You will walk the hallways of the Buendia house long after you finish this book and swear that you've known the many people that lived and died there. And you will miss them.This book is a masterpiece. Put this first on your list."
1,"Masterpiece This is my favorite novel by some distance. The novel is simultaneously the story of several generations of an extended family and the story of the entire human race from the beginning of history. It is full of magic not only in the sense that magical things happen, but also in its glowing prose and deeply sympathetic portrayals of its characters. The repetition and near-repetitions of names over the generations invite the reader to conflate information about different characters, demonstrating the interconnectedness of the family members. Maybe it doesn't matter if we keep their identities straight, and maybe we're not even supposed to. Let the plot swirl and let Marquez work his magic. Then step outside and notice how the world shimmers and glows."
1,"Beautiful and stunning fiction This is the best book I've read since The Triumph and the Glory. The quality of the writing is just superb. The characters so unrelentingly vivid they become as familiar as family. A very good book, I highly recommend it and cam just about guarantee that you will like it. Five stars."
1,"You will be amazed This is one of those books that you will make all of your friends read once you have experienced its magic. It will take your through a hundred years of deaths, births, tragedies, and joys of a cursed family. And the best part is the ending - a conclusion that will leave you breathless!"
1,"Not easy to read, but worth it It's a sophisticated read with MANY subplots (most of which include characters with the same name). It can be confusing at times, but it's a good book once you learn each character. I read this book 5 times since 2008 and each time I read it, I discover something new. Don't expect a book you can just read once and move on with your life. It's not that simple."
1,"Monumental, Mesmerizing! Most likely the greatest epic I have ever read. The story grips you, pulls you in, and commands 100% of your concentration. Marquez deserves two Nobel Prizes for this tale."
1,Could be the best Novel ever written This book blew my mind. I can be a bit slow and confusing (there are many characters with the same of very similar names) but the writing is of a caliber seldom seen. The story is intense and the people stick with you for years!
1,"A Very Important Novel One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read ( and I have read thousands).Marquez is a giant. His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece."
1,great book This book captivates you from beginning to end. I fell in love with the characters and enjoyed the colorful lives of each one. The symbolism and translation make this book one of a kind.
1,"MUST READ! This is a book that comes but once in a lifetime. Everyone should read it. It is an interesting journey that will allow your mind and senses to places they've never been before. Don't be scared by its number of pages, it is an adventure one should undergo at least once."
1,"One of the best novels of the past 100 years Marquez creates a unique fictional world, a town called Macondo in the middle of the South American jungle.The language is lush, the characters unique. Marquez finally trusts the reader to accept fantasy and reality as equal partners in an ongoing unfolding of life.This is the only novel I've read four times. It works like magic, like great wine, like a wonderful piece of music."
1,"The First Hundred Pages of ""Solitude."" I have ony read the first 100 pages of this book and the adjective ""engrossing"" is but an understatement. From the moment the family patriarch becomes obsessed with the magnets and alchemy equipment of the gypsies to the marriage of Rebeca, this literary trip has so far been an odysseey which leaves most everybody's family trees for wanting.Aside from the title theme of desolation is the less obvious but equally salient theme of discovery and its relationship to the science/magic dichotomy (I guess that this is the essence of this so-called ""magical realism"" phenomenon). Rarely has this subject matter been tackled with such perceptiveness and aesthetic. Though I have only read the beginning, I find myself wishing that the book were even longer than it already is.Thank you, Gabriel Garcia Marquez!"
1,"Magical Realism at its best I guess that is where this book is usually categorized in. Apparently, Gabriel Garcia Marquez popularized the genre. I loved the book and would put it in the top five of my list. There are people who I've talked to that thinks it was confusing or complicated. That was not the case for me. It's true that there were many characters (and it does not help that a lot of them are named similarly). But, I think each of them is distinct and was developed very well. The book is not about the town of Macondo...it's about the people who lived there. And, you will be able to relate to the book because of its very human characters set in an environment that is often very real but occasionally eerily surreal. That's magical realism for you."
1,"The best book ever One Hundred .... was the first book by GarcÃ­a Marquez I read, since then I have read all his work, but I will never be so impressed by a book as I was with this one, the moment I finished it, I began again. The last pages got me so much that I kept doing as Aureliano was doing at the moment, trying to skip some bits to reach the end and find out what was the mistery of the book. Is a masterpice that everyone should read at least three times. It might not be the most beautiful one I've ever read, that is for sure ' Love in the times of cholera', but it is, for sure, the most powerfull."
1,"Use of language I was surprised at how little was lost in the translation of this book. Garcia writes this novel as if it were poetry, he has a wonderful use of language that seems to braid mystical as well as humurous aspects into his writing. This is a novel that I won't forget and recommend readily."
1,"Beyond most.... This book seems to move beyond so many other books not only in its message, but also in the beauty of description. The intricacy and almost surrealism of the plot draws the reader in so intently its exhilarating. Also, the tone is calming as you learn of the Buendia family and their history. You will come away from this book with a sharper eye for the magical aspects of everyday life, as well as a few hours of absolute escape and bliss. Read it. You're not likely to regret it!"
1,"An exprience that lives with you for the rest of your life I read this book many many years ago when I was 14. I did not read it in English or Spanish. At the time I didn't know either one. I read it in Persian, but that did not diminish the effect it had on me at all. I guess the translation must have been good. I must have read the book some 12 times over the period of that year. And still, every once in while as I am driving my car, a passage from the book comes to my mind and takes me back to the magic that it was. I do not want to read this book again. I don't think that after getting accustomed to the reality of life around me my heart can handle such surge of emotions as it did then. If you haven't read it though, and you are able to pull yourself back to reality after finishing the book, I strongly recommend it."
1,"Wow Magic realism plus rich, beautiful latin culture combines to make a beautiful novel of a town's history. So many wonderfully impossible things happen that this was just a treat to read, even during the heart wrenching moments. I think it's one of the riskier books for Oprah's club, but I can't wait to see what people say. Splendid!"
1,"Keep trying to read this if at first you put it down My first couple of tries at reading this book didn't go very far. I never made it beyond the first chapter. Then on a visit to Colombia I was determined to read this book. I kept at it. Before long I was totally absorbed into the story, which is truly fascinating and amazing. Now I don't know why I could not get into it on my earlier attempts. I'm so glad that I persisted. So, the book that I originally couldn't get into, finally became one of my favorite novels."
1,"Stunning literary masterpeice This is a stunning literary masterpiece. It takes some patience to get into but once you are involved in the story, it is difficult to put down. God, after I finished reading the book it felt like I went into shock. The prose is gorgeous but it is the larger story, stories within stories, and metaphors that are so striking. Will stay with me for the rest of my life."
1,"Magical and All Encompassing A few writers in each generation are gifted with such writing talent that they create books that make you catch your breath. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of those writers. His gift with prose, the way he uses language, his storytelling ability is staggering. This is an engrossing read from the very first sentence. You will be captivated by the magical world that has been created and the all too human characters that populate the story.For reading pleasure, I would recommend the Harper Perennial Modern Classics edition of this book, which has those very convenient flaps on the front and back covers that make perfect bookmarks to save your page when you do manage to put the book down!"
1,"U will never read anything like it I read One Hudred Years of SOlitude like 6 times over the years, and it still holds its magic and atmosphyre. Just an unbelievable classic. It feels weary and long at moments, also distracting at moments but its originality and magical ventures arise and fill the soul. Must have."
1,"Amazing! This is absolutely the most wonderful book I've ever read. I read more than one book every week, so what can I say!! A must read, which you will not want to put down. There's so much to this than just the story.. Beautifully written and wonderously haphazard presentation!"
1,"Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez greatest novel This is the novel that made the author succeed and it's obvious why. A story which seems it's never going to finish, has an incredible ending (I read the last page like a hundred times already). A personal advise would be to get a chart of the family tree, otherwise you may not enjoy it as I have"
1,"Vacation from reality Garcia-Marquez is my favorite autor and ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" is a wonderful book, one that should be read by every intelligent reader. He deftly suspends the laws of reality and takes you to a world that will leave you with the feeling that you have just returned from a rejuvenating vacation. This book is not to be missed. The writing is at once mystical and cathartic, and it will leave you breathless."
1,"Very creative, very imaginative No wonder this book has become an instant classic. It is. This is probably the best translated book that I've ever read. Very confusing, at first, but very imaginative. More of a fantasy than anything else, really. Much better the second time through. I loved the characters and the setting!"
1,"100 Years of Solitude. The standard for South American Lit. 100 Years of Solitude is a must-read for anyone intrested inmagical realism and the beauty of South American literature.It is simply the standard by which all other Latin AmericanNovels will be judged, but putting aside the lofty complimentsfor a moment, 100 Years of Solitude is a necessary journeyfor any reader engaged in the human struggle and the cycle oflife.The novel's lyricism is as simple as a journey down a calm river, yetas complex as the idea of gravity pulling that water down theriver. It is this lyricism that sets Gabriel Garcia Marquezapart from the other story tellers of his time--and a storyteller is exactly what Marquez is, a story teller of grandproportions, that will keep you sitting at the fire with himuntil his epic story is complete."
1,"OmniMount UCL-LP Single Arm Cantilever Mount (fits 32""- 45"" flat panels) I wanted to locate my flat panel in a difficult location. Seeing this item gave me hope that I could finally accomplish this. Although quite expensive, the price seemed reasonable compared to what was available in local stores and their even higher prices.My unit I own a 46"" flat panel, but decided to take a chance that this item would be adequate. Ordered the item and waited with baited breath. Without any inquiry or such, the mount arrived promptly as advertised. Much to my surprise, the company and up sized my order, I can only assume because of availability, to the next size.It was constructed well beyond my expectations and installed easily. The flat panel is in its new location and given me much more flexiblity with the arranging of my living room.By the way, I don't have any doubt that if they had sent exactly the item I'd order that is would have worked out just as well also."
1,"Great! Being very new to the Atlanta area, I needed some help finding my way around and knowing where to shop for what. This book eased my transition, and more than paid for itself."
1,"Easy to understand advice about diabetes Type 2 diabetes is a national epidemic. Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are necessary to prevent complications (heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, blindness) in those with Type 2 diabetes and prevent the disease from occurring in those at high risk. Medical advice regarding diet often leaves patients confused and therefore unable to follow their advice. Kristine Napier defines Type II diabetes and the steps needed to control this disease in a way that is easy to understand. She provides advice and examples to help the reader incorporate her guidelines into their everyday life. Her 28 day guide of menus will help those get started and as always, Kris's recipes are easy to follow and delicious.

1,"More Morpork Night Watch Adventures! I love the Night Watch novels, I am reading the third at the moment, I can't stop! They are funny and surprising and introduce concepts from our world in such a way that parodies and makes a comment on society same time. This book has Leonard of Quirm (Discworld's thinly veiled version of Da Vinci) inventing a dangerous device which is ""running"" loose on the citizens of Ankh Morpork. A mystery for Captain Vimes and the Night Watch - Carrot, Colon, Nobby and the new recruits to solve - romance, intrigue and hilarity abound, I want more! Thank you amazon kindle for letting me download them instantly, this makes me very happy."
1,Max s Keeble s big move I jut enjoy this movie the boy that plays robe the actor is Josh Peck from Drake and Josh show. In my dvd box it had a big picture.
1,Strong Medicine I love this show!! I am VERY DISAPOINTED that the other seasons are not for sale. Shouldnt they be by now? I would buy all of them and be proud to add them to my movie collection.
1,"Just as described The package came and the item was just as described, new in the shrink wrap. Plays perfectly. Two thumbs up!"
1,"Future Sound Of London, The - Accelerator Accelerator. If you don't have this album, you don't know anything about electronic music. It's a classic through-and-through. Although it may sound slightly dated, it still stands head-and-shoulders above most techno albums today. With impressive range, from the moody ""While Others Cry"" and the trance-forerunner ""Calcium"" to the nu-industrial of ""Central Industrial"" and the storming ""Moscow,"" Accelerator still is a great listen. This re-release also includes 10 mixes of ""Papua New Guinea,"" a title that should inspire devotion among all fans of electronic music. Blue States does its usual downtempo magic on the track, while Simian makes it sound like the carnival from hell. Hybrid (of course) adds some hard breaks, while Satoshi Tomiie makes some dark house. Some good mixes, but do they hold up to the original? What do you think the answer is?"
1,"The Canterbury Tales, Reviewed by Philip Moore Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's ""Canterbury Tales"", a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are ""The Knight's Tale"", ""The Wife of Bath's Tale"", ""The Miller's Tale"", ""The Reeve's Tale"", and ""The Parson's Tale"". Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor. The latter due impart to the corruption within the clergy and the condition of the people from their suffering of drought, famine, and disease. Chaucer's work brought to light a new age of literature full of wit, comedy, and daily life."
1,"A wondeful set of tales which define an era Clearly, during Chaucer's time, the english language was looked down on as inderior by the other languages of Europe. The Canterbury tales were important because of the use of the venacular language of england. It represents our first look into our language."
1,"The Hobo Philosopher I suppose that any freshman college student has read some of these Tales. I had a professor who read a few of them to us in the Olde English. It was really fun and you really got a grasp of where the English language was coming from - and poetry.I went on from my English class and read the whole works. They are good, classic short stories. You are really going back to the basics here. The stories are all easy to read and are about the everyday type people and their everyday lives. You get classic English literature, history, short story writing techniques, and the roots of the English language all in one medium sized book. Can't beat it. It's a bargain.Richard EdwardNoble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:""A Summer with Charlie"""
1,"Excellent The first story ""The Knight's Tale"" is on par with ""Aucassin and Nicolette"" (Andrew Lang), and The Friendship of ""Amis and Amile"" (Old French Romances, William Morris, which can usually be bought through Alibris as a used book put out by (...)) In my own opinion ""The Knight's Tale"" is the only reason to purchase or read The Canterbury Tales. It is unmatched if heard on audio book,Blackstone Audiobook, unabridged, read by Fred Williams, ISBN: 0-7861-2239-0.(I purchased mine at audio books on cassette.)"
1,great book Well written and beautifully illustrated. A good introduction to Chaucer for young and old. A very good winter read indeed..
1,"A Fine Edition of A Brilliant Play *****Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"" are timeless. The tales (mostly in verse, although some are in prose) are told as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from Southwark to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. These stories paint pictures of medieval life, theology, and culture.And this edition is most preferable to me. I highly recommend it!*****"
1,"Magnificent This movie is excellent on its own, but absolutely extraordinary when paired with its sequel, Manon of the Spring. I highly reccomend the two as a pair to anyone considering either."
1,"EXCELLENT FILM/A MUST SEE IN ANSWER TO THE FIRST REVIEW ABOUT THIS MOVIE, MOST PEOPLE (IN THE UNITED STATES) ARE REALLY IGNORANT OF WHAT GOOD FILMS ARE ALL ABOUT. THEY ARE BLINDED BY TODAY'S ""HOLLYWOOD"" INDUSTRY WHICH IS LESS THAN PERFECT, TO SAY THE LEAST...EVERYONE...: DO YOURSELFS A FAVOR: START WATCHING MORE FOREIGN FILMS..., MOST OF THEM ARE NOT PRETENTIOUS, NOT SHALLOW, NOT HOLLYWOOD..., EVERYONE MIGHT LEARN A THING OR TWO.GREAT FILM, FULL OF GOOD CONTENT AND MEANING!!!"
1,"A must-see movie Truly, this is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is a realistic story that has made it possible for me to see how one thinks and how one acts in life, and how everything has its reason in the end. Highly recommended movie, Cheers, Branko Miros"
1,"Tears for the Masses This book made me cry for alot of reasons. But mostly for the humanity. It the dozens of books that I have read on Titanic, none compares to this one. I liked the author to know that I hate him for it and love him for it just the same. He ruined my day with the harsh reality and changed my life with it's inspiration. Thomas Andrews would be amazed. Oh yes, he would be utterly amazed. -Jaime N. Rinne/Titanic Historian"
1,"Enlightening and spell binding I read Titanic in the early part of 1997. I found the book fascinating, especially to one who knew very little of the disaster and the uncovering of the broken ship. I have recommended the book as a must read to many of my friends. Skip the movie and read the book!"
1,"a pleasant reminder of the British Invasion Listeners of this cd will be reminded that, in the era of just three guitars and a drummer, the British Invasion provided a pleasant change from American sounds in the early 1960s. The sound quality of this cd is remarkable. On ""Don't Throw Your Love Away"" you can actually hear someone in the studio rustling some papers at the very start of the song. The opening drum riff on ""Needles and Pins"" will stir the blood of any Mersey listener. This album is nothing but pop....but pure, straight and beautiful pop it is with jingle jangle guitars and high harmonies covering songs that strongly hint of a lost era of innocence. Either you love this stuff ...or you don't!"
1,"Who Said Coyotes Weren't Interesting? Classic genre - underdog trying to make her dreams come true.. A sexy story that surprising ends well..Violet moves to the big city in the hopes of taking her writing career to the next level.. Reality check has her desperate for work in a city where no one ever listens..Coyote Ugly - possibly the sexiest club man has ever seen (a modern day Moulin Rouge) - Enter the young - innocent -inexperienced Violet.. Will she fit into the world of the ""Coyotes""??..Cameo appearence by country singing sensation LeAnn Rimes - Little unknown fact - LeAnn provided all the vocals performances for Violet.. Piper apparently can't sing - but boy can she act!5 Stars.. :D .. An Excellent Sexy movie.. :D"
1,"Coyote Ugly ROCKS!!!! I thought that Coyote Ugly was an awesome movie. Piper Perabo has great talent and should be given or sought out for more roles. This movie is a definite must see, as well as, a must have. The music for the movie was right on, although I would have loved to hear Piper's voice on more of the songs. She is definite STAR material... :-)"
1,"Love it I love this movie, we had it on VHS and then our VHS player died so had to replace it with this. Works great."
1,"gift for husband my husband loves this movie, so I bought it for him as a christmas present to add to his dvd collection"
1,"CoYoTe UgLy MoViE rEviEw this is definitely more of a chick flick than a guy movie! in all honesty though, its a GREAT movie. although geared more towards younger girls, i'm sure anyone could enjoy this movie! its just an all out great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone!"
1,Great Movie Coyote Ugly may not be the ideal family movie but it is excellent. it tells the story of young female musician whose only dream is to have someone like Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey sing her songs. After moving to New York on her own she is forced to find work in order to remain living in her apartment. She meets up with the Coyotes and finally finds her dreams through them. Excellent movie with a great cast.
1,"Nice show (Recommended) The strengths of this DVD are : 1) A nice storyline which shows how a country girl tries to survive in NY. 2) Nice music eg. Can't fight the moonlight, etc. throughout the show. 3) Girl-Appeal esp. the innocence of Piper Perabo and the sensuality of the coyotes. 4) Romance with a nice ending :) 5) various commentaries on the movie 6) music video of 'can't fight the moonlight'"
1,"GREAT! I thought that this was going to be a really stupid movie of only bar dancing scenes, but I was wrong there were bar dancing scenes but they also tried to put a story."
1,Great Movie I thought that this movie was very good and the girls very hotter than John Goodman in the Mojave Desert. Bruckheimer did a great job and the story line is really good
1,"It's Entertainment, Folks I am so tired of reading reviews from people who think every movie should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. This is one of the most entertaining films my wife and I have seen in a long time, and none of the people involved with its production have anything to apologize for. It unquestionably delivers exactly what Bruckheimer, et al intended, and it does not pretend to be anything else. If I wanted something artistic or meaningful, I would have looked for word ""Miramax"" on the outside of the box - a studio that has made many wonderful movies, but not the type of high impact, SIMPLE fun Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have delivered so well. Sometimes, it's just what the doctor ordered.Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, break out the popcorn, have a few drinks, and enjoy..."
1,Great movie to watch I can watch this over and over again. I had to wait for it to come on tv until I finally bought it
1,"I can't get enough of this 'garbage' Another collection of the hypnotic Shirley Manson tunes. This album is equally entrancing and rocking. I didn't think they could top there 1st cd but they clearly are exceptional musicians. If your a Shirley Manson fan (lover), you've got to get Version 2.0. She will take you away....(again)."
1,"Sometimes an album just clicks It sounds right, is the best way to say this. Sometimes an album just clicks, tracks in order, everything moving smoothly together. Such is the sound of VERSION 2.0, a big, liquid album with a song for every mood. Here is a group that enjoys playing together -- see them in concert; they have a good time -- and they spend the album playing with us, doing bleak, doing frantic, doing downright catty. Showing off? They have a right to. This is very good stuff."
1,"Excellent, excellent! When I read professional music critics' reviews about Version 2.0, I read these super technical descriptions and criticisms of the album which honestly, is a waste of time. Why don't they say the truth without further hassle? This album is excellent from the first track to the last. For even those who aren't familiar with Garbage or their first album but just want to rock, this is a great choice. It's excellent--EXCELLENT!"
1,Can't get better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Push It- makes the listener wonder what the heck she's talking about.Special-Interesting song about liking but now hating.Hammering in my Head-A fast techno song.There's not one bad song on this album and I would tell about other songs but... Anyways you cant go wrong!
1,"One of the best albums of 1998 Garbage returned in '98 with their excellent sophmore album. VERSION 2.0 is so slick, you'll slip on it. Shirley Manson [lead vocals and songwriter] vamps every song for all it's worth. She's slick, sly, and clever in every delivery. VERSION 2.0 is groove heavy with more electroica than their debut back in '95. Garbage became more of a pop band with this album. The hooks and melodies are awesome. Each track is seemless, timeless, pop mixed with rock and electronic influences. VERSION 2.0 is an improvement from their debut. Shirley's voicals are exellent. It's sexy and it goes very well with this awesome album."
1,"version 2.0-newer, faster, better after the fanstatic acclaimed debut album, garbage had a rough second album to make.well, version 2.0 is the perfect second album. More pop-electronic and yet with the same dark obscure feeling the first album had.shirley's voice is more adaptaded to the songs and they seem to be more a band than they used to. one of garbage's best caracteristics is that all musics are very good. here you can't say that one or two songs are below the average, because they're all excellent. please listen to this album, that confirms that garbage are one of the best (or why not, the best!) band around!"
1,garbage ROCK! This is my first garbage CD and I really enjoy it. The words are very powerfull and Shirley Manson's voice is amazing! I highly recommend this CD.
1,"Perfect! Well written! I saw Garbage in concert at The Night 89x Stole X-Mas in Detroit, and they were by far the best group there. This album is excellent. A definate buy!"
1,"warning: this CD is extremely addictive All I had ever heard of Garbage were a couple of their music videos until my friends persuaded me to buy this CD. Now I listen to it at least twice a week. I usually go for music with lighter lyrics, but I've fallen head-over-heels in love with all these songs, even ""Medication"". As much as I love the whole CD, I do have favorites: I listen to ""When I Grow Up"" and ""Hammering in My Head"" so much I'm bound to wear the CD out!"
1,"Better than words can describe Garbage has no doubt put out a kickass sophomore album!! I'm completely hooked on the song ""You Look So Fine""-it takes me to a different world. Special also is one of the greatest singles out there right now! I got it for Christmas and haven't hardly gotten through a day without listening to it. Once you hear Shirley's voice, there's no turning back, and if you do than there is something wrong with you! I enjoyed this album just as much as their first, but i appreciate this one on a whole different level. There's no trash involved with this garbage. Aside from Pink Floyd, there is no better!!! YOU HAVE GOT TO BUY IT!!!"
1,"One of the few cd's that you can just let play through Garbage has released one of the few cd's that can just play through, with every song having a certain flavor and enjoyability. Songs on this album range from dark and stormy (push it) to fast paced rock (when i grow up) and each has a pleasent variety. The songs lyrics are deep and meaningfull, and are easy to relate to, in my opion, version 2.0 is a groundbreaking and interesting album, that is sure to delight many a wide audiance."
1,"Great CD! I loved the first CD, but was doubtful about the 2cnd, since I'm used to the first CD being the better one. (Alanis Morissette) I got a pleasant surpise, since this one is just as sweet as the first one!!!"
1,"A great album There is no competition...this is my undisputed, absolute favorite CD (since the last release from Garbage). Version 2.0 is addicting, from the lively (and occasionally erratic)techno beats to Shirley Manson's breathy, seductive verbal catharsis (laser recodred for our enjoyment!), it leaves you yearning for more. This CD takes a person on a sort of emotional roller coaster. From ""Temptation Waits"", a celebration of dependance and obsession to ""You look so fine"" a melancholy longing for ""ever after"" (i.e. riding of into sun sets and such...) It's a trip and I fully endorse it (regardless of my insignificance). BUY IT ALREADY!"
1,Love this CD! I have loved Garbage for a long time now... and I have her first two CD's and I am so excited that she's come out with another one. Shirley is AWESOME! I love her voice.. and I don't believe that anyone else has a voice like hers. Garbage ROCKS!!
1,"You gotta love garbage After missing theirr recent Toronto concert at the phoenix (sold out in 20 minutes!), and reading reviews, I had to buy this CD. So I did... I liked the first album but I LOVE version 2.0. Everything from the clever Album title to the amazing mix of wonderful songs made me fall in love with garbage for real!!!If you're at all unsure about garbage, just buy this CD and see what happens.... But don't forget to get your concert tickets as soon as they go on sale!"
1,"Good I had never heard Garbage before I listened to Version 2.0 at a listening kiosk at Tower Records, but I was immediately hooked. It's like a modernized Pretenders on steroids. I'd definitely recommend it. END"
1,"So far, the best cd this year Garbage's higly anticipated second cd three years after their first is a must have for all Garbage fans. It has a faster and more up-beat tempo. Garbage has been nominated 8 times for the video to their great song, ""Push It."" I'm sure that they'll when all 8. I highly recommend this cd."
1,"woo! This album is a classic. I've had this CD for probably over a year now, and I *still* listen to it often.One of the things that makes this album so amazing is that there are no ""duds"". Every track seems to work and fit together. The amount of feeling Shirley Manson throws into the songs is amazing, and the melodies seem to only add on to that.Buy it. This is one of those albums that sucks you in from the first track, and doesn't let go. In fact, when you're finished listening to it, you'll want to play the whole thing over. :)"
1,"Huge Garbage fan anyway... ..but this is my go-to album when I want a perk-me-up and to listen to the best. So many great songs on this one. Love ""When I Grow Up"", ""Push It"", The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"" and ""You Look So Fine"". Music now just doesn't compare. Which is why I'm excited about the whispers of a new album this coming year. Can't wait."
1,"Undoubtedly THE BEST Garbage Album thus far! This is a great album by Garbage! I love the modern and hip beat of ""Special."""
1,"New Type of Funk new and exciting sound, very nifty beat. I really like this one folks, it has a new type of funk that sets it aside from all imatators. If you buy just one cd this year let it be this one, it all starts here."
1,"I have both Garbage CD's, and this is the best one I must admit that i don't care as much for the first Garbage CD as I do Version 2.0. This is by far my favorite CD. I like it so much that I listen to it all the time. I know the whole CD by heart(almost). My favorite songs on this album are Temptation Waits, I Think I'm Paranoid, Push It, and Wicked Ways. It realllllyyyyy RRRRROOOOOOCKSSSSS!!!!!!!"
1,"Amazing CD I had just heard a little bit of the song ""Push It"" and I had to run out and buy the CD, the CD has so much into it that now anything that Garbage has out, I have to find and listen to it. I especially like the song, ""The trick is to keep breathing"" Shirley Manson's voice is amazing, I can't think of any other way to put it. I recomment this CD totally."
1,"Garbage - The world's coolest pop group I just started listening to garbage about a month ago. Their latest album Version 2.0 is fantastic! The guitar work along with Shirley Manson's distinctive style of singing ( evident in Temptation waits , I think I'm paranoid , When I grow up, Push it ,You look so fine) is just too good. They are a class apart from all the stale pop groups around us . Garbage, to me is God!"
1,"great i lvoe garbage, every song on their albums are so good you can just play the whole cd straight. and shirley manson is so hot and butch vig si so cool"
1,"""Version 2.0"" is the greatest! Shirley Manson and Co. has done it again! The techno music combined with the raw but truthful lyrics makes this CD one of the best I've listened to. With the combination of slow and fast, moody and light, Version 2.0 shows Shirley Manson's talent as never seen before. The pulsing music stays in your head for hours and you can totally relate to some of the lyrics. This is without a doubt one of my favorite CD's!"
1,"First One's Better Not taking away from this album which is absolutley awesome but i missed the angry edge to shirley's voice, this album was pop where the first one was rock but still absolutley rocks, shoulda won da grammy"
1,most awesome CD ever recorded!!!! wow my friend got me started on garbage a few months ago and that was the start of another big garbage fan!!!this band kicks arse!!!!!!thank you Annie!!!!
1,"Great Graphics Card! After buying a new Pentium 4 system, I was tight for cash. Luckily enough I managed to come upon the Radeon 7000. It has one of the best image qualities I've seen and its performance isn't too bad either."
1,"A good season I've watched One Tree Hill since the first episode the first season. I have to say that I'm not as passionate about the show as I used to be; the characters Lucas and Peyton left and I thought that would ruin the show. However, that just lead to the show growing and getting to know smaller characters more. Season seven of One Tree Hill is amazing and the actors/actresses are great. It's a good show and the dvd allows for episodes to be watched without commercials. It's also the smallest and most compact dvd case out of all of the seasons (I have all 7). I would recommend this item."
1,"Better than expected When I found out that Lucas and Peyton were off the show, I was very disappointed.I did not think they would be able to coninue the show well without those 2 characters. But, with the new characters, the show is still as amazing as its always been. Very entertaining season, I could not stop watching it!"
1,Very pleased No problems with order! Received item within time frame. Haven't played the DVDs yet but they are new in packaging so any problems with DVD would not be seller fault.
1,"great flag-waving action movie This movie is by far one of my favorites but you can't take it seriously. In the movie, Chuck's protege ""Deke Slater"" nabs the terrorist leader Fidal Rasheed by sky-diving out of a stealth fighter over Afganistan and hang-gliding from southern Afganistan to the Indian Ocean in 5 minutes, where a nuclear submarine comes out of nowhere to rescue him. Chuck Norris seems to have forgotten that Afganistan is a landlocked country! The flag-waving (for both America and the great state of Texas) is hilarious. And Chuck Norris tries to take on a Yoda figure role by teaching Deke about using the ""mind's eye"" to sense his opponents and do things ""never thought humanly possible""."
1,"Don't miss this one! One of the last great films of that remarkable era of film-making--the 1970's--""Julia"" stands the test of time as a testament to heroism in drastic times of collusion much like our own. We know the bad guys but think we are too weak to stop them--to make a difference--but the story of ""Julia"" gives us strength to at least try. I was about to say the films of today do not have this power, but after experiencing the power of some of this year's extraordinary films like ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Syrianna"" I find hope in the modern arena. Keep the faith."
1,"Julia DVD Excellent movie about two female friends chronicled from childhood through adulthood. I highly recommend this film. As for the seller of this DVD, I received this item very quickly and was very pleased with the condition. I would definitely purchase from this Seller again."
1,"One of the BEST films from the 70's I must have seen ""Julia "" over 20 times,and I never get tired of it.Fonda and Redgrave are great,along with Jason Robards.Its amazing this is a true story about a period in Lilian Hellman's life,and what a heroic task she did for her friend,Julia.If you have never seen this movie,please make it a point to, about a time in our history we should never forget."
1,"Julia A wistful, compelling story about the power of female bonds and friendship. Fonda has never been better, Redgrave is luminous as the idealistic Julia, and Jason Robards conveys a worn assuredness as Hellman's husband, writer Dashiell Hammett. Zinnemann's handling of period detail in 1930s New York and Berlin is exquisite, and the film rightfully earned 11 Oscar nominations. A personal favorite."
1,"Wonderful flow What a great video! I just received it and went through the routine. The flow was wonderful. (I am not a surfer, have never surfed, I was just looking for a good video, and everybody recommended this to me.) But maybe now I'll be surfing by summer!"
1,performed as hoped The plug was exactly what I needed.We used it to blow out the line in winterizing our RV.and it worked.
1,Works very well This will keep my pipes from freezing and it isn't very expensive. I plan to use it at home and on vacation property. Buy it. It can be adapted to blow out at hose bib connections too. It will save on repairs.
1,"This is a psychological masterpiece. I am simply shocked that this novel, which is perhaps the best piece of American fiction I have ever read, is out of stock. It draws a far more realistic and detailed portrait of the ""hard boiled detective"" that so many other writers have simply slapped together, then lets us watch, with first fascination, then horror, as he slowly unravels. Even the minor characters are better drawn then they would be in a trilogy all their own, and the entire work shimmers with energy and power. This is a book that demands republishing."
1,"great book, hopefully wont need it I bought this book more for a just in case kind of need. I am not filing bankruptcy but if I ever need to then the book contains all the helpful information that someone would need. It has great examples and definitions."
1,"A crazy adventure Crewel Lye is about the journey of Jordan the Barbarian. Like all Xanth books, this one is comical and full of puns. Since Jordan's talent is full regeneration, it adds an interesting viewpoint through the eyes of a person who doesn't care if he gets killed(he'll just come back). I think that anyone who reads the Xanth series should definitely read this one."
1,Excellent fantsy My first Piers Anthony book. I can hardly wait for each of the Xanth books to appear.Best fantsy writer.
1,An unbiased history One of the best books you will find on the Army Air Force prior to and during World War II. This is one of the few authors that doesn't impose his opinions on the reader. He goes out of his way to give both sides of an issue or a personality. Even such controversial figures as Britain's Bernard Montgomery or our own Douglas MacArthur are treated with an even-handedness that is all too rare. Very entertaining and very informative.
1,"Ok massager I bought this foot massager because I needed a footrest for my ijoy100 massage chair. I used it couple times after a long walk in the mall,and it soothed my aching legs. My sister bought it two years ago, and she said it improved the circulation on her legs."
1,"IT ""s GREAT ( realy) hey i love it but im an old horror movie fan , if you lov the clissic horrors you'll lov this , it realy is great , i love it ,"
1,"Highly recommend :) I love this book because it allowed me to see just how much I have been limiting myself. I enjoyed learning the techniques to achieving your visualizations. The author makes valid points and talked about many specific subjects that I have been questioning recently and even experiencing, so that has helped me directly address the issues. Overall, I'd hiiighly recommend"
1,"Thank you for this book Just received this book today 11/23/11, will get to reading it over the holiday, since school is closed and I need something interesting to read. The notes in the book will help me to decide on new ideas for the coming year. Thanks."
1,Secrets of Native American herbal Remedies A very good comprhreshive book. It has a lot of common problems that you may come across with. A very good reference.
1,"Set me free! This will with no noubt be one of the classics. It's just perfect. The baseline is an sultry invitation to dance. Kylies gentle vocals do right to those innovative lyrics. ""There's a dark secret in me don't keep locked in your heart. Set me free!"" What can one do but dance to trance as long as this song stays on. The original verison needs nothing more. It's only just so short. And that la-la-la will go on forever!More eighties retro this one. The follow up ""In your eyes"" has more true disco flair."
1,"Kylie returns Years after her hit in the US (and with a steadily growing career in Europe and else where in the world) Kylie Minogue returns to the airwaves with a dance hit that is catchy and hypnotic. At first I was only slightly interested in this tune but the more I heard it, the more I like it. I'm looking foward to the entire cd and I hope it is filled with great dance songs like this one."
1,"It's Never Too Late to Review This Single. As someone who's been following Kylie since her late 1980s, Stock Aitken Waterman years, I was one happy camper when I learned that ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" blasted into the US Top Ten. After a disastrous cover of ""The Locomotion,"" Kylie quickly disappeared from the American spotlight while she attained superstardom in the UK. Over the years, she tried to win American audiences back, but with no such luck. Then, years later, came this single, a hypnotic slice of disco minimalism with its undeniable ""la la la"" hook. Having topped the charts in the UK and in a few other countries, it was poised for similar success stateside. After a long absence, we Americans should be so lucky that we have Kylie back ruling the charts again. ""I Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" is one of the best and most memorable singles of this, or any other, year."
1,"Oh...Oh....OH!!!!! Oh!!!! YEAH!! Kylie you did it again!!!!!!!!! Kylie Minogue is so freakin' HOT that everytime i see her i wanna get naked and ""Can't get you out of my head"" is so darn sexy.It's got a pulsating strutting groove that gets your blood boiling and makes you wanna get on the dance floor and do your thang.,This is primo pop dressed up in a super dance groove and it will get any party cookin guaranteed.Personally i recommend getting the entire ""Fever"" album which will have you on the floor panting for air from all of it's wet and juicy musical savage foreplay.OUCH!Tell Kylie you want the fever and prepare yourself to be cooked to a crisp with Kylie's hot sexy grooves."
1,"One of a Kind I had to read a book for a book report due in a week. I was beginning to feel hopeless before I stumbled onto this in the library. Langston Hughes is an amazing Writer and poet. This was the first of his novels that I have read and I think it couldn't have been more perfect. This book is so rich in its characters and Hughes shows no mercy in telling of the bittersweet culture that engulfs the world of Sandy and his family. After reading this book, the beauty of this people was more evident than ever before. With words that are lovely and flowing and thoughts that are deep and abundant, Hughes is a person whom I wish was still with us."
1,"Putting in transforming action The book is an inspiring, practical Biblically-based manual for moving fromcharity to transformation of community. It is enriched by practical examplesfrom real life experiences in low income communities and working with people with soundtheological underpinnings. It is inspiring;one feels hopeful and notdependent on experts, but that transformation, step by step, can happenwith committed people inspired by hope and small first successes. A mustbook for people working in low income communities, especially with faithconnections."
1,"Great for young kids I love this game! I bought one 15 or so years ago when my son was young, good first game as it helps teach turn taking. Little kids love it when the crocodile ""bites"" you! Even timid kids get into the game after an adult gets bitten a few times. Bonus that it's portable, no loose pieces, I purchased this one for my niece's three sons (under the age of 5) and have given it as a gift over and over, really fun game."
1,"Children Love Crocodile Dentist ! I bought this for my three children and they all loved it, it was well used for years. It was still in good shape after years of use so I put it in storage. I came across it, and I thought the students I teach might like it. I teach middle school. I put this on my desk and the students race to be the first in the class to play. They loved it so much, I went on Amazon and bought more! I have 5 on my desk, they are used daily by 100's of students, they are dropped almost daily. Students are not late to class. Students do not get tired of this quick fun and durable game. You should purchase this, it is perfect for on top of a desk, kids of every age love it!"
1,"Perfect Gift... this was a gift for a 4 year old - she loves it, and the best part is that she can play it solo as well!! Not the most edicational toy, but a great game to keep the kids busy."
1,"so far sounds great I actually ended up buying these to update two old cabinets i had come across. Thought they only needed speakers, turned out there was no crossover that was why the speakers were shot in the first place. Then a friend gave me a JBL set (bass mids and highs) from an old big screen tv for free so keeping the project as low cost as possible i baught these. They have nice sound for the price did't expect the results i got out of these, and i am picky about sound and i'm very satisfied. Plus they were easy to figure out how to hook up, all the terminals are marked."
1,"Awesome! I absoultely LOVE Mero! I just wish that they had more than one single out, because I can't get enough of them! I listen to this single over and over again without getting tired of it. It's a group of two guys, but it's not entirely pop sounding. It's just fun loving music to relax and enjoy."
1,"''and by will, I mean won't!'' This series is SO hilarious. I was so upset when I found out that they cancelled it.If you watched it religiously like I did when it was airing on MTV, (2004, I believe?) then you won't de dissapointed. In it's short 13 episode run, it had plenty of laughs. You should get this. Hands down. You'll have plenty of quotes that you can share with your friends for weeks to come."
1,Great show If you know this show that is probably why you are here and don't need me to tell you how good it is. If you are new then buy it! It is fun and never slows down. Unfortunately there is only one season.
1,Absolutely adorable! This horseshoe cat is aweomse! I would like to buy more for my Christmas presents. Very well made and good value.
1,"What a Gift This Book Is This amazing book begins with the author exploring with seven women and one man what the feminine consciousness is, why it's coming in now, what its role is and how it will help reshape our world. I can't tell if all eight of these people have reached enlightenment, but if not, they are well on their path, with each having their own spiritual journey and discipline. The book ends with those interviwed saying such similar things, concentrating on four areas: exploring the feminine consciousness, what's important about spiritual practices, the need to go beyond transcendence to transformation in everyday life (and in a balanced way), and finally where we're headed because of our bringing in the feminine consciousness and transformation. It is with heart-felt gratitude to the author for writing this book."
1,"Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band Gorilla Album Review (I couldn't think of a better title! :( This is probably my dad's and my favorite album that we own simply for it's ridiculusness. Some background:The Bonzos were the ""house band"" for Monty Python's predicessor, a silly British tv show called ""Do Not Adjust Your Set."" Since they were that house band, you can't expect their music to be all that serious. If you listen closely to the lyrics, the songs are downright hilarious. I do not reccomend listening to this while doing homework, though. I just finished an essay that would've nomally taken me about one hour to write, revise, and edit, but instead it took me about 1.5 hours because I was listening to Gorilla. It's good for leisure time, but not for homework. In short, I love the Gorilla album."
1,"AN ABSOLUTE 'MUST HAVE' FOR EVERYONE!!!! If you listen to this CD and you don't laugh out loud, Then JACK, YOU ARE DEAD!!! Better yet, just buy the entire collection on the 3 CD set called 'CORNOLOGY'."
1,Love it! I recently ordered the Chamae Rose 2oz bottle and receivd it promptly.Item as described and I will absolutely purchase again!
1,"Touching and Sincere Although I had some reservations about the movie, due to the whole Homosexual theme, I soon put aside all differences, and truly enjoyed the movie. It was extremily touching, and the ending was sad but sweet. I liked how Clay was able to put aside his somewhat unenjoyable relationship with James Whale, and remember him fondly for many years afterward.The issue that the movie deals with, has been something of a controversal subject for many years, and I enjoyed how Bill Condon was able to portray this problem senstively and emotionally. A terrific drama for not only Brendan Fraser fans, but also for those that only ever wanted to find love and acceptence."
1,"An intense and powerful Drama! I purchased this movie because I am a huge Brendan Fraser fan, but the movie is so moving that I somewhat forgot that Brendan was in it and became so captivated in the story, that I ended up watching it again a second time. It is wonderfully acted! I think it's Brendan's best work ever and Ian Mckellen is outstanding in this movie. For anyone looking for a movie that will move you and having you wanting friends and family to see it, this one will. It's such a powerful drama. One that I will watch over and over. I'm glad to have it in my Collection."
1,"a poignant story about loneliness and friendship Every now and then comes a movie that reminds you that entertainment can also be an intelligent emotional experience. This poignant story of loneliness and friendship has everything to go for it. Ian Mckellen's performance is once again memorable and Brendon Fraser is at his best. Script, direction and dialogues are brilliantly handled by newcomer director Bill Condon. It should appeal to everyone because it is a movie about life and death, loneliness and friendship. The widescreen edition is remarkable."
1,"""Gods and Monsters,"" indeed! What a surprising movie! First, you have one of the screen's great performances by Ian McKellen, and then there's the stunning revelation that Brendan Fraser has great depth and power as an actor and has been pretty much wasted in films up until now (except that he is terrific at comedy). This film on DVD is a marvel. The images are crisp and clean, the sound is clear and distinct, and the music score by Carter Burwell is one of the finest of recent years, subtly entwining itself into the psychological makeup of the characters and storyline. ""Gods and Monsters"" is a movie of rare depth and directorial eloquence. I cannot recommend it highly enough for thinking moviegoers."
1,"best screenplays have more stability One of the few recent films that I anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectations.Sir Ian McKellen once again performs well. The real surprise here is Brendan Fraser. Thanks to Bill Condon's amazing screenplay, Fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to McKellen's anguished and self-defeated character. Make a point to get this one. Best screenplays consist of strong dialogue, pacing, and narrative. The Oscars are usually accurrate about that."
1,Gods and Monsters I thought I had already reviewed this product. I love this movieI hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
1,"Fantastic Underrated film There is so much to love about this film it's hard to know where to begin. Ian MacKellan is brilliant as the director James Whale; Brandon Fraser is perfect as his ""monster"", and Lynn Redgrave is wonderful as his long-suffering maid Hanna. The three are the perfect ensemble and compliment each other perfectly.There are so many layers and dimensions to the story. Each time I watch it, I discover more to love about it. I heartily recommend this movie although not everyone will understand the deeper meaning. And it's definitely not for those who are homophobic, but those with an open mind will love it."
1,"Its a very gratifying film it befriends the audience at once This film is very sweet in sense that we get to know what Karchy goes through when he realizes America isnt necessary a place you can get away with telling lies when he meets his idol Billy Magic.Personally I would recommend this movie because it has great performances from Brad Renfro,Kevin Bacon and Calista Flockhart."
1,Excellent Reference Library Text for a PLS This book is simply excellent. It covers surveying subjects thoroughly and with great technical depth. It taught me to calculate state plane coordinate conversions by hand so that I understand what happens in a computer.This is the type of text that will elevate the PLS profession.
1,"excellent readable fun Martin Deporres Kennedy has a fine gift for storytelling. He pulls you into the story. I read this through in one sitting. The story is a vehicle for introducing theological ideas, often through debates between characters. These debates are very realistic, and may reflect actual arguments that the author haard or participated in. I would strongly recommend this for students. It would be a wonderful thing for Catholic high school religion teachers to assign their class."
1,"The Sultan of Swat This is a complete and thorough examination of the life and playing career of a baseball icon. The author has done a commendable job of separating the facts from the fanciful fictions that have grown up surrounding George Herman Ruth. While his home run record has been surpassed, I still think one can argue that Ruth was the greatest baseball player when one considers that in addition to his hitting abilities Ruth was an outstanding pitcher. He was shifted to the outfield when his managers determined that he could be of greater value as an everyday player rather than pitching every third or fourth day."
1,"This film is only for laser printers For those considering this overhead transperency film, only order it for use with laser printers or laser copy machines. It is not intended for inkjets and needs the laser fuser to ""burn in"" the image. It works great with the correct printer/copy machine."
1,This will make your install a breeze. . . My car is a 1994 Honda Civic EX. Save yourself a headache and get this if you have to replace your stereo. Plug and play.
1,"What a gorgeous watch!!! (for $65) I have been looking for a new dress watch for a month. (I am kind of a fussy person). I saw this watch and read the reviews . It made me considered about buying it. I decided to buy this one. I've got it today. I thought of two words on my mind. (everytime when I bought stuff online) ""Satisfied"" or ""Disappointed"". After I opened the package. I smiled all day long.Nice watch!!! Good price.!A few things want to mention you all, The watch is a little bit smaller than I expected (But it's not a promblem because my wrist it's so small(6"").it fits me perfectly)Don't be panic about the watch doesn't work at the first time. You have to let it charges for a while.(Good function,though! you don't need to worry about changing baterries)I love the lobster claw-clasp because I can adjust it myself. (I always got a problem about paying extra for adjusting the band)Well..I'd recommend this watch to anybody. Buy for yourself or as a gift. You will be happy anyway.Love it!!"
1,"great price, perfect product I have a tendency to burn out watch batteries, so this watch is perfect for me. No more replacing batteries every 3 to 6 months. Plus as a woman with a larger wrist I have a terrible time finding a feminine looking watch that fits me. This one I have plenty of room and it looks great."
1,"5 to the 10th Power In Stars They should really raise the star point system here, because anything by Mosby is worth the buy. I have the Mosby's Medical Dictionary for Nursing and Allied Health Professionals, and when I saw this book in the store, I was trying to figure out the difference, because of the color. This one offers just as many details as my previous book. This is important, because it is an easy read, and it is necessary for each household to have, for children to study off of, to the housewife that just wants to be informed. Mosby has been following me through nursing school, and anything they sell as a study aide will have a place in my home."
1,"A hidden diamond It is interesting listening to this album. Even though many of the songs date back 35 years and all of them are over 20 years old this album is like ABBA -it hasn't dated with time. Sure some of the songs have that 1970's feel, but many of them don't. The opening song has uses Thamas Arne's Rule Brittania tune. But the ""How do you do"" song is the classic, a song that even today sounds fresh.Sadly Mouth is now dead, (December 2004 of a heart attack.) and maybe that adds something to this album too.But the real star of this Album is Maggie MacNeal. Her music is as fresh and beautiful and up to date now as when it was first released 30 years ago. ""When your lady says Goodbye"" is a real classic of pigant musical beauty. One of the greatest tragedies of this album is that Maggie MacNeal has been all but forgotten today. Neither she nor her music deserve to be forgotten..."
1,"Provides valuable lessons -- especially for adults! I am a faculty member at a law school. When we considered revamping our curriculum, I gave the committee members passages from this book to read, where the Academy's approach is made clear. Universally, the response was: ""Yeah, that's how we should do things. But we have to pursue a feel-good approach now."" Heinlein understands that character matters, and that institutions should encourage responsibility, not undermine it. That, I suppose, is why he was never an administrator.... Nonetheless, this is not only a terrific story, but one -- like all of Heinlein's juniors -- with a point."
1,"Book that turned me on to science fiction I first read this book in 1970, a time that seems so long ago now it's hard to remember just what it was like. I happened upon it on my school library shelves, among the ""H"" books, among five other Heinleins. I read all of them, but this one was still the one that impressed me the most. Even though it's been nearly fifty years after its first publication, even though things didn't work out like Heinlein proposed, I can still recommend this as a good book to jump-start someone's interest in science fiction."
1,Beautiful Ring! This is a gorgeous ring. I love the unique design and how it sparkles and shines. I've received some very nice compliments too.
1,Good Product The quality was more than I expected for the price. Bought this for work and it's perfect for the food biz.
1,"My first vegetarian cookbook A friend gave me this book (the spiral edition) in 1973, and it truly changed my life -- I became a vegetarian immediately. This is where I learned how to cook and eat all kinds of food that I'd never seen before, especially beans. I am not crazy about the ""breakfast"" recipes, but the breads in this cookbook are great. I have over a hundred cookbooks, and I still make the lasagne with adzuki beans (complicated) and the potato soup (easy). Almost every page in my book is either stained or annotated or both.The only disadvantage to this cookbook is that many recipes call for dairy products and eggs -- things that I still enjoy after 29 years, but that I am not allowed to eat as often these days!This is a classic, educational cookbook for vegetarians."
1,"Not Just For Kids! This product is not just for kids, but very good for adult drivers who do not ordinarily have passengers in the car. I put all my ""junk"" in it which used to be jumbled on the seat beside me. When I am going to have someone else in the car, I just pull it out and put it in the back seat. So much nicer than tossing stuff from the front to the back to make room for a passenger! It looks so neat and holds everything I need."
1,"Great card for peripherals I've been using this card regularly since 2003 in different PC laptops. I got it as a gift with my 1st iPod and have used it for countless hard drives, including for audio recording purposes. Audio & video people take note this has the sought-after TI chipset. All in all it's been rock solid. My only concern now is whether it works under Windows 7."
1,"we are witnesses We are witnesses by Jacob Boas, is a GREAT book to read it gives you different views of teenagers that went through diffuculty during the holocaust. As you know, the person who was in charge of the holocaust was Hitler. All the teeangers talked about hope they always had the hope to live and to have their own family. They never talked about hate, they never said they hate hitler the only thing that they said was that he was responsible for what was happening. This was shocking to me because I would hate the person who had my family killed. Wouldn't you?"
1,"Caught the fever! I was introduced to this band by some friends. Not only are their covers better than some of the original recordings but Brian's love songs are amazing. Give a listen this cd, specifically I'm Gonna Stay and the title track, The Great Symphony."
1,"Inspiration & Motivation Right into the book one of the authors (Norean) talks about the necessity of getting out of our own way in the battle to lose weight. She had my attention from that moment on. Most of us know how to lose weight, it's our attitudes that need adjusting. This book is easy to read, with helpful information on every page. I read it with a Magic Marker in my hand, marking passages to read again. It was pretty well marked up by the time I finished the book. AND, it's got to be the FIRST weight loss book I've ever read cover to cover. I highly recommend it. It's written with compassion."
1,"The Heart of the Matter This book goes right to the heart of the matter - answering the question so often asked: Why do so many fail at weight loss when they know what to do? The narrative is authentic, ringing true from personal experience and case histories. Developing a new way of thinking is challenging and these authors, while providing encouragement, are realistic about the difficult road one must travel to change thought patterns. I found it very valuable."
1,AWESOME MOVIE A MUST SEE I Loved this Movie Plain And Simple It is A MUST SEE. Zoey Saldana has a huge impact in this film. I have multiple copies of this film in my home some how lol but it is well worth it. A must see buy it. Pop some popcorn and enjoy :)
1,"The Pacific Northwest's Best-Kept Musical Secret Mark is a phenomenally talented singer, songwriter, and blues harp player. Why the entire world doesn't know about him is a mystery. His clever, witty lyrics, powerful voice, and musicianship stand out on every cut of this CD. I already owned it, but bought this one as a gift for my sister who lives across the country, heard him live once, and was a goner!"
1,"Husband LOVES this magazine! I got this subscription as a gift for my husband. He loves it. He's really into staying fit and taking care of himself, like many other 20-30 year olds. And this magazine does a great job of writing about topics that are important to young male readers. A great buy. :)"
1,"Terrific new artist Merche (Mercedes Trujillo Callealta) is one of a number of fresh, young Spanish artists. As I understand it, she gave up a career in education to concentrate on music. As far as I am concerned it was a great decision. Her first album, on which she not only sings but also wrote most of the words and music, is a combination of great dance rhythms and a few excellent ballads. She has a strong, beautiful voice, and it is no wonder that her intitial foray into the music world has been a big hit in her native country. Personally, since I received this CD, I have listened to it again and again, and have not even begun to tire of it. Highly recommended!"
1,Excellent review of Mythology through early Christianity This book provided a fascinating review of early Middle Eastern mythology starting from Mesopotamian culture and proceeding through to Judaism and early Christianity. It also includes a discussion of the importance of myth and ritual as a basis for religious and socialogical structure. The area I found most interesting was the discussion of the influence of the mythology of early civilizations on Judeo-Christian belief and scripture.
1,"Fantastic eye openerThis I am so glad I found out about this book. Reading it was a major eye opener for me in understanding the early myths from the area where my own (former) religion originated. S. H. Hooke is an expert in mythology, and he does a fantastic job of showing the connections between the myths of the Middle East. For me personally, this helped me see how the roots of Christianity (particularly with ancient Hebrew religions) was inspired greatly by earlier myths. Whether it was the author's intention or not, it also helped me realize that the religion I once thought was real was, in fact, nothing more than a myth that was not unlike so many similar myths of the time and place.Jeff Mark, author ofChristian No More"
1,"Foster Parenting Abused children- a review This pamphlet serves as a wonderful resource to both those in profesional fields dealing with child abuse as well as those lay persons just entering this world through their consideration of foster parenting. As a researcher I was greatful for such a compact, to the point resource. As someone working with parents I was greatful for the open and easy to understand writing style of Eliana Gil. I have found all of Eliana Gil's works most useful and am greatful that this resource is available to those out there who may not be as interested in her works which are written in a more scholarly (although still understandable) voice."
1,Los Fantasma del Caribe are great!!! I really love Los fantasmas del Caribe they have great music and sound. I love all their material from Caramelo to Mas Y Mas. I completly recommend all their cds. They will have u dancing all night.
1,"Great Lego book One of the best Lego books out. Very high quality graphics and pictures. A nice collection of great projects. Full of interesting topics and tricks for Mindstorms. Covers RCX code, Robolab, NQC, and Visual Basic. RCX communication, Internet control, data logging, etc. Includes a CD and a useful parts list. Enough material to keep young minds and adults busy playing and learning."
1,"Word Biblical Commentary - Genesis Gordon Wenham has produced a first-class exegetical commentary of Genesis. The bibliographies cover a full range of topics and authors. For each section of the biblical text, he begins with textual notes which are quite valuable to those familiar with the ancient languages. Next he addresses issues of form and structure. Finally, he provides a verse-by-verse commentary. In the process, he addresses various approaches and viewpoints in an even-handed and fair way."
1,"This book should be on our shelves as Pastors I cannot imagine a less user-friendly layout than the Word Biblical Commentary Series. The series is uneven, and occasionally goes overboard in literary/source criticism. But one up-to-date, critical commentary on Genesis should be on our shelves, and this is about the best."
1,"Britney I think this C.D. is great. She has a wonderful voice. I love the beats, they are really good. Most of the reviews I have seen always compare the singer to Britney Spears though(Not just Stacie's reviews). I love Brit, she is my fav. singer. I wish that everyone would stop trashing Britney because she shows her stomach. Regardless of what she wears she is still a christian, no one's perfect anyways. As christians we must not judge, people seem to think that christians are judgmental and scrutinizers. Christians, think about what you say before you say it. There is no need to talk badly of others-just something to think about."
1,"Stacie can stand on her own. Stacie's voice is strong and clear. This album (can I still call it an ""album""? I'm dating myslef!) is superb. My young daughter loves it too and it is a joy to hear her singing the words. My only complaint is that the male voice in the background is really unnecessary. Her powerful voice can stand on it's own. Overall, it's superb and outstanding!"
1,"I LOVED it! ^__^ I really loved this CD! *___* There wasn't one song on this CD I didn't like, but my favorites were: Ride, 0.0 Baby, So Pray, Holdin' On, and Everything.But I give every song (...Except the interludes...) 5/5. ^__^"
1,a great cd for teens this cd is a great christian cd that appeals to teans and still shows somewhat of a christian sound. stacie has a great voice thats very mature 14.
1,"The best Christian CD ever! Stacie Orrico has managed to take Christian music to another level with Genuine! Anyone who dares to call her ""the Britney Spears of Christian music"" needs a wake-up call! Britney is awesome, but Stacie will put her to shame! Such songs as Don't Look At Me, O.O. Baby, Stay True, and Holdin' On both have a groove and a message. Then, there's the ballads, like Without Love, Everything, and Dear Friend, a song Stacie herself wrote for her anorexic friend. This album is filled, not with artificial things, but that which is genuine...no pun intended. Although Stacie has tapped into the teen pop phenomenon respresented by such secular artists as Mandy Moore, Christina Aguilera, and of course, Britney Spears, Stacie sings about real life issues, such as peer pressure, idolizing someone else, temptation to do wrong, and even marriage and dating. Stacie is the coolest Christian singer ever. Rock on!"
1,good movie If you are a Chuck Norris fan like me you will enjoy this movie.I remember watching this movie yrs ago remembered the movie but not its proper name until amazon suggested movies to me.
1,Great Service Fast delivery and in wonderful condition. Would buy again anytime from this person. Thank you.
1,"Classic It's a classic for a reason, folks. Extremely amusing and spot-on accurate. A very humorous account of the universal quest for meaning that has surely depressed the mess out of us all at some point or other. Style so good you forget to be jealous and just enjoy.A short review is not an insult. I strongly suggest that you find out about this book from one of those professional reviewer sorts. If you do that, you'll buy it. Alternately, just check your local library, get it if they have it, and prepare to get sucked right into reading this as quickly as you possibly can because it's just that damn good."
1,"Powerful Self-Talk, Change Your Self-Talk, Change Your Life I found this CD program to have very simple yet powerful ideas that I have already implemented in my life. Michael Russ speaks about the way to make changes is to change the way I talk with myself. Very cool!This is clearly one of the best programs I have ever heard, I think Michael Russ will be one of the up and coming stars in the self help business."
1,"Retrospect Awesome book, written many years ago but still is relevant to us today in 2012! Hudson Taylor was a man of Godly wisdom! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book of inspiration and mission work."
1,Really makes a difference Limbsavers reduce the kick of large calibre mil surp rifles. The slip-ons eliminate the need for stock butt modifications if you can put up with an additional inch of pull. Highly recommended.
1,Good flavor to meat. The bisquettes are very good and added flavor to the meat.I would recommend them to anyone wanting to use them.
1,My Name Is Buddy CD Adorable songs about Buddy the cat who goes on a trip with just hissuitcase. Great old songs. Kind of jazzy with blues undertones. Thestories of Buddy's journey are timely. Very enjoyable for people wholove Cats and jazz & blues. Love it!Linda
1,"Great Latin entertainment The best ever, buy and enjoy hours of music by many popular latin singers who have performed over the years. Thank you for the tribute of Celia Cruz befor her death. Buy today."
1,"Fun little guy Picked up my Tachikoma from AX '06. To address some questions: Arms and legs do not have a wire frame inside so it will not hold a pose. Eyes do not turn. Tightly stuffed so it will hold its shape. Go ahead and order it, it's too fun not to own."
1,Hard to find but works great I've been using these for years but for some reason they are no longer available in any of the grocery stores near me. I like them because they offer enough friction to clean tough stains (especially when used with BarKeeper's Friend) but they don't scratch my stainless steel pots the way steel wool used to. They also work great on my stainless steel cook top. I bought a case which reduced the price per item and spread out the shipping.
1,"great stuff We can't find these in stores anymore, which is a shame, since nothing else works as well."
1,great stuff These are just the beat scrubbies I'ver used. They don't scratch and they last forever. None of my local stores carry them anymore.
1,"This is a winner for fat burning & weight loss I did a lot of research, and this product has the best ingredients, and the highest amounts of brown guggul. I have only been taking it about a week but I have lost about 3-4 pounds. It doesn't contain any stimulant like caffeine, so I don't get that jittery feeling. The suggested usage is 1-2 capusules twice a day, the bottle doesn't say whether to take before or after you eat, but I take it before breakfast after my morning coffee. And I have no nausea or anything. I take 2 capsules twice a day, it does raise your body temperature, and has increased my metabolism. I haven't changed my diet or exercised and its working. I will be ordering this again when I run out. And this company had speedy delivery, I received my order within 3 days."
1,Great music to listen to. Highly recommend. This is a great CD with wonderful music to listen to. Larry Carlton is a very talented musician and I'll look forward to buying more of his music.
1,"see this flik Voodoo-like anti-hero, super hot gun toting anti-heroin, oh yea! If you haven't seen this flik your F^&-ing up."
1,"Clean,clear&sounding better then the LP!! Yes, this is the cd from Japan. It definitely is a much better sound then the USA out of print cd that sell for big bucks. Crisp and clear w/solid bass and much better mid & high frequencies all around. The cd does not come in the standard cd case, so you will have no problem finding it amoung all those standard cases. It does have a seperate sheet with the words and a full replica of the old LP cover. I would recommend purchasing this cd made in Japan before getting an out of print US reversion. I got this cd for only eight buck$ more then a mint LP, which I would have to put on a disk to listen to. Oh, you can pay alot less, for this cd, if you buy it on Amazon.com. Enjoy! (-:"
1,"Blistering, compelling rock I bought this because I'd heard the opening track ""Down in the Desert"" and thought it excellent. I was stunned to find the whole CD is supreme...this is surely one of the best kept secrets in all of rock. Thin White Rope are a combination of Television and Sonic Youth and Nick Cave and Pavement and better than all of them. ""When Worlds Collide"" is one of my most treasured CDs and one of the greatest compilations in the history of rock music."
1,"simply first-class! Truth be told, I wasn't expecting a whole lot of sophistication from the uneducated peasant culture of overwhelmingly rural Haiti. Imagine my surprise, then, to discover that I was being treated to a marvelously tightly integrated ethnographic study-cum-anecdote chrestomathy. In addition to some uniquely Haitian elements, there are, of course, the to-be-expected plethora of archetypal folkloric motifs as catalogued by Aarne and Thomson. The stories were generally brief and worked quite well, and Wolkstein's detailed notes about the physical setting and orator of each tale make the reader feel as if he's actually taking part in a rural Haitian storytelling session under the full moon in the sweltering sugar cane fields. Bravo, Dr. Wolkstein!"
1,This book was Phnomenal This was Ann's best book yet. The charatcters and the story were very well-written and woven into real history that I felt like i was relly there. The medical aspcet of it was interesting as well. I was also intrigued by all the body-snatchers and read more about them . The author presents a fair argument as to whether the bodies should have been left alone or used for mediacl science and I thought that her un-biased nature was commendable. This was a great book and I think this was definately the best yet.
1,"A Very Suspenseful Book! This book not only kept me reading and reading, it also was suspenseful and thrilling. Emily was a truly wonderful character and all of the other characters had colorful personalities as well. If you like suspense and romance too, get this book today! You'll absolutely love it."
1,"Outstanding performancw I'd like to see this on stage, this performance certainly enhanced my interest in this work."
1,Just right for the job This repair kit has an excellent selection of lots of various screw sizes and had just what I wanted for my glasses. The cost was not expensive and delivery was fast. I have to use a walker or scooter so going to the store to fix my glasses would have been a big chore. This kit enabled me to do everything at home quickly.
1,Great product This kit has everything you would ever need to repair a pair of glasses from screws to nose padsI received the kit real fast in about 3 days I was surprised at how many screws there were the screwdriver is easy to use and the nose pads so many this was better then described on amazon store page
1,"Great Tool Kit for Sunglasses After my Gucci sunglasses lost the part that holds the screw I could not find a tool kit that coantain the part and I didn't want to throw my glasses away. I am so glad I found this kit in Amazon. Not only did it have the part I need it, it also has a small screw that attaches to your keychain so you can have with you at all times just in case your sunglasses get loose."
1,"The Best of Bizarro is awesome Well, this is a great collection. The artwork is great, but it's the clever conceptions that make these cartoons so funny. There are no stock characters or favorite themes, every panel is original and fresh. Highly recommended."
1,"Why pay more? I actually purchased a pair of these about a year ago for my home WIFI network from a different site. Since that site no longer has these in stock, I got the next pair (this time for my church) from Amazon. I have had 0 issues with these cards - can't remember a single time where I lost connectivity honestly. Don't think I could ask for more, especially at the price point. Great buy!"
1,"Super G 802.11BG Wireless Pci 64 Bit Xp Compliant Turbo Mode I ordered this just over a month ago, and I recieved it in the time frame that I was told. It is great! My computer works great with it and it was really easy to install! I have never installed one before, but I wanted to try and do it myself and not have to get someone else to do it! It was so easy to do and once installed, I downloaded the disk and it was ready to go...it was really quite simple,and I am far from a computer expert. So if I can do it, so can you! I'm so glad I got it and I will probably be purchasing a couple more in the near future for my kids' computers too!!"
1,"Installed on 2 desktops - Easy as pie I wanted to get rid of those pesky wires, so after some research I bought one of these to see if it would work in my desktop. The day it arrived I followed the directions and it was picking up my wireless router signal within 5 minutes of opening the package. Needless to say, I bought another one the same day for my wife's desktop and they have worked flawlessly for a month now. Both are XP systems."
1,"Works great if................. I recently installed this card on an old HP 64 bit desktop that I was upgrading to Windows 7. As the included CD didn't have a Windows 7 driver I went to their website, using another PC of course, and downloaded the correct driver and then let Windows ""find"" it during installation. I didn't load any of the manufacturer's software at all, I let Windows do everything and its working perfectly. I get instant connection when I power up, the signal is strong and I've yet to drop the connection. The desktop is 2 rooms (thus 2 walls) away from the gateway and directly next to an HD TV, which I use as its monitor, and doesn't pick up any interference. Oh, one more thing, once everything was working ""automatic update"" downloaded and installed an even newer driver."
1,"Easy install, works great I moved to a location where wireless internet was all that was available and so I needed a wireless adapter for my desktop PC. This product was quick and easy to install and enabled me to be on line immediately. The price was very reasonable and the product works as described."
1,"Great wireless adapter The computer I installed this in, is in my sons room across the hallway. Without a wall, it would measure probably 50 to 60 feet (maybe a little more) Since I have installed the product it has held at excellent signal. I can't say how well it would work further as I have not tried. I only ran into 1 hiccup after installing. When I turned off the computer and turned it back on, it did not automatically hunt for my access point. So I added my access point to the settings and that fixed that problem. I am very pleased with this product."
1,"Super G 802.11BG worked out of box I installed the Super G 801.11BG wireless card into an older Dell desktop with 2 OS's on separate hard drives. One OS is ubuntu and the other is XP.With the ubuntu OS,the card worked out of the box without any more tweaking,with the XP OS,I installed the software that came with the card,and it worked without any more tweaking, and still works with ubuntu after upgrading from 8.10 to 9.04.Highly recommend this wireless card and I really like the antenna being on a cable instead of attached to the card on the back of computer."
1,"Wonderful Resource The stories in ""The Mishomis Book"" give an excellent background for the Anishnabe culture. I have heard Anishnabe Elders refer to it as a children's bible for the Anishnabe.It begins with the origin of the Anishnabe People. It continues through many of the stories that establish the mores and society of this culture. All of these stories are written in a way children can understand.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the culture of the Woodland Indians. It has been a beginning point of understanding this culture for me and, I am certain, many others."
1,"Wonderful story I had to buy this for a college course, and I love it so much that I won't part with it now. My kids are reading it and I think it's a great way to introduce them to Native American tradition."
1,"Classic and Essential! Since 1980, I have been recommending this reference to over 23, 000 participants in my business writing workshops. I describe the book as invaluable, comprehensive, beautifully organized, and continuously updated. The Gregg Reference Manual is one of two essential tools for business, government and corporate writers: the other is a fat dictionary. The Manual is full of wisdom and articulates sound uniform rules with nicely nuanced exceptions. It is simply my writer's crutch."
1,"Complete and easy to use I've used this book for years, and I think it's terrific. Why? Four reasons: First, the information about grammar and usage is so mainstream, so consistent with the majority of other important references (The Chicago Manual of Style, for one). Second, it is accurate and reliable. Third, the outstanding index makes it wonderfully easy to use; you can look something up, in everyday terms, and readily find a reference. Fourth, the rules are short and the examples clear; once you've found the rule you need, you can read it, grasp it, and 30 seconds later be on your way.As a full-time trainer of writers and editors, I have used this book with everyone from grammar-challenged support staff to highly educated professional editors. With some classes, I've also used the optional worksheets (sold separately). I can't recommend Gregg highly enough."
1,"Thank you, Peter! Your book is great! I've found this book totally different from any other tutorial stuff. In spite of my past programmers expirience in database I've started studying OOP from scratch more than one year ago. I had several books of Java-programming (Deitel&Deitel, Mike Morgan, Peter Norton etc.). I've got prefer this one. Author give to readers the pretty excelent refferences. I would say that this book ought to read whether you beginers in OOP or not. This book will compel you work. It is inexhaustible source for Java programming."
1,"Great book, great price I learned a lot from ""Just Java 1.2"" and really liked the readable style. The author knows how to get detailed technical points across. The diagrams and pictures really helped too. The CD has a LOT of Java material on it."
1,"Great for bi-wire I use this on my Mirage OMD -15 , since the speaker has 4 post on the speaker and suggest bi-wiring I needed something that would be able to be run into the same plug into the receiver and all four plugs into the speaker while not splitting the wire. Even though I am not running over long distances I like the fact that I can run 4 16 gauge AWG solid copper wires out of 2 plugs."
1,"Reviewing the review I am bothered by the review from dn@microtek.fr. Everyone has a right to his own opinion, but I think this is just vicious anti-Christian retoric. Mr. Tozer is a prolific writer and has several 5 star ratings. Please see the ""All Books"" list before judging this book only by what this man says."
1,"The Best Sherlock Holmes -- And That's Saying Plenty! I have read and enjoyed many a good Sherlock Holmes story (e.g. ""The Red-Headed League"" is a winner), but at the very top of the book stack I would place ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"". Who could ever forget the atmosphere that Arthur Conan Doyle evokes by his use of those misty moors!In teaching English (Literature) to a class of 7th & 8th grade boys, I was at first a bit hesitant to introduce this novel as our text. Would a group of squirrelly junior high boys find anything of interest in a book written in 1901? Answer: I needn't have worried. They loved it (and so did I)! The fog from the moors drifted right into our classroom.First-rate mystery tale with one of the most famous fictional characters ever created. ENJOY! (But keep an eye out for a frightful luminescent hound next time you're walking home at night - just in case)."
1,"Top Rate Holmes.......... Ah, to settle in with Hound of the Baskervilles was pure delight. I had read this many years ago in an almost obsessive pursuit of reading all things Sherlock Holmes and have only recently taken up my obsession again with the wonderful series by Laurie R. King featuring Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell. I digress, back to Hound of the Baskervilles. One of the best mysteries in the series. What more could you ask for? A spookylegend about a gruesome phantom dog, murder most foul, the English moor and an ancient creepy mansion. In this story, Dr. Watson has never been more delightful as Holmes' foil and confidant. The mystery evolves to an exiting climax which leaves the reader fufilled but wanting to get their hands on the next Holmes case. Well done!"
1,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would approve I'm new to audio books. But, I'm afraid I've already been spoiled. I wonder if there could possibly exist a better combination of author and reader. Holmes sounds just the way you'd expect the great sleuth to sound. Deliberate, never rushed and always a gentleman.The story is carefully woven and the presentation of the characters by Timson is masterful. I've listened to it over several times and each time I appreciate a little more the complexity and the detail. The Musical interludes are brief and sparse, but definitely compliment. If you like Sherlock Holmes, Timson is the right reader for the job. I'm buying the big collection now."
1,"Like Classics, Read this Book Follow Sherlock Holmes and his trusty colleague, Watson, in one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's best murder mystery ever, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Watch while Sherlock Holmes uncovers the mysteries of the Baskerville Hall of London.You and Sherlock Holmes get to discover all the clues of Charles Baskerville's mysterious death and protect Henry Baskerville from being murdered. You listen to stories of the notorious hound. Finally, before its too late, decide who is behind the murder of Charles Baskerville. Was it the baronet, Mr. And Mrs. Stapleton, or was it possibly Laura Lynes? Find out in the end.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle keeps you in suspense throughout the book. He keeps bringing in more leads to the story. The author also provides an interesting and intriguing topic with a tall tale creature tied in.This book is wonderful and would be best appreciated by all readers 10 and up."
1,"Enhanced with music and sound effects The first in Scenario Productions' ""The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes"" series and taken from the Archives of CBC Radio, this superbly presented radio adventure theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is a multicast presentation of a classic Sherlock Holmes story. This two audio cassette audio book has a two hour running time and is enhanced with music and sound effects for the perfect ""theater of the mind"" listening experience. This radio theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is enthusiastically recommended for all Sherlock Holmes fans and would make a very popular addition to school and community library audio book collections."
1,"kindle book this was good copy, I enjoyed it. Smooth transaction, no problems at all, I will buy more in the future."
1,"This book is awesome! I read this book and this is definitely my favorite of all the books I have read. This book is very, very, suspenseful and a little spooky. This was the first Sherlock Holmes book I have read and it got me hooked on Sherlock Holmes. I couldn't put this book down because it was so suspenseful and it was very entertaining. I would recommend this book to anyone."
1,"Nice, basic version Nice, basic book version of this classic Sherlock Holmes story. Comments/vocabulary in the back is a nice touch for those trying to learn from literature. Not deluxe, but worth the low price."
1,Great Laser Printer I had this printer working within minutes of opening the box. Very fast with quality print. An excellent value.
1,"SAILOR STARS ROCKS!! i dont own this, but i ahve all the MP3s and i just have to say that this cd is awesome!!!"
1,The Gratest Ever!!! This is the absolute best of Sailor Moon right here. Not only is Sailor Moon Sailor Stars the best season ever the sonds are the GREATEST!
1,Couldnt have been easier! I purchased this system a year ago and have been dreading having to change the filter. I HATE changing filters on anything because it's never as easy as the manufacturer claims. I just changed the filter and it took me about 2 minutes. Super easy! I love this product! My skin isn't all itchy when I take a shower anymore!
1,JOHN WAYNE!!!!!! What else is there to say about a John Wayne movie that has not been said. Good fast service and good movie.
1,"One of the Duke's best westerns John Ford and John Wayne teamed up to do many films during their days in Hollywood and this western adventure is among the best horse operas ever made. Set in picturesque Monument Valley, a favorite Ford outdoor setting, the movie tells of life in an army outpost in Arizona and the unease of officers and enlisted men under the command of a disgruntled, by-the-book lieutenant colonel. Henry Fonda is excellent as the martinent who alienates his men and clashes with Wayne's Captain York throughout the film, their differences exploding during a peace parley with the Apaches which ends in a rousing cavalry-Indian engagement near the end of the movie. Ford's regulars, led by Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen and Hank Worden are among the cast members, and Shirley Temple and John Agar provide the romantic angle in the proceedings. The black and white cinematography by Archie Stout is striking and Richard Hageman's wistful score are among the film's top notch production values."
1,"Classic Western John Ford was one of the greatest directors to ever step on a movie set. He was proficient in many genres but won his most acclaim for his Westerns - especially those starring John Wayne. Fort Apache ranks among his best offerings, having not only great direction but also two super stars at the peak of their powers. Duke Wayne and Hank Fonda play contrasting characters who share one thing in common - the call to duty. The scenery is glorious and the pacing sublime in this highly recommended film."
1,A FUN EVENT! Hey not many people I know watch the apprentice but pretty soon everybody I know will play the computer game of it! It totally rocks! You have to try it. Donald Trump is amazing. I love the game. And I got it from amazon for a really cheap price. Amazon has the cheapest prices you could imagine.
1,"Small but very nice! I bought this for a little Valentine's day gift for my 2.5yo. He has good fine motor skills for his age, so he can handle the tiny size. He's not into coloring the pictures in yet, just lots of enthusiastic stamping, counting, making animal sounds, and naming the animals and colors, which this is great for. I do think that if your child wants to color the pictures in, you'll want the bigger stampers. But this set is so cute, easy to store, and the 4-color stamp pad is nice. A lot of fun in a tiny package, and definitely worth the 6 bucks!"
1,farm animal stamps looks nice. i purchased this as a gift & it has not been used yet. so i can't really rate it.
1,"Fun Series, but I'm biased OK, first I'll admit to a strong bias. My day job is to limit orbital debris creation from NASA satellites, so any series that recognizes the importance of my daily struggle is an automatic win with me.That said, I think the show is interesting, and something I could see watching on Saturday mornings for fun. They've included enough interpersonal relationship stuff to keep it interesting, but with the backdrop of nerdy space facts. I love to destroy these kinds of shows on technical inaccuracies, but I find that harder to do with this series. The writers seem to have made the effort to actually research their topic a little bit, and tried to stick to facts. There are a few inventions to fit the story lines, but for the most part they try to be reasonably accurate.The interviews in the bonus tracks are pretty good, and I use them in my classes on orbital debris."
1,Extreme Trains: The complete Season One My husband loves steam trains. This was a Christmas present for him. He has spent many enjoyable hours watching it.
1,"Hello, my name is...and I love trains! I stumbled upon this series while looking for train shows for my 6 year old son...he loves the show so much we have almost every show to date and will definitely buy this dvd. He has even begun to say ""Hello, my name is Kieran and ever since I was little I have loved trains.""I have to agree Matt is awesome...he is grown kid playing with real life trains....I learned so much about trains and the history about them that I can't wait til next season....Trains rule at our house! We are train hunters...no matter where trains are we will find them."
1,"A must for the Railfans, kids, and transpotters An avid fan of trans, and model railroading, I love this show. It's the favorite show of my 4 year old who watches an episode at least daily, and knows more about the operations of railroads than most adults because of this show.The camera work is well done, and captures the hard steel and movement of a train. Matt Bown is a great host who adds excitement and his love of trains with the audience, giving great descriptions of the technical aspects of railroading. You'll walk away from the show with a greater understanding of trains and a deeper love for them as well.The extras are nice, as there are some scenes from nearly every episode that never aired. I would liked to have seen some audio commentary though."
1,"Bighorse Warrior Comes Alive I've met the author - Tiana Bighorse Butler. Her pride shines through as she tells the stories of her father. Written in Navajo english, the reader is taken into the traditional navajo way of life. Wonderful stories give an honest perspective and a clear understanding of warriors in that point of time. Buy this book!! Compelling reading that you'll never forget!!"
1,"ELEGANT AND EASY Barry Tarshis has given us a remarkably well done guidebook to that often complicated language we call ""English"". It is a priceless helping hand for everyone - students, writers, professionals, and just plain folks. Bravo Mr. Tarshis!"
1,"An excellent and enjoyable resource After reading ""Seduce Me! How to Ignite Your Partner's Passion"", I immediately made arrangements to purchase an initial order of 50 copies for our medical office. Through our patient-centered obstetrics and gynecology practice, we treat thousands of women annually and receive questions and concerns about sexual libido daily.I found this book to be very informative, presenting scientific biochemical data and psychological insights in a manner that any of our patients could easily comprehend.Beyond that, the recommendations offer clear and fun solutions, addressing both sexual and relationship issues. I would estimate that 1 in 4 women I see daily ask me about problems with sexual desire and fulfillment, and I am very pleased to be able to provide ""Seduce Me!"" to them as an excellent and enjoyable resource."
1,"Genious Allegory of the Christian Life - Timeless! This book is truly a literary classic! Although written over 400 years ago, this allegory of the Christian life is still relevant today. It still speaks to incredible depths of the Christian experience, the struggles as well as the joys. You'll feel the emotion of ""Christian"" as he encouters a number of characters, all named for their particular life experience.I have read this book 4 times in the last 10 years, and plan to again this year. Everytime I pick it up my relationship with God is strengthened. I have also refered to it many times in conversation. What more could you ask for in a book!If you're not comfortable with the old english, then try a modern language version. Either way you won't be disappointed. I guarantee it!"
1,"Prompt and Utter Distruction My opinion about this book is it joins a long list of similar books that pick out parts of the decisions that were made in 1945 about use of the atomic bomb and criticize U.S. leaders who made decisions under the press of time and circumstance and in dealing with a Japanese military, which totally ran the country. In such a situation, someone like the author of this book (and there are many others like him) can go back and question the decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan from the safe distance of more than 50 years. In my review of the handling of the atomic bomb in August, 1945, with very minor exceptions, the leaders of the United States made the correct decision based on all the facts.uwcharlie"
1,Great History Book I bought this book for school.. I have not read it yet but it arrived in perfect condition.. Very fast shipping.
1,"Assessing NAFTA This book contains a comprehensive assessment of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Authors from all three countries probe different aspects of the deal; they provide an overall assessment as well as detaailed examination of some of the critical issues and sectors that will be affected.In addition to assessments of NAFTA from Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the book examines specific issues, namely, the enviroment, agriculture, investment provisions, rules of origin, the trade in automotive goods, dispute settlement, energy, the textile and apparel sector, and the financial sector. -- from book's back cover"
1,"Hardcore Fun for The Entire Family If you enjoy movies that make you uneasy yet you keep watching because of a voyeueristic mix of repulsion and fascination, then look no further--here's the one you've been looking for.Brando was considered a legend, and this movie is proof; ""acting"" is too small a word to describe the performance he gave here.Pain. Confusion. Lust. Grasping at redemption as it slithers through your fingers--it's all right here, folks.This movie is a carousel of torment. There's an anonymous person riding next to you, and both of you have to laugh at it all, just to keep from crying."
1,"The genius of Marlon Brando I remember seeing this movie for the first time about a billion yrs ago and thinking, `So THIS is what being a superb actor is all about.' Brando, playing an expat in Paris who is in despair over his wife's very recent suicide, never once seems to be acting, never seems aware of camera or audience, never seems to consider how others will view him or his role or this movie. Unbelievable.The film was shocking when it was first made in 1973, especially for the graphic and (at that time) `unusual' sexual scenes - and it still makes viewers squirm a bit, but his odd and almost voiceless relationship with Maria Schneider is not self-serving on either end. It's dispassionate and anonymous sex, meant as a Band-Aid on a wound too painful to be dealt with in any other way.Super, super, super."
1,"to paraphrase Inigo Montoyo and Freud, sometimes a camel hair coat ""[doesn't mean] what you think it means"" Ohmijesus, arriviste in Paris lets go of one branch to grab onto what she thinks is an established man of importance. Brando who raped faerie queen Vivien Leigh in A Streetcar Named Desire has his bereaved, many-varied way with badly cloaked Toxic Ambition. This is why men break up over the telephone or via email or better yet just VANISH. This is a precursor to Fatal Attraction. I think this movie is supposed to be annoying, off-putting and unattractive. His dead wife is the daughter of a French Resistence member. Could this be important to the movie?"
1,"Great bindings, good intro critique We all know about Shakespeare, so a review of his writing is not required. However, I would like to say that the Everyman's Library series are worth getting. Unlike omnibus editions (such as the Riverside Shakespeare), these are actually portable so you don't need a table to hold them up while you are reading. The Everyman's Library series have good hardbindings, are conveniently sized to carry around, and have illuminating and extensive introductions. The typeface used is old, but the letters are large and easily readable (something that is a concern with some other editions).Tragedies, Volume 1 contains: Hamlet; Othello; King Lear; Machbeth"
1,"Don't buy the wrong one! This review is not about the product -- Everyman Tragedies Volume 2, which is wonderful -- but a warning to use care when purchasing. My first time through, I clicked into the ""New"" options from $0.73, and was directed to several well priced books. The only problem is, they are not the volume advertised on this page. Instead it's three plays in an unattractive volume from something called Ann Arbor Media. So be careful!"
1,"Brush Up Your Shakespeare Editions! None of the other reviews here refer to what is actually being offered on this page: the 3-volume set of Shakespeare's plays (Histories, Tragedies, Comedies) published by The Heritage Press, commonly known as The Heritage Shakespeare.This set became an instant classic when it was published in 1958, and if you're interested in a beautifully printed, edited, and illustrated edition of the plays at a reasonable price, you cannot go wrong with the Heritage."
1,"And I even didn't like this singer! But now I do! Marco Borsato wasn't one of my favourite singers here in Holland. But that changed when I heard several of the songs on this album. As soon as the CD got out, I run to the store and bought the album. There are several slow songs, but also some songs with ritme. Marco Borsato is on his best at this CD and I think it is even better than his new album Luid en Duidelijk. A ""must have"" Cd for every Borsato fan!"
1,"Finally - a PRACTICAL guide Mark's book is an excellent, easy to understand read, which I found extremely helpful.Most books on TOC deal with a lot of theory, or case studies. This is the first book I've read that goes into incredible detail on how to implement TOC using the author's years of experience in this field.A must-read if you are plannig to implement TOC."
1,Tubas by a Waterfall in the Canyons of Your Mind -- This is more entertaining than anything should be allowed to be. Avoid operating heavy machinery while listening.And don't listen to it while asleep or you'll wake up on the floor wondering how you came to be so elevated.
1,"what a great story I liked this. Better than the first one, I think, although I have to go re-read that one. I especially liked the way the characters are developing into more complex people. The scenes at sea are wonderful, but I have to say that I'm glad she didn't leave them in Scotland. Too much Scotland these days in love stories. Don't people realize it's wet and cold there most of the time? I'm looking forward to the next installment back on the ny frontier. Give me mosquitos over scotsmen anyday.I also have a theory about the reviews here that call this book boring (there are about five of them, I think). There are three reasons that come to mind to call this boring: somebody glued the pages together on you, you're brain dead, you've got something against the author. I suspect those reviews were all written by the same boring person. A vendetta? Sour grapes? Oxygen deprivation? Who knows."
1,"Not as good as the first but still excellent I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one, but I usually think the first book in a series is the best anyway. All in all this is an excellent series, recommend!"
1,"review I felt the first book in the series started off a little weak and definitely grew in strength as the novel progressed. However, I enjoyed ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" from start to finish and went on to purchase the other titles in the series right away. My only complaint is that this book did not have a Kindle edition."
1,"what a story The kind of book that makes you turn off the phone and ignore the kids. Those two reviewers here who said ""boring""? I'm wondering if they read the same book. I suppose they need a nuclear explosion or the like to keep them happy. What I like is, interesting characters in challenging situations, and you've got that here in abundance.The first one was very good, but this one is even better. More tightly written. Miss Donati has come into her stride. Bring on Hidden Wolf!"
1,"EUEKA BITTERROOT 11 I just got this to replace a little 2 people tent as my daughter is old enough now to go camping whit us. Yes It is very roomy for the three of us but I can for sure use the extra space. We camp at a lagoon 35F at night to 55F at noon. No condensation, good wind protection and resistance. Very well constructed. You will need help to put on the canopy on windy situations. It's a very good option between a 3 seasons and a 2 seasons because of the protection and waterproof and the big windows and height."
1,"Euphoric About Eureka Bitterroot Tent We have owned this tent for seven months now and can attest that the manufacturer description and majority of other reviews are spot on (thus far)! While we have yet to put it through any rough weather tests, we have found the tent to possess a practical design, spacious interior, a height that makes it comfortable for standing, well made, and easy to put up and take down. The only suggestion I would have for Eureka is to include metal tent stakes instead of the cheap easily breakable plastic ones."
1,"perfect campground tent You certainly wouldn't want to take this backpacking, but for use at a campground, this tent would be hard to beat. I purchased it from a gold box offer shortly before Memorial Day, and just got back from a camping trip. Everyone was jealous of this HUGE tent. I am 6'5'' and could stand up comfortably in the center of this tent.It rained 2 of the 3 nights we were out there, and one night it POURED. Despite the usual loudness of the rain on the fly, this was a pleasant experience. No rain got into the tent, and thanks to the ceiling vents and well designed fly, we stayed cool and happy the entire night.Easy to set up, easy to take down. Easy to shake off after a rainfall to pack up immediately.1 adult and 4 kids was no problem, everyone had PLENTY of personal space. I imagine 4 adults fit in quite comfortably.Eureka hasn't let me down, and if you are in the market for a HUGE tent, this is the one to get."

1,"ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES EVER WHEN THE MOVIE STARTED I WAS NOT SURE ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE PLOT ABOUT, AND THAT REALLY WORKED GOOD FOR ME. AFTER A VERY SHOCKING SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT, SIX WOMEN DECIDED TO EXPLORE A CAVE AND THEY FIND WHAT TRUE HORROR IS. I WAS SHOCKED AND STUCK TO MY SIT FROM THE BEGINNING TILL THE END OF THE MOVIE. THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD AND WELL DONE, DIRECTED AND EDITED. VISUAL EFFECTS ARE OUTSTANDING. I WON'T TELL ANYTHING ELSE TO AVOID TO SPOIL IT WHEN YOU WATCH IT. BUT TRUST ME, THIS MOVIES IS SO GOOD THAT NOW, I WILL FOLLOW CLOSER ALL WORKS BY DIRECTOR NEIL MARSHALL. SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THE MOVIE HAS WON 3 IMPORTANT AWARDS,1- British Independent Film Award ""Best Director: Neil Marshall""2- British Independent Film Award ""Best Technical Achievement""3- Empire Award ""Best Horror Movie""AND HAS 4 OTHER NOMINATIONS... THE MOVIE IS A TOTAL SUCCESS, THUMPS UP FOR NEIL MARSHALL"
1,Warning! Do not buy this film if you are afraid of small dark cramped spaces underground. This movie will scare the bee-jabbers out of you. Other than that -- it's a good thrill ride.
1,"Best horror film...ever. Before this film no other film has even come close to scaring me. Those films mentioned above are like watching the Teletubbies in comparison to this film. I even consciously considered getting up and leaving the cinema through this film because I thought my mind just couldn't handle the tension any more. The action simply never stops once it starts. And, I won't spoil anything, but the first gory scene of the film: that kind of stuff shouldn't even be allowed! I never thought the line could be moved so far."
1,I LOVE THIS MOVIE:D This is a great and powerful movie. It starts out slow but then it gets going. It is a great movie and everything about it is great. If you are into horror and monster like creatures then you will like this movie.
1,"I wish their were more like this First no spoilers here but I will say theier is a build up in the movie,but when it hits the fan,it really hits the fan.I havnt had that feeling in my gut in a long time,not since the first Alien film,they felt similiar to me.This movie is not for the faint of heart although not as gorry as some previous movies when its used here it is very effective,this movie will make you feel unsettled,this is for sure the best creature film i've seen in years,bring your nerves.Sum it up I wont be in any caves for sure anytime in the near future,and yes go ahead and buy this no need to waste your money on a rent you will want this in your collection.Instant Classic"
1,"Terrorific Extreme Adventuring When watching this movie, I feel like I'm in that labyrinthine cave so far underground--just as I find myself on the mountain and in the crevasse when viewing Touching the Void. I found the troglodytes very believable as well. The character development was quite adequate. The acting was fine. I found nothing that detracted from the experience except the very last 10 seconds (which I won't give away). I find this movie to be an engrossing terrorific adventure."
1,"Awesome Movie I only have one word for this Movie ''Awesome'' , the movie have anything one horror movie need, you need see this movie. 5 star for this."
1,"Intense horror/suspense Simply spine chilling!!! After a bit of drama in the beginning to set the relationship between these friends, the movie erupts into an action/thriller that had me biting my nails (something I haven't done for years). This movie is 'otherworldly' and may scare some would-be spelunkers away from dark, creepy caves forever, but it's worth the risk if you love horror. If you liked 'Dog Soldiers', you'll 'bite into' this one. Grab your popcorn and hang on because once the creatures take the stage your eyes are glued wide open. (o.k, so I viewed bloody scenes from between my fingers the first time). I watched it twice and still jumped at a few things I knew were coming. Very well-written. The cave/climbing shots and immense fear factor never go over the top, but they sure do raise your blood pressure a few notches. Excellent horror film! I believe this director is really on a roll.P.S. Be sure to check out the beautiful mountain scenery.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
1,"Brilliant! The best horror film to come out in 10 years, easy. If you are in any way claustraphobic this film will be hard to sit through. The cave is terrifying in itself, which is quite an acheivement considering the modest budget. As the women descend deeper into the cave I felt as if I was watching A Stanly Kubrick or a Ridly Scott film. The buidup to the real threat is fantastic, and theaters will be filled with screams when the movie hits the U.S next month. I think the American studio cut the real ending off so they can sell the 'unrated' DVD afterwards. They know they have a hit on their hands, so they will milk it for all it's worth. This version is a must have for any horror fan that doesn't want to wait a year for a proper US release."
1,"GREAT !! This is a great movie !I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this, but I'm very glad I took a chance on it. It has beautiful scenery, good actors and it's really quite scary ! Iv'e been in a cave before and went much farther into it than expected for a guy who doesn't like confined spaces. This movie captures the feel and fear involved in exploring the underground. If I ever do go into another one, I will be watching for the freaky creatures that live within the caves of this movie. These guys(or gals)natually freak me out! The way they look, move, and sound are great. There is plenty of suspense and alot of scary scenes.I was a little ""put-off"" by the ending,which I guess is the prelude to ""Decent II"", which I haven't seen yet. Over all, it's worth renting, or buying. It's a classic !!"
1,"Great Little Printer This little printer prints fast and clearly. I always thought a laser printer would be out of reach for me, cost-wise, but Amazon's price was quite reasonable (in fact it's still the lowest I've seen, a month later). Most of the things I print are in b&w anyway and I love not having to wait while my inkjet printer grinds out a page. I recommend this printer wholeheartedly."
1,"Perfect UPDATE:July 22, 2007: The old review stated that I have not changed my ink cartrdige, which was in August of 2005. I still have yet to change it. It has been almost 2 years. Since I am in school, I print hundreds to thousands of text. I am surprised that there is still no fade to the text. My printer has still not jammed and is still printing at quick speeds. I am fully satisfied with this printer and am glad I did not invest in any other printer. I recommend this printer to anyone that wants a cost efficient and very reliable, black and white printer.This HP Printer has lasted me throughout my freshman and sophomore year of college. I have not yet needed to change my ink cartridge: I've printed most likely 1000 pages of text. I've never had a hardware or software issues. When I recieved the product, there was no usb cable, as most printers do not include them (quite lame). I recommend this product to any person who does not need color. Great product and great price!"
1,"Best little printer ever!!! Would not sell for 300 even though bought for 80 because this printer is amazing! I have used for maybe 3 years and only replaced the ink cartridge once and print all the time. Quality Prints, Quiet and Nearly Instant prints. What else could you want?IFind one of these. You won't be disappointed."
1,"A great workhorse I couldn't be happier with this printer. I'm a writer and a writer who doesn't particularly like reading off a computer screen. I can't see the flow, and make easy notes, or get an overall vibe of the thing while reading off a screen.Plus, I'm also starting a PhD program in the next month and so printing is a necessity.I don't need the absolute fastest, and I don't need the absolute best quality. What I need is a solid, laser printer that fits into my decidedly narrow budget.This fit perfectly and it works perfectly as well.I'm very pleased."
1,"I am so pleased with this computer. This is a great computer and at such a reasonable price. I haven't had any problems with it whatsoever. It's fast, doesn't jam and I print several pages everyday...unlike the ink-jets, I don't have to replace cartridges frequently.It arrived in a timely manner. I will shop here again."
1,"I get a plenty of 'smooth use' out of this lit'l thing at my small business. I'll keep it simple...I get a lot of 'smooth use' out of this lit'l thing at my small business. Great, no me arrepiento (no regrets)! I wish I could find a laserjet 'all in one' in this 'price effectiveness' range as well."
1,"The Printer that Could My first laser printer cost over $1,000, was frustratingly slow, and had good but not great print quality. Fifteen years and about as many printers later, I now have this little 1020 for less than one-fifth the price. I set it up in exactly two minutes. It runs dead quiet (nice in an office environment of so many fans and hums). It has great first page response - and when I'm done typing the letter, I slap the envelope in the manual tray, print it, and I'm done. The print quality is as good as it gets. It is not the fastest printer in the world, but it is more than competitive in this price bracket. And small? Smallest footprint of any laser I've owned, which is also important to me. I can't say enough about this printer - finally, someone got a small printer exactly right for small business."
1,"Flawless This printer has been working flawlessly. This is the second one I have purchased. We decided to put one on each of our computers. No problems whatsover. If you want B&W laser prints without any problems, this printer is perfect and well priced."
1,"Wow fast delivery! Really nice printer, it's black and white ink, but does the job better than my higher quality printer,"
1,"Great little machine! I don't normally go out of my way to write reviews, but I do appreciate reading them before I buy....so here's one for those considering buying this for their ""second office"" application. I've had this printer for 3 months now, and it's great for my home office (where I work when I'm not in my office office). Footprint is tiny, no problems with paper feed (like prior top-feed printers I've had), print quality good and crisp, and printouts appear instantly. Good work HP."
1,"Great printer for the price I bought this printer to replace my HP Laserjet III, which was approximately 18 years old and only needed service once. The printer was delivered a few days earlier than I expected it. Even though the USB cable didn't come with it, I looked around at home and found that I had a spare one. I preloaded the software supplied with the printer and it was fully functional in under 15 minutes.I'm more than pleased with my selection. I hope this one lasts as long as the HP III did."
1,"Miracle Man This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It made Padre Pio very real, his life, dedication and suffering. It was a lengthy film but worth ever minute. I highly recommend it to any one at all intersted in the mystical side of our saints and the Church."
1,Inspirational How one man's faith kept him through all of life's challenges. Very well played out and very well done!
1,"Excellent Movie! Movie arrived on time and in great condition. This was a birthday gift for my grandaughter and she was really happy. I watched it and I just loved it, a great movie."
1,"One of my all time favorites This is the kind of movie I like watching more than once. I have a deep admiration for this man who was able to follow Christ ways in such a heroic way, the movie does a great job also showing the issues within the church which true saints are able to endure and still love it.Very accurate in biographical data, I have to warn you that the dubbing in English (it lacks the proper feeling which can lead you to think that the acting was poor) is poor, the spanish one si really good.The music is beatiful.It's a work of art, highly reccomended, specially if you don't understand what a saint is and what are the merits that make one.The acting is really good, specially considering Father Pio had a complicated italian personallity :-)"
1,Padre Pio Miracle Man This video was FANTASTIC. It was over 3 1/2 hrs and I was rivited. It is a great story and pretty close to article I have read about Padre Pio. Would recommend this highly.
1,"Nothing short of incredible. This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Nothing else needs to be said, whoever watches it will understand."
1,Great story This novel was a very quick read. The characters were well developed and so was the story line. I loved the way it ended it gave the story a close. I recommend this novel to anyone.
1,"Drama, Drama and more Drama This book is a page turner. It will have you guessing about the ending. I wonder who did Ms. Spencer get the male outlook from, but whoever it is is real. The ending is a shocker, but so is the middle and the beginning. It will keep you laughing."
1,Strange Exciting Twist WHEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE is a fantastic book to read on a slow Saturday afternoon. I enjoyed it because I could never have anticipated the twist and turns the story takes. I think Ms. Spencer is on her way to becoming a very popular writer.
1,"Out of sight!!!! An excellent book of ""Cat and Mouse"" (so to speak). I thought this was an excellent book. It was easy reading, interest....A real page turner with a twist."
1,Dont Stop Now....... This was a very exciting book. I finished it in 2 days. I cant wait for the next book.
1,"couldn't stop reading Well my bookclub enjoyed every page of this book she was a new author for us and we got our money worth. Boy Adrian was something else but we knew something wasn't right about her and to do a man like that you are what you are and she didn't have to bring Greg into her life like that, but his mother was a for real women and I'm glad the sister got her head on straight. You will enjoy this book I passed it on and everyone say the same thing I couldn't stop reading."
1,"It may have been predictable, but I couldn't put it down I dont care what was wrong with this book. If I couldn't put it down then that says a lot! I read the other reviews where people were disappointed and all that, but it takes work and commitment to even write a paragraph let alone a book. Camika, don't let those other comments hinder you because I've yet to read their work. YOur book did have flaws but who's book doesn't? All I can say is the book grabbed my attention and I had to finish it no matter what. That's the definition of a good book. I don't like sappy endings either and yours allowed me to come up with my own conclusions. I'm sure Random House is helping you with everything else. I'm forever in your corner because you've done what most of us only dream about."
1,"I laughed, got mad, cried and even screamed. This book was an emotional rollercoaster for me. I bought it and read it in 3 days. By the time I finished I was breathing hard and mad at Adrian. She knew better. Maybe she didn't. I need a sequel!"
1,"Poitier's best ""Lilies of the Field"" is a great movie. Even though it's in black and white, this movie puts the viewer right in the action. If you've attended Catholic school, you can really identify with the toughness of the German nuns. All characters are believable, and the acting is first rate. I heartily recommend this movie to anyone."
1,"Classic This is one of those movies every movie buff should see at least once. This is a feel good movie to watch when you feel life is being too tough on you. I always liked this movie, but it is surprisingly realistic since I met Helga, a 79yo Berliner visiting the States. Mother Superior is NO caricature, they really do come that way."
1,"Amazon order Would buy again from this seller. Item arrived quickly, and in condition described.Thanks so much!"
1,"A Heart-Tugging Look at the Value of One Man at Work A great movie. I don't understand why they don't show it more often. Sidney Poitier's character in this movie harkens back to his performance in ""To Sir with Love."" Also gives a nostalgic look at the American West. If you don't buy this excellent movie, make sure to rent it sometime. You'll enjoy it!"
1,"A really good movie This is a classic, great movie. It's one that is watchable on a repeat basis. Low key but very meaningful. The movie is in black and white but that actually seems to add to it in the same way that the H. Bogart movies 'Casablanca' and 'Sahara' effectively use that medium.The price is right. It's a keeper. Buy it and sit back and enjoy a great performance."
1,Lighthearted Comdey Good movie with comedy thats subtle and not forced or over the top like modern movies. I know most people will not focus on the humor of this movie but it's what I like about it.
1,"Ghost is Back Ghostface a.k.a Tony Starks a.k.a Pretty Tony a.k.a Ironman is back. Although he is with Def Jam now his style has not changed. He is still the real MC we all have come to know and luv. This is real hiphop right here, not your everyday average, Ice and bling type rap CD. All the beats are bangers (a 70's type feel) and the lyrics are straight fire from start to finish. This needs to be in heavy rotation this summer, since alot of people slept on BULLET PROOF WALLETS (another Ghostface album).Wake up cause real hiphop can not be denied.Put away your Nelly, Chingy, and CashMoney CD for a second and listen to this joint.Instant classic right along with Supreme Clientele (another hot Ghostface album)Since the face been revealed game got real for real"
1,"Classic Hip Hop in 2004!! I'm been rocking this one heavy rotation since it dropped.La, La, La, Holla- if you hear me!!!!Holla is one of my favorites, so are Beat the Clock, Biscuits,It's Over, & Be This Way. I really like it all except Missy's verse on Tush (just hit skip after Ghosts 2 verses)."
1,"The Ironman of Hip Hop! This album is the defifnition of a classic. All the elements are there. Tight beats, tight lyrics this is an excellent product. Ghost has elevated the game. Others rappers need to take notes. Get this joint!"
1,Ghostface is the most consistent in the game. Another hot one from the most consistent man in the Wu. Damn that! One of the most consistent in hip-hop period. Hasn't disappointed yet. And this is hip-hop you can feel. Not this old manufractured crap you see all over MTV every five minutes. Ya'll aint ready for Ghost. Keep it up man and tell the rest of the Wu to step it up. I still got love for them.Wu-Tang Forever babythetza
1,"Classic example of the genre I would have to agree with the other review in that this nearly 45 minute performance is flawless for the genre. No audience noises or any indication that it's live... which ranks it up there with any studio output from Main. Beautiful sounds that do more than drone, they lift you. The recording has many layers of guitar sounds that are typical of Main's output of treated guitar for gentle outer space travel. Excellent recording quality too. If you're thinking about getting this one, don't wait as they are out of print and supply is very low!"
1,Great book This book was in excellent condition. I love it. It is a little bit of history with good ideas for today.
1,"Common sense from years ago It is not a book, as such, just several wonderful hints that are great to see in this day and time."
1,"An excellent movie, deserves to be better known It just needs to be said that the movie is what you could expect of having a master, Hopper, playing a character by another, Highsmith, while directed by yet another, Wenders. If you already read Ripley's game, see the movie to find an amazing picture of that odd world depicted by Patricia Highsmith."
1,"Chopped Version of Last Hero In China I agree with Michael Van about the clipped version "" Deadly China Hero"" as I own ""Last Hero in China"" which is the movie in its orginal presentation and with Subtitles. This is actually, if placed in order of sequences by year, the Fourth ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series before OUATIC IV/V came out. Nonetheless, you have to watch this movie as it has, as usual, great martial art scenes. I own all but OUATIC IV and most of Jet Li's DVD's that are available. The 6th version of OUATIC is ""Once upon a Time in China and America"" also starring Jet Li. Though this may be the 4th Jet Li did as Wong Fei-Hung, you do not have to see the three previous OUATIC's. Order is not important with this version of Wong Fei-Hung but the tales of this Martial Artist (a real actual Chinese Hero) is. Get this DVD and try to get ""Last Hero in China"" also. In fact, get every Jet Li movie made. You will not be dissappointed. This man is our replacement for Bruce Lee."

1,"Hot Stuff! I bought this item and have been really happy with it! Having my coffee become lukewarm was a real pet peeve, but no more! Every sip is now just the perfect temperature... not hot enough to burn my tongue, but definitely hot, not warm. A caution... if you forget to put your cup on the warmer and your drink does cool down, the warmer is not hot enough to heat it up.Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer"
1,Perfect! Love it.... Now I can enjoy my entire cup of tea or coffee and take my time... Hot to the last drop!
1,"Very Very Good so far this is the best. Please don't expect this heater can heat up your coffee, this is only keep your coffee warm and stay the temperature around 60 to 70 degree."
1,Great item Just what I needed since I drink my coffee really slow and with this cup warmer it keeps my coffee warm to the last drop.
1,"AMAZING, WONDERFUL DEVICE! Sometimes it takes me forever to get to my coffee, and by then it's cold. Cold coffee sucks! So I microwave it 3-4 times a morning and it progressively tastes worse and worse. Well I tell you: it's all the microwave's fault! I just finished the last sip of a coffee that I poured over 6 hours ago, and it was just as warm and delicious as it was 5 hours and 50 minutes ago (see, I really am slow)! Now that I have my Mr Coffee warmer I am a happy, more efficient worker. I need to get another one for my home! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!"
1,Hot Coffee All Day Glad to have found this nifty little device. Works as advertised. Keeps your beverage hot without over-cooking it. I think this would work well with a big mug of soup as well. Can't tell you how many half-consumed mugs of coffee have been saved by this. It's great to pick up my mug an hour after I poured the coffee into it and take a hot swig.
1,"Great Coffee Warmer I bought one of these coffee warmers to keep my coffee warm at the office. It really does the job. Note you cannot pour cold coffee into a mug and expect this device to heat it -- that isn't the purpose. If you set your warm coffee on this heater, get up go get something out of the printer, get distracted talk to people, come back to your desk 15 min later your coffee will still be warm, maybe even hot depending on how hot it was when you poured it in there. I love it. I bought one for home too. The success of the coffee warmer is also dependent on your coffee mug. I find it works best with coffee mugs that have a large surface area at the bottom. I would definitely recommend this product -- I already have, I love it."
1,"Works Great This little warmer works great. It will not really heat a full cup of cold coffee, but it will keep hot coffee very hot, and will heat up a half cup of coffee very well."
1,AWESOME! I use this at work. Turn it on before you go to get your coffee in the breakroom. Best if the cup/coffee is already warm.
1,"I like it! I like this product enough to specifically turned my computer on to write a review. It worked better than expected and kept my beverage warm. It's a mug warmer so, no, it doesn't bring your beverages to a boil (I seem to have read complaints that it doesn't heat up their beverages, though that could be for a similar product.) I think my tea was actually a bit hotter than the original temperature when I pulled it out of the microwave and put it on the warmer. I am just very happy that my tea doesn't turn cold within 5-10 minutes."
1,"Hot Coffee This is the 4th mugwarmer that I have bought - still using the other 3 in different places. Had a hard time trying to find one in the stores, so I was thankful to find one on Amazon.com. I selected this one because it was a good price and seemed more substantial than the others. So far it works great - no complaints at all. My other mugwarmers are white. I like the black color because it seems to blend better with my nice wooden office desk. I would recommend it!"
1,"Mr Coffee you are a legend! I shipped this product to the southern most tip of Africa because nothing comparable was available locally.I fitted the power converter necessary to cater for our 220v, and I now have seriously hot coffee available 24/7.To even boost the heat retention more, I'm using an enamel cup with a lid to keep the heat in.Nothing compares.All in, the shipping + power converter cost more than the cup warmer, but it was worth every cent.Very happy customer.Tam"
1,Must have for the office! This has got to be one of the best office companions ever! It really does work! It does its job of keeping my coffee/tea warm. A very good buy and must have!
1,"coffee mug warmer Ok, so I never finished my coffee before I got this since it always got cold. (Nothing like cold java on a winter's day with the a/c on in the office.) So, I gave this gadget a shot. If you are a coffee sipper like me and don't gulp your coffee in 2 minutes, this is the perfect product for you. It keeps hot cocoa, coffee, and tea and even cup-a-soups at the perfect sipping temperature.The only drawback is that once you are almost done with your drink, you must remember to turn off the switch. Can't blame the manufacturer, though. I forgot to shut mine off and a couple of hours later, my half a cup of coffee became a shot of espresso. Not so yummy."
1,"GREAT GREAT GREAT! I finally found a cup warmer that actually keeps my coffee hot! I have a very narrow threshold of how hot I like my coffee (piping hot, if it gets even remotely cooler, I can't stand it). This unit keeps it at nearly the optimal temperature.To further optimize my coffee temperature control, I bought a Titanium coffee mug from REI (very thin with great heat transfer) for about 30$. This set-up is perfect. I can walk away from my desk for any amount of time and return to a perfectly hot cup!You do have to start with a hot cup of joe to begin with though."
1,"Love it for my desk at work I got this for my desk at work so I could nurse my coffee without it getting cold. I love it. My coffee stays warm, and I see no signs of burning/damage on the bottom of my mug. My dad uses one at night for his tea while watching TV. A great gadget, especially for people who are hard to shop for.UPDATE: I've had this item for a year and half. I use it about 3x a week, and it still works great."
1,Just what I needed at the office I wanted to cut down on the amount of coffee I drank and realized one of the main reasons why I top-off is because it cooled down. Once I got my mug warmer I can now happily sip my cup of coffee throughout the day and it keeps it at just the right temperature. Not blazingly hot but just under that. I've been using it 5 days a week 10 hours a day for 2 months and it has been a solid performer.
1,"This has made my dreams come true. I am constantly having to make trips to the microwave to heat up my tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. I'm a slow drinker, I can't help it. I don't like to gulp my drinks I like to enjoy them. Sometimes for over an hour! And I have high temperature standards. I like my beverages borderline scalding. That being said, I had doubts that this little gadget would keep my beverages HOT (not warm). It does a great job. Other reviewers are correct in that it will not reheat cold beverages but if you put them on the warmer when they are already hot enough to your liking, it will keep it that way for hours. Highly recommend for any slow drinkers out there. Should have gotten one years ago.Update: it's also useful for keeping a small teapot with tea in it warm for hours. I have a little ceramic tea pot that holds maybe 3 cups of liquid. If you make sure the tea is extra hot when you put it in the pot, it will stay pretty warm for a long time."
1,"Best of stays warmer coffee cup! Mr. Coffee had a very good warmer coffee on my mug cup. Before I bought it, I was usually my mug cup of coffee only warmer less than 10 min to become cold coffee, I was put it in a microwave to reheater mug cup then they went become cold after 15 mins. Now, I use a warmer heater which is stayed warmer till fill it up a coffee will stays warmer an hour, hour, hour forever is excellent it so much. I love it so much better than life without warmer."
1,"He Loves it! I gave it to my boss for Christmas, his coffee was always getting cold because he's too busy to drink it right away. Now he always has a hot, hot cup of coffee.He Loves it!Kathy"
1,"Why in the world isn't this writer/director world famous? This is a wonderful movie, and to think it is a debut film. Man. I had seen ""The Magdalene Sisters"" twice,and loved it so much that I looked up the director, found this movie, and ordered it on Netflix. It startsoff sort of slow, but gathers speed and intensity, and winds up a home run. This writer/director shouldbe working. His NOT working robs me of pleasure. Mr. Mullan, if ever you check these things (and I knowfamous people sometimes do), for the love of God get off your rump and get to work. If you drink stop. Ifyou drug it, stop. If you're just plain lazy, get some gumption. If you've been this good on your first twofilms, you could be a world-beater.Get back to work. Please. (And the actors are great, down to the tiniest part. Just dynamite stuff all around)."
1,"The accent rocks! This movie makes great audio. I can't wait for Scottish Independence so we can see kilts in the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony parade. But until then, England should include a Scottish audio option on all their movies and television program(me)s. This movie comes with English subtitles. The first part is reminiscent of After Hours and the ending is a peaceful one."
1,Thank you Jennifer! This was the first book by Jennifer Crusie that i have read and i just loved it. i had got hold of this book on a very 'bad day'. I was very depressed. it was not easy to make me laugh but this book did it. i laughed out loud... and it felt very good! As from now Crusie is my favorite romance writer. Thank you jennifer for writing this book!
1,"Magick for REAL people!!! This is a great book...It's filled with a hundred spells from various cultures, religions and traditions that work independent of any specific culture, religion or tradition. What's wonderful about it, is that Draja focuses on making magick PRACTICAL. How refreshing! A lot of the spells are simple to perform and require items that are easily available to most people. There are a few spells that i find to be rather peculiar or overly time-consuming, but they're an interesting read at the least. He provides practical spells for most of the situations that people encounter in their daily lives...money, health, jobs, luck, relationships, etc. He does have a slight paternal tone in telling people not to alter the spells, but i take that to simply be a guardrail for the novice magick user. It's a great little sourcebook for spells and as inspiration to help you create your own. Definately a ""must-have"" for me! =))"
1,"Definite ""thumbs up"" An excellent little collection of spells. Not wicca or CM, so if you're looking for those you might be more pleased with some other selection. But it's good solid folk magic, largely of a mixed African and European flavor.I wouldn't say the book is indispensable for the advanced or intermediate practitioner. It's largely addressed at the beginner. But it's a pleasant read, well organised, and contains more useful practical spells than most books on the market these days.I definitely class it as a good value, especially at the price."
1,Good deal Purchased this for my 2000 Windstar; price was about 40% cheaper than local parts store for same item. Have had no issues at all with this.
1,"Kare Kano RULES! This is one of the best animes, I believe, so far in the history of anime. Kareshi Kanojo No Jijou (His and Her Situation) [...] It opens with the begining ""warning"" music and then leads straight to the opening song. Then it has several tracks of BEAUTIFUL instrumental music. The next actual vocal song you hear is the ""S.O.S"" song. I think that's one of my favorites because of the situation they played it in on the show.(When Arima huged Miyazawa) KAWAII! Then you have more breath taking music. The next ""song"" is a song (dunno what it's called) about monsters that all of Miyazawa's new friends sing. My favorite part is when Tsubasa shouts out. I crack up every time I hear it! Then you have both versions of the ending theme song. But if you have a chance to get this CD, it's totally worth it! Not to mention the cover artwork is very cool. It features evrybody. *-* Ja'ne! ~Aya-chan"
1,This is a great little CD I was really pleased after purchasing this CD. Had heard Derryl in person a couple of times and thought he was good. His CD shows his versatility and there wasn't one tune I didn't love. He is also a great performer.
1,Fantastic combo of Rocksteady originals & U-Roy toasting This double CD is fantastic value. The second CD is the best rocksteady compilation I have heard so far: lots of Paragons classics. The first CD is about the best intro to U-Roy you could buy and as he is the granddaddy of DJ toasting a good place to start. As there are nearly 30 tracks on each disc this adds to the value. The only doubt you might have is that it can sometimes be a bit wearing to listen to a whole disc of a single DJ's toasting. But hey! You could play the rocksteady disc all day long and never tire of it!
1,"Sturdy Bench I am 6'1"". This bench is a very good fit. It feels sturdy and stable when lifting. There is a good span between the uprights to ensure your hands don't hit when replacing the bar. It was easy to assemble. I have decided to remove the leg lift, but it was not in the way. The padding is comfortable and seems durable. I would definitely recommend this bench for a daily workout."
1,"Great bench for the money I bought this bench for my husband as a gift. I'm pretty impressed with the sturdiness so far. It took me over 2 hours to assemble by myself and there were a couple errors in the instructions but nothing I couldn't figure out pretty easily. Overall, a fantastic bargain. He was thrilled."

1,"Yoko Kanno,you're the greatest!!! I just got to say that one of the reasons Macross Plus and Cowboy Bebop succeded were not only because they are great anime but because of their great music score.Yoko Kanno is a master in composing any great song.She uses an unique and unrealistic language in most of them though(That's the reason I like After in the Dark and Pulse so much,it's all about emotions)U just won't believe it till u finally listen to it.I haven't been able to buy it though,I can't find it anywhere(Amazon.com got it though ^^)but I'd listen to every single song on the internet and all of them are great."
1,Thanks Thank you for answering my questions and sending the product in a timely manner as it was described to me.
1,"Brink of time= best vgmusic i have ever heard The brink of time add on cd to the chrono trigger osv was better than the original itsself. The orchestration by yasunori mitsuda was simply amazing, he truly is a master of vgmusic. I would in all ways say he is equal to or better than N. Umetsu (final fantasy). This is a truly captivating cd."
1,"Best season yet! My daughter and I have been watching all the seasons together. After season 8, we were feeling done with the series but couldn't quite let go. Are we ever glad we didn't! This was an action packed season and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,"Great show This show lasted for 10 seasons! It was a little silly, but I believe that was intentional. Tom Welling will forever be my favorite Superman! He's the perfect choice. The package arrived on time and in good condition."
1,"Love it. Buy all seasons for $9.99 each and save about $50 compared to buying the ""complete collection"". Just search each season and look for the $9.99 version. It's the same as the complete collections, but cheaper."
1,"Smallville Rocks!!!!!!! The condition was awesome, the price definately nice and all the inserts were there. I would definately trust these guys as far as condition goes. Very timely shipping as well before the stated recieve date. Thanks!"
1,Great Customer Service! Amazon's customer service was beyond wonderful when contacted for this specific item. They worked with me to make sure I was treated fairly and to make sure I was happy. I will definitely continue to shop with Amazon for this particular reason!
1,birthday gift I am always satisfied with this show. I get a season every birthday and Christmas for my brother. Thankfully I'm almost to the end of the list. He really loves the extra footage and interviews.
1,"Wondertwin Powers... Activate! Awesome episode if you know who the wonder-twins are. They even had the monkey, mistakes, and really good intentions. I kept waiting for one of them to say how they wanted to be ""super friends"" with Clark or Chloe."
1,"<3 Smallville <3 I love my movie. I can't wait till I own the whole collection, which should be very very soon. You could say I'm Smallville obsessed."
1,Smallville I've got all of the Smaville seasons and have enjoyed them all. I'm disappointed that the show is ending. I like the characters and the plots.
1,"Golden Earrings One of the better WWII romantic movies, one of my 3 favorites. It has excitement, surprise, romance, mystery. Everything that makes a great war story!!! Miss Marlene & Mr. Ray are at their best!"
1,"Delightful! If you enjoy acting and song, this is a must! Marlene's superb acting delighted me through the whole movie. She was enchanting and endearing as this Gypsy character. The gravity of the war times was made easier to watch. If you've not seen this please do settle down for a very enjoyable fun time with these wonderful characters and music."
1,"Quick Delivery. Quality Replacement Part. The replacement battery cartridge arrived a day early, was in great condition, and contained APC batteries as described. As a busy Network Administrator, receiving the correct replacement part as described and a day early is the best case scenario. Thank you."
1,"Excellent music and movie The film has a nice flow and plot. The music is great. It is all geared toward the Italian familia. I love Cher, Nicholas Cage, and Olivia Dukacas in it. They gave great performances. I already loved La Boheme prior to seeing the movie and bought the CD of the movie soundtrack. Anyone wanting to see an enjoyable movie and listen to great music should put this high on your list. It is entertaining and holds your interest, unlike a lot of other movies. It used to be a 4-star movie and is now rated a 3-star movie - but a high 3-star. It is a classic that will be viewed over and over. The music of Puccini will live forever. Once you see the movie, the music flows from scene to scene in your mind.A must buy CD."
1,"Good experience I received this is great condition and early! No problems whatsoever. Also, the price was very reasonable. I would order from this vendor again."
1,Brilliant This is my 10th time screening this incredible movie and now I have the option of buying it in DVD. Bravo toCher and Norman Jewison and Ms. Dukakis
1,"Moonstruck is terrific Moonstruck is one of the best gems that's been on the screen---ever. Cher, Nick Cage, Danny Aiello, Olympia Dukakis all put in great performances in this Brooklyn romance, set in today's world, but timeless in it's tale of love. A true romantic comedy with some pricelss one liners in it. And all the time, the wonderful music of Puccini in the background. A must see. END"
1,"Sophistication Under The Moonlight Yes dear viewer, Moonstruck provides the most sophisticated elements of a good movie could offer. A great story, excellent performers and the fabulous music of Puccini. END"
1,"Humor and Melancholy and Surprise A full cycle of emotions while watching real artists deliver their craft. Cher is beautiful, humorous and devilish while themen in her life complicate it and compliment it."
1,"Struck by Moonstruck I am a Cher fan. Always was and always will be. That said, I haven't always been a fan of her movies. But this one regardless weather Cher is in it or not is a true classic in every way possible. I must have seen this movie 50 times over the last 12 years and still never tire of it. I use many a catch fraise often from the movie that have become part of my everyday language. This story reminds me of my childhood as I came from a typical Italian family and we all acted very much the same way and lived in the Jersey side of NY in a 3 story house with a view of the Hudson. This movie is dead on the character, the vibe and the humor! If you haven't seen Moonstruck, you don't know what you're missing. I might add, this is one of Nick Cages finest performances!Rich"
1,MOONSTRUCK This movie is funny and well written. If you like to laugh and love a love story buy this movie.
1,"Chao Bella... ""When you love 'em they drive you crazy because they know they can"" is just one of so many truthful, poignant, memorable lines from this intelligent, warm, grown-up story. This isn't just a movie, it's the tradition of story telling at it's finest. The music, settings, and characters tell such a fine, truthful tale, I swear I can smell the food in the kitchen, dining room, or restaurant - you'll see what I mean when you see the movie!"
1,"ONE OF MY FAVORITES I never grow tired of seeing this movie. I am not sureif it is because I am Italian and can relate to so many of the scenes and actions, or if it is the excellent acting that Cher,Nicolas Cage and the others put forth in their roles.A love story that grabs your attention from the first act and holds you glued to your seat throughout the movie.Tender, sweet and loving, yet tinted with such true to life raw emotions. Outstanding.This is one movie that no one should miss seeing! Excellent!"
1,"movie I am a Romantic at heart, love a good love story. Been a Cher fan since day one and she was on TV."
1,A hit with seniors I recently took a bus load of seniors on a bus trip. The trip was 3 hours long. We usually have a movie to show so the time goes faster. I picked Moonstruck. It was very funny and very light hearted. It was quite a hit. The seniors were mostly Italian and they really enjoyed the movie. Some of them missed it when it came out quite a few years ago. It's the first time they showed appreciation of a movie by clapping. I was very pleased.
1,"Perfect This is perhaps the most romantic movie I have ever seen. But don't let the word romantic turn you away-this movie is hilarious. There is something in this movie for everyone. Cher and Olympia are great and both deserved the Oscar. It's not full of fluff or trash-it's the perfect date movie.also reccomended: Moulin Rouge, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, About a Boy.*"
1,"A modern day classic ""Moonstruck"" is one of my all time favorite films. Frothy, romantic, and poignant, this film is one to watch over and over again. All of the characters are loveable and endearing. I feel like I am part of the Castarini family every time I watch it. The script is absolutely perfect. Every line is quotable. One of my favorites is Rita's wry, ""Cosmo can't OWN the moon!"" Puccini's gorgeous melodies from ""La Boheme"" make the perfect musical backdrop for this contemporary masterpiece. A gem!"
1,Lots of Fun to Read Growing up I heard a lot of folk tales about Paul Bunyan. I was very amused by those stories. This book puts them all together for me. Very enjoyable to read. Lots of fun in these pages.
1,The Holy Spirit DR. Graham brings The Holy Spirit alive. It is a easy read in a descriptive and understanding language.The book goes in to detail to explain how the Holy Spirit can be experienced in your life.

1,"No leaks for a big boy I've had a lot of trouble finding a paper diaper that fits my 29 1/2"" long, 23lb 7 month old boy, he's a wiggler, jumper, tosser, turner, and roller, but these seem to fit really well. We've had no poo up the back (even when he poo'd while jumping in his bouncer) and no leaks overnight, both of which were problems before. I haven't had any rashes from chemicals, dyes, or perfumes which was also a problem with other brands in the past."
1,"I LOVE Pampers Baby Dry I am the mother of 4 ranging in ages 1-16 and I have always used Pampers, they are the best. I have tried them all and none of them compare to Baby Dry. I don't have a problem with leaking, they don't tear easily, they have a nice sent, and they are affordable. What else could you ask for?"
1,"Great diapers! I really like these diapers! I had fewer leaks with these than with the Pampers Swaddlers, and while I like the contoured fit of the Huggies Pure and Natural, I loved the super absorbency of these. They hold a LOT! My baby is a heavy wetter, and we almost never have a leak with these. Even though they are not as stretchy, I find that they fit just fine compared to the Huggies, and for the price difference and absorbency, I would choose these."
1,Easy Purchase....Great Savings! Thanks to Amazon I no longer have to run to the store to get diapers they just show up on my doorstep! And the savings is great!
1,"Great Buy I have tried Huggies, Pampers and Loves, so far Pampers by far were the best, and for this price of only .17 cents per diaper its a Great Deal! I have priced around and didnt find a better deal for this size. Very Happy"
1,"great price and condition Just noticed I could buy open box pampers for cheaper, this arrived just the outside was opened, but who cares we any how dont keep the box, the pampers where closed in original package."
1,Pampers are the best disposable diapers While I prefer the cruisers it's really not a big deal because the baby dry work just as well they're just not as cute.
1,"excellent diapers It doesn't leak, stay dry for a long time, and above all, has a thinner layer that provides flexibility to my daughter's movement. Strongly recommend it."
1,"Love these! Great for my twins! We have 5-month old B/G twins. I love these diapers. They are thin, yet they protect very well. We haven't had diaper rash yet and will hopefully stay that way. But I do rinse them off almost every time they poop. We tried huggies and they just didn't hold up - too bulky and too many leaks. So go with these!"
1,"Pampers work! I find pampers work better for longer leaner babies, toddlers than for chunky babies. Less leakage. Huggies work better for chunky babies."
1,Very fast delivery and cheap! It was so fast delivery only for 3 days and with free shipping also without any tax.It's cheap then everywhere.
1,"I love pampers No leaks, no blow outs!! I also love them because it's easy to tell if she has wet or not, other brands are so thick it's kinda hard to tell."
1,"Good price when you subscribe Awesome value, better price than Costco SAMs club. We just subscribed using the trial feature and tried it out. Value buy, enjoy."
1,"Good for babies who move around I love pampers it's durable. I didn't like it when my baby was 2,3 months old because when he poops it leaks in the back. After he started sitting down and walking it is the perfect diaper for him"
1,"AWESOME overnight protection LOVE these diapers!! My 8 month old daughter was leaking through her diapers until we found these!!! No more wet sheets in the morning!!! AND, you CAN'T beat 222 diapers for 30 bucks!!! LOVE AmazonMom!!!"
1,"Great - Be sure to get a larger size! We think that these are great diapers. Virtually never have a blowout.What we learned is that the weight recommendation on the box should generally be ignored. The size 5 packaging says 27+ lbs. Our baby started wearing these at around 16-18 lbs.It's really very simple. When the diaper gets full, there's no more room...thus the blowout.With our first child (using the size/weight recommendations), blowouts and ruined clothing were a regular occurance. With our second child (ignoring the size weight recommendations), blowouts are a rarity."
1,"wonderful diapers great value, great diaper, my 21 month old daughter leaked in every other brand except PAMPERS, i love pampers brand, however i did have to buy a size 5 in the Pampers and in other brands she could wear a size 4 but i wont buy any other brand now."
1,Questions? I subscribed to getting diapers once a month. My question is how can I go in and change the size? My daughter is a size three now but will be in a four pretty soon.
1,"Good price gr8 shipping time Pampers is the best brand available as compared to others pampers is the best but buying pampers from amazon made my life easy.i dont have to rush to the stores to buy the same box with a higher price,and absolutely loved amazon when i saw the box delivered after 1 day."
1,"Best Diapers! This is absolutely the best way to get diapers. Auto ship: 2 boxes per month. In a science fair experiment at our elementary school a 3rd grade student compared Luvs, Huggies, a local store diaper, and Pampers. Pampers won out and this is one item that I stick to!"
1,"good product Good as diaper lasts long. Good during travel and keeps dry, no body rashes. Good for boys under 8 months."
1,"Love the product and the service! We couldn't be happier with the Pampers products in general. We've had some nasty ""messes"" on our hands and these keep everything well contained AND are thin for our little man to move around comfortably."
1,"No leaks, best diaper on the market! I've been using Pampers Baby Dry diapers ever since my daughter was born 2 years ago. These don't ever leak on us, and blow-outs non-existent. They feel soft and seem comfortable. I've heard about babies getting rashes with the Dry Max line, but these seem great for sensitive bottoms."
1,great service it was fast Service and cheap for the amount of diapers I can always pick Amazon for these kind of deliverys ......cool
1,good excellent experience with pampers. i always use pampers only to my son since his birth. pampers is a nice product
1,"Got what I expected Received the diapers as expected and had no issues. Ordering online was convenient and price was good too. Pampers Baby Dry feels soft. When wet the diapers feel very gel like, don't like that feeling though."
1,"Great deal on pampers We prefer Pampers diapers & these (at least at the time) were a great deal. No complaints. Don't think they last 12 hr though, but none do."
1,"Love these diapers!!! I've been trying different brands and so far Pampers baby -Dry are my favorite. They are soft, durable, last through the night without leaking, and overall, just very convenient. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,"i loved this item i loved this item but i gonna move out of the country , so i had to cancel. My baby never had problem with these diapers.thanks."
1,"Love these diapers These diapers have been my go to with both my children. They do not leak overnight, and do not cause any skin irritation like other diapers. If you are looking for a quality diaper, order Baby Dry diapers!"
1,"Cheapest I can find - even compared to the wholesale stores! Great product, arrives on time in a perfect box each time. Can't beat the great price!"
1,Great Product We use Pampers and this product was great for us! It arrived quickly as Amazon promised and was by far the best in affordability. Would recommend to a friend.
1,"""caterpillar"" flex tabs delivered by Amazon 5/07 Just for those worried (like I was) about getting old non-flextab diapers from ordering this product: I ordered a 160-pack, size 4, in May, and they were the newest version, not the old ones with non-flexible tabs."
1,"perfect diaper ive been purchasing diapers for years.these are perfect they are soft,absorb well even at night.they work better than the new cruisers.i have bought these and cruisers,the old ones worked well.the new ones leak everywhere especially infront.i have never had a poo leak from these diapers.unless your child has diarrhea there shouldnt be any leaks.these are also a better value than the cruisers."
1,"Best diapers! Best diapers ever! Believe me, with my two kids I tried a lot! Good leakage protection, thin (what is very good for summer)."
1,"Very Good Pampers diapers are the best diapers. I would not recommend any other brand of diapers. No matter what stage and/or size your child is, this brand works the best."
1,GREAT DIAPERS. I love them on my 14month baby she was using these before bit then started using pamper crusiers but they were a tad bit more expensive when these do the exact same thing. there great hold alot. PAMPERS ARE BETTER THAN HUGGIES.I TRIED THEM AND HAD A HORRIBLE EXPIERNCE. MY BABY WOULDNT HAVE THEM ON EVEN ON 20 MIN WHEN SHE WOULD BE LEAKING. THESE DIAPERS LAST HER GREAT ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT REAL FULL (: BUT NO LEAKING. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THEM
1,PAMPERS I only bought pampers because I heard they are the best.. however im rethinking that due to all the poop explosions my daughter has in them
1,Good quality diapers This is a good quality product. The leakage is almost none. We have been using it for quite some time now and are very satisfied.
1,"Pampers Baby Dry work for us! Pampers Baby Dry are the best diapers around for daytime use in my opinion. We tried many other kinds before and these were the only ones that would hold in all of my daughter's pee. Wish they were cheaper, but otherwise they're great!"
1,Deal on diapers Recieved diapers in a good time frame. Recieved deal with diapers on sale and no shipping.
1,"Great Diaper Diaper works great - my son is dry till morning. Thin diapers. Only bad is on two occasions, we have had the tape break on us ."
1,"great diaper pampers is the best! We tried other brand (maybe the no. 2 brand), but we came back to pampers and would not try any others."
1,I love this brand! I love using baby dry on my five month old.. they never leak and my baby sleep from 8pm and I dont change his paper until 5:30 am. I love that they fit just fine not to big not to small. I love these pampers so much that I usually buy a convenience pack instead of buying them separately on the store. I recommend this brand to any mommas out there. Plus they have gifts to grow~ you enter a code and you earn points and then you could buy stuff for free.
1,"Great diapers I don't know why people complain about these diapers vs the Pampers cruisers. the only time I have leaks with my 8 month old is when she has an excessively large BM....not that often, and Cruisers wouldn't do much better. When she was littler, I wasted my money buying the swaddlers line for my daughter. The truth is, she doesn't know that difference, and would rather have me put the savings toward her college education."
1,diapers and wipes Had no issues whatsoever and the products came as scheduled in great condition. Much better than driving to the store for diapers and wipes and here I am saving money. I wish I knew about this sooner!
1,Satisfied Love pampers and this is a great way to buy them. Price is great and I don't have to walk down the diaper isle every week!
1,great price and great product Great price. better than any other shops around here. Great product too.All my family and friends love this product as well.
1,"Awesome overnight diapers! To be honest, when I first read the box (when my son was a newborn), I thought to myself, why would I ever keep my baby in one diaper for 12 hours (ewwwwww!) but the second he began sleeping through the night, I figured it out (hah!).These diapers are great and we have never had a morning blow outs, despite our son sleeping 12+ hours a night and definitely releasing a lot of substance into the diaper during that time. Moreover, he tends to roll several times at night and gets up and plays actively in his crib for a while (before we realize he is up) and even so, with all the movement, bouncing and a full diaper, there haven't been any leaks.We've put him in other diapers overnight and he's blown through all of those."
1,Great diaper at a great price with Amazon subscribe and mom club Not much to say. They do what they are supposed to. Earlier we tried the discount diapers and they didn't fare too well. Dealing with a few blowouts and peeing through some diapers at night we came back to pampers. You really can tell the quality after using discount brands. I am sure others have the same feeling for other brands but Pampers works well for us. Awesome delivery and price with Amazon Mom and subscribe and save.
1,great These diapers are great for my 2 year old. We haven't had any leaking issues and they are much softer than the huggies she used to have.
1,"Diapers Cheaper than purchasing in the store. Comes to my house, and it is always a better price. What's not to love?"
1,pampers I love just being able to buy diapers for the month from Amazon and it saves me a lot of money and trips to the store.
1,Best there is..better than the new Cruisers Pampers Baby Dry have been our choice for our 2 year old since he outgrew the Swaddlers. We liked the old Cruisers too and we used to switch back and forth between cruisers and baby dry. But I'm not very fond of the new Dry Max Crusiers. So we have started using Pampers Baby Dry exclusively and have been very happy.
1,"love it I love this diapers. They can hold pretty good. And no rash ever. My baby is turning 6 months, only the first box of diapers I did not buy from Amazon. Good deal,A+"
1,The best! I have tried multiple diapers and these work the best. They have the best fit and are great for overnight sleepers.
1,a good choice It's a good choice. Help me to save some money.It's good enough to keep dry for about 5 hours or up and it's much cheaper than the rest of pampers.
1,"This was a prompt and cost effective answer for busy moms This was a great option for diapers.It easy, quick, and they come right to your door!"
1,"fast shipping. I notice so many people complain the shipping problems, I just want to tell my experience, I ordered it on 22,Oct,2004, and received on 27,Oct,2004. What a fast shipping!!!"
1,good choice I used a coupon 2$ off. good price. I look forward to better offer next time ro so. maybe... df
1,"I love Pampers Baby Dry Pampers Baby Dry diapers are amazing. They absorbe everything and do just what they say, stay dry. None of those little jelly beads like in other diapers. They hold up to their name. They also smell wonderful with that fresh baby powder scent. Thisa is a great purchase and a great deal."
1,diapers I save from .04 to.07 per diaper (depending on sizes I have autoshipped and mr mom deductions) as opposed to walmart's price. This adds up to a minimum savings of $7.68 per box up to well over $10 per box on smaller sizes. I have 3 in diapers.
1,Very Comfortabke for the little ones Pampers are the best for your little ones. The diaper absorb the moisture very well and keep kids skin dry. Surely recommend it.
1,They did what diapers do... What can I say...they performed their duties as expected. I like the Pampers diapers and will continue to use them.
1,"What a deal! I have tried many types of diapers on my five children and Pampers are by far my favorite! They provide the best leak proof coverage and are slim enough that people have thought my older kids were already potty trained. With 30% off through Amazon Mom, these diapers are even cheaper than Parent's Choice. And they are delivered straight to your door! You can't beat that!"
1,"Subscribe & Save Really Works!!! Love the Baby Dry diapers w/o dry max! Cruisers have the new dry max which broke my son's little bottom out with sore like blisters. Glad Pamper's is still making this on w/o dry max!Best part about his diaper box was the price! With subscribe and save program and signing up for amazon mom I will get 30% off diapers and free shipping. This price simply cannot be beat, even at membership clubs!Great job amazon! Diapering baby just got cheaper!"
1,Good one .. Quality as usual good .. very goodBest thing is cost - Lowest anywhere when you take advantage of 10$ off of 49$
1,"no issues here I have used pampers since my 10 month old was born. Initially I used the swaddles sensitive, which was great because they had the strip that changed colors when the baby is wet. But now I use the baby dry and have been very happy. Pampers came highly recommended to me, and I highly recommend them to other Moms!"
1,"Absolutely the best for my baby, but expensive After trying several brands only pampers are working for my baby since he has very sensitive skin.I wish they were cheaper but they are definitely the best!"
1,"The Best Diapers for our Munchkin We love these diapers. They keep our little munchkin very dry. At seven months, he's never had a diaper rash. He's been sleeping through the night since two months and ends up with some VERY wet diapers by morning. So to never have had a diaper rash, I am super impressed. As for ""blow-outs,"" I can't comment. Our poor little guy tends to be constipated... But as my sister would tell you, there may not be a diaper out there that can handle some babies' blow-outs.My only advice to parents that think these are too leaky is to try another size before switching. My son is so tall that he'll have to go up a size before the weight guidlines indicate they'll fit. We know it's time to go up a size when he does have lots of leaks."
1,"Very happy with Pampers Baby Dry We have tried a variety of different diapers on our newborn, and these are our favorite. Our baby has never had any issues with leaking or blow outs with these diapers, and they hold so much that we don't have to worry if he sleeps through the night. We definitely prefer these over the Huggies diapers, and I believe we even like them more than the Pampers Swaddlers."
1,"soft and very nice i love these diapers, also they are at a great price. they leak at night sometimes if the baby pees tons of times, which is very normal."
1,"Only disposable that's ever worked for us! I mostly use cloth diapers during the day, but for overnight and going out, I go with disposables. We're on our 3rd baby now, and over the years Pampers has been the ONLY disposable diaper that we can rely on! Have tried cheaper brands sometimes - they're cheaper for a reason! Pampers has consistently given us a diaper that we can count on not leaking. Store brands, Luvs, Huggies have all failed us multiple times, just leak really bad or tear easily. I am rarely brand-loyal, but Pampers is now the only brand of disposable I'll buy. Pampers is a good quality disposable for the times that you need it (I still recommend using mostly cloth and more natural products though!)"
1,"great diaper I have been ordering this for my baby girls. Once tried other brands, but never satisfied until using this one. This is a high quality diaper. Amazon is a great place for shopping diaper since it is free shipping."
1,Keeps Kids Dry We have 4 boys and all of them have used Pampers as they are the only ones that we have found that do not leak for them. The price is wonderful on here as well using Amazon Mom and Subscribe and Save.
1,"Excellent diaper I'm now a mom of twin boys and I have an older daughter. I like other diapers as well but for different reasons. I've used Pampers, Huggies, Babies R Us brand, Seventh Generation, Luvs, Target Brand, and many more.My daughter has always been a bit larger in the hip size and I recommend both the Pampers Baby dry and Huggies. Now, that she is older and almost potty trained we still use these in size 5 and they fit great and hold everything in. She can even put these diapers on all by herself! I like the fact that you can get size 5 for $.14 a piece via Subscribe and Save and using Amazon Mom for free shipping. This is the best deal!"
1,Baby Dry stays DRY overnight!! Pampaers is my go to diaper and the Baby Dry keeps my baby dry thru the night! Extremely pleased with the product and the pricing on Amazon Mom!!
1,"great price, quality and to the door service I have shopped around and this is the best deal for the top quality diapers out there. The time of the free delivery of the diapers from Amazon varies with my two orders. The first time it took a couples of weeks and the second time it arrived in a couple of days. So you should plan ahead to order these big package diapers. But in my opinion, it is well worth it!"
1,Love Pampers Diapers I love pampers diapers. we tried all brands including some store brands and these were by far my favorite. my child will always be a pampers baby
1,love Pampers baby dry is the only brand that works for my baby... them keep her dry and we have never had leaks!
1,"Great diapers I have been using these diapers for my daughter for almost a year now. They are excellent and I almost never have any issues with leakes. I use them both daytime and night. With Prime shipping, they are at my door so quick. Its very convenient, and the box lasts for a month!"
1,"convenience, convenience, convenience i love subscribe and save!!! i never buy diapers or wipes at the store anymore! and of course, great value!!!"
1,"Best diapers for us I haven't really strayed from Pampers since my son was born - each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand, they didn't work as well (tabs not restickable, not as absorbent, etc) and we went back to Pampers. I discovered Baby Dry because we were in Mexico and that was the type of Pampers they had in the Costco there - baby dry is great - they are thin and super absorbent. Amazon is the best place to buy them - especially if you use subscribe and save."
1,"Great Diapers for my Little Guy! This product is a good value, and Pampers Baby Dry work best for my son. They don't leak, despite the fact he is a super wetter, and I love the Caterpillar Flex sides. Cute Sesame Street designs as well."
1,Never disappointed My daughter is 2 years old and we have always used Panpers. I may spend a little bit more but it is worth it for no leaks - ever!
1,"AL We always love these diapers, they move well with our 14 month old and don't spill. The large pack makes the price per diaper significantly less, and with shipping right to your door who could ask for a better deal."
1,Fast shipment at a good price The convenience of ordering diapers and having them delivered free in two days (with Prime shipping) makes me doubt I'll ever go back to buying diapers at the store.
1,Great price!!! I always search for the cheapest name brand diapers and this is it!!! With the economy the way it is and the bigger the baby gets the less diapers you get this is great!!!! Affordable and they work great!!! I was using the cruisers but I needed to cut down my expenses so this helps some.
1,Pampers > Huggies We only buy Pampers because of multiple incidents with Huggies and blowouts. The Pampers just feel like better quality.
1,Great diapers! These diapers have great absorbency.I do not change her diaper in the middle of the night(she sleeps 11 hours)and there are no leaks and no diaper rashes.
1,love it my baby stays dry and happy all the time i only use pampers especially the 222 count which is a real value
1,Love pampers!! I am a mom to 7 kids with our 8th on the way. We have used pampers for years. We trust that they are the best and know from experience that it's worth the money. They are gentle on skin and leak proof! Don't waste time trying any other diapers I have tried them all and nothing compares to pampers quality!
1,awesome! I save a lot of money It is better to buy in bulk like this than the small one. I saved a lot of money and didn'y worry to run out of diaper anytime soon.
1,"Best diapers ever! Since our daughter was born, we used only Pampers diapers. They cost a little bit more than the ""generic"" ones, but you get what you pay for. They fit well and no liquid ever ""dripped-out"" of them. Go with Pampers and you cannot be wrong."
1,"Pampers are best Have tried all diapers. My boys leak out of all except these baby dry pampers, didn't try the cruisers since they are more expensive. It should say something since all the hospitals I work t use pampers. Swaddles are best for new babies and baby dry from then on out. Amazon has great prices. Love when you have amazon mom and the extra coupon from parenting magazine"
1,"super light I just got these, they are super thin, but seem to hold alot! I like how light weight they are."
1,Baby Dry is the Best! I bought a bag of these at the store because they were on sale and used it. It is the best diaper ever! I started using it when my baby was 8 weeks old and she slept for 8 hours! Prior to that we were using the Swaddlers and they were getting soaked after just 4-5 hours. Our baby is almost 11 weeks old now and she's sleeping 11 hours a night and these diapers lasts her that long. These are the best. I have ordered more and will swear by these diapers now!
1,"Pampers Baby Dry Newborn Size These work great, I have been using them for my baby boy who was born 7 lbs and is now 10 lbs. The only time we have leaks is when we dont change him at every feeding.The only drawback of these pampers is they dont have the wetness strip. That being said after 2 months of diaper changes I can tell without the strip when he is wet."
1,"diapers I bought the pampers brand due to the deal you get thru amazon, and Im happy with them. This is my first baby, so I really do not know much about diapers, they keep everything in most of the time. I swear she shoots stuff sideways sometimes so it leaks thru her legs but I dont think thats the diapers fault! lol A diaper is a diaper I think!"
1,Jessica B. very good product! good price for the amount too when compared to the stores. this products ships in a short amount of time too.
1,Great Diapers The baby dry diapers are great. My daughter has been using them since she was 3 months old (now 15 months) and has never had any rashs or leaks in them. I will not be ordering these from Amazon anymore. They have changed the discount on the MOM program so that it's not worth it anymore.
1,"Pampers purchase on Amazon I have used pampers for my son ever since he has been born. Great product and I love the rewards program they have as well.I always buy my Pampers through Amazon, I have yet to find them cheaper (even at Sam's Club). I also love the easy of having them sent right to my door."
1,Pampers Are the Best Hands down pampers are the best diapers. Never had a problem with leaking or skin breakdown on my baby.
1,"pampers are the best these are much better then huggies , first off huggies run smaller, they dont hold as much for as long eaither, the design seems nice but the over all quality is good just isnt as good in my option for the price dif. ,"
1,"Best diapers we've used! We've tried Costco's diapers and to a limited extent, Huggies... From our experience, Baby Dry are the best at catching leaks and offer the most value."
1,"It does the job! The main thing with diapers is that you want to get a great deal, and this was one of the best ones we saw. Very pleased."
1,A Pampers Household We love Pampers. They are all we use in our house. I can trust that they will make it through long nights and keep my baby from getting diaper rashes. Love them!
1,"Well worth $1 I needed a copy of ""Leaves of Grass"" that includes the 1855 prose preface. The formatting of this Kindle book is perfect. I know I could read it on my computer for free on some websites, but I wanted a version for my Kindle. This Kindle edition will not disappoint you! I gladly paid $1 for a more ""portable"" option. I prefer reading on Kindle than the computer screen."
1,nice This is a good app that works well with the system and we have had no problems with this app so far.
1,"Love it Love it....Love it! I have been trying to find the book, but I guess an electronic copy works better since I will forever own it on my kindle!"
1,"Review of Walt Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"" This thick soft-backed ""pocket"" book has 490 pages. It could be called The Complete Whitman. It contains hundreds of poems.I am a senior citizen who had not read any Whitman for more than 50 years and am enjoying it very much. His descriptions of the 19th century's people, places, and inventions are eye-openers. He was actually a feminist before there was such a concept, and also an abolitionist. He truly believed in equality and democracy. He was a nature lover and wanted to protect the environment.Of course, there are parts I could quibble about, but that would be foolish. Whitman was a man ahead of his time."
1,"A ""MUST READ"" (or re-read) This beautifully told story belongs in every library, and then....lend it out as often as possible! It's a ""classic"" of the ""Holden Caulfield genre, and although I don't know, I'd imagine it's now, or has been, studied in High School English/writing programs."
1,"This movie grew on me. After first watching this movie years ago I thought just another John Wayne ""B"" movie. The more I watched it, the more I realize it was a very good story and very well acted."
1,"Absolutely breathtaking! Several vignettes of various lives taken from a seemingly magical summer eve in a masterfully described Finland countryside. This ain't no ordinary prose! While reading this book, I experienced emotions usually felt while listening to my favorite music, looking at a desert sunset or drinking a fine nut-brown ale. The words jump off the page, straight into your mind and create the most vivid, colourful images imaginable. Track down a copy of this book, it's definately a masterpiece!"
1,"Samsung comes through again. Sure its a more expensive product, compared to other comparable, or supposedly comparable products, however, you get what you pay for. In this era of mass everything and relatively shoddy quality it is good to see that Samsung, at least from my experience, walks the talk in product quality.Very good viewing, very good set up, no problems, no drama, ahhhhhh, the price of luxury i guess!"
1,"A Powerful Tale on Life, Friendship and Tragedy If you're a comics buff who's only into superheros or manga or whatever popular subjects featured in mainstream comics, this book is probably not for you, regardless of the glowing reviews here. Otherwise ... read on.I utterly enjoyed the book. The story is so intense, yet the illustration is minimalistic and poetic. Because of the frugal use of text, I had to revisit some pages just to interpret what exactly happened. But I'm telling you - less is more! The book has the rare quality and artistic appeal of a Criterion Collection classic film. It also reminded me of Art Spiegelman's Maus. If Maus has been studied in schools, Hey Wait should be, too. I hope, through word of mouth, this book as well as others by Jason will get more attention in the States."
1,wow it really does help... alot this stuff has really extended the life of my skate shoes... and it also has worked to repair some old slippers that had come apart. this is great buy for any skater for sure.
1,"Great Product with a Short Shelf Life This is a terrific item to keep just about any sensible shoe and sandal bottom from wearing out too quickly. I've had great success with it.Unless you are going to doctor-up a lot of needy shoes, athletic ones in particular, at one time, buy the smaller Shoe Goo size. Shoe Goo stored over an extended period of time loses most of its potency."
1,"Shoe Goo Review :) Great product! When my sneakers start to lose their soles, I reach for the Shoe Goo. Makes a permanent repair that stays flexible. Saves me from buying an expensive new pair of sneaks."
1,Very good product! I bought this goo for my son to repair his skating shoes; his shoes get damaged quite often. He used it to repair one pair and it did its job!!! He's happy!
1,"Fantastic shoe repair My entire family has used this product since the seventies, and it is JUST AS GREAT as it originally was. You can repair shoe soles for your favorite running shoes, slippers, any rubber-soled shoes. You can put rubber on the bottoms of walking canes for stage, real life, etc. This is like rubber cement repair, only one hundred times better. Do you get the picture?"
1,"Interesting for the stories if not the recipes! I bought this for my daughter as a gift, but when it arrived, I had a hard time parting with it!I especially enjoyed all the history in the book, very facinating, and have made quite a few recipes from it, all turning out wonderfully.Beautiful coffee table book as well."
1,Such a great album This is just such a classic album. Aloe Blacc finds the right mix of electro-funk and classic hip-hop to make an album diverse in sound. Highly recommended from a hip-hop head.
1,Very interesting This book has informed me of things I have never known. I watch a lot of crime shows but Mark and John go behind the scenes and explain how the actual process works. The difficulties of solving a crime and making sure you have the right person. Very interesting read. Could not put it down.
1,"Douglas and Olshaker Kick Ass Again This is a great book that any person interested in psychology should have. I know detectives and psychologists who delight in the interesting way that Douglas makes the wisdom of the FBI available to readers. The United States has spent millions of dollars in researching the psychology of criminal behavior, so it should be of no surprize that so much quality information exists. Douglas and Olshaker are doing an excellent job at disseminating this information in a fascinating way. Researchers in other human behaviors should take note of the massive work done by the United States into the criminal mind."
1,Great Book! One of the best books I've ever read and everyone should read it to clear up any misconceptions they have regarding any of the cases mentioned in the book. I refer to it often when one of the cases pops back into the news or I hear a new theory regarding any of the cases.
1,"At last! After so many years... This album was originally relased on Virgin records about 1976 and it was playing all over London for about a year. Delroy was working as Bob Marley's road manager at the time. The backing band ISUS consisted of the solid drum and bass from what later became ASWAD. First time I ever went into a studio in London - I was 16 and it was with Delroy who was recording with The Cimmarons a song called ""Walking Down Lonely Street"" :o) - that was 30 years ago! Anyway - I just ordered this and it's worth it for the first track alone called ""Jah Wonderful"" - a tune that stuck in my head to this day. Delroy! Those were the days!"
1,"A cult classic of a song This song has the whole package. It's catchy, fun and infectious. The type of song that everyone is listening to. Cassie definately has enough potential to go far in the music industry."
1,Simply amazing This book was advertised as used. I don't know what they used it for but it had never been opened. I'm finding it to be very useful as a guide on how to fully use a table saw. The drawing are excellent and the jigs that I've made so far actually work.
1,"A FABULOUS ACOUSTIC TRIP AROUND THE WORLD YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY ""ACOUSTIC JOURNEY"". IT TAKES YOU ON A MUSICAL TRIP TO DIVERSE PLACES AROUND THE WORLD AND DELIVERS A MASTERFUL INTERPRETATION OF EACH WORK AS THOUGH IT WERE HIS OWN. MY FAVORITE TUNE ON THE CD IS ""BLUE CHILI"" AND DIMITRI'S TANGO. ""BLUE CHILI"" IS LIKE A SLOW BLUES JAM WITH SOME JAZZY STUFF THROWN IN AS WELL AS SOME ROCK N ROLL RIFFS. ""TANGO EN PARAISO"" IS A WONDERFUL TROPICAL GROOVE THAT MAKES ME WANT TO ORDER A PINA COLADA AND SIT OUT BY THE POOL. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO JUST DIGS GOOD MUSIC."
1,"very pleased bride I loved the dress! Ive orderd the dress on two seperate times. The first time I orderd it was to see about the sizes, because I read in the reviews that some people felt it was too big/small. I found that the dress really runs true-to-size. Then I orderd the rest of the dresses for my bridesmaids. The dress is made really well, and will hold up. You dont have to worry about it loosing its shape on the bust area because it has parallel stays. Also it is fitted thru the natural natural waist, so again we didnt worry about the other measurments. Honestly I have seen the dress in bridal stores for twice the price, and im glad that I didnt pay the extra price!! The shipping from PacifiPlex was awesome as well. It tells you to expect it in a week or so, and both times it has shown up in under three days!"
1,"Beautiful bridesmaid dress Big thank you to the seller for a very beautiful bridesmaids dresses! The price was reasonable, delivery very quick and customer service was excellent. My bridesmaids will look absolutely beautiful in those dresses next spring at my wedding!"
1,"GREAT bridesmaids dress! I bought this dress in royal blue at a little shop in the mall for $90. I had a TON of compliments on it during the wedding and felt like I looked great. Because of the boning in the top and flare out bottom, I didn't feel like I needed any kind of girdle or nylons to control my tummy or rear. I just found this dress an Amazon for $40 cheaper and I since I already know how great it is, I am going to buy it again in black for another wedding I am in later this year! TIP: I would recommend buying one size down from the size suggested on the sizing chart. According to my measurements, I should wear an XL but the L fit me just perfectly with a 38"" bust and 31"" waist."
1,"Bridesmaid dress on a budget!!! The dress is for my bridesmaids and the style is perfect for a back yard wedding. The satin look doesn't make it look cheap. And the price fits in the budget of all bridesmaids; some in college, just bought a house or have multiple people in my bridal party. I had been looking at some Alfred Angelo dresses in the 148-190 price range.There is only one minor set back. For my wedding design I wanted to replace the bow and ribbon with one of another color and there is no easy wash of removing just that ribbon, it's sewn in through all layers around the zipper. But we found a solution without taking the whole dress apart. We are going to attach the new ribbon to the one already there in the back. (Just in case someone else has the same idea).Overall very worth it!!!!!"
1,"A Pocketful of Promises for Women I bought this delightful book for my wife, who planned to pass it along to a group of her friends who share special books among themselves. It was so good, I read it myself! And I found it to be spiritually uplifting. Highly recommended!"
1,Inspirational Message The word of God set to music. An inspirational message in every song. Lift your spirits.
1,"Wonderful duel I recomend everybody to purchase this film. I am admirer of these both great english actors. The movie is full of surprises that take place in a aristocratic english cottage. An amazing garden full of statues is were the movie begin. Inside the cottage there is a world of fantasy with puppets moving everywhere, that seem watch impassive the duel between the two only characters of the film. I do not miss any other actor in the movie, they both are enough. Only great actors as them can get it. John Addison's score is as elegant and playful as the film requires."
1,"Sleuth the movie Sleuth is a 2 person movie with Sir Lawrence Olivier, and Michael Caine that treats the viewer to a twisting story of ingrigue and humor and suspense, a cat n mouse drama that is well worth owning"
1,"Perfect Just exactly what we were looking for, the fact that this item can be moved to size I am 100% pleased. This got the job done"
1,"A serious masterpiece The other reviews are good. Trouble right now is that the DVD is becoming unavailable. This import is spoken in English, don't worry, and subtitles can be turned off. It's the full wide screen. The end credits are cut short before the music stops, which spoils that mood, but not ""in the middle of the credits"".

Joel Fotinos, a VP at Penguin Group, narrates this fine audiobook offering the blueprint for Napoleon Hill's wealth strategy to listeners who would understand 'cosmic habitforce', sharing wealth, and more. It's an outstanding guide to wealth-building and riches and is especially lively in audio format, perfect for listening in the car and for any lending library general or business!"

1,Did the job. Needed to add a front license plate following my relocation to Texas. This little item solved the problem. Installation was less than five minutes.
1,"It truly is BEAUTIFUL! Perhaps the Beautiful South's best-known collection of tunes, ""0898"" carries their signature stylings of rhythm, melody, and groove. From classics heard everywhere on the radio like ""Old Red Eyes Is Back"" to the more eclectic ""We Are Each Other,"" this album lets listeners slide in and enjoy some great music while the catchy and poignant lyrics beat a path through their brains. ""0898"" is a wonderful CD to pop in on road trips, on lazy summer afternoons, or after a long day on the job--it will soothe your frazzled nerves and let your mind wander through landscapes of vivid imagery and imagination. Check out their other work for even more entertainment and endearment...you'll be hooked! =) Simply put, this album is BEAUTIFUL!"
1,"also my favourite cd Today I bought this cd again, since I only had it on tape, and it broke the other day. I never cease to be amazed by the genius of this album, everything feels right about, and such a richness of sounds.. it will probably never show up in official lists with ""top 100 of all time"", but it has made and will stay my number one.. its great for in the car, when exercising, at home.. everywhere, sheer bliss"
1,"Excellent price and excelllent shoe! Stride Rite's are good shoes and these are priced so low. I don't know why and I won't ask. When I got them, they were nice (looked just like the picture) with a square toe. The size is right on, they are cushy inside, and the bottom is not slippery. My toddler likes wearing them even when he does not have too."
1,"What more could you ask for? I bought ""Buddy Guy & Junior Wells Play the Blues abum"" when it first hit the rack.Then again about a month ago. It had the same effect as it did back then...I put it in the cd player, sat down and didn't get up until I'd heard every song on the cd.It is Buddy Guy and Junior at their very best.Rickey Noel Mitchell"

1,"great reference book Lots of information I refer back to it often! Really like this book a lot, has become one of my favorites."
1,"Great Guide I really love this book. I began reading it the first day I got it. I am happy I purchased the book, because this gives me a great explanation on when and when not to perform spells. This has everything I was looking for. I wish this was a larger hardback book with more illustrations of the moon's phases. I use this book in combination with other spell books. I would recommend this to all who are new to crafting. I hope to find more books similar to this."
1,"A must see How could you not love this movie? It has Lena Horne, and Cab Calloway just to name a few amazing artists. The music numbers blend seamlessly with the story line. This is a star studded cast of anyone that was anyone back in the day. Incredible, I still love it to this day. I have seen it more times than I can count. It is neat to see all of my favorite people back when they were young. Way cool."
1,Good Entertainment! This is another one of those old movies that I had to watch more than once to appreciate. This is largely because of the singing and dancing in the film. At times it was too much and at times it was awesome. Before watching this film I'd never seen Cab Calloway perform or watched a whole film with Lena Horne in it. Both entertainers did a great job. If you're interested in classy entertainment from early black actors this is the film to watch.
1,"Great sequel! If you liked Patton, then you will need to get this DVD to show how his remarkable life ended. A great addition to your WWII collection."
1,"Bruce Didn't Invent Happiness, 'Just Made It Easy to Find This tape can be the key to opening up a whole new happy life for anyone who wants it. That is exactly what it did for me when I learned the Option Method 17 years ago. On this great intro to the Option Method, Bruce DiMarsico dispells the mystique around unhappiness by exposing the notion that the experience of unhappiness is always based on what someone believes... often erroneously. Questioning the belief(or judgement or assumption) can effectively vaporize the unhappy conclussion. Hearing one of Bruce's original lectures on Option rekindles the fire in me to spread the word to other happiness-seekers. Do yourself a favor... get this tape and let yourself out of YOUR prison of unhappiness. If I can do it, anyone can!"
1,"A Truly Helpful Way To Be Happier Now! This timeless tape is filled with humor, wisdom and wonderful liberating questions to help you get to the real cause of your emotional pain and self-limitation. I had the life-changing privilege of studying with this inspiring teacher in the early 1970's, followed by the joy of teaching others how to change their unhappy belief systems for over 30 years. I cannot imagine what my life would be like had I not had that opportunity, so I am especially glad that everyone can now hear these simple, powerful ideas from the man who originated the Option Method, himself, Bruce Di Marsico."

1,"Swept away to France If you liked Salvador's"" Chambre Avec Vue"" you will love this. If you don't know Salvador imagine a male combination of Astrud Gilberto, Blossom Dearie, and Jane Birkin. I dont know of a male contender for his soft minimal jazz voice except perhaps Jo Gilberto. The song selection is all French ballads, played and sung with a quiet jazz, simple, sort of bossa nova delivery. No French marching songs, clever novelty songs, or over-the -top Piaf theatrics; strictly light, fresh, crisp and airy as a nice bottle of Chablis. Romantic music, not especially for having sex, more for sitting beside your lover and listening. During the week of the recent bombings in America I listened to this CD almost constantly. It was very reassuring that, yes, there is beauty and love in the world."

It will sit in amongst the cd's that I even now listen to on a regular basis from many different decades.Classics never age.
1,"AMAZING I love this album and I love Laura Shay!! This album takes me back to 2006 when I was young and in love..this album is my soundtrack for that year! Whenever I listen to a song I get goosebumps as I'm reminded of those sweet times!! I highly recommend this not because I have so many fond memories but because it is a beautiful work of art. The lyrics, the music, it is one word which is amazing."
1,"Great for the Serious Pie/Pastry Baker I bought this book because I loved Rose's Bread Bible and I wanted to make really good pies and pastries. Before using this book I had not had a lot of experience making pies, I had made a couple apple pies and pumpkin pies, but they were all kind of blah. Not anymore!! Even with my little experience Rose transformed me into an awesome pie baker!! After I made my first pie from the Pie Bible, people were telling me it was the best pie they had ever had in their life! Now, I have to warn you, her pies do take a while to make. In many cases it's an all day (or multiple days) affair. However, I promise you, if you diligently follow her instructions, the results will be worth it!"
1,"The perfect companion to The Cake Bible Just when I thought that The Cake Bible was the ultimate culinary experience, Rose Levy Beranbaum strikes again. I just bought a copy for my mother who taught me to love and bake my own pies from scratch. She lays it all out for you, step by step, and never leaves you hanging. Not only are there wonderful decadent recipies for pies of all kinds, but also for savory breads as well. How do I feel about this book? To paraphase a famous saying -- you can have my Pastry Bible when you pry it from my cold dead fingers!"
1,"Be an Instant Pastry Chef!! I have used this book on several special occassions. I don't even have to do a trial run before I present the final dessert, because I am confident that every recipe in this book will turn out just as promised. Easy to follow instructions, and ingredients that you find at your local grocery store---what could be better! By using Rose's recipe book, I have become the automatic dessert maker in my family....especially when it comes to pies."
1,"Real Treasure The book is a real treasure to any baker: all the details, all the step-by-step, it gives confidence and explains the secrets of pastry. I just love it!"

1,"A pail of oysters. [Hardcover] Vern. SNEIDER This is a fictional story, but the tale might as well be real to a Taiwanese. The story starts in near Lukang when KMT soldiers steal the god from a family and he is sent to bring it back. Much of the story focuses around an American newsman stationed in Taipei and how he learns Nationalist Taiwan is not what it seems. The true story behind the fiction is that Sneider met Ed Paine, an eye witness to the 228 massacre and Paine hooked Sneider up with his interpreter. The history is fuzzy, the places are not where they should be, but the story is more an allegory of 50's Taipei with the dreaded race track and deaths. This book is now considered rare following years of KMT student spies stealing it from libraries. --not my review, but Maowang from Forumosa"

1,"Amazingly ... amazing. When i read this book for a class project i was amazed with it when i realized it was written in 1962. I read it several times as it is not the most easy of reading , but once i did so i thought it was maybe written in the eighties with a backward-looking viewpoint. When i learned the actual date of publishing... i was stupified. Must read for any of Bucky's fans."
1,This CD is really nice to listen to and it soothes the soul! I listened to the CD one time with my mom and then I couldn't stop listening to it. My favorite song is Friendness!!
1,"The Santanic Mill The Satanic Mill by Otfried Preussler is a great book to read. It is about a begger boy called Krabat who gets called to a mill in a dream. The mill is also a Black School. He met a female singer, and they both fell in love. Krabat wanted to leave the mill, but to do that the Singer (the book did not give her name) had to pick him out while he and all the other miller's men were in the form of ravens.This book is very creepy, mysrerious, and unpredictable which, I think, is great. There are several things to focus on, so it doesn't get boring. It's very nervewracking, too. All in all, it is one of the best books I have ever read. I give it a five-star rating."
1,"The German historical experience with the Nazis told as a folk tale Ottfried Preussler, a German WW II veteran, wrote about his book: My Krabat tells [...] my personal story, the story of my generation and the story of all young people who get in touch with power and its temptations and who become entangled.""The story is based on an old wendish (west slavic) tale of which it takes over only a small part but is also a parable on totalitarian systems, how they are run by means of force and seduction and how the individuals can get away.It is interesting to see that the miller is described not only as the demonic master (which he is) but later on also as a human slave to the haunting journeyman and thus serves only as a cog in the wheel in the evil system."
1,"A bit more durable than Gates I purchased this as a replacement for my E-powered MTB. I had a Gates belt before and it stretch out pretty quick. It didn't break, but the stretching bothered me. I installed this Goodyear belt and am able to push more power through the belt without me having to keep adjusting the tension."
1,"Ian Richardson version of The Hound of the Baskervilles I highly recommend this 1983 version of the Sherlock Holmes mystery. Richardson suits the role of Holmes very well, bringing a confidence and intellectual flare to solving the case.I can't be critical of much in this movie. I enjoyed it immensely on vhs and now, again, on dvd. It's well acted, well scripted, and well produced. I think Ian Richardson is my favourite Sherlock Holmes - although I don't think he played the role as many times as other actors. Again, he brings such confidence in his ability, that as a viewer you don't really think he's not going to solve the mystery.Thumbs up. Enjoy."
1,"Moving, enlightening, mysterious, and for the serious only This session begins with the shimmering peal of a gong, and you enter into the somber, mysterious and intense world of 1964 John Coltrane. ""Love Supreme"", a poem of great tonal color and emotion, hailed Coltrane's religious awakening and a new period in which he embarked on a mission to uplift people. Prior to the recording of this album, Coltrane's faith was tested by the bombing of a black church in Alabama, and the death of Eric Dolphy and the tumult of the 1960s---civil rights, change, new music, new worlds. All of Coltrane's recorded work from ""Love Supreme"" forward was groundbreaking on every level. This is not for listeners who are new to Coltrane, or those who wish to hear the mainstream Coltrane of the Prestige and ""Blue Train"" period. This is for the more serious listener seeking a different and more challenging experience with sound, and with history."
1,"Trane was spiritual... The negative reviews are from people with poor taste and poor ears. As for the review in 'trying-to-write-Ebonics' -titled ""What's the hype, dog?"" by some idiot from Garden City, MI United States - white guys fronting as black guys is very easily discerned by the knowing. Know that, playa-hatin' white boy!Now - to the album. This is very pure music that comes undiluted from the soul of a highly evolved and empathetic human being - who knows the depths and ecstasies of the human soul - and who has the genius to express every shade of his gigantic wisdom and understanding.You don't need to look up a jazz encyclopaedia and throw words around to understand this - people who do that are usually trying to show off because they lack soul.A healer plays these sounds - a medicine man. Coltrane is truly a Bodhisattva."
1,"A study in spiritual ecstacy. For all those seeking the ultimate jazz experience this is THE album. Man seeks for meaning by finding the beautiful aesthetic. Coletrane has helped all of us to find that moment and to think the moment was recorded. A Love Supreme stands right at the border between beauty and chaos. While many later avant garde works and even the later works of Coletrane run past that border and become difficult to listen to, A Love Supreme remains in the realm where the listener is allowed to enter the experience of the artist. A Love Supreme is the ultimate jazz album THE CLASSIC!!"
1,"Classic Coltrane John Coltrane's expressionistic existentialist masterpiece is released in a superbly remastered edition with essential additional material. This album is the turning point for Coltrane, away from his past material that was closer to hard bop and into the realms of free jazz. This was just before he picked up the atonalities that would be trademark of his later recordings but gives the listener a chance of what is to come. Spiritually rich and expressionistic, it is one jazz's greatest albums. If you own the original album, it is worth the purchase for the additional disc. Outtakes of the album with Archie Shepp included, it also has a full length concert of the only time the album was performed publicly. By this time, Coltrane had picked up the dissonance of his later albums and to some listeners will be less satisfying but for those who appreciate Coltrane in all his complexity,is well appreciated. Highly recommended."
1,"STIMULATING/STARTLING MUSIC I enjoy jazz...I'm far from thoroughly versed in the style though; I have a few key discs in my collection, that's it. A Love Supreme is one of them. A lot of good music sets a mood, but Coltrane's disc really talks...it's amazing. Where some musicians can hint at an idea, Coltrane rattles off a spiritual epic. If you're looking to add some stimulating, startling jazz to your collection (we're not talking Kenny G here...), this is your disc."
1,"The Pinnacle of Modal Jazz John Coltrane is at his best on this recording. Some people dislike it because they believe it is excessively serious, but to me it is deeply emotional and even joyful. It really takes an open mind (and concentration) to enjoy this CD properly, but it will more than reward the listener for the energy he expends.Musically, it would be absurd to attack this recording; the writing, improvisation, and interaction are flawless.One word of warning: If you are someone who listens to music for simple entertainment or background, this is not the CD for you. Listening to this CD in the background would be like reading yourself to sleep with James Joyce's ""Ulysses"".It really boils down to how you see music. Some people just don't think of music as being a deeply expressive artistic outlet, and that's fine - but they won't enjoy this CD."
1,"TRANE!!!!!!!! All that needs to be said about ""A Love Supreme"" is --- BUY IT! If this disc is not in your collection, you are missing out on one of the most vital pieces of music ever recorded. No matter what your musical tastes are, I guarantee you will find something of interest in Trane's visceral and evocative performance. A classic of sheer beauty and emotion. Peace."
1,"It sounds great, and ... ... I wonder how much the awesome result is due to the Rudy Van gelder re-mastering process rather than to the DSD-SACD new teach. I wonder sometimes if the music major are trying to sell us the n-th remastering and try to make us re-buy our music collection again and again. It would also be nice to compare the same re-mastering hi-rez DVD-A and DSD-SACD.BTW I am astonished how much better it is compared to my vynil (I did not buy the red-book CD waiting for a hi-rez re-issue :-) )5 stars to the music (I'd vote 6 starts if possible ...) and 5 stars to the sound"
1,"master takes john coltrane----LONG winded---from the first ""breath"" of this swAn song we all know as "" a love supreme""safe playing taken to exremes----maybe the best Long composition in jAzz ma tazzthe live stuff just hits hard"
1,"TRUELY A ""CLASSIC"" John Coltrane was truely ahead of his time! Vacuum tubes were still the state of the art when this album came out! Yet, the Fidelity is pretty amazing... Jimmy Garrison down-shifting on the Bass on the first cut ( ""Acknowlegement"" aka ""Love Supreme"" )with Elvin Jones and McKoy Tyner rounding things out, just Blew My Mind! If you DON'T ""feel"" this one, you have NO SOUL!"
1,"I'm just a guy who said this record wasn't all that? I beg your pardon, you don't say. this record is not for a party, it's for your ears. This is pure joy. the guy that gave one star does not like jazz. listen to this late at night after your girlfriend broke up with you. this is life affirming it's hopeful it taps into all your emoticons and beyond. if i knew you i would just make you a copy but it's cheap enough. check it out when you are screwed up or to impress a lady. either way you will score."
1,"Unhelpful, but true This album may serve as an acid test - if you don't like it, you don't like jazz, and never will. The flawless interplay of the four voices in this work builds upon all that came before and anticipates all that came after. Those who don't like it - and these are few an far between - are usually aggressively drowsy conservatives who listen to Coltrane wishing listfully that his genius had not arrived on the scene to disturb the sanguine haze that was American music in the late 50's. A Love Supreme created a new musical idiom in which the depth of human sentiment could be commiunicated. A towering accomplishment."
1,Seth Eastman Sketchbook Came as promised - in great shape - very fair price - and delightful sketches from our state's past. What else can you ask for?
1,Hard to find this product now. I like this scent and it is no longer made in this particular configuration...I was happy to find it so reasonably priced here.
1,Great Christmas Songs I love all this music by the Celtic Woman. I purchased this and one other Christmas cd. I also purchased the Celtic Woman cd. The most beautiful music.

1,"helped with bypass recovery My husband was recovering from bypass surgery and could not slide forward to get out of chair, bed etc. With the silk Pajamas he could get to the edge of the the seat and then stand with the aid of the walker. Amazon was the only place I could find this product. That was 6 weeks ago. He likes them so well he won't wear anything else, They have been laundered many times and still look like new"
1,"Review for Intimo Silk Pant I have ordered this same pajama pant before, and they wear well. The size is also accurate. Color is true to photo."
1,"Valeo WW2 2-Pound Wrist Weights These are super soft, like a silky terry cloth. These are a bit on the small side for a medium-large framed woman's wrist. However, these are perfect for a child's wrist or even ankle. These are used in my child's therapy, and they fit perfectly on an 8 yr old's wrists and ankles. Very comfortable."
1,wrist weights I have small; tiny wrists so the weights fit fine and they are a great enhancement to my daily workout. In fact I wear then almost everyday all day long except when I am sleeping.
1,Just a lovely as picture I bought this pillow and I was very nervous that it wouldn't be as lovely as the picture. I'm not one for buying this without touching it but I was pleasantly surprise. It is absolutely lovely and I'm very happy I made the purchase.
1,"the best music for the best videogame This Cd contains every track you hear in the video game. If you liked the game, you'll love this cd, just to hear it is like playing the game all over again. A MUST HAVE FOR ZELDA FANS."
1,"Ocarina of Time This is a great cd! It includes all the wonderful music from the 1999 award winning n64 game, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.There are 82 tracks to this cd, some that last a few seconds long... some that last a few minutes long. My favorite is the ""End Credits."" This is the song played after beating the game and is truly beautiful!! I love it!!"
1,"kool first of all, the music on zelda ocarina of time matches the setting you are in. for example, listen to the water temple music. most people get an image of a watery or icy place. the game's songs impressed many people im sure. the game is already great by it self, but the music just takes it to the next level."
1,"Wonderful I loved the compositions from the game and I think Nobuo Uematsu is a great composer, fitting perfect music for perfect environments.However, I could not abide the repetative synthesised instruments that accompanied the music on most occasions. I recently bought the original FF8, thinking they perhaps implemented real instruments..but no luck.Then I saw this! Absolutely amazing... A single pianist plays 13 of the greatest FF8 tracks, with clever re-arrangements, you can listen to this, fully imersed in the Final Fantasy atmosphere. My highlight must be the card game theme, shuffle or boogie...an excellent take on the 12 bar blues. Anyway, yes, buy this! Also you get it in Japanese packaging...which is always good, for some bizarre reason the have a little plastic see-though sheath which the real case goes in...lovely."
1,"Frommers South Africa My family and I took five books about South Africa with us, and this is the book we used and relied on the most. It proved to be the most accurate with what we experienced once there, and the book itself was the easiest to use in its layout and organization."
1,"Great planner book This book, as all the Frommer series, is very good to help you plan a trip. The recommendations are often the same as you will find on Tripadvisor which increase my confidence level, but in the book you get really detailed information with contact numbers and websites. They have maps of each area with the interest point marked on it, this is a great planning tool; you can really figure better in what order to schedule visits. Yes, other boks have more photos, this one definitely does not but that is why it's a good planner, it has INFORMATION. Those pretty DK books are nice to look at but useless to plan with. I would like to see them update more frequently but reality is that the information does not really change that often, so all in all the book is great."
1,"Loaded with information I am preparing for a trip to South Africa in May to join my daughter that is studying abroad in Cape Town. I anticipate that the information packed in the pages of this book will be very helpful in making contacts with hotels, adventure planners, and restaurants. With the help from the chapter on Victoria Falls, we anticipate having a successful trip through Zimbabwe as well."
1,"Loved it all! As a fan of the horror genre I am very often forced to sit through a book by a well known author that although has the major affect of scaring me out of my wits, rarely gets deep into my own personal life. Mr. Marano has succeeded where others have failed me!From the moment I picked this book up, I just couldn't put it down until I finished the story.The story of two Princes of Hell each trying to take over the world was as gripping as it was frightening, and left me wanting more from this author. His style of prose was just amazing.Of course the real good stuff is the emotional roller coaster you get the privilege to be on from almost page one!This book takes you everywhere, from sorrow to hopeful, and taking little pitstops at each emotion along the way.With characters I could really feel for, the struggle for Earth was just a beautiful mix of great insight and moments of pure suspense.Pick it up if you can, it's a great read!"
1,"Great buy! This was a great buy. It seems it's shrunk lines in my forehead to a nicer size. It's also a great moisturizer for anything, I've used it on my lips, nose, eyes. Nothing irritant about emu oil competitors prices much higher for no reason. You won't be disappointed."
1,Everything perfect ! Could not have asked for a smoother transaction. Timely delivery and intact product. Thank you !
1,"Seals In Moisture... Love this oil over or mixed with my other face care products. If you use glycolic washes or treatment, you may want to consider using this afterwards. The bottle with the dropper works fine for easy control over how much you want to use. The product last a very long time making it a real bargain for such good product. For me, there is no offensive smell.I put on a light cream, add Marie Veronique sunscreen, them use my powder foundation. Just let the oil dry a little prior to using your foundation.I will buy again and again!"
1,"Mesmerizingly Cute Slinky Malinki, the star of the story, creeps out of the house at night to look for the other cats in the neighbourhood to play. But what happens when Scarface Claw appears?A very cute book, written in the form of poetry, children learn all about rhyming words and various characteristics of cats.Lovely illustrations, adults would love this book as much as the children."
1,"Solid Album, great comback Not as fun as the second album, not as accessible as the first... probably the best whole album from SDRE. Some great songs... ""Two Promises"", ""100 Million"" the title track and ""Guitar and Video Games"" stand out as some of SDRE's best.Does require a couple of listens to to get truly into, but rewarding in the end."
1,"Still Gives Me Chills I can't believe it's been 13 years since I first heard this CD. Funny thing is I listened for 3 or 4 years before I actually listened to the lyrics too.Another KOD reviewer on Amazon had problem with some of the gay-themed lyrics. If you can't get over that, then frankly you don't deserve to hear it. The guitar effects will put you in a trance, and the songs flow together seamlessly. One of the reasons KOD didn't have mainstream success is their songs are some heavy duty songs about LOVE, both gutwrentching, and glorious.One of the top 10 CD's that changed my life.Just buy it."
1,"Another great album from Twilightning This is one of my all-time favorite bands. This album is rather heavy on the synthesizer sounds when compared to their others, which is actually not a quality attribute to my ear, but they pull it off with flying colors. Highly recommended to anyone who likes metal with powerful vocals...EdGuy, Excalion, Iron Maiden, etc."
1,Good play I read this because my husband had to buy it for a college course and it was actually a really good play to read :) The only part I hate about reading plays is keeping who says what straight!
1,"Three Hanks ""Men with Broken Hearts"" - Hank Sr., Hank Jr., and Hank III CD EXCELLENT!!! The way they compiled these 3 great voices together is a miracle!!! The sound is simply ""awesome"". One Hank will sing a part, then another Hank will sing another part, and so on. These are re-mixed upbeat Rock versions of these Hank William's Classics. This cd contains the classic ""Men with Broken Hearts"" - everyone should hear this song before they die. This is simply a poetic masterpiece, and this 3 Hank's version is ""awesome"". This is ""required"" listening for any Hank fan!!! I've seen Hank Jr. perform live and he is great. Thanks and may God Bless!!!"

1,"""Casualties of War"" is a Masterpiece This is the best war movie ever made. ""Casualties of War"" is an amazing accomplishment by director Brian De Palma. The story of a soldier (Michael J. Fox) who reports his squad for the rape and murder of a Vietnamese woman during Vietnam. He lives in fear and is assumed the enemy for not participating in the heinous acts. The squad leader (Sean Penn) has no moral conscious and his ego gets the best of him. Ving Rhames gave a speech about justice and was extremely right on. You can't beat the system, but when it's to do the right thing, then you must try."
1,"A cinematic opera. Absolutely brilliant An enduring statement about the conflicts that exist between morality and circumstance, character and expediancy, steadfastness and complacency, and the war that each of us has to fight for ourselves in our own minds during times of trouble.Great performances from Penn (as usual) and a very (unexpectedly) believable Michael J Fox.The real question is what and who are the real Casualties of war? Not to be missed."
1,"it's the world's best acquired taste! Okay, to first start out, if you aren't into this sort of genre of music (or if you aren't vaguely familiar with the epic saga that is Xenogears), then you might want to consider other options before buying this piece. Packed with a ton of the music from the game, the CD's recording quality is enough to give RPGers that warm, fuzzy feeling of nostalgia all over again. Everything from Lahan to id is in this package, and it's well worth the somewhat high price. A wonderful compliment to possibly the greatest game out there."
1,Quick Success to Stain Glass I am a beginner and I'm teaching myself. This book was very helpful in teaching me how to begin. It also has a lot of nice designs that I was not afraid to try. I found this book very helpful in getting started.
1,Have book will travel! Love this book! It is always in the car and always helpful. Nice write-ups about the different parks and places to walk. If you like to run around with your dog do buy one of these and leave it in the car.
1,"""The Village Barbershop"" Movie A wonderful, ""feel good"" movie......funny, poignant, delicious. John Ratzenberger shows how multi-faceted his acting abilities are. He's funny, sweet, sexy, lovable. This movie is a ""must-see""!"
1,"The best of all his books (all of which I love). Sure the ""secret"" is outrageous, but then, the same can be said about organized religion in general, so I didn't have a problem with it. I loved the book and thought it had a great plot and was an entertaining read, which I believe is what it was intended to be - hello - fiction! It wasn't preachy or didactic and therefore, in general, annoying as so many other authors seem to be with this and similar subjects (case in point - The Last Templar by Raymond Khoury, OMG, bleck!!!). Taken for what it is - a good page turner - it's one of Berry's best, in my opinion, and certainly inspired me to read all of his novels (this was the first I read), none of which have disappointed to date."
1,"third secret Steve Berry has become one of my favourite authors. The Third Secret does not disappoint, Get ready for a thrilling ride."
1,really brilliant this is a brilliant video. I agree its not a replacement for everyday play and excessive tv watching is not good for anyone....but from first hand practical experience my daughter just loves this and has certainly learned practical things from it...we dont put tv on everyday..just every so often...if she is restless or ill.. ( or mommy really needs to get something done....)she much prefers it to anything else that she has seen in the past...in fact it is the only dvd that she gets excited about.it is also a wonderful format to copy and and gives you simple but great ideas for easy play ( good for a new parent)It is was also the only thing that would stop her crying when she was teething... for this i rate it as one of the most valuable things that we have bought!!!!
1,For the small ones This video is super popular with my 19 month old GD. The rest of us can stand it - it is really really not for older kids/adults.She sees any sort of package to be opened and wants to know if there is a new Eebee in it. Even Barney and Elmo can't beat Eebee for her attention. Not sure how long it will last but will really recommend Eebee for the second year of a child's life. <G>
1,"Film Noir....in ""Bizarro World"" It was once said that the whole of a movie should not be in so much whether you like or disliked a movie, but rather, did it leave a lasting impression upon you? Taking that idea into account, I would have to say that ""Singapore Sling"" is without a doubt an indelible addition to the film noir genre, albeit the bizarro kind. As one of the reviewers has mentioned before, this movie shouldn't be taken seriously. You should come into this one with an open mind and you'll be rewarded with a beautifully photographed film noir filled with black humor. ""Singapore Sling"" is like the demented cousin of ""Laura"", ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Grey Gardens"". It's your basic detective story but with torture, bizarre erotica, and outstanding overacting. Just make sure the parents are asleep and that you've got the right kind of friend in tow when watching it."
1,"IMPORTANT NEWS ABOUT A SAD TOPIC! Obviously we live in troubled times. Many are unable to confront the tragic events that recently took place. Others feel it very important that they know what is ahead for all of us. If you are of like mind you will want to read NOSTRADAMUS PREDICTIONS OF WORLD WAR III. It contains a host of material from the seers earlier prophecies right on through to the third anti christ who is said to be living in the Middle East. Does this book have all the answers??? Probably not, but the author does delve into the meaning of Nostradamus words as well as bringing in the visions of other seers from our current era. And, in addition, there are other things besides predictions of World War III to contemplate -- even an invasion from space."
1,"great it was as desceibed. i have nothing else to say, this is very annoying to write this much about the quality of a dvd, stop it."
1,Molton Brown I bought this product as a gift for a fussy relative who has everything and is very difficult to please. She loved it! Worth every penny.
1,"GREAT for Vacation I took my GS Service Unit to DC and also our 5th graders over spring break!! To help make the trip ""educational"" as well as fun - this book is like a journal where the students can keep all their tickets, maps, flyers, and information in one little holder. When the parents ask the kids what they saw and did - the kids can pull this out and SHOW the parents and REVIEW what they did!! Excellent visual - up to date - and instead of asking what's this place is about--- there is a short write up about each place they will visit.Also wonderful for families going on vacation ---- the kids love it!"
1,"Cool Book I'm getting tired of wading through these novels where the main antagonist is incredibly annoying, but left in the plot because there'd be no reason to continue writing without him (or her). So you just sit there and get annoyed by the character until the book - mercifully - ends.Expendible is not one of these books. The characters are strange but never annoying. If nothing else, they're human without resorting to extremes. The book reads very quickly and cleanly.You'd be inclined to think it's fluff, since it does read well, but there's actually quite a bit of food for thought in there and some very interesting insight into human nature. Go read it now."

1,"Great Books by Oakley Another classic story by author/artist Graham Oakley. The church mice books are his best, the artwork is priceless (and hilarious!). Check his other books out too. They are great."
1,A Royal Kiss This book is full of a young girls romance with a prince it is one of the best books i have ever read and if you like this one check out the other 2 in this sereis THEY ROCK just as much!!!!!!!!
1,INTER GENERATIONAL TRAUMA Another book with stories about the trauma that the Boarding Schools caused our Indian People of Turtle Island. Many of us are products of the Historical Trauma that our ancestors endured at the hands of the White Man!
1,THE Ultimate Food for your Lories This is the only brand of Lory food our flock will accept. Its fruity smell and apparent good taste are the first thing our lories want in the morning and they get very excited waiting for their individual bowls to be passed out.
1,very interesting and informative I have always been interested in weird things and this fills my need
1,A Gift of Wings Some really good short stories both for readability and philosophy. Bach has written several other good books such as 'Biplane' and 'Nothing by Chance'.
1,"Intellectual reading I am on an intellectual quest to understand what makes a man a hero and a woman a heroine.Thomas Carlyle did an amazing amount of research and is the first book in a long seriesthat I will read on mythological heroes/heroines and actual heroes/heroines in history.I am interested in how mythological heroes/heroines carried on through the ages and how they influencedactual heroes/heroines throughout history.I was lucky enough to come across this book on archive.org and was able to downloadit and read it for free.The prose of this century is sometimes convoluted which causes you to spend more timetrying to understand and then reflect on the author's words.The book was, as I said, the first read of many to come on an intellectual quest tounderstand the whole 'hero/heroine' concept.I am glad I came across this book. This book piqued my interest more on the whole mythology ofheroism."
1,"TIVO CHANGED TELEVISION FOREVER! I no longer schedule my day around TV, I can enjoy any program at any time! I set my TIVO at night before going to bed and don't concern myself about missing any of my favorite programs any more! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!"
1,"Don't waste your time with anything else After spending years with Cox Communications DVRs (Motorola and then Scientific Atlanta) and dealing with all the problems they cause (not recording everything, not recording at all, crashing, dying etc.) we decided to try TiVo. I have yet to find a flaw with this piece of equipment.It records what its supposed to, when its supposed to. I love my new TiVo."
1,"Tivo allows me to view on my schedule My experience with TiVo started when my daughter gave us a series 2 for Christmas years ago.We have used it daily ever since. Then when she had trouble with hers she gave it to me. It works perfectly if it is kept above 60F. When it is colder the audio becomes distorted with scratchy crackling noise other than that it still works great. If I had the money I would upgrade in a minute. Until that time I will continue to use our series 2 TiVos until they no longer work.TiVo TCD746320 Premiere DVR, BlackTiVo TCD649080 Series 2 80-Hour Dual Tuner Digital Video RecorderTiVo Premiere XL4 TCD758250 HD Digital Video Recorder"
1,Love it When I say that tivo is the best thing out as far as dvr's right now it's an understatement. This product is absolutely wonderful. I am 100% happy with this product. I highly recommend it.
1,"Time Warner sucks. TiVo ROCKS. My old TiVo is still alive and kicking. Got him as a gift about 8 years ago and bit the bullet and bought lifetime service. Best money I've ever spent. We have other TWC dvrs in the house; always having problems with on demand video, slow relays, delayed remote responses, playback of recorded shows. NEVER have these problems with TiVO. He's changed my life!"
1,"An explanation of just what TiVo is for you newcomers Length:: 3:45 MinsIn this video, I explain just what a TiVo is, how it works, and why it is TOTALLY AWESOME."
1,"A witty mystery... A mystery filled with wit, and based on the famous Lord Lucan case (a murderer who escaped, and to this day, no one knows if he's alive or dead). Spark has not lost her touch, and this is a short, engaging book that you won't want to put down."
1,"This is the only available version of BCP and is good that it is released Despite all the protestations by others, I personally love the cover and artwork and the fact that we can finally hear supposedly from the tape that Don sent to UK promoter Roger Eagle something like Bat Chain Puler should have sounded. thios album is raw and energetic work from the captain and his Magic Band. Definitely worth buying."
1,Great Introduction To The Lottery If you are new to playing lottery then this is the book to get. Plenty of charts to get you thinking and analyzing numbers so you can create your OWN systems. I highly recommend this book for all beginning lottery enthusists.
1,"Play to Win First of all - you need to play to win. Using Gail's books and software can make the winning happen. Some people see patterns and trends very easily using the information and charts available to them in her books and software. Others need to study harder. I've used Gail's books and software for a long time now, and although I haven't hit the ""big one"" YET, it's just around the corner. These tools can make it happen! As Gail says, ""Smart Luck!"""
1,"Like ""Angela's Ashes,"" only well-written! I had not expected 'Never Piss Into The Wind' to packsuch an emotional punch- a punch softened with humorand great wit. This is a homerun, a must read. I willbe sending copies of this jewel to family members forChristmas this year."
1,"Does what it says I bought this product for my 98 Chevy S10. It fits great, and it's nice not to have to lift my door up to close it anymore. It doesn't really look exactly like the picture, but I think that's just a generic picture for all the hinge kits. Make sure you put it in from the bottom for the top hinge if yours is like mine. There isn't room to do it from the top, and your hammer can slip and crack your windshield if you're not careful. Otherwise it's a no brainer to put in. All you'll need is a hammer and some pliers."
1,"You Gotta' Love It!!!!! I have always loved Buffy, since her first dusting, to the tragic events of Joyce Summers. This is a pair of my favorite episodes, the only others are ""Hush"" and ""Prophecy Girl"" Buy it!!!! you'll love it, trust me on this one!"
1,"The Bible for Minimalism and its British origins For anyone wanting to discover what is minimalism and wher it came from, this a must. No one has managed to outline and seize precisely the essence of it as well as H. YPMA. Outstanding photos, and a fantastic insigt into London"
1,"A must-read for attaining harmony with your horse. A classic aimed at the dressage rider yet applicable to all who desire a true partnership with their horse. Museler provides clear explanations and graphic illustrations on the training of the horse and rider from the basics of balance and feel to correcting disobedience and advanced training. First published in 1937, 'Riding Logic' provides practical steps to achieving the sympathetic partnership advocated by todays natural horsemen"
1,"Kal Yeast makes for a great breakfast Blends very easily. Has a mild taste. I put a scoop of nutritional yeast in my breakfast blender shakes (also has water, powdered milk and frozen berries or other fruit, and a sweetener such as stevia). Gives a great nutritional boost - and all those B vitamins are great for the ""nerves' before a work day begins and I like the protein in it too. Have been taking yeast for 20 years - it did take a few weeks to get used to the taste when I began, since I only stirred it in milk. With the fruit and a little sweetener - it tastes really good."
1,yeast flakes Just what I wanted came quickly. Highly recommend both this product and the supplier. Very satisfied. Only need 3 more words... Thanks!
1,Love it Far superior taste to what I've been buying in bulk at my local health food store. I'm a loyal Kal user now!
1,"Wrong Picture, Great Product. Though the item that arrived was not this picture, it is the same 22 oz KAL Nutritional Yeast flakes I purchased before and I'm very satisfied. It takes a little while to get used to the taste but now I put it on pretty much everything. I agree it's slightly cheesy, a little salty tasting (to me), but I really do sprinkle it on pretty much everything savory or spicy. 3 TBS for 9 protein and it's just yummy. Great product, have purchased again, will purchase again."
1,"Bulk size rocks Keep a small shaker flip top canister (I use the Red Star one) so you can refill when needed. Getting this jumbo size will save you a bundle, especially if you use a lot of yeast. The quality is good, and you can add it to many foods to increase nutritional value."
1,"Perfect on popcorn! Healthy for you! It's difficult to find flakes of yeast. I like it on home-made popcorn fresh off the stove.It adds a buttery taste to it, and the flakes catch in the crooks and crevices of the popped corn.Discovered it in Portland, OR at an art theater downtown, where they had it in a shaker, next toparmesean cheese and salt, etc.About once a month I HAD to go to that theater, no matter what movie was showing,and have some popcorn with brewer's yeast on it. Finally figured out it was right beforemy menstral cycle, and my body craved B vitamins, which this stuff is packed full of.This is a big container of it, and should last quite a while.I'll tell you, finding FLAKED brewer's years is difficult way down here in my area."
1,"Air Filter Excellent product and much less expensive than at the dealer. Shipped on time, easy instructions to replace old filter with the new one."
1,"Even prettier than the ""garden faries' by Darcy Mae. 16 pages of beautiful, black and white illustrations on quality parchment paper. These are the coloring books I turn to when Im ready for something different to color. Personally speaking, I find these to be the most fun, and a great change of pace, because I can use almost any medium for terrific results, in far less time. I prefer using my Tombow markers with water applied, so I get that traslucent watercolor effect, then come back with either more felt marker, and or a soft colored pencil, and crayola crayons, hit it with a hot iron to melt the wax's into the paper for retaining bold yet translucent colors.( I like the buckling effect this also gives) Lot's of fun to color!! Great projects for kids and adults alike. These designs are also great for crafters."
1,"I love this tree! You can definitely see the pool in the middle--if you stick your head into the branches! =) I absolutely loooooooove this tree. It is so beautiful and came out of the box almost perfect--haven't even fluffed up the branches yet and it looks wonderful. There are so many lights--800! One thing though, the lights are LED so they don't have that soft yellow glow. Instead it's kind of an ice blue glow, like ice on the branches or very sparkly diamonds. So for those of you who are more interested in the soft yellow glow, don't get this tree. Other than that it's really bright--it lights up the whole room. Very nice tree. Would buy again."
1,"CANDIDE - THE TRUE LOVER CANDIDE IS ONE THE BEST LOVE STORIES OF ALL TIMES. THE BOOK MADE ME LAUGH, CRY, HATE, BUT MOST ALL LOVE AND SEE THAT TRUE LOVE WILL ALWAYS FIND IT TRUE END.

BUT ALAS CANDIDE CHOSEN COURSE WAS TO LEAVE THIS PLACE OF PERFECT PEACE AND UNITY AND TO SEEK FOREVER HIS TRUE PEACE AND UNITY, HIS BELOVED MADAME CONGONDE.THIS IS A MUST READ BOOK SHORT AND SWEET I RATE THIS BOOK A TRUE CLASSICHENRY"
1,"Surpringly not boring! When I started this very short book, I expected it to be a drone-fest from the 1700s. However I was pleasantly surprised to find the story gripping, the satire comical and devious, and my time well spent. I even read sections of the book to younger siblings of ages 10 and 6, and they paid attention with great detail. I would highly recommend this book as a classic for a reason."
1,"Should Be Required Reading I have owned this book for quite awhile but put off reading it, fearing that it would be dull and scholarly. I was in for a wonderful surprise. His philosophy makes a lot of sense and he puts it forth in a simple story accessible to almost everyone. Many, many times I laughed out loud. It was fun as well as enlightening. The term ""sixes and sevens"" was used; what is the etymology of that expression? The violence is expressed in an absurd way, though we know awful things did and do happen."
1,"A Fairy Tale for the Thinkers Everyone will like this story for different reasons. It's easily read, and one can then toss out the phrase ""I, frequent reader of Voltaire, think..."". Alternatively, one can read it AND think about it. How strikingly funny it is. How incredibly relevant it remains to this day. How possible it is to challenge blind optimism and yet not wallow in complete despair and self-pity. Above all, I found it to be a very accessible work of philosophy. Ahem. I mean, ""I, frequent reader of Voltaire, think it is a rather accessible work of philosophy..."""
1,a good book this book was pretty good. it was kind of weird but good. i thought that it wasnt a satire but my lit teacher said that it was so you have to interpret it as one. if you dont then it makes it look like any regular book that you would read.
1,"Truly a Beautiful Thing... I saw the show in Chicago and it was brilliant! The story is so honest and heart-felt. Harvey did a magnificent job of not turning the show into a cliched ""gay"" play."
1,Great Book! I love this book! I am a professional graphic designer that does not know how to write any JavaScript. I just wanted to be able to create more dynamic pdf files. The author did a great job explaining the JavaScript used in this book in a way that non programmers can grasp!Mr. Deubert was also very gracious in helping me customize one of the scripts in his book to work for a specific project I had. He stands behind his product!I recommend this to anyone that is a non programmer looking to learn how to use JavaScript with Acrobat.
1,"EXCELLENT! Purchased this book knowing full well it was outdated, but for a beginner in PDF forms this was and is and excellent purchase. Came through quickly and in Excellent condition. I would recommend this book to anybody who is starting out creating and making forms more user friendly. Great Job, can't wait till the next book gets released... please put it on Kindle, Nook and iPad versions as well as Print."
1,"Portals to Freedom Of all the books I have purchased lately this is one of the few that I read completely in a timely way. I purchased 3 copies, one of which I sent to my sister, one I have to give to someone?? whenever the spirit moves me. I love to buy from Amazon because the price is usually decent and it saves an old person lots of running around."
1,"I love it What can you say about a sweatshirt? It great, I've been wearing it for years now. I love it."
1,"Delightful! This is a wonderful read. It makes a great bedtime story and it is also beautiful (the wood carvings) and inspiring. This is good for people tired of reading what is wrong with the environment. The Man Who Planted Trees is kind of like a sophisticated Lorax book. Anyway, buy this book and enjoy it!"
1,"Beautiful illustration, beautiful story Jean Jiono's meandering myth works at so many levels I have no idea where to start. The parable touches on personal dedication, patience, the chance of ecological redemption, and ironies introduced when the loner comes to the authorities' attention. The pace seems Zen-like, even monastic, as the speaker touches The Man's life at intervals of years.McCurdy's woodcuts complement the story perfectly, with gently elegant renderings of some selected moments from it. The images' black and white simplicity reinforces the simple life of The Man and the understated character of the writing.But, despite the words and images coming across in such a low-key way, I found the story deeply moving. It inspires me, too -- but inspires me to what? I really couldn't say, but I'm not sure I need to.-- wiredweird"
1,"Offering hope in a troubled world This is a delightful allegory, offering hope to change the world by the persistence of one man, working one day at a time, over many years. Written after the ravages of World War I, this story tells the tree planter in all of us that the seeds of one person's dreams will change the lives of thousands.The wood block prints are an added bonus. I've given this book to sons, to foresters, and to those who need hope in troubled times."
1,"Gripping and Inspired As an adult who loves children's fantasy and survival novels, this was a real page-turner. It sounds morbid to say I 'enjoyed' the book, but I don't think that was the author's intent. I felt a gloom and sense of foreboding dread the entire time. It's gritty, real, and very immersing, even heartbreaking at times to consider the story of these kids and how they would grow and develop without adults in the world. It was reminiscent of Lord of the Flies and Red Dawn, with a little bit of Stephen King's 'The Stand' thrown in for good measure, but it wasn't derivative of any of these.I must also say that the style of writing was very different and engaging - these two authors have a great voice, style, and the prose flows right along - impressive without being obtrusive. I'm very excited about reading the rest of the series."
1,"Savage seamless paper This is an off white color. More of a vanilla than a white. Ive used it a few times though, and like the color . The shipping tube is a great storage tube when not in use."
1,Julie Garwoods best book yet! I really loved this book. When I read the Secret I thought then that the characters of Brodrick and Ramsey would be great for another book. I'm so glad she used them for this one. Ransom had such a great story with wonderful heroes and villans I loved to hate.
1,"ANOTHER CAN'T-PUT-DOWN BOOK ONCE AGAIN JULIE GARWOOD HAS WRITTEN A BOOK WHERE I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN. ALL I WANT TO DO IS READ, READ, READ. I FEEL THAT I AM BEING TAKEN BACK IN TIME AND THAT I AM ACTUALLY A PART OF THE STORY, A THIRD PARTY, OF COURSE. RANSOM WAS A FUN-LOVING BOOK WITH OLD CHARACTERS RETURNED FROM THE SECRET, AND THEY HAVE A MAJOR ROLE, NOT JUST A FLY-BY- NIGHT MENTION."
1,"Best Book Ever! The Ransom book by Julie Garwood is truely riviting and the characters come to life. I have this book in paper as well as on Kendal book. this is one of my favorite books by far. I have read this Ransom about 5 times now from cover to cover. Everytime i read it i capture the true essense of Characters. I would love to see the younger generation in the books to come spring to life. I cannot seem to get enough of Julie's, characters; Ian, Brodrick, Ramsey Patrick and their wives, I would love to see the story unfold more.Thank you for your stories they are truley inspirational! A devoted Fan!"
1,I loved this book! I have to say that I have read all of Ms. Garwood's books and by far this one is my favorite. I have read it over several times and still love it each and every time!
1,"FINALLY! I must admit, it's been a while since Ms. Garwood has written a really and truly good story. The characters were well-developed and the plot just complicated enough so as not to be predictably boring. She was my first and, still is, my favorite romance author. This one I just COULD NOT put down! I finished it in a day! for anyone who loves historicals, this one is definitely a must read! :)"
1,"Wonderful I love Julie Garwood's historical romance novels, especially the ones that have to do with the Highlands. Reading this book was like catching up with old friends from the book The Secret. If you haven't read The Secret you should read that first then read Ransom so that you will be familiar with the characters. You will fall in love with Brodick and his gruff nature but you will see that he is just a pussycat, I just wish that Ramsey and Bridgid's story was a bit more longer. Either way I would definitely recommend this book to read."
1,"Great characters, great book !!! I am a huge fan of Julie Garwood. I have read every single book of hers. But Ransom is deffinitely my favourite. Why I loved the book? First of all, the heroine is not a weak, silly girl. She is strong and the way she behaves and holds herself when she is in pain was amazing. Second, I can feel the love between Brodick and Gillian every time I read the book (and I assure you, I have read this book for 4 times already). Besides, every single dialog means something and I never got bored while I was reading the book. The third thing is deffinitely this is not only plain romance between 2 people but also there are intrigues and real conflicts pulling the reader in. There are always something happening through the book so you never get bored. I would like to say a little about why I didnt like the book but there is not even one reason!!! 100% loved it !!!"
1,"It does not disappoint! I loved this story!!! If you are like me and you reread all her stories this will be added. It did not lack or miss anything. I came away from this book with a smile on my face. ""Come the Spring"" and ""The Wedding"" just seemed to lack the depth that I've come to expect from Julie Garwood and I was hoping and praying to see the old Julie back in evidence. It was wonderful. Now I would like to read all about Nicholas and Clare's story from ""Saving Grace""."
1,"An Absolute Joy! To Ms. Garwood: I own every book you have ever written and was absolutely delighted to find some of my most favorite characters in this book. This book is so filled with love and laughter that I *had* to read it from cover to cover, and was sad to finally close the book on such vivid personalities. Should you be inclined to allow any of the other characters fall in love in a third book, I would be thrilled!"
1,"And, A Note To Julie Garwood I'm one of those people who says she wouldn't be caught dead with a romance novel. Imagine my surprise when a friend loaned this to me and told me it was a mystery, which she knows I love and I finally relized it was a romance! Julie Garwood lovingly developes her characters; she interests, involves and excties this reader and tells me a wonderful story. I ran right out and bought the ""prequel"" ""The Secret"" wherein we meet the Maitland clan and many of ""Ransom's"" characters. My note to Ms Garwood is, 'Please, please', take us home with Gillian Buchannan to the places and people she has not met, and keep us in touch with the Sinclairs and the Maitlands. A trilolgy would be such a joy!!"
1,"Her best so far, Ms Garwood never dissapoints us. It was wonderful, I could hardly wait to get home and read it. I was thrilled to find out what happend with Judith and Frances Catherine. Ms Garwood is my favorite author. This was truly one of Ms. Garwoods finest books."
1,Ransom Good story wish it would continue into another story line. Love this book but where is the next one to follow
1,Julie Garwood is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have read all of her books and I think she is a fantastic writer. Ransom is by far one of her BEST books. No body else can compare to her!!
1,Great Book! RANSOM was wonderful. A compelling plot and characters that come to life. I laughed and then I cried and then I laughed again. Garwood is the best at weaving a touching story. I highly recommend this book.
1,Wonderful That is the cutest baby on the cover that I've ever seen in my whole life. It's about time that a successful lawyer found a way to structure her career around her family!
1,"This Book Rules If you are into fantasy, adventure, humor, or all of the above, you have to read The Lives of Christopher Chant. I own a copy of it and would highly reccomend it to everyone. If you have read this book and enjoyed it, you should also read Witch Week, Charmed Life, The Magicians of Caprona, and everything else written by Diana Wynne Jones."

1,Beautifully illustrated The gorgeous illustrations caught my eye and so I picked up the book for the first time. What a wonderful story. Kipling has a way of writing that just flows and makes reading the story out loud a pleasure just to hear the words.
1,"Detailed guide to QFT The book's focus is on carefully explaining what quantum field theory is. Starting from classical field theories, ie. the harmonic chain, Greiner goes on to discuss 2nd quantization for spin 0, 1/2, and spin 1 fields. The results are then applied to derive the perturbation expansion for interacting fields. The last sections on quantization with path integrals is also well written, and contains more details than eg. Sakurai. Throughout, many (sometimes tedious, but) instructive examples are presented that lots of other authors just assume to be understood already."
1,Great Utility Lantern I bought this for a backup power for our company data center. It has come in handy a couple of times and it works great. We have not used the radio or the Power utlity much but all features work well enough. I am happy with the Black and Decker lantern and would recommend it.
1,"A review of the book, unlike the author below........ 1st let me say you're supposed to review the book, not give us a character assassination of Mike Murdock. Mike Murdock has an impeccable record (financial AND spiritual.) Moving on.....this book is filled with scriptures and insights as to how Jesus is a true leader and how you can follow His teachings. A great book for personal and professional development!"
1,"""HAIL the Ultimate Mentor!"" It takes a special person to point out the wondorous truths contained in the Bible which have been clamouring for the average person to incorporate them into their lives.Many Thanks and God's blessings to Mike Murdock. And, a wonderful experience awaits the next person to read this book."

1,A great tool for exams! I have some of my biggest exams ahead of me in the next week. About a month ago I wasn't sure if i was going to be able to understand all of the information that we've been going over for the entire year of biology. There were some parts that i was really struggling to understand. When i got a hold of BioTutor Excalibur i quickly put it to use. I first attempted just some of the chapters we were on. After seeing how much they helped me with what we were studying i began to use every chapter such as a practice exam. I really feel like i am now ready to take this exam. Thanks BioTutor!
1,"Castro Is A Monster I read this book years ago and now I am writing this because I have come across another book,Tortured for Christ, that I will be picking up. A few years before that was published, however, this one was. Let me tell you, after reading this gripping, sad and eventually triumphant (how else would he have been able to get this in print?) story, I never, never again had any shred of respect for Castro. I probably didn't anyway, but ignorance doesn't excuse it. After reading this, I have never trusted anything I have heard or read about that man or his regime if it purports to be something ""good"" about communist Cuba. Not the people, the regime. This story is one that needs to be read and shared, especially now as we seem to moving toward ""de-thawing"" the relationship with this thug. I don't pretend to know much more than what I have read and seen. I'm not of Cuban descent. For what people may think of this dictatorship, this book brings out some sad accuracy."
1,"Humbling & Challenging Story I first got hooked on autobiographies, when I read a book by Richard Wurmbrand. Then a friend told me about this book and I got it immediately, and read it in about 2 days. I'm not a reader, like seriously, I don't enjoy reading at all. But I couldn't put this book down. Noble Alexander was an incredible man of God and I am humbled and challenged when I read his story. This book will change your life!"
1,"First class all the way This is a terrific book with terrific material to present. It is part of a wonderful series. The organization, text, photos, and drawings are all excellent. More authors/publishers should learn to present architecture this well. It's a book I study often for inspiration as Forbes' work is very elegant and spare: qualities more architects should aspire to incorporate into their work, rather than the stylistic faddish gestures all too common today. This is a favorite book in my library."
1,"Drinking the Koolaid Like the other reviewers, really like these levels. Not as pictured. Rubber ends are now yellow not black and the center vile is trimmed with yellow plastic minus the two screws shown. All that aside, they arrived dead solid perfect no thanks to the scant packaging. The levels themselves are great."
1,"Brilliant! I have been a punk fan for about 2 years now, and never have I heard such a strong debut album (I think it's their debut). Two of my favourite bands are Lagwagon and Ten Foot Pole. In my opinion, this CD is like a combination of the two bands. The harmonies and melodies are like those characteristic of Lagwagon, and the singer sounds like Dennis from TFP. Put this together with the lightning fast drumming of, say, NOFX, and there you have Over It - The Ready Series."
1,Its Williams... Every cartoony thing the man has done... Early through Zap and into the 90's. No more need be said. (his commentary is worth the price.
1,"No Bridge too Far As a former combat engineer of the Vietnam War era, I liked this series because it shows some good history of my field. It has some great old photos which will make this series good for preserving history. Combat Engineers may not get the glory of the Infantry, Armor or Artillery units, but they are vital to any war effort, and this series demonstrates that fact. I am looking forward to the next episodes."
1,Halley will ROCK your world I really love this CD. Halley's songwriting and lyrics combine an incredible emotional depth with a powerful rock and roll sound that will blow you away! These songs have a groove that will make you wish you were dancin' in a club when you listen to them. You'll want to listen again and again to catch every word of the soulful lyrics.cerrato@ptechinc.com
1,Love this Pillow I went to a Hilton and slept on the most comfortable pillow and then bought it. I love the softness of the down with the firmness of the foam that also keeps the quills from poking me in the head.
1,"A mesmirizing Michael Caine I saw this movie years ago in the theatre, and it totally captivated me. Julie Waters and Michael Caine make a wonderful student and teacher team. You can feel sorry for Michael Caine's character, with his drinking and feelings of worthlessness. I wish I had had a relationship with my teachers as Julie Waters has with Mr. Caine in this film. The end scene at the airport, leaves you feeling that both characters really had found a type of love for each other. It is a beautiful moment when Michael Caine hugs Julie Waters. Watch the facial expressions on both actors, and you will feel a deep warmth in your heart. Watch this video and enjoy and discover what is a keepsake of unspoken love.Sue"
1,"FULL VOLUME, FULL POWER TRIP! brant bjork's music is complete. This is dense,juicy rock. the type of stuff that you'll crank in the car driving 100 miles an hour in the middle of the night.the small minds of rock critics would lean on the old ""stoner rock"" cliches, but Bjork's stuff is beyond that. these are good sounds...true,thick, spacey, simple. the grooves nail you in the gut and keep you awake through the dark of night. LOUD is the word!"
1,"John Bryan Bulb book This is an excellent reference book, listing all types of bulbs, from the common garden variety to the more obscure varieties. Listings also include all the hybrids and new cultivars. The book is well set out with many colour photos of the different species. A must for any home library and avid gardeners anywhere."
1,"Love the music Great music, really surprising. My demographics - over 60, white male, big into music in 1960s and 70s, not so much now, listen to the best jazz station in the nation 91.1 or KCSM.org. Still rock out. Was a berkeley type for decades. I have seen Johnny Otis three times starting in 1964. Still didn't realize the tremendous variety of his music. Real R&B (not the crap they call R&B today), jazz, blues, race record pop sounds, rock and roll. Great album. Get it."
1,"What a Wonerful book! I have been teaching Reiki for many years using different books, finally there is a book that is clear and has all the correct information in a format a beginner can understand. This book explains the Reiki story so clearly without disclaiming the original story that appears in most other Reiki books. The pictures of the hand placements are wonderful and I like the additional placements also. I believe the stories throughout the book add a special dimension showing the flexibility and depth that Reiki can be used. This book has taken the number one position in my Reiki library. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
1,Excellent for me - a beginner I highly recommend this Reiki book. It is a wonderful guide for a beginner like myself. The photos are clear and the writing is interesting and insightful.
1,"The sunny side of latin-inspired nu-jazz With such names as Jazzanova, Rainer Truby Trio, MAW, Ian Pooley and Cujo (aka Amon Tobin), this compilation could do no wrong. Tracks were selected by Rainer Truby, a well-respected Compost project, and a guy with a low profile and a great musical instinct (check out his Glucklich series). UK's Nuphonic, along with SF's Ubiquity, is TMHO the world's no 1 label in dancefloor-friendly nu-jazz; watch out for their releases, and let everybody else wait 1-2 years for the next 'ground-breaking' and 'genre-defining' compilation from Guidance."
1,"A Treasure This is a book about the spiritual nourishment of a young soul. It is as patiently and impeccably crafted as a fine piece of simple furniture, made without glue, nails, or embellishment. Smooth and beautiful without a false or unnecessary move. Very few authors today have that restraint, finesse, and wisdom."
1,"A beautiful book that reaffirms love and faith This book will do more to restore the human heart andantimaterialism than all the polemical works in the world. It isabout dignity and faith, sure of hand, deceptively simple. Buy it. Treasure it. Share it..."
1,"BEAUTIFUL! (I can think of no other word to describe it) Tony Early tells the story of Jim with such straight-forward simplicity that you forget that you are, in fact, just reading a book. You can feel the heat of the sun on the boy's shoulders as he spends a day with his uncles in the corn field; feel his yearning to know the father who died just a week before he was born. I could go on, but I can't top Early. Go read this book! I doubt that I'll read a better one this year."
1,"Wonderful book Probably one of the better short character novels written in recent time.Mr. Early has caught the feelings, time and people of this part of NC in a way that, I think, few have ever done. The wonderful relationships between a boy, his mother and uncles is as close to what a truly caring family could ever be.Read this book."
1,"EVERYONE should have this book! I often times have trouble thinking of gifts for my three grown children for Christmas. I ordered each of them Life's, ""One Nation"" and paged through it after it arrived. Not only is it beautifully put together, but it served as a reminder of the horrifying, heinous crime committed on all of the innocent people at the WTC and the Pentagon. If you ever questioned, for one second, our countries mission to find those cold hearted, controlling, crazy bastards, the book WILL remind you of the rage you felt the day it happened..guaranteed."
1,"Excellent This book really showed patriotism. I loved it and the pictures were extreme. It was a great book for anyone, any age. I really enjoyed the book, but it made me sad."
1,Lest we forget Pictures. These will remind you. Haunting. Sad. Heart wrenching. Moving. These words won't do it for you. The book will give you more. Over 3000 people died that day. This book will help you to never forget what happened to them and us.
1,best book ever i just want to say this is one of the most moveing and inspiring books iv ever read.Its history and its worth every cent and more.i bought 5 books as gifts for christmas. and everyone loved them.every picture is detailed to what happend..and the storys in the book is from the personal lifes of everyone like fireman.police man.ect..you got to buy it ..!!!!Roger.
1,"An useful catalog Just like all books on patterns, this gives you the feeling of 'oh, this is soooo obvious' the first reading it. The fact is that a second after reading it you start thinking and talking about brown bags, angles and evangelists and refer to the book all the time. Linda and Mary Lynn give us an idiom, a very very useful idiom.Also, the book is funny. Must read."
1,"Bill Engvall ""15 degrees off cool"" Bill Engvall is totally funny in this video, espically when he talks about taking his F16 flight."
1,"How to tickle your funny bone. If you want to spend a fun evening with someone, watchingthis DVD is the perfect way to do it. It had us both institches. Bill Engvall is funny, funny, funny and doesn'thave to use foul words to do it."
1,One of my top 3 favourite funniest comics I first saw 15degrees off cool on Comedy Central. I can't remember when last I laughed so hard. It was hilarious especially his last story about the air force.
1,"All my Cats love Cosmic Pet Scratchers Since I am owned by nine cats and am grandmama to three more, I have bought numerous cardboard scratchers. Cosmic Pet Double Wide Scratcher is by far the best. The cardboard frame and scratcher are both durable, lasting many months. When one side is shredded, the scratcher can be turned over so the other side can be used. Packets of Cosmic Pet catnip are included for sprinkling over the scratcher. I think Cosmic Catnip is as good as my homegrown...much fresher looking and less junk-filled than many other catnip products. My cats certainly look forward to it. The double wide size is most suited for my fat cats."
1,"PERFECT SCRATCHER!! We can't say enough about this cat scratcher. No other cardboard scratchers can come close to this brand. Plus, the extra wide version is wonderful for my big Ally/Tom cats. They are all around 12 pounds. We have three cats and two scratchers last quite a long time since you can flip them. They love to lay on them and even bite them. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful product!"
1,"Review for Another Life In a selflessly honest appreciation for bare life, this book opens to a yearning for that which the modern human is in search of; the straining of life against its inevitable end to recapture innocence, grace before the fall, love, or what is even more mysterious, forever lost, and finally unattainable. The anxiety of these stories is deafening as you hope against hope for your own salvation along with the characters' in their quiet desperation for another life, so exigent as to be a matter of life and death; a struggle too unfathomable to dare come into consciousness, though felt every moment throughout the living flesh. You will find yourself in this book."
1,"The original, and perhaps the best. This is the album in which the Sci-fi, metal saga of the Iron Savior starts. Kai Hansen's influence and style are more than evident here. For me it's one of the best albums of the 90's. The concept of the story is really good and the song writing and the performance brilliant.I would really like to see this concept taken into a big budget movie, is fantastic. The following 3 albums continue and expand the story, but this is the first episode. Great music and a great idea. Recommended to all metalheads."
1,Comment about the textbook Smooth transaction. Got my book on time. Recommend others to buy textbooks from this person.
1,C-Murder iz on fire This was one of c-murders best album also look at Bossaline and life or deathTRU RECORDS
1,"This refill works in my Whisker City Play Cavern Cat Scratcher I purchased this Cosmic Pet Alpine scratcher replacement kit and it fits perfect in my Whisker City Play cavern cat scratcher box. I just took the refill, pulled the two halves apart and have 2 refills for the Whisker City scratcher."
1,"Great Re-Introduction to Christianity I am in the process of converting to Catholicism after being raised Presbyterian. I found this book not only to be an easy-to-read and understand explanation of the basics of Catholic catechism, but an outstanding reminder of what Christianity means, should stand for and should strive to be.The topics are in depth, and there are subtle references to refute fundamentalist arguments often heard in 21st century America.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it!"
1,"Good gift selection I usually read more than one book together and found this a very good companion to Vatican II, the Crisis and the Promise. Even though, I am aware of most of the issues that are covered in these books, I find Alan Schreck to be an interesting writer on these topics. I find both books easy late night reading unlike many others that actually help me to go to sleep. I have actually found it hard to put down these books until I finish a chapter. His writings are highly readable and thoroughly convincing."
1,"The book I recommend most! Clearly written explanation of the specific areas where Protestants have the most difficulty with Catholic teaching. I bought two, just so I'd have one to lend and one to keep!"
1,"Readable, informative and non-judgemental In the preface to this new, revised 20th anniversary edition of Catholic and Christian, author Alan Schreck reflects upon the centrality of the Eucharist at the core of the Catholic tradition as John Paul II calls us to enter the ""Year of the Eucharist"". This book covers all of the topics we Catholics are frequently asked about in conversation by our non-Catholic friends: Mary, the Communion of Saints, the Pope and more. The book is not only of value for its apologetic purposes, but also for any Catholic (or for individuals wanting to inform themselves about the Faith) who wants to learn more about the traditions at the core of our Church. The topics covered remain timely in an era when many are striving to understand the true teachings of the Church."
1,"Quick reminder! I don't think I can say anything else that the previous reviewers haven't already noted. I have rated this book 5 stars simply because it earned it. However, I do have a quick reminder... that the book's purpose is to EXPLAIN, not to CONVERT."
1,"Clear, Concise explanations I'm planning on loaning this book out to some of my Protestant friends who have misconceptions about Catholicism. Mr. Schreck successfully refutes such notions as ""the Catholic Church puts its own hierarchy above scripture,"" ""the Catholic Church teaches Pelagian works righteousness,"" and ""Catholics deify Mary and the Saints."" Mr. Schreck has done an excellent job of stating what Catholics really believe, as well as presenting the Scriptural foundations of those beliefs."
1,"EXCELLENT! This is an excellent learning tool for those who want tolearn crochet. I'm an avid knitter but want to learncrochet especially in-the-round as I want to make my ownhats and caps, but I just couldn't find a book to get mestarted.This book has wonderful photos and close-ups of every technique.The projects are slanted towards younger adults but can beadapted for any age. A very well-thought-out book and easilyportable as it closes with its own velcro clasp. I highly recommend."
1,"I Laughed The Whole Way Through The First Episode On This The first ep, on the tape is one where a new teacher shows up. If you've ever had a motivational speaker come to your school, this one will be hilarious. He is a perfect exaggeration of the people that always come to mine and I guess that's why I found it so funny. The second ep is where a new disciple shows up. He's totally against fighting and stealing, but is willing to do anything to learn master Happosai's techniques. This one's okay. I laughed a couple times through it, but overall any ranma fan should get this one. Plus Ukyo's in the first ep. My all time fav character. I wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars except it wouldn't let me. This was a great xmas gift."
1,"Pug Fur Real toy, a real charmer! I bought this for my adult friend who has a Pug, she just loves it, it is as cute as a button, all Pug-lovers would get a kick out of this little guy! Great transaction, speedy shipping, would highly recommend seller! Thanks!"
1,"Eternal change and freedom to choose. ""We shall break down all the walls-to let the green wind blow free from end to end-across the earth.""No ordinary SF novel, ""WE"" questions the wisdom of 1920's Russian body politik, The Party. Banned and suppressed there, even today, Zamyatin's distopian nightmare demands of the reader a re-thinking of their rights to choose and the necessity of eternal change, r/evolution.Earnest and beautiful, one man's personal diary of the events surrounding the legislation of mandatory brain operations within a hermetically enclosed city-state, is a subtle, terse and poetic examination of fear of, and need for freedom. I highly reccommended to anyone without hesitation. Zamyatin's philosophical enquiry is personal and lyrical"
1,"Five Stars: Not Sufficient I read ""The Daughter of Time"" as an adolescent, joined the Richard III Society in my twenties, wandered around Bosworth Field at thirty. Found Derek Jacobi's recording at a book sale last year and have listened to it many times since. Hearing a well-narrated book that you previously embraced while reading it is a unique pleasure. The opposite of loving a book, hating the movie. I am sorry that Derek Jacobi recorded no other Inspector Grant than this single book. His Inspector Grant is much different that Stephen Thorne's - they could never be mistaken for each other, and Stephen Thorne's is also brilliant."
1,"Josephine Tey, The Daughter of Time Don't know how I missed Josephine Tey all these years. This is a very unusual, well written mystery. Very definitely a work of its time, as Adam Grant is a detective of his time and place. But well worth the read."
1,"??? I am not a particular fan of the history of the British Monarchy or of mysteries, but ""Daughter of Time"" is an intensely intellectual read, albeit fiction. This is not a story for the passive reader, as it randomly visits different points in time, both ""present"" and past and invokes a series of questions which are ultimatley never answered. The most intiguing element is the supposition that history's account of King Richard III is flawed, either by purposeful acts of those who opposed him, or by mere consequence of events. ""Daughter of Time"" is quite difficult to follow at times and is best read when one is fully alert; a nice pot of hot tea or coffee will help. Not recommended for junior readers unless mystery is their forte'; the story is severely lacking in action although the tale is quite adventurous. See if you can unravel the mystery, if at all possible, then read ""Spring Moon"" by Bette Bao-Lord for a refreshing look at the opposite end of the world/political spectrum."
1,"A Milestone in detective and historical fiction This is one of the 2 or 3 must reads in the entire history of detective fiction. It's also the book that was most responsible for popularizing the revisionist narrative of the life of Richard III. And it's an insightful study into the way history is recorded to suit the interests and prejudices of historians, including the ""sainted Thomas More,"" who is taken to the woodshed."
1,Superb writing. I had only marginal interest in Richard III before but the book was so compelling that you are drawn into the search for how and why Richard got his reputation and now I am a fan of both Josephine Tey (the late) and Richard. Unusual detective story but the characters were so well differentiated that you will read it again.
1,"Daughter of Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme Couldn't resist the Simon & Garfunkel reference.This is easily one of the best mysteries I have ever read, and believe me I do a lot of reading. While admittedly it sometimes gets a little difficult to follow at times, I found the whole premise so different and intriguing from other mysteries I have read that it kept me going. My first thought was it is surprising that other authors haven't really tried to duplicate this type of story, but I think anything would come up short. It's like hollywood trying to remake classics or follow the same storyline (it never works). There is only one ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and there is only one ""Daughter of Time"". I am looking forward to reading another Tey novel."
1,an excellent blast of the past a different approach to what might have happend in the castle when richard III ruled england.you will become your own detective and come to your own conclusions. I looked for more books on richard III ever since josephine tey introduced me to him. Thank you J.T....
1,"The Not-so-sainted Thomas More The format of a ""whodunnit"" is admirably suited to Josephine Tey's critical look at the reign of Richard III, the ambition of Henry VII, and the fact that it's the winner who writes the history that comes to be accepted as fact, whether or not it is, indeed, factual. This book is an excellent companion-read to Thomas More's ""History of Richard III"", puts a new term into my working vocabulary (""Tonypandy""), and shows Thomas More to have more(pun intended) of an interest in his future employment under Henry VII than he did of his life under Henry VIII. Too bad the image of Richard III on the cover is not the image described in the book; it would have been better to not put a new cover on this edition -- and that's my only objection."
1,"Great Product It is a wonderful product, not greasy andleaves the skin feeling smooth.lt does all that itsays it should do."
1,"The Best I gave these silk Pajamas to my dad for his birthday. He told me "" He never felt anything so wonderful in his life"". They are without a question the best pajamas in the world!"
1,Very Peased The pajamas are an excellent quality of silk although I have to admit I have not washed them yet. They ironed easily and look great on my husband. I was impressed with the workmanship and detailed sewing. The 2X I ordered was ample considering at 6'3' and 225 pounds they fit. He is not broad in the shoulders so that problem was solved by having the cuffs shortened. My husband is comfortable in them and that is what counts.
1,ut didn't belive i would enjoy the cool comfort. usually i tend to sweat when wearing cotten but the silk was cooler
1,"Sensational silk! I bought these silk pajamas for my husband for our anniversary, and he LOVED them. They're exactly as described - cool when it's warm out, and warm when it's cool out. He wears them all the time and says they're very comfortable."
1,"Great product, easy to use Pictures are clear, colors are great. Easy to operate the scanner/copier. Color cartridges last a very long time, unlike my previous Canon printer."
1,"Roger Rabbit Great flick...!Only issue is that I live in North America, the DVD did not run on my Bose System...I had to return it."
1,"Still a lot of fun! Not too many family movies stand the test of time...this is one of them! A bit too intense for little kids, but my 7 and 10 year old girls love it. We were watching with their grandfather who got a big kick out of it, too. Christoper Lloyd is a terrific villian and there are plot twists worthy of an adult murder mystery. And where else can you see Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny sharing the screen?"
1,"Incredible !! Not only is Jessica the sexiest woman ever, the movie actually gives a little insite to life in Los Angeles during the time before the freeway system we all know. Most people didnt know LA actually did have a great mass transit system at one time so even though this movie pokes fun at a lot of things it is based on some truths. the coupling of Disney and Warner Bros cartoons was also a first, Mickey and Bugs in the same scene. and did I mention Jessica?"
1,That rabit is the greatest. One of my favorites. I recommend it to anyone with kids. Mine is autistic and he loves it. One of his favorites.
1,"Toon-riffic! This is a DVD you should own if you enjoyed this movie that came out nearly 20 years ago! It offers you the inside story on the behind the scenes production and the animation. It was too bad they didn't make a sequel for Roger Rabbit! Bob Hoskins was wonderful in this film. Still,its good entertainment for everyone!"
1,"Classic movie/Somewhat not for kids/An All Time Favorite. Ok this is THEE best version of this movie. The extras are amazing and you get a behind look on how exactly they made everything.This movie isnt/kinda/ not for kids.Its really adult like humor and also child humor. I suggest parents watching it before they let thier kids watching it.BUT!, if you yourself havenst seen this movie yet... YOUR CRAZY! and you dont know what your missing. I bought this movie just cause its a classic and the extras. And it was a very good desicion. BUY IT!"
1,"Live Changing Film Living outside of San Antonio and having friends involved in this project, I remember these kids being here and having prayed for them. I was not expecting to ever see the inside of the stories unfold. My heart is changed forever. Watching the anguish and the joy of these families who are trusting that these Americans are going to heal their children is overwhelming. The beautiful hospitality of the people who opened their homes to these families was deeply inspiring. Their faith in Christ is shown in this remarkable way that leads these Buddhist families to trust in Jesus Christ and to trust and thank Him. I cannot recommend this to you enough. Please watch it. Be challenged from your complacency and moved to heal the broken hearted. Be warned. If you are a parent, this will make you want to go to your children and embrace them.This dvd was graciously provided by Thomas Nelson Publishers for review."
1,"Shriekback's Organic - All Natural - High Bran Album Shriekback's Barry Andrews is a genius of the highest order. This album has the band ditch all synthesizers (A bold move! Electronics being heretofore their main life-blood.) Andrews' garage sale of the sorts of machines worshiped by pale Englishmen with funny haircuts and their ilk frees him up to add yet another depth to the Shriekback sound. Attempts to express my enthusiasm for works of art like the contents on this CD are ineffable - at least on my part - but I do want to register my 5 stars, and hope that anybody who follows my other recommendations will try this great work of art as well. This is like eavesdropping on Shriekback in a world of no electricity. Thank God somebody was cranking a generator or some such device in order to record this work. AWESOME in the organic, original sense of the word. BUY! BUY! BUY!"
1,"Gamer Love As a Mario fan born in the 80's, this movie is an instant classic in my book. Absolutely loved it, and would recommend it to anyone looking for something fun to watch, especially if you want to show your kids some of the cool things to come out of your generation."
1,"Classic This move brings back great memories from when I was a kid and everything related to the Mario Bros. rocked! I used to play the video games all the time, I watched the cartoon and to then have a live action movie; it was the cherry on-top. This movie may not have won an major awards, but if you've ever played Mario Bros. on NES you must see this movie. It is well worth the cost to own."
1,"Flashbacks My son had been looking for this old movie for nearly a year. I told him I could probably find it on Amazon.com so I went to look and sure enough, there it was so I ordered it for him. I am not a big Mario Bros fan but my son sure is happy with the movie."
1,Just Recived it I use to have this film recorded on vidio and recorded over it and was regreting it. I bought it on Dvd. The quality is exellent and it is in widescreen it's a shame there's no Dvd extra's but it's stil a class film one of my all time favourates. It's based on the video game about Mario and Luigi tryinhg to save Princess Daisy from another dimention where diosaurs are still alive and are trying to get back from earth. I'm also glad that yoshi is on it. It reminds me of the game Super Mario World.It's well worth getting for any Mario fan
1,"awesome movie !!! this is a fun movie! fantasitic special effects, fine actingand lots of fun moments make this a must see! The creature effects were outstanding! if you havent seen this special effects extravaganza yet, you got to!!!"
1,"An Underappreciated Film I liked this movie quite a bit. I felt that it was funny, and the special effects were quite nice. It doens't deserve all the bad reviews it's getting. I highly recommmend it."
1,OMG This is fraken amazingI nearly fillied my daiper when i heard the song=AnesthetizeAmazingly filmed and awesome sound.Best prog Rock DVD I have seencheersKev
1,"A masterpiece of audio clarity The band alone is great, but the audio quality is really something of an achievement. It is a live concert and it sounds like studio quality, definitely a must have for fans and music lovers alike."
1,"Fantastic DVD! The sound of this DVD and the performance are amazing! Fear of a Blank Planet is an album that merits to be performed as a whole musical piece and the performance is unbelieveble. Porcupine Tree are definitely at a peak of their career and I hope that the current peak will last. Way Outta Here, Let's Sleep Together, Anesthetize... All songs on the setlist are actually great. They perform three out of for tracks from the great ""Nil recurring"" as well. A treat for the fans"
1,Amazing Recived the limited edition DVD / BluRay Gray cover edition from PT web site. I am simply amazed by the quality of the video and sound. I have seen PT several times though not on thier most recent tour but this make me feel as if I was there. If you a PT fan this is well worth the investment and if not what a great introduction to PT. I intend to introduce PT through this DVD
1,"Compact book with Amazing Insights Although ""Before you Think Another Thought"" is a relatively small book (less than 125 pages), it's filled with amazing and easy to understand insights about how our underlying beliefs are creating our experiences on a daily basis.The best news is that, although our limiting beliefs have had a great impact on our lives so far, once we identify & explore them, we have the ability to CHOOSE whether or not to keep them as they are, or to change them. If we choose to change them, and replace them with an empowering belief, our lives will begin to change.Mr. Doyle has included many great illustrations & examples to help the reader better grasp the ideas he presents, and has also included an appendix that includes several tools for identifying, exploring and changing our limited underlying beliefs.Overall, I found this to be an interesting, easy to read book with far reaching implications. I would highly recommend it!"
1,"A Manual for Life Excellent, profound, and illuminating. This book provides an easy-to-grasp explanation of what governs our experiences in life. It also provides a simple method to quickly eliminate and replace our unpleasant experiences with what we really want. More than a book, it is a manual for better living that you will want to refer to on a regular basis."
1,"The Best Of All Time! The A-Team wasn't only the greatest action show of all time, but it also had the best original instrumental music of any television show to ever exist! Every song played in the background of a scene fit that scene perfectly. The action has yet to be equaled (even in today's world of special effects) and the music would make anyone who hears it feel energized to kick some bandit butt!"
1,"A ""Must Read"" for Today's Woman! When it comes to defining a woman's role, PAST TENSE has blown through the glass ceiling! Both the protagonist and antagonist are dynamic and determined. . . equal opponents squaring off in a fast-paced, tension-filled arena. I loved the wonderful mix of humor, tension, passion, and surprises! Can't wait to see what the author writes next!"
1,"Basic tool of an educated person - must have A profound, orginal work that changes the entire worldview and saves the lives of many young adults by giving them insight into who they are and how they got that way."
1,"Classic horror This is one of my absolute favorite horror movies of all time...no gore, no heavy, cheesy special effects, just plot and suspense-building to the end."
1,"Not the best horror movie, the best movie. Seen it 40 times. This movie is perfect. It is astonishing that it was made so long ago.The entire movie is a buildup to the final sequence where she accepts the child. Though shocking, we realize it's not the least bit of a surprise - given her devotion to what she carried for so many months.Best line: ""He has his father's eyes"""
1,"Classic One of my favorite horror films, this one had my skin crawling. Beautifully real and subtly terrifying. Watch it and love it."
1,"Rosemary's Baby A subtly demonic tale that builds to a shocking climax. Mia Farrow embodies vulnerability as Rosemary, and John Cassavetes is interesting to watch in a rare mainstream role as her soothing husband. Look for a young Charles Grodin playing a doctor in a pivotal scene."
1,"Brilliant. Certainly on my ten-best list, ROSEMARY'S BABY is one of the most frightening films ever made. The genius of the film is that it juxtaposes the mundane with the most beastly and achieves it with little graphic violence. The carnage occurs mostly off-screen and we see the crowd in the street or hear the terrible news over the phone just as we would in real-life.Polanski plays (or preys) masterfully on natural human paranoia and allows the viewer's imagination to construct the most heinous outcome. Mia Farrow is the innocent who is led by her ""loving"" husband, respected doctor and eccentric neighbors into a woman's worst nightmare."
1,Terrified in Connecticut Rosemary's baby is a horror classic that should not be missed. Mia Farrow and the rest of the cast is outstanding in this tale of broken trust and Santanic eroticism.This film will be loved by anyone who isn't pregnant.
1,"A Face Only A Mother Could Love !! Yes, Devil Conspiracy at it's finest..this is a true 1960ish classic and another epic from Roman Polanski.How the lifestyle of Doris Day becomes satanic..This Devil worship genre was heavy stuff in the mid 1960's coming as it did with the saga of Sharon Tate, Charles Manson and Polanski somehow tied into all of this.Nonetheless murder is murder and this movie is the depiction of darkness, Lucifer, evil with the premise of the birth of the antichrist.Rosemary herself (a witch not by choice), battles endlessly with herself and her emotions as if reason could win.... This movie blurs all distinction between madness and reality as seen through the eyes of Rosemary.A truly remarkable groundbreaking flick that contrasts good and evil, passion and reason, a highly entertaining movie with a a great cast of future stars.The extras are good."
1,"A big hit! My 23-month-old LOVES this sticker book. He has been using it almost every day for a month, and he still loves it. I sit with him while he plays with it to help him bring the edges of the stickers up from the pages. The stickers are losing their stickiness now, but it was a good deal for a month of play!"
1,"Centre Stage-Michael Ball Hit after Hit. A must for all Michael Ball fans. Each new album outdoes his last, yet each are great. The selection of songs is outstanding and each features the true prue voice of Michael in all ranges. Michael again proves he could star in any musical of his choice. His choice of ""Immortality"" and ""Can You Feel the Love"" will totally capitivate you!"
1,"Fantastic! After listening to Michael Ball on the Complete Symphonic Recording of Les Miserables and seeing him again on the Miz DVD, I must say I was very impressed by this CD. He has a very sultry voice that is one that both soothes and gets the blood pumping. I love ""Boy From Nowhere"", ""Winner Takes It All"" and of course the two Phantom of the Opera selections. His vocals are really something else and for a starter Michael Ball CD, this would be the one to buy."
1,"Fantastic album! I very highly recommend this album. It's one of Michael Ball's best. He has such a beautiful voice. His rendition of ""Not While I'm Around,"" is so beautiful. All the other songs he sings are great as well. He also does some songs from, ""Phantom,"". If you listen to it I believe most people would love it and enjoy his voice."
1,"Centre Stage THIS IS MICHAEL BALL'S BEST WORK,YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM ALL OVER AGAIN.THIS CD TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.THE SONG'S A BOY FROM NO WHERE AND THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL ARE MY ALL TIME FAVORITE'S.I HAVE EVERY CD HE HAS MADE,HE GETS 100 STARS FOR THIS ONE."
1,"comprehensive contemporary documentary of China Granted, I have not spent a great deal of time learning about China, nor have I ever BEEN to China. But I was very impressed with all of the aspects of China covered in this documentary. The film packs a lot of information into this little package! Contemporary China may both match your expectations and blow them out of the water. If you want to be entertained and informed about a diverse world quite different from the US, I recommend this film!"
1,Italy revealed Very well done video with different indendant living scenarios by native Italians which makes it even more personal and interesting !Narration by ISABELLA ROSELLINI IS WELL DONE WITH AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FLAVOR.................BEING ITALIAN THIS IS WELL APPRECIATED.
1,Could have used this a lot earlier in life Reading this book-I couldn't help but feel that I've wasted so muchof my life being unhappy by choice. I'll even venture to say thatthe option method could change the world as we know it if more peopleknew about it and practiced it.A book I'll continue to revisit throughout my life.
1,"One of the Best Films of the 80's As Judith, Maggie Smith turns in the performance of a lifetime and oneof the best and most complete portrayals by any actor on film. This isan astonishing film, full of bleak Irish heartbreak, yet with thepromise of hope.Smith is a no less than a revelation in the title role and one cannothelp but route for this desperate character even when all lookshopeless. The screenplay had been fought over for years by actresses ofevery stripe, with, for a while, Jane Fonda, leading the pack ofactresses trying to get Judith onto the screen. It's a good thingMaggie Smith won out.The ensemble cast of actors led by Bob Hoskins is fully up to Smith'sstandard and the emotional wallops this movie packs are big onesindeed.George Delarue's score is simply perfect underlying with the exactweight and gravity - and sweetness - of every situation.When is this thing coming out on DVD? It's simply ridiculous it hasn'tyet appeared.Highest recommendation."
1,"A great bike for the price I paid... I bought two of these bikes, before Christmas and when they were selling for one-fifty, which was an awesome price for an awesome bike. The bikes were relatively easy to put together - you have to install the handle-bars, seat post and seat, from wheel and the front disk brake (the only really tricky part), and it took me about an hour. Everything else is pre-assembled, and that is done very well too.The quality of the bike is just great - everything feels really solid and well-built. My only complaint is that for an all-aluminum frame they are surprisingly heavy, so even with the 21 speeds this is not a good bike for anyone living in a particularly hilly area.But even at two-fifty, these bikes are half the price of comparable comfort bikes at your local bike shop, and you can't even find comfort bikes with disk brakes from what I can see, so that makes the deal for me."
1,"Shredded packaging The bike was every thing advertised and more. It was delivered promptly, but the box was in shreds thank goodness by some miracle everything stayed inside and assembly was a snap."
1,"Captivating! One of the best books I've read in a very long time. The author Nathaniel Philbrick does an absolutely superb job narrating the tragic tale of the whaleship Essex; not only does he give you an up close view of the ordeal the stranded sailors went through but he also gives a detailed (and interesting) look into the whaling business as well as life on the island of Nantucket in the late 1800s. From beginning to end I was caught up in the story, it would be a true shame if ""In the Heart of the Sea"" doesn't become a classic and the story of the Essex's crew becomes lost once more in the mists of time."
1,"Cant believe no one has bought the screen rights to this yet. Excellent read and excellent story.if done right this would be an awesome film.Getting the period right, the ship of the early 1800s, the whale attach and the story of survival -shown realistically and not exploitvily or gratuitious, the whale attack.this is a story begging to be told on the big screen. It would also make more people aware of this story that is, when first told of it, very hard to believe."
1,"In the Heart of the Sea I actually haven't had a chance to read it yet but I will say that anything by Nathaniel Philbrick has to be very good. More to the point, ""In the Heart of the Sea"" did not win the National Book Award for nothing!"
1,"A quick & entertaining read I'm not a fisherman or do I have much interest in boats, the ocean, etc. My brother-in-law recommended this book and I cannot use enough superlatives to describe what an enjoyable book this is. The historical details are intriguing and the story of the ill-fated whaling voyage is truly riveting. Even though you know how it ends, the story is so engrossing that I read this in a matter of days. Bring it to the beach, I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
1,"A RIP-ROARING ADVENTURE! I am only about 2/3 through this book, but just have to say it is the most rip-roaring adventure book I have ever read! It is full of information about the early 1800s, the whaling industry, the sea, and about whales that I have never known. It is all fascinating! Although I am a girl (ahem!), I am loving every word of this book, as I also loved THE ENDURANCE and INTO THIN AIR and A FIRST RATE TRAGEDY recently, not to mention TARZAN, FRANKENSTEIN, etc. from years back. This book is highly recommended whether you fancy yourself an adventurer (armchair adventurers okay) or not."
1,"And we complain about being thirsty... This book is a wonderfully written true tale of the disaster of the whaleship Essex. This crew of Nantucketers and off-islanders endured the most horrible adventure at sea. An enourmous Sperm Whale rams the boat and sends these men into a 90-day whirlwind of starvation, dehydration, delusion, despair, insanity, death, and eventual recovery. The way Nathaniel Philbrick depicts every aspect of their hellish journey puts you at the helm. I highly recommend this book for those who want to know what REALLY happened to the crew of the whaleship Essex back in the early 19th century, and how Melville was inspired to write his famous novel ""Moby Dick""."
1,"Whale Bites Ship This was a compelling story that kept me interested until the last page. Nathanial Philbrick told me more than I ever wanted to know about whaling in the early 19th century and the tragedy of the Essex. The actual sinking of the ship by a sperm whale is stunning enough, but the tale of survival by the crew members was even more remarkable. I would recommend this book to anyone."
1,"a great story well-told and well-researched This is a great nautical introduction for the landlubber. Philbrick does a great job of telling the straight story of Nantucket, of whaling, of this journey, of what happened to the men, and of what happened to their legend.Philbrick especially does a great job of filling-in-the-blanks when the historical record is thin. When the men are adrift with minimal food for weeks, he uses WWII-era experiments to speculate what probably happened to the men's physiology and psychology. He interviews contemporary whale experts to evaluate the likelihood of the reputed whale behavior.Overall, a great story well-told and well-researched, and deserving of the National Book Award. It inspired me to make a trip to the New Bedford Whaling museum!"
1,"worthy of the award I read this book a couple of years ago, but scenes from the novel, masterfully painted by Nathaniel Philbrick, are still with me. Few books in my life have engaged me as this one did. It's the kind you just want to recommend to whomever you can, because you know they're going to enjoy it also. I know this all sounds like hyperbole, but Philbrick, in my opinion, is a gifted writer. He expertly describes the events taking place, and as I was reading I was also making the movie in my head. I think it would be a fantastic movie (unless hollywood ruins it of course).A MUST read."
1,"In the Heart of the Sea Was great,It put you right there with those poor soles,that went through that terrible ordeal.I learned a lot about that time and place also.It was a quick read"
1,"one of the best maritime disaster books I've ever read What a fantastic story told in a fascinating way. I've read many books about maritime disasters, and this one has gone to the top of the list. Nathaniel Philbrick is a great story-teller and meticulous researcher. I'm very, very impressed."
1,"Whale of a book One fantastic book! Expertly written and researched, Heart of the Sea is a must. I read it in one day. Absorbing. Don't miss it. And give it to the children, too."
1,"How does this novel stack up with the Penguin Version? I haven't read this book, but I was wondering how this book stacks up with the Penguin version 'The Loss of the Whale Ship Essex, Sunk By A Whale?' From what I understand, this novel is a retelling of events while the Penguin Classics is the actual accounts of two of the crew members? I'm a bit torn as to which one I should read/purchase. All comments are very much appreciated."
1,Stunning Tale of Old Whaling Days I just finished this last night...wow! The narration is lively and keeps the pace of the story while the author imparts a great deal of information that could have been dull but is not. The prose is so vivid that I could not eat while reading the passages about dismembering the whale; I could almost smell the burning oil and feel the slick decks. Amazing that men made a living this way! I can hardly wait to start Philbrick's MAYFLOWER.
1,"Best book I've read in the last 5 years This is a great peice of work. Nathaniel Philbrick uses a wonderful, empathetic style when telling this tragic story. If you like history, adventure, and sailing you may want to read this one twice."
1,"The ""Demos"" CD plus two tracks Margo Guryan fans, take note : This CD consists of the same material as the ""Demos"" CD on another label, right down to the running order and some of the liner notes. It does include two extra tracks (""Why Do I Cry?"" and ""Under My Umbrella"", neither written by Guryan) tacked on the end, though, so if you don't already have the ""Demos"" CD, this is now the better choice. As far as the music goes : Excellent! Although these tracks are demos, the arrangements are unexpectedly full (strings, woodwinds, backing vocals) and could easily pass as finished commercial recordings. Guryan's vocals are as charmingly ethereal as always and she has a rare gift for melody and nuance in her songwriting. Although many of the songs overlap with those on the terrific ""Take a Picture"", many are heard here in quite different arrangements, making this an essential purchase for fans."
1,"Astonishing contrasts Having heard a live performance of Eight Seasons given by Tasmin Little at De La Warr pavilion,Bexhill was enthusiastic to get a copy. The performance by Gidon Kremer does not disappoint. The Vivaldi is as fresh as ever, far less mannered than the Nigel Kennedy version, and with the revolutionary 'naturalistic' effects of the seasons that make it so endearing a piece played with sensitivity and grace. The Piazzola 4 Seasons of Buenos Aires is similarly responsive to the atmospheres of the city but composed with amazing a-tonal effects. Huge glissandi and sonorous climaxes along with cool, lazy tango rhythms make a complete musical portrait of the sounds of the city. Very exciting music making - very rewarding listening"
1,"Rapturous Parts of this recording are so beautiful that when I listen while working, I have to pause what I am doing and close my eyes. I don't remember how I ended up buying this CD (it certainly wasn't planned), but I am so grateful.My rabbit hates it though. When I listen to it at home, he stamps his feet. So I can only listen to it at work. :("
1,"Wish they still made it This mower used to be made by Agri-Fab, but they stopped producing it. I have one and it is awesome. The blade spins freely, so it doesn't have very much resistence when pushing. All the other Great States / American Lawnmower Company mowers that I know of have contact blades, which dull quickly and make the mower difficult to push. I would check out Sunlawn mowers if I were planning to buy another reel mower."
1,"Hotheads are HOT! SNZ and BBVD are good, but these guys from Minneapolis smoke! In no way are the Hotheads latecomers to the ""swing scene;"" they owe more to the wilder, dirtier jazz of the late 20s. This is actually their third album, with two prior albums (and some minor changes with musicians) as the Straw Dogs. Check it out...you won't be disappointed!"
1,"from the editor of the book I appreciate the favorable comments made by all of the reviewers. For the record, however, in response to Peter George: my note on Stonewall Jackson accurately observes that the Confederate forces under his command repulsed the Union army at the first Bull Run and forced their retreat to Washington. I elsewhere add (chapter V, note 14) that J. E. Johnston commanded all Confederate forces in the battle. Peter Bridges also seems to object that my notes are too detailed, even ""demeaning"" to ""educated Penguin readers,"" yet that my note re. Bailie Jarvie is not detailed enough. I can only reply that my notes are intended to aid precisely those undergraduates who require them, not the pedants who are perfectly entitled to ignore them."
1,Seamless set up I decided to drop my land line only to realize that my Tivo was now very unhappy! I checked out several options for providing wireless connectivity and decided to go with this one. Good choice. It was a breeze to setup and has operated very reliably so far - a couple of months at this point.
1,A definite must have for Tivo owners I live outside the US in Bermuda and having my Tivo connect through my phone lines was costing me a small fortune in international calls. I bought the Tivo network adaptor and plugged it in. Within minutes it had automatically configured itself to my network and now I download all my Tivo updates through the internet which costs me nothing. I am very pleased with this purchase. It was very simple to install and once running you can simply forget about it.
1,TiVo wireless adapter If you can't connect your TiVo using an Ethernet cord then this is the next best thing. This is the only wireless adapter that you should using if you own a TiVo. This adapter was specifically design for TiVo.
1,Works like a charm I hooked it up and it worked immediately...no problems and it was quite a bit cheaper than ordering the exact same thing from Tivo
1,"TiVO just gets better! I ordered a new TiVO box for my living room and then realized I'd have to run some cables which I wasn't looking forward to. I checked the web site and discovered that I could go wireless. This little gem is worth its weight in platnum! I was concerned that it might not work well but I was very wrong. We have three TiVO boxes and now all of them are wireless. I HIGHLY recomend this product. It looks nice and sort of blends into any room. It's easy to install and comes with everything you need. (except a wireless ""g"" router and the TiVO box)Buy with confidence."
1,"Great Extra for Tivo! This thing works really well. It's a little slow but that's Comcast's fault, because their internet service sucks! But this Item is pretty cool and works great too!"
1,"Love it - and generally get 80% reception I would have to use a phone connection for Tivo without this adapter because my broadband source is several rooms away and I'm not going to run ethernet cable through the apartment. The phone works, but generally it only connects once in the middle of the night. With a broadband connection Tivo will connect more frequently at all times of the day - among several other advantages.Techno-novices take note: you must have a wireless router to make use of this adapter, but if your TV is close to a wired ethernet source (as was the case at my old house) you do not need this!Be sure to go into your settings and see what % connectivity you're getting - I went from less than 60% up to 79/80% with a slight change in the angle of the hinged portion and where I positioned the device. It's quite small so it takes up very little room."
1,"Works great We have two of these, used to network our Series 2 and Series 3 Tivos. Easy to set up and use, have had no problems in the 8 months we've been using 'em (and LOVE being able to stream from Netflix!)"
1,"no more phone line This adapter is great. I no longer have to connect to the TIVO service with a telephone line. By connecting through my broadband, I have a lot more options on how to use my service. Set up was easy, and reception is excellent."
1,"Easy as pie Just unpackage it, plug into the back of the TIVO box, and TIVO does the rest (prompts you to change to your wireless router). Simple."
1,Easy! Love it! Easy as pie to hook up and works in a jiff! Great connection and I couldn't be happier with it!
1,great price The Adapter works great with my new HD Tivo and was $30 cheaper than one I bought at Best Buy for my older Series 3.
1,"A Tivo Series 3 Must When we purchased the Series 3 Tivo I had to upgrade the wireless adapter from the one I had used with a Series 2 Tivo. Installation was a snap and it has worked flawlessly. It is absolutly essential in order to view Netflix videos as easy as it is to watch an old TIVO recording. Networking to a computer it makes it possible to transfer programs between TIVO units, transfer programs to your computer, and to publish photos and music from you computer to your TV."
1,Tivo Wireless G USB adapter Love it! It was easy to setup and connect to my home network with no problems. It also works with my WAP encryption enabled.
1,Great Buy Bought this item for half or what a local computer store wanted. Worked right out of the box. Very good product.
1,"Easy to use and Makes TiVo even better! As others have said, this product is very easy to set up. We use it with our Series 2 Duel Tuner Tivo. Now that we're set up on the wireless network we can go to Tivo's website and schedule TV shows for our TiVo to record. We also downloaded TiVo to Go. The wireless adaptor allows us to send recorded programs from our TiVo to our computers (which can then be viewed or transfered to an ipod video or burned on DVD). The wireless adapter also allows us to listen to our favorite podcasts on the TV (this is a feature of the TiVo service), listen to the music we have saved on our computer through our TV and view pictures saved on our computer through the TV. Not bad for price."
1,"Excellent Wireless Adapter for TIVO I've gone through two other adapters, one being DLink which constantly loss the connection or couldnt see my network, this adapter works great. Installation was nothing: you just connect to TIVO and run the network install, the adapter found the network and settings on its own.Highly recommend this one."
1,"Absolutely Perfectly Quick and Easy We plugged in our Tivo box, and realized that we needed a phone line plugged in to obtain up-to-date program guides. Unfortunately, our phone line was all the way on the opposing corner of the room. We couldn't leave the line plugged in, strewn across the floor, so we would routinely have to plug in a phone cord, let it update, then unplug it again. We saw that Tivo had this Wireless USB adapter, but found it much cheaper on Amazon. We plugged it in, Tivo recognized it, we followed the onscreen prompts, and tada!! Couldn't been simpler! An added perk is that, when we bought additional ones for other rooms, not only to we never have to worry about tying up the phone line, but we now have all the Tivo units networked together, so if we record something in the living room, we can watch it in the bedroom! How cool is that! I would recommend this to everyone who has Tivo and a wireless network setup in their house."
1,It works I was looking for a way to connect to tivo without using a phone line. Tivo does not support phone service over Cable so I needed to invest in another way to connect. This is easy to hook up and works well. Amazon had the best price I could find.
1,"TIVO Wireless adapter I was dragging a 75 ft telephone cord up to my TIVO every 10 days or so. Most of the time it could not make a connection. If it did make a connection, it failed to complete download. It was ridiculous.It would call 5-6-7 times and I had to have this cord laying around until it was successful. It took 10 minutes to hook up the adapter to my wireless DSL upstairs. Now, I don't ever think about it. What took me so long!!!!"
1,"Very good value. The TiVo AG0100 wireless adapter is quite a distance from my router but I get fantastic and fast data transfer. The product was very easy to install, it took about 3 minutes."
1,"Almost flawless operation! My husband and I recently purchased a Series 3 HD Tivo and ordered this to avoid having to go the phone line connection route. This adapter works really well with strong signal strength!One issue...I was listening to Pandora one day and it was skipping like a CD (and this happened again another day). I couldn't get it to stop so I just turned it off. I called Tivo's customer service to see why this may be happening, and they said to try unplugging it for 15 seconds and then reconnecting it. This fixed the issue for the moment. They said it's usually a network issue. However, I don't believe it's an issue with my network (as I never have problems with it), and that this adapter sometimes gets off track somehow. I guess I will continue to troubleshoot this way. Overall, it's an excellent product that has a small glitch every now and then. Aside from that, we haven't had any problems with streaming Video on Demand or regular recorded TV."
1,Wireless Adapter--Awesome! Love being able to connect to any of the TiVos in my home from any one of them. It's a great product.
1,Works exactly as advertised! There is little to say about this little item apart from the fact that it makes life with a TiVo DVR even easier and your connections and downloads much faster. Works exactly as described and is a total breeze to install. It looks very low profile and sleek and is small enough to sit anywhere (and disappear) in your a/v set up. Superb product.
1,"Works well with WPA2 I wanted to upgrade my older TiVo-compatible 802.11b Linksys wireless adapter to 54g to get faster transfers between my TiVo Desktop, so, at first, I tried the IOGear 54g USB wireless adapter which I already owned, but it seems that TiVo has made sure that its box will only work (or work best) with its own branded wireless adapter (its website says that the AG0100 is the only one that will support WPA security).If you can get past their marketing extortion and bite the bullet, this attractive adapter works like a gem. I have the popular Linksys Wireless-G broadband router and configured it to use WPA2 security. While the TiVo website only mentions support for WPA for the AG0100, I did not have an issue with compatibility. I simply plug it in, entered my network password, and it connected with a strong signal."
1,"Works great, not that simple to install! This is a great wireless device. The only thing that gave me a hard time was trying to connect it. I had to go into my Wireless router and change the settings from WAP to WEP encrytion. But once that was taken care of, it worked great."
1,"Tivo wireless adapter Great product, works extremely well. My modem is in my basement and the adapter is upstairs. I get an 85% signal strength. Highly recommend."
1,"Thank Goodness For TIVO This TIVO Network Adapter is the ONLY way to go to set up your TIVO. I have my TIVO in my bedroom set up with one of these and my computer is at the other end of the house. I have a Linksys wireless router on my computer and this USB works perfectly!! I have two walls in between the wireless router and the TIVO in the bedroom and it connects to the TIVO service every time. Don't waste your money on other USB Adapters, I did and I had a very hard time getting my previous USB adapter ( a linksys USB adapter) to connect to my network. As soon as I hooked up this little baby to my network...BAM....I was connected. You will not be disappointed with this USB. Trust Me!"
1,"Works great with Tivo Premier I bought the wireless adapter to pair up with Tivo Premier. Talk about piece of cake! I took the adapter out of the package, plugged it into the USB in the back of the Tivo, ran the wireless setup and was up and running. Just be aware there are two versions of the adapter; one for wireless A/B/G and the another for N."
1,"Flawless Connection I was so thrilled with the easy of use for this USB product that I ordered a second one for my older Humax TiVo. I had previously conntected my Toshiba (w/CD Player) to the wireless router for my broadband network. I now have all three TiVo connected where they can ""see"" my router and now no telephone connections. This product worked immediately upon connecting to both my new HD Tivo and my very old Humax. i really enjoy the capability to transfer recordings from one TiVo to another because of the wireless connections."
1,"TiVo AG0100 Wireless G USB Network Adapter for TiVo Series 2 and Series 3 DVRs This product simply plugs into the TiVo, and it works like a charm, utilizing TiVo'z Internet capabilities including Netflix, Yahoo, YouTube, etc.Hopefully TiVo also will introduce a Wireless N as well as thie Wireless G adapter"
1,"TiVo Wireless adapter Works right away, no configuration needed.... Just plug and play. Great price on Amazon too. Bestbuy sells this for twice as much!!"
1,"Does the Job It was inconvenient to arrange a telephone line access where my TIVO is placed, so I bought this wireless adapter. With the additional download and installation of the PC software, I can access media residing on the home network. This was not a driving reason for the purchase - just a nice extra.Installation and use of the adapter couldn't be easier. It was nice to have something work first try.I cannot rate customer service since I had no occasion to use it."
1,"Makes Life Easier Prior to using this gadget we strung a phone cord across our living room to connect our older model Tivo, several times a week. The only thing you really need to know before you buy this product is that it is not WPA compatible, you must set your network for WEP instead. Don't know what I just said? Check out the configuration of your network, and I hope it becomes clear."
1,"Perfect for Access and Updating If you have a wireless connection at home, you need this now. basically, you plug and play - and enter your wireless network's password - and you will never worry about updating your TIVo again. Great reception - I have my wireless box upstairs and on the other side of the house, and the TIVO wireless receiver downstairs and on the other end of the house: no connectivity or throughput issues."
1,"Don't forget your Tivo Wireless G Adapter! Don't forget the Tivo Wireless G USB Network Adapter. If you already have broadband internet access with a wireless network, you can transfer shows between your Tivo box and computer or laptop. The deal from Amazon saved me about 70% over the full retail price offered on the Tivo website. Get it, you won't regret this purchase either!!"
1,"Just Plug it in! This item works exactly as it says, just plug it in and the TiVo recognizes it right away. I bought a different brand before checking the TiVo compatibility chart, and it didn't work."
1,"TiVo Series3 Compatible Just in case there are readers considering the new TiVo Series3 HD box, this TiVo Wireless G works with it too. Mine arrived today and I plugged it right in and in less than 5 seconds, the Series3 had it installed. Very slick the way that TiVo wireless install process works!"
1,"Plug and Play Having never dabbled much in wireless connectivity for a computer, much less for my Tivo, I was a bit nervous when we moved to a house where I couldn't connect my Tivo directly into my router. All of my online research also indicated that the Tivo was pretty finicky when it came to wireless connectivity.With that in mind, I bypassed other wireless bridges and bought the Tivo version. I can't say for sure that the other bridges wouldn't have worked, but the Tivo one works nicely. I was pretty apprehensive, but I just plugged it into the back of my Series 2 Tivo. I just had to change a setting on my Tivo and enter my WEP (or is it WPA? I can never remember) password. Bingo - everything worked like a charm.It was easy - as easy as electronics stuff SHOULD be but never is."
1,"Slightly pricey, but works well without a hitch After reading problems with other usb wi-fi adapters I thought that the additional $15 ( $25 for one obtained from CC or Best Buy versus $40 at Amazon) was well worth it if we did not have to hook up the TiVo to a telephone every night and IT was well WORTH it. Set up was easy and I have had no hitch for the past month. The router is upstairs 30 feet away and the signal strength is >80 %. Unless someone has time to get the wireless adapters locally and tinker with it and return it if it does not function ( what with the current gas prices) I would recommend getting this one. A better option would be using LAN link if the house was hardwired"
1,"TIVO Wireless Adapter This wireless adapter works extremely well. I have used Linksys adapter with my TIVO, but the connectivity was poor and inconsistent. This device if very effective and looks nice!"
1,"Important tip for this unit I've used the Tivo wireless adapter for a couple years on an older box with no problems. I hooked the PremierXL and TiVo wireless adapter up and put the Tivo box's MAC (Media Access Control) address into the router. I have to restrict my network using MAC addresses due to my location.Nothing happened, it could not find my network. Over and over.2 hours later I took the adapter off and looked at the bottom to see if it was the correct one. Well, what do I see there but a MAC address for the adapter. Duh.I added that back into to the routers approved MAC addresses-and it worked first time, right away.Lesson: don't forget the adapter has its own MAC address. And you will have to add it if you restrict your network to certain MAC addresses."
1,Great addition to TIVO Setup was a breeze. It took very little time for the setup and recognition of the adaptor by my computer. It updates with the Tivo server and links to my pictures very well. I'm going to link with my Rhapsody server tonight and don't anticipate any problems. Anyone having Tivo should use it to it's full potential by getting one of these.
1,"TiVo AG0100 Wireless G USB Adaptor I installed this so that I could get my TiVo Hi Def unit to broadband wirelessly. So far, it works great. I have had no problems with the connection to my wireless router."
1,Worked like a charm! I wish this little doohickey had been available the first time I set up my TiVo wirelessly! I originally used a Linksys adapter and spent probably 4 hours trying to get it to work. With the TiVo adapter you just plug it in and continue with the on screen set up. The box recognizes the adapter immediately!Well worth the $50 price tag.
1,works great easy to set up I had this working in under 10 minutes and it works perfectly. Now we don't have a phone cord running across the floor!
1,"Works great The TiVo Wireless Adapter works great. As far as setting it up and using it, there's really nothing to it - Just plug it in and tell your TiVo your wireless ID and Key (password)."
1,"Basically a no-brainer I own two Series 2 TiVOs. Each one had a Linksys WUSB12 wireless network adapter (slowing my entire wireless network down to B speed).I did this:1. Took out the WUSB12 adapters2. Plugged in the TiVO Wireless G USB adapters3. Restarted both TiVOs, just to be safe4. Adjusted my Linksys router to Wireless-G mode (instead of Mixed mode)BAM. DONE. My TiVO-To-Go transfers were now over a gajillion percent faster. ""6 hours remaining"" became ""1 hour remaining"".I have no complaints."
1,"Fast, reliable, easy to set up Had to get this when we canceled our land line. OK so it cost some money, but it let us get rid of the wire, and it works quickly.I was also concerned that it wouldn't be compatible with my wireless network since I run a WPA2 with long complex name and password. But it was a breeze to set up, it connected right away, and the steps getting there were fairly well explained.I'm thinking about getting one for my inlaws, to free up the clutter from their phone line as well."
1,"Works like a charm Absolutely foolproof setup - took about three minutes. I guess it could have taken four minutes if I'd had to try a different network password, but I got lucky and remembered it on the first try. Guess I should include the two minutes it took me to open the box, so I'll say six minutes, tops!"
1,"Great job TIVO !! I was so thrilled when TIVO came out with this wireless adapter !! With cell phones increasingly replacing the need for a land line, TIVO hopped on the wagon. The only reason I had a land line was for my TIVO service. With the wireless adapter, I had my land line disconnected and am happy to save that monthly expense.Adapter works great and I've had no problems with it over the last 10 months or so since I purchased it.It was easy to get working !"
1,Tivo wireless USB Very good product. I paid $20 less than the Tivo site was charging. Very happy with this. My signal between PC and Tivo have no problems once I switched to Linksy's router instead of the gateway that came from Verizon.
1,Excellent I have been using my netgear wireless adapter for the last couple of years with some problems here and there. I finally caved in and bought one of these since the price is now under $40.Worked like a charm. Setup and ready to go in 20 minutes or less.Recommended.
1,"Loved it After moving, I didn't have easy access to an ethernet cable anymore. I needed to go wireless and this was the answer. It's cheaper than the same product on the Tivo site and works well."
1,"great product this is a great product! I am very glad I bought it here rather than tivo.com, it saved me $$$...it was easy to set up and didn't take long for tivo to update with it...we have not set up any of the extra features, but when we have time we will. for now, not using the phone line is all we were concerned with (we switched to Vonage)."
1,"The only way to fly I hooked this baby up to a D-Link MIMO wireless router. It connnected immediately and the entire setup took no more than 15 mintutes. Of course, I did ROFM (a little bit). The router is at least 40' away from the adapter and on another level of the house. Reception is great and I'm streaming Live365 programming to my stereo via Tivo as I type this.Highly recommended product."
1,"Tivo Wireless Adapter - Great Product I changed out my old (but reliable) Linksys USB adapter for the Tivo 802.11g on my Toshiba Tivo DVR and transfer speeds to PC network improved by two and one half times. Very satisfied - plugged straight in, Tivo recognized the adapter and I was up and running. Nice looking product including dual green LEDs."
1,TiVo Wireless Adapter Pros:Works amazing! Love it. Uses wireless internet connection to upload the show times and titles.Highly suggest this product if your looking for a wireless adapter for your TiVo.Was a plug and play periphrial. Plug it in and your Series2 TiVo finds it right away.Great product and experience. Much like every TiVo product I own.Cons:The price seems a little steep but not too bad because it works like a charms
1,works great It works great and the price was cheaper here at Amazon than what TIVO sells it for on their website.
1,simple and easy setup this adapter is pretty good looking.It practically installed itself.All I had to do was connect the cord and tivo popped put a message that it found a network and guided me thru the rest of the process.I highly recommend it.Lets you enjoy all the web features of tivo.
1,"One of Hardy's best works This is a fabulous book written in classic Hardy style. It's full of twists, turns, and surprises. Just when you think you know where Hardy is leading you, he throws in another detail, which leaves you dumbfounded and believing that no other than Thomas Hardy could pull this off."
1,"A classic tale of a man's rise and fall Thomas Hardy's books are somewhat difficult to read, but this book, set in an English market town, is well worth reading to obtain a picture of life in rural England during that time period along with a complex tale of an ambitious man's rise and ultimate fall. A man rising from the ranks of farm laborers builds himself up to become a successful grain merchant and leading citizen of the town. Events of his past emerge to place a shadow over his success, and his greed and some bad judgement lead to his ruin. Like most of Hardy's books, it is a tragedy for the main character."
1,"A Dog With Star Power ""Rhonda Findley and I are the co-authors of New Orleans Unleashed. We created this book, along with the photographer, Vanessa Brown Louvier. There have been some postings giving me more credit than I'm due and suggesting that I was the sole author of the book, which is incorrect. I'd like to clarify that this was a group project. There were no stars, except for Indy the Dog. I hope you all enjoy our wonderful project."""
1,"IN SEARCH OF KNOWLEDGE This book has been one of many great books I have come across it has broadened my mind in so many wonderful ways. My search for truth still continues and not only is this book outstanding but, I do recommend it for those who's' minds are seekers of continuous knowledge."
1,"WHAM! The only thing better than playing frisbee, is playing frisbee in the dark! Especially when the frisbee glows! I'm no serious diskhead but for some leisurely summer evening fun this is the frisbees knees."
1,"this book is a certified pageturner` I am proud of the way Butch made all that money from the streets and while doing it, he exposes the hypocrisy of the government that tries to bring him down. they charge him with running a criminal enterprise, yet the government controls liquor, ""pharmacueticals"", and cigarettes which is equally or more damaging than heroine. This was a story was really one of the best books Ive ever read, honestly....because its based on a true story. Someone needs to make a movie out of this quick!!! I wonder who would play Butch...."
1,"RE code Veronica I kind of missed out on this game. I played every RE games well except for the outbreaks and the gameboy version. I didnt have a dreamcase so i couldn't really get this game. Though i did have a PS2, i really didn't pay attention to this game, rather from 1-5. This game is amazing, the graphics is stunning and the hazy structure adds a scary visual to the game. Lots of gameplay hours and fun. Claire is too legit of a character, much like RE2. Claire should make an appearance in the newest RE."
1,Great curriculum for preschoolers!! This is a wonderful wealth of curriculum for parents who are interested in teaching their preschoolers! It has wonderful Christian resources and I highly recommend it!
1,An excellent performance There is a tendency to write of the musicians of bond as fluff because they are provocative in the way they dress.Like most young people these girls are aware of their sexuality but what I hear in the music is professionals who take their music very seriously.I often listen to this DVD at work and when I can't watch the concert I run the program in the background while I have something else on the screen and I enjoy the performance just as much.A definite recommend!
1,"Good for Violin Lover Starters I heard about BOND with my nephew and I fall in love with these group! They bond to my heart and my fascination of violin music. This is a new concept in violin performance. I recommend this DVD, because you can enjoy music and see the passion of the performance of these girls. I buy a new violin. My children see it and play with them the violin, dance and sing. I am going to buy other BOND presentation. It is a good choice.Vivian"
1,"I love this concert...Bond rocks!! Ever since I started playing the violin, people were raving about this orchestra band called Bond. I borrowed my friend Paulina's DVD of the Royal Albert Hall concert and I loved every minute of it. I recommend this to the people who love violin and would enjoy watching the girls play electric orchestra instruments."
1,Bond performance Good quality of music and great show. Lively modern mix of classical and rock music. If you like electrified classical music you will like this.
1,"Melodramatic and Exciting music + Interesting Performance + Attractive Ladies + Beautiful picture = What else can you ask for? The music goes from melodramatic to exciting. The performance is interesting. The four lady musicians are attractive. The DVD is a beautiful picture. What else can you ask for?The only bad thing is most of the time the sound from the instruments of the 4 ladies is drowned out by background music.Still, they do make classical music sound exciting, and contemporary."
1,"My search for the perfect athletic underwear is over I spent a lot of time trying to find supportive athletic underwear that doesn't bunch up or get sweaty. These are the ones! I use them for Crossfit, running, hiking, etc. They're pretty snug, but keep everything under control and cool. However, I would not want to use these as every-day underwear; they are much too tight for that. The longest I've worn them is about 4 hours on a hike.I'm not certain but it appears these are no longer made by Under Armour, at least under the same name. Luckily I purchased 10 pairs--I've had these for about 9 months and they are holding up perfectly when washed (cold water) and air dried. I'm a size 29 waist, 5'10"", 145 lbs, and the smalls are perfect. Absolutely zero leg ride-up even when squatting, running, etc."
1,Awesome I got these shorts in order to get gear for my first mud run. These are awesome. They kept the mud and sweat out of all the right places. I would def recommend.
1,"Awesome shorts for long hikes and bicycling I use this compression short regularly for longer hikes and bicycle rides. Won't go back to using cotton undergarments for sports - No Chaffing, mostly dry even after long hikes/rides, dries overnight."
1,"My guy loves these I purchased these for the man in my life. Compared to other similar items, these rate the best quality and just overall fit/likeablility. They are holding up well with frequent use and frequent washing. I would recommend these to anyone!"
1,"Love it! Bought two of these compression shorts, it is a great buy! It may cost a bit, but it is worth the price cause it will get the job done no matter what!"
1,again its under armour you can not go wrong if you do not own a pair then you need to trust me get some
1,"Product fine but arried very late it arrived extremely late, to the point where i wondered if i had been robbed. Be prepared for an extra 2-3 weeks on the shipping estimate."
1,Review for Compression Shorts These work so well. I got a black pair for Christmas and needed a pair of white ones for my white soccer shorts. They help so much in recovery and I couldn't recommend them more.
1,"muy bueno el producto excelente el producto lo recomiendo, llego en buenas condiciones. el empaque es muy bueno, no estaba abierto y a tiempo!!"
1,Sleek & Comfortable Design Would recommend over any other brand not because its Under Armour but the fact that it is really great and stays tight to hold everything in place during exercise when using the treadmill or doing some Insanity Workout DVDs. Great Product if your considering this its worth the extra buck because of how durable it is.
1,"GRRREEEEAAATT love them, wwear them all the time, great for working out, if u have any doubts, dont hesitate, and buy"
1,"Work like they should I bought the compression shorts for running and general workouts. The fit comfortably, and are exactly what I wanted. Under Armour makes great stuff, even though it can be costly."
1,"Fit and work Great These are very comfortable and fit and work great. I wear them under my 10"" UA shorts so they don't peek out the bottom like some of the other compression shorts.The compression shorts really help avoid the leg rubbing of shorts or creeping when on the treadmill or elliptical. I'm ordering more."
1,"Excellent product I bought these because I play Ultimate Frisbee, I bought one initially and loved it so I bought another one. I wish they were a little longer but they work fine nevertheless."
1,"Worth Every Penny This was my first purchase from UnderArmour, and I'm sure it won't be the last if the rest of their products are as good as this one. The fit is perfect as well as the support. I'm not knowledgeable enough to talk about the technical features so all I can say is that I'll buy a few more as I can't imagine wearing anything else. It feels that good."
1,"West Coast Jump Blues at its best! If you are a blues fan and have yet to experience the West Coast Blues scene or Little Charlie and the Nightcats in particular, BUY this CD! 'Little' Charlie and Rusty Zinn offer up some smokin' solos on ""Bluto's Back"" that boggle the mind. Once you hear this offering, you'll be back to the store buying all the rest. Great party music! Also recommend Rod Piazza, Rusty Zinn, Kid Ramos."
1,"Boosts milk supply quickly This product is great. Your milk supply will increase just like promissed in 1 - 4 days. The only down side is the taste. I recommend positioning the dropper way at the back of the throat so you don't taste it as much when you drop it in your mouth. After a little while, the taste doesn't bother you as much. It really works, so I truely recommend it."
1,"Lots of Milk! When I started using this, I was a bit skeptical. But within a week I saw a differences. I use to only be able to pump 2 oz at most and after starting with this product I would get 6- 8 oz every time I pumped. Its great! Yes the taste is bitter but the milk starts flowing!"
1,thank you! Great product Just as promised. It really does work . just dont drink anything before or after using it. I highly recommend it
1,"Most excellent This CD is quite a bit different than these guys first CD, but it is the same in that every single song is worth listening to. This CD is a little more mellow than the first, but is still very upbeat. This is one of my favorite albums, it just doesnt get old."
1,Very nice cut and quality Fits me as if it were custom tailored. I highly reccomend this item. I have paid twice as much for shirts nowhere near as good as this one.
1,"TREMENDOUSLY AWESOME MUSIC - MY FAVORITE ALBUM! I listened to this CD multiple times and I never got tired of it. I'm serious I even experienced several *astral projections* because it perfectly resonates to deep relaxation centers and it's hard to explain but it's gorgeous and incredible. I call this album ""mind candy"" because it gives me most delicious sensations and I ""go under"" very quickly and experience profound deep relaxation - to the point I really did have astral projections. It's the most amazing albumn I have EVER heard and I own a lot of CDs of this genre. THIS ALBUM IS THE ONE TO GET YOU WON'T BE SORRY - it's simply FANTASTIC BEYOND DESCRIPTION!!!"
1,"The Last Supper, 1497 is Magnificient! This product was purchased for my daughter and son-in law for Christmas. They love it! I will buy more paintings from this company and highly recommend to others."
1,"Of Mice and Men This book takes place in Soledad,CA. It taking about two migrant workers Lennie and George. George is ""small and quick and dark of face"". ""Lennie, a huge man has the mind of a young child"". George like a father that taking care his trouble son Lennie. Lennie is a trouble maker, he made a lot of trouble. Finally George can't help Lennie and he use a gun point on the back of lennie's head.Read on to find out what happened next.I give this book 5 stars, beacuse I like John Steinbeck's books."
1,"""OF MICE AND MEN"" The book ""Of Mice and Men"" by John Steinbeck, takes place in Soledad, C.A.,during the Great Depresion.The two main characters of the book are George and Lennie.They are good friends.Their relationship is complex and is like father and son.One of the theme of the book is "" Friendship"".This is the case of Lennie and George.But do you think that this relationship will be forever?Personally,I recommend this book because it is interesting,and it is a really good story, I give 5 stars to it.I learned that friendship is valuable and when you have a really good friend he/she can become more than a friend ""a Family""."
1,A wonderful masterpiece Of Mice and Men was a wonderful book that went to the heart of the readers. Steinbeck did a great job of making the reader feel the pain of the tragedy that never should have happened. I give this book a 10 because it was heart warming but sad and it also gave you a good insight on how each character reacted and what they were like.
1,"De Ratones a Hombres Two men travel together looking for work. They meet some workers named Curley, Slim, Candy, Carlson, and Crooks who live in a ranch.Lenny and George have to solve many problems in their lives. Lenny has to go through many difficulties as he is mentally challenged.In this novel we can see how the people from low social classes are treated inferiorly.In this tragic novel only one gets out alive!"
1,"A Lesson in Human Tragedy This piece is ultimate Steinbeck. The author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones. The book is short, however, the tale is told thoroughly. The reader feels so very sorry for George. George is a study of loyalty, decency and patience and how one feels so utterly responsible for the life of another human being-in this case his childhood friend, Lennie, who is somewhat mentally challenged. This book is a sad account of the fragility of human beings and how one person will be loyal to the other person til the end-even if he needs to commit murder to show it. The character, Candy, is so very pathetic too and his comments about "" a stranger killing my old dog"" are so very sad! One tends to think that it was because of Candy feeling badly about a stranger killing his dog that George does what he does. This is a beautiful book!"
1,"George, Lennie and Gary Sinise This audio production for ""Of Mice and Men"" by Gary Sinise is nothing short of brilliant. Over the years, Mr. Sinise has made John Steinbeck's work a part of his life, being involved with it in various mediums: live plays, a film, and this audio recording. As a result, he seems to have developed a deep connection to this story, and a lively and powerful rendering of the characters is what results. It is the perfect performance of a perfect book."
1,"Great book! One of my favorites. I love this book. This was my first Steinbeck novel, and I thought it was great"
1,"Surprisingly good! This books is on most reading lists, and it is easy to understand why. Beyond merely a 'classic,' the book stands next to 1984 as literature that remains good reading long after it was written. The language is modern, the symbolism deep, and the story short but compelling.I've read Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, a book I did not enjoy very much. If you have enjoyed one of his previous books, regardless of the experience, I suggest picking up this book. If you haven't read his other works, I strongly suggest picking this one up first."
1,Of Mice and Men Book This bok was a great value and was perfectly described in the description. There wasm't a single flaw with it and would definitely reccomend buying it from amazon for the great deal.
1,"Outstanding novel I thought this book to be one of the best novels that I've read. I also did a duo interpertation of this book for speech and my partner and I did very well we took sixth in state. Anyone who gave it less than at least five stars can't see the true meanings and feelings that the author intended for this book. It show's peoples differences with one another, but how they can still be connected. This book was awesome."
1,"Of Mice and Men John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is definitely now one of my favorite literature novels that I have read in English class. This book was one that I could actually picture in my head and imagine what was really happening in the story. I found myself not wanting to put it down until I finished reading it completely. George and Lenny, otherwise known as John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, were great characters and each perfect for the part that they contributed in the story. These two characters had a remarkable relationship and the way Steinbeck portrayed it told me a lot. They shared good times, bad times, and sad times together, but no matter what, there was still a connection between them. Though I was required to read it I am now very thankful that I did. It was a great novel and I would honestly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good piece of literature."
1,"A Touching Tale On Man's Tragic Fate. A story of two men contrasting in physical & mental conditions but united in a deep & trusting bond whose dreams are shattered by life's sinister twist;is handled very well by Steinbeck's gifted touch for the realistic.His lyrical catch-scapes prove daunting & impenetrable though,hindering the flow of the dialogues bet. the characters,where the strength of the novel lies.His style of prose fits more for a screenplay,& it's no wonder that the film of this work was done so well.The end is a dissapointment when one has seen the film;nevertheless,the work is a moving portrayal of human relationships in the inevitability of man's destiny & his helplesness in trying to avert it."
1,"Surprisingly Good=)!! This book was one that i wish i would of read when i was suppose to in 9th grade. It was once we reached the middle of the book i realized how good it was. I am one of those students who hate reading those long novels about nothing important. Even though my teacher said it was one of the shortest novels we would ever read! After only reading the middle to the end. I just had to check this book out for myself! Once you begin this book, you may think it starts off boring..but keep going becuase youll never want to put it down. It teackes you about loyalty and friendship in real life situations. This is a book i would read over and over again!.Try this book out..you'll really like it!"
1,"Timeless... The books appears to be merely entertaining until you reach the end. Memorable characters. Excellent ending. Colorful setting. This is some of the best American literture.Also of interest: you know the big dog in Looney Tunes cartoons that always asks the smaller dog to tell him about ""the bunnies"". That character is taken from this book."
1,Always good... When asked I tell people OF MICE AND MEN is my favorite book.My youngest son had to read it for ninth grade English class and was exclaiming over it. I have read it numerous times but not for many years. I bought a copy and read it again. It is always good. The dark themes remind me that the misfits of the world have a place but too often it is a place with tragic consequences that effect us all and always will.
1,"Heartwrenching, Beautiful These are the two words I have to describe this book. It's a short work of genius, and it fully immerses you in its world for the all-too-short time that it lasts. With its masterfully crafted characterization and storyline woven so perfectly, it has you tightly wrapped around its proverbial fingers until its heartbreaking conclusion."
1,A tale of two men Time after time steinbeck has been able to tell a story and capture my attention with great words which flow off the pages. Mice and men is a great story of two men and their lot in life. You'll laugh and cry as you read this tale. And it will challenge you to ask questions you never though were there to ask.
1,"Review of;of Mice and men! This is a tragic story about two friends that travel together. There friendship is unique. These two frineds, Lennie and George make a very good team together. Lennie is a very big and strong person and is very slow but George is much smaller guy with the brains. It talks about their life in farming and how they travel together to make there dream come true until it takes a twisting turn."
1,It was a very riviting book. I could not put it down. I loved of Mice and Men. The relationship between George and Lennie has a very special meaning. The twists and turns of the story kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down.
1,I don't think you should be able to read this until you're 30! I am so very glad that I read this book as an adult for the first time (and had no real idea what it was even about). I read it in one sitting - it is only short and the language is very easy. That is not the challenge of this book!Under an hour to read and oh my god - the ending still makes me gasp...But it is a book that you could probably only read with the intense emotion once and that time should not be wasted on a 17 year old! Once you know the ending it will stay with you forever.This book it a masterpiece.
1,"This is a good book for anyone old enough for the content I liked this book, Of Mice and Men, more than any book I've read in a while. This book was a fast paced easy to understand book that was great for a person like me who doesn't like books all that much. It was a great plot that didn't make me want to go to sleep and had a very unexpected ending that left you with plenty to think about after it was all said and done. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes to read or hates to read, I don't think that it matters. Anyway fantastic book!"
1,Great Character Sketch What is great about this novel is it's simple plot yet complex psychological interplay of the characters who affect each other like a woven mesh. All of them have good intentions but tragedy was inescapable. Real life stuff. Great read.
1,"Beautifully written book This is a very beautifully written book. It's the first Steinbeck book I've ever read, I started yesterday night and just couldn't put it down until I had read it. The words are vividly descriptive and the characters almost come alive in your mind. Steinbeck sort of fades in and out of scenes by describing what is happening in the surroundings, making it a very pleasant experienced to read this book. He picks you up gently in the start of a chapter and puts you down just as gently in the end.The plot is brilliant, I love the story about this odd couple travelling together, the dilemma, a story told with a vivid and subtly humorous language.This is absolutely a 5 star book."
1,"The book that made me an avid reader 602 reviews of this book have been written to date, with an average rating of 4.5 stars! What more needs to be said?The story and popularity of this book are of course well known, so I will briefly tell you my Of Mice and Men story:I was in grade eleven (but taking grade ten English), hated school, had loser ""friends"" who I studdornly refused to disassociate with despite the fact that I knew deep down they would ruin me, when we had to do a reading assignment for English class. Not wanting to be bothered by it all, I chose the shortest one that I could find: Of Mice and Men. My teacher tried to get me to read a longer book--why then was Of Mice and Men on the list then???--but I refused. Well, I read the book and loved it, loved it so much that I have been an avid reader ever since."
1,audio book I loved this book! It was read by Gary Sinise and I love his voice. It arrived quickly and in the condition I was expecting. I'm very happy with my purchase.
1,When I read this book it showed me how love is so important. This book is a really good book and I recomend it to kids to read. It is really showing and it really grabs the reader. Overall this book was well written but has a few flaws in it.
1,"A True Classic One of my all-time favorite books. Appropriate for maybe thirteen years and older. But don't at all think this is a book intended for teens, it's got some adult themes and has a crazy ending worth reading."
1,"I loved this book. I read it in the 9th grade which was about two or three years ago. I loved it. I thought it very well written. I love George and Lennie. I love George's hate/love relationship with Lennie, and how he takes care of him and look out for him even though Lennie gets him into a lot of trouble. I loved the ending and how Lennie was thinking of the farm that George and him have dreamed about. I cried at the end of the story it was so amazing yet terribly sad. You really connect with how the characters feel at or by the end of the novel.thank you for your time,Loran"
1,Beautifully read . . . For those who have never read Of Mice and Men AND for those who have - this is an exquisitely read version of Steinbeck's classic tale.
1,"Reluctant readers will read it... Having taught at an inner city school with extremely reluctant readers, I always found joy in witnessing kids get into this book. I have had students confess they had never before read a ""chapter"" book, but they actually read this one.Steinbeck's characteriztion, his timeless themes, and his crafty step into a deeper world of symbolism and realism reach to students...I highly recommend reading it with the audio tapes as well. Gary Sinise does an outstanding read...There simply is no better George."
1,A wonderful Tale! This book is a tragic tale of two farm laborers who wander around to own a land of their own. They both are an unlikely pair. George is a short and smart man. Lennie is an enormous man with a childish mind. They both are very different yet they have formed a family. They ran away from their hometown to escape the law and started to work on a ranch in the Salians valley but trouble awaits them every corner. This is a great book for the ages of thirteen or over. If you love adventure and fun then you should read this book!
1,"SWEET DREAMS Lennie is big with a mind of a kid and George is a good person,always is taking care of lennie, he is small and black.They have a big dream.This book talk abaut lonliness, love,friendship,discrimination,alienation,disappointment,death,and dreams.It is a good book,i like it because i learned abaut the dreams, something tha everybody has, but some of they came true. I recommend this book because a lot of people have learned somrthing from this book and it is easy to understand the life of the migrant workers.Read it."
1,"An unbelievable work of art! Of Mice and Men is truely one of Steinbeck's most well-written and moving novels. The story is a simple one, with a few others branching off of it. The main plot consists of a smart, young, productive man taking care of a friend who is extremely strong, large, and partially slow. It is a tear-jerking story that I feel everyone should read. If you end up liking this, the movie with Gary Sinise is just as good, if not better! A must read!I conclude with only one negative comment. If you are sensitive about profanity in books, I suggest you not read this. It is packed to the brim... Compared to the book, though, the movie is profanely mild, in fact. A surprising move for Hollywood."
1,"Powerful, wonderful Never required to read this book in school. Now, in my mid 50's have finally read it. It is superb. Great character studies. A short book, but one I will never forget. Makes me hungry for more Steinbeck. Is densely packed with incredibly colorful descriptions, yet still leaves room for one's imagination to fill in some details. Probably can appreciate more now than would have in high school. Steinbeck was a genius."
1,"Great What more do you want? its a simple paper back book, looks good, decent enough cover, what else? its a book"
1,"A good book of a strong friendship. I think the book ""Of Mice and Men"" was a really good book. It is one of my favorites. I like it because it emphasizes the great friendship of these two guys that are trying to make a livng after the depression when money wasn't worth much. I thought it was interesting how John Steinbeck chose to have the setting of this story in Salinas and that's where he was born. I think George is a strong character and his good qualities are useful in my years to come."
1,"""Of Mice and Men"" The story, Of Mice & Men was a laid back but humorous. I thought it was a great book. The characters all were individual. They all had their own distinct personalities. Lennie was my favorite character. He was a big guy that wasn't to bright. Actually I felt bad for him. I also felt bad for the mice he killed. Well the story is mostly about two guys working on a ranch, but dream of having a place of their own. Lennie who was strong but had a mind of his own, wanted rabbits. He couldn't get off the subject bout those rabbits. I really liked the book but the one thing I didn't like was how it ended. I was hoping that they would get Lennie's dream about having a place of their own and livin off the fat of the lan."
1,"One of, if not , THE best book i've ever read! Of Mice And Men is one of my alltime favorite books. It is so thought provocking, and is a book that should be read by every one. So If You haven't read this book, do yourself a favor, and read it!"
1,the BESTEST FILM EVERRRRR!!!!!!! this is an absolute MUST SEE for both the morrissey-obsessed and morrissey-hater... Jackie Buscarino and Eduardo Acosta are hillarious!!!!!!!!! i think i could watch this movie 100 times over.
1,"Absolutely adorable summary of wildlife in the desert! This fun book tells ""lyric-like"" tales of some of the main creatures found in the southwestern desert. You can almost hear music when you read it! It's very clever! I highly recommend it for toddlers to second graders. The illustrations are great too. A really cute book!Desert Songwriter/Patty Horn"
1,Nice! I really like this cookbook. It's not overwhelming. I have already made a recipe and it turned out really good!
1,many resources many of the names are still out there for resources. would prefer a newer edition for assisting client in our area
1,"Fast and fun Andy Borowitz is a precious national asset - a hip, modern-day Will Rogers whose hilarious new send-up of corporate culture and the nation's ongoing corporate corruption scandals adds up to insightful and hilarious social commentary."
1,Great CD - You will NOT be disappointed Excellent Service. Fab CD. If you have never heard Walter Jackson sing then that is why you probably don't have any of his cd's yet. Phenomenal!
1,"Laura Todd is hunting for treasure . . . well, actually she's hunting for a mysterious heir who's going to inherit a fortune, if she can find them. Devlin Rafferty is hiding in Ireland, trying to heal emotional wounds that threaten to tear him apart. Ultimately, Laura finds her heir, and a love she never believed possible on the Emerald Isle. But is Devlin's love strong enough to overcome his pain? I laughed, and I sniffled as I read Laura and Devlin's story, Sex, Lies and Leprechauns . I'll be watching for Renee Roszel's new releases, and her extensive backlist."
1,Best High School/Basic College Math Dictionary available Simply put this is the best math dictionary out there for the high school level and for most college students. Maybe there are some more appropriate ones for upper level college math/science students. I have found the descriptions and links in the text very clear and appropriate for most students. I greatly prefer this one over the Oxford math dictionary.I highly recommend it for high school math students (and make sure you keep it until you are done with college). When more detail is needed beyond this text there's always google.
1,"HILARIOUS!!! Just from watching the previews, I knew that it was a good movie. Little did I know that I was wrong. This is the best movie to watch with a boyfriend/girlfriend. It's classic Adam Sandler comedy along with Drew Barrymore charm!"
1,"Loved It--Just Loved It (What an adorable movie) I saw the previews on TV for this movie and finally talked my husband into renting it. (He usually pick out all the movies and they are usually kick-em-up types or blow-em-up ones.) My husband rented 3 movies that night, and this one was a ""token"" chick flick ""for me.""He put off watching it the first night, but the second night we watched it because the other movie was way too long. We were both moved by this movie and came away absolutely ""in love"" with it. My husband even had to admit that ""my movie"" was an ""us movie.""This movie is just really fun to watch and takes you on a journey that involves so many emotions--just what to look for in a good film."
1,"Touching Film Adam S. and Drew B. make a bangup team in this movie! Drew is beautiful and quite an innocent soul. It had a satisfying, yet surprising ending. A good twist.It's refreshing to watch a comedy with characters who HAVE character. Makes for an uplifting viewing.Drew B's character wakes up every morning thinking it's her father's birthday . . . the same day in which she had an auto accident that injured her memory.Adam Sandler falls for her and figures out a way for them to live happily ever after.Heartwarming and hilarious!"
1,"Awesome movie, already watched over 60 times!!!! This is the best movie I have seen in a LONG time, I dont know what it is that has made me watch it over 60 times already, and I am far from being sick of it, I seen it 4 times in theatres and I waited the 3 months until the day it was released to buy it, if you haven't yet seen it, watch it, better yet buy it, you wont be dissapointed, and I promise you no matter how many times you watch it, it is still as great as the first time!!!!!"
1,Equal Parts Romantic and Comedy Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore give memorable performances in this very funny romantic comedy. Don't worry guys this isn't a total chick flick just kinda. This movie was shot in the very beautiful state of Hawaii. Of course the Sandman makes this movie very worth buying.
1,"great date movie. my husband and I went to see this movie, and it had some great laughs, we love adam sandler and drew barrymore in the wedding singer and loved them just as much in this movie."
1,"Already a classic! This movie is nothing less of a classic. It's the kind of feel good movie that reminds you there really are good and loving people in the world, eventhough the man of your dreams is also well known for the ""Turkey Song""."
1,50 First Laffs it was a lol. (laugh out loud) i tell ya. it isn't rated R it's a 13. pg-13 that is. i loved it it was like so funny i couldn't like stand it it was like that good i could not stop laffing. i like to spell laff and laffing the way i am spelling them. and i love this film and my brother met adam sandler.
1,"im still lmao I love this movie! It was very funny, yet sweet and touching. Altough the ending was a bit shocking to me,I'll be first in line to buy it when it comes out. Adam and Drew work great together. Hawaii is beautiful, the soundtrack rocks, and this movie is awesom! GO SEE IT!! GO NOW!!"
1,"fifty first dates i love adam, drew,rob, missi and dan and everyone else in the movie.i love how adam sandler uses all of the same people in his movies.i hope they all keep making these great movies."
1,"Adorable Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler turn their adorable charm up to full blast and its enough to carry this film over the bridge of believabilty. I can't imagine the pressure trying to make someone fall in love with you everyday-then again-maybe it's something that we all should strive for. Surely a task like that would lower the divorce rate. Whenever I run across this film I can't help but smile. That's a good thing, right? Highly recommended."
1,Great product This is by far my favorite perfume. Glad to see I can still purchase it! And at an affordable price!
1,"Best. Cookbook. EVER. After all the decades of my life, I have found the perfect cookbook. The recipes are simple, but it is all in the doing. For example, the way to prepare a pot roast is clear and very simple, but it is all in the way to do it which leads to the best ever potroast that I have made five times now. The amount of cholesterol in this book may make you blanch, but cover the eyes of your doctor and just do it. Eat lots of salad in addition as penance and you can get away with the wonderful recipes of this book from the 40's."
1,"$99- what!?! I have this cookbook and I love it and want to buy it for another couple. The recipes are really fun, very good, and well organized. But $99-- what the heck? Doesn't anyone sell a new copy of this for less??"
1,"Great book! Finally, a cookbook that lets us cook together! The recipes are great, the instructions are clearly described for two people, and the meals are delicious. Cooking has never been more fun. The pork roast is fabulous. We're looking forward to preparing the Ultimate Valentines Day dinner. We also loved the ""Marinating the Chef"" concept."

1,"Vincent: Insightful and brave journalist I met Steven Vincent days after In the Red Zone had been submitted to the publisher. His personal reflections from 9/11, when he stood atop his apartment building and watch the second plane hit, brought tears to my eyes. But that was nothing compared to his remarkable insight into Iraq from his journeys there. Fresh from returning and putting his thoughts into written form, he regaled me for hours with what he learned and what all Americans must know about Iraq. I cannot recommend In the Red Zone more highly."
1,"Running With Sally's Brilliant First Album Evocative of, yet arguably exeeding, the lyrics of Bob Dylan's Time Out Of Mind and the master musicianship of Wide Spread Panic's Ain't Life Grand, The First Sally melds rock with funk and country in a challenging, roaring, at times careening, completely enjoyable musical experience. The album captures the energy of one of the best live acts in the West. Trevor Clendenin and Chris Sheldon's vocals take center stage amidst musicianship pushed to the limits on such Sally staples as Cadillac, Cowboy Vai, and especially the Denver radio favorite Porno Music. Do -not- miss the chance to listen to this first work from Colorado's best rock and roll band. Also check out the Sally's website for tour dates throughout the Mountain West and for a release date on thier soon forthcoming second album."
1,"BEST MACROECONOMICS TEXTBOOK AVAILABLE Among all the textbooks I have seen in economics, I have found Mankiw's to be the best. It is clear and concise, addressing all the important intermediate issues in macroeconomics. The description of concepts is simple, and the book benefits from a three pronged approach to teaching - graphical, mathematical, and anecdotal. The student is free to choose whichever one he feels most comfortable learning from."
1,"Vintage Barry White My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed this CD. Excellent condition, packaged well, more than expected."
1,"Topper is Tops! ... it's become my favorite video. Joan Blondell and Carole Landis--the ""poor man's Betty Grable""--are great as the two party gals who go to a spooky old mansion to claim the inheritance that Landis has been awarded. Billy Burke as Mrs. Topper is a scream and so is her side-kick maid, Patsy Kelly (no one could do a double-take better than patsy) and Rochester, as Cosmo Topper's man servant is hysterical. The beautiful camera-work, the women's gowns, the top-notch special effects and the hysterical sight-gags ranks this with the best of Abbott and Costello comedies. A terrific excuse to while away an hour and a half when you're feeling down or bored. Best Scene: the playful seal and Rochester."
1,"topper returns What can I say, my wife and I love these types of old movies. Its great to get out of the every day stress and have a few laughs."
1,"Topper Returns Topper Returns was great clean fun. The actors were great. I loved every minute of the movie. My only complaint was a film problem with a short section of the tape itself. It in no way reflected on the quality of the acting, the problem was a bad tape."
1,"Wonderful! I love this movie! I hadn't seen it in years, but remembered loving it, so today I watched it. I love it. It's funny, mysterious, and dramatic. Plus it's always nice to watch an oldie and realize how different they are from today's. I would definately reccomend this!!"
1,How cute! What agreat idea! Usually I absolutely Hate Baby Bratz Dolls But this is a doll you gotta buy! I'm countin on ya to buy the doll reader!
1,"loverly story i found the book in a car boot sale it is over a hundred years old ,it was a bit hard with the text,being old ,i had to read the book twice for it to sink in ,what a story best one yet,especialy that it was written so long ago,i havent read the new version, but if its like mine you will enjoy it happy reading ."
1,"BEAUTIFULY PUT TOGETHER! Her songs are beautiful they flow and the music and words are something you can relate to personliy i enjoyed it very much and you should listen and buy it. some songs that i really injoyed were white houses, annie & who's to say."
1,"Another Great One! Vanessa has done it again! I have been listening to this CD almost non-stop since I picked it up today and I LOVE it! The songs are even better than the songs on the first album (my favorite CD of 2002). You can tell that she has matured as an artist and I can't wait for more. Make sure you check out ""Who's to Say"" it's great."
1,this album takes awhile to get used to This is an even better album than Be Not Nobody - the lyrics and vocals and everything about it is superb! It's not radio-friendly pop like Be Not Nobody was. Fav songs on this cd are: Annie and Half A Week Before the Winter.
1,better and better Vanessa has definitely changed and it shows in this incredible Cd. I havent taken this CD out of my player yet. It is quite different than her first.. but similar at the same time. The songs are deeper and darker.. this is very apparent later on in the disc. The content is very real .. nothing about this is fake or pretentious. This is a calm cd and moody as well.I saw Vanessa in concert 11-03-2004 at Joe's Pub... if you getta chance I recommend going to check her out.. shes unbelievable.If you like Vanessa's whole debut and not just 1000 miles.. then I think you'll love this cd as well. You can expect her material always to be true to who she is and not some industry garbage. If you truly appreciate piano and real vocals and true talent.. take a listen...
1,"wow Will and always will be a nessaholic forever. i love this album more then her first album..there seems to be a extra track on the european version of the album. Its called ""the streets have no name"". favourite tracks are white houses, whos to say, afterglow, san francisco, private radio and the streets have no name."
1,"harmonium reviewwwwwww!! this album is absolutely amazing! don't worry vanessa carlton i didnt rip you off! I heard the whole album on MSN then went to download the song called Who's to say. after that it was so amazing i went to buy the album! Now who says downloading is a bad thing after all :)anyway the piano is really cool. vanessa carlton is looking better than ever too. and the video inside the enhanced cd is absolutely amazing too! after watching it, it changed my impression of vanessa carlton and i respect her a lot as an artist.. thanks for the great music!-brandon"
1,"Great Second Album! My daughter and I loved Be Not Nobody, and we love Harmonium too! My daughter hasn't stopped listening to the cd since I bought it, and neither have I. We strongly recommend it to everyone."
1,"Harmonium: The Second Coming of Vanessa Carlton Harmonium is such an incredible record, and it completely exceeds my initial expectations for Vanessa Carlton's sophomore album. It is a little different from 2002's Be Not Nobody in the sense that we are allowed to take a deeper look into Vanessa's beautiful, and sometimes dark, soul. I would have to say that most of the treasures on this record are the more upbeat songs. Some of these songs that steal the show are the bittersweet White Houses, a summer song about friendship, love, and loss, and Who's to Say, a song about choosing between family and a relationhip. Also, though a little dark, Annie shines on Harmonium. If you are not already a Nessaholic, you will be once you hear this talented ivory tickler show off her gift. Harmonium is in stores now, so go out and pick it up now!"
1,"Vanessa Carlton's Harmonium This is the best album I've heard in a LOOONG time. I love the energy of ""Private Radio"", the beautiful reflectiveness of ""White Houses"", and the sarcasm of ""Ces't La Vie"". I recommend this to anyone who wants music that's real and isn't poppy fake. :)"
1,"Take a Look `The Looking Book' is the perfect title for this cute story about a boy looking for his cat. Young readers will have a great time helping Ned look for Pistachio through twenty-eight pages of colorful, collage-style illustrations.""Of course you know it's not much funTo lose a cat upon page ONE.""The rhyme and rhythem in this book make it perfect for reading out-loud while the kids search the page for Pistachio. They'll find him popping out of a cupboard door, disguised as a castle guard or camelphloged in a monkeys cage. Of course Ned never seems to see him and enlists the help of a courtly queen, a memory-challenged old man and a faithful horse (who eventually gives up on page twenty-six). This book is a fun adventure with great giggle potential."
1,"A guide for those coping with repeated harassment Detective Mike Proctor teaches readers the basics of defending themselves in How To Stop A Stalker, a guide for those coping with repeated harassment by potentially violent individuals. From why stalkers follow their victims; to what to do if one is being stalked; the collection of evidence; getting the justice system on one's side; what to do in court, and so much more, How To Stop A Stalker is an absolute ""must-read"", and bears the very highest recommendation for men and women alike -- because statistical data indicates 1 out of 12 women and 1 out of every 45 men will be stalked in their lifetime. In our troubled times of having to also deal with the threats presented by domestic and foreign terrorism, How To Stop A Stalker is even more relevant to the lives of ordinary citizens and could well save your life and the lives of those dear to you."
1,"If you are being stalked you need this book Mike Proctor demonstrates that he understands the issue of stalking completely. This is the best resource I have found to facilitate effectively working with law enforcement and prosecutors and using the criminal justice system to protect victims from their stalkers. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about stopping their stalker or stalkers. Stand up and fight these bullys - stop living in fear, believing that you are powerless to stop them. You can do it!"
1,"Calming and Aromatic Heat these in the microwave and have them set out where you are going to sit watching TV while you moisturize your hands after a paraffin dip.After dipping your hands, you can then place them in a plastic liner or plastic bags work well too. Then, place your hands into these mitts.Your moisturizing results will double when you continue to heat the paraffin on your hands. Spas tend to use electrically heated mitts, but these don't need to be plugged in and are also calming and aromatic because of the herbal mixture inside the gloves.~The Rebecca Review"
1,"WOW!! GREAT CD CLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY My goodness, this is a WONDERFUL cd, I would HIGHLY recommend Clay Aiken!!!!"
1,"REFRESHING!!! I decided to ""go for it"" and take the plunge and buy this CD not knowing what to expect. Let me tell you, I AM SO GLAD I DID! I absolutely LOVE this CD. Clay's voice is incredible and the music is so relaxing. It is the best album I have bought in a long time. My 5 kids even like it ; ) You will not be disappointed if you love Clay Aiken's voice."
1,"RUDE Dork Rock...Please keep your cruel, gross and nasty remarks off here. You show your real character and it is so totally opposite of Clay and his fans. Grow up and find another web page to be so rude. We all wish Ruben well but PLEASE, children read these reviews and it is just not appropriate. I happen to think Clay is one of the best vocalist's to come along in many many years..and it is my right to have that opinion, as it is the right of others to respond positively to those singers they enjoy."
1,Clay knows how to do it! how can anyone use words to describe clay?? WOW!!! i can listen to his songs over and over and over again!
1,"Best Pop Album of the Year! This is easily the best pop album of 2003. This CD showcases Clay's amazing voice with catchy pop tunes and beautiful ballads. I absolutely love this album -- every song!One of the amazing things about Clay is that my 18 year old daughter and my 68 year old father love him, too! Very few of today's artists have such wide appeal."
1,Even more than I expected! If this doesn't go platinum quickly I will be surprised. I don't think I can say enough about this album. It's just great!
1,"Measure of a Man This is a fantastic first album for the ""real"" winner of American Idol. This album has none of the American Idolish songs and Clay's vocals are outstanding. This album will set a record for one of the quickest selling albums in music history. Don't delay -- get your copy now!!!"
1,"Clay is a one of a kind! I love this CD. the song ""measure of a man says it all!"" There are so many people out there that judge people for what they have an not who they are. All of Clay's songs touch your heart! FINALLY someone that is in the spotlight that doen't dress and act like trash! He said ""I will never do anything that I would that I would be ashamed of"". There are not to many performers out there these days that can say that! He is a one of a kind! He has a truly loving and caring heart! Clay Aiken is what this world needs and this CD is the best CD I have heard in a LONG time! If I had kids I wouldn't be afraid for them to listen to it! Clay is the best! Keep up the great work Clay! And stay true to your heart!"
1,"The Revolution has begun After all the hype and the anticipation leading up to this record, I was sure I'd be disappointed. However, after just one listen of the entire cd, I have never been more happy to have been proven wrong. This cd is fantastic! It is such a solid pop album! Every song is good...many boarder on great. He takes risks on some of the song selections, but he still manages to give the fans what they want and love. Is there a slight element of ""cheese"" to the cd? Sure, but if anyone can pull it off, it's Clay Aiken. He pours his heart and soul into each song, and, just like AI2, he makes you feel like he's singing each song just for you. Bravo, Clay! You've made your fans proud, and you left us all begging for more! Can't wait to hear the next one!"
1,Measure of a Man I find that the judges on American Idol got it ALL WRONG!!! They chose Ruben because they thought he could hold the attention of the people buying the CD's. They were also wrong with Kelly Clarkson. Clay has a voice that crosses all lines and he can sing any song put in front of him and his new CD shows that TALENT. Ruben can only sing one style of song and that will be his undoing. I see CLAY around ten years from now and Ruben a vast memory. I recommend this Album wholeheartdly and and glad that my kids can listed without fear of profanity and other vulgar words.
1,Bringing it back! Clay's album 'Measure of a Man' is such a treat to listen to. Pop music has gone down hill in the past 10 years and it is so refreshing to be able to listen to Clay's voice and actually hear the way should be made. Let us hope that Clay will bring back the good ole music! The whole album is truly fabulous.
1,"The REAL American Idol I am so pleased with Clay's CD! I had no idea what to expect from this album; I just knew I wanted to support Clay (because he was my fav on American Idol). However, I was blown away by the songs and that wonderful voice of his!! My favorite songs are No More Sad Songs, Run to Me, Perfect Day, and Measure of a Man. This is not an album full of ballads - there is a lot of variety, but they all highlight Clay's amazing voice. Buy it - you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Measure of a Man Clay Aiken This is a terrific CD. It is easy to listen to, has perfect songs, and makes you want to play it over and over again. Clay does a fantastic job. His voice is incredible with such power and range. All songs are unique to Clay and sang as only he can! AMAZING singer and fantastic songs! GET IT NOW!"
1,Amazing This CD is AMAZING there is something in it for everyone. Clay is SO talented and I'm glad that he uses it in a positive way. It is nice to finallly be able to look up to someone. THis album is probally the only TRULLY clean pop album that I have ever heard!!! This CD is so good. All the songs are GREAT!! Every song is different in it's own way. I totally give it 5 STARS!!
1,"MUSIC Makes Sense I haven't had a CD that I haven't skipped tracks. Even if it's the best of. Clay Aiken had come up with BEST of CLAY on HiS FIRST RELEASE. It's combination of not just pop songs but mix of danceable tunes(Invisible), Country (Perfect Day), Oldies (I Will Carry You), Rock Ripped (No More Sad Songs), Sexy (Touch), Edgy and heart twisting(I Survived You). There is a story in every tract and Artist let's you be a part of that Journey. Fans and Avid Music Listener would not be disappointed. Why are you still reading.. GO BUY ONE and HEAR for YOURSELF."
1,"measure of a man i couldnt wait for clays album to come out, and i was not disappointed. after listening to some of the garbage the music industry produces today, this album is one that i dont mind my kids listening to and this is an artist my kids can ""idolize"""
1,"A Must Have For Your ""Good Music"" Collection! I was concerned about Clay's ability to enter into the pop world, given the songs we fell in love with on AI. My concerns were eliminated the second I pushed play. Amazing album, that captures many of his talents, without overdoing it. I was instantly captivated by the lyrics, the melodies. Absolutely love all but song No. 4. Highly recommend that you add this to you and your family's collections."
1,Wow This CD is a must buy. Doesn't these songs sung by Clay Aiken already show that HE was supposed to win American idol? I give this cd a 5 stars. AMAZING! I can't wait till his next album
1,"A New Pop King Has Been Crowned!! Clay Aiken is everything the music world has been searching for! He has morals that equal his dynamic vocal range. From the beginning note of ""Invisible"" to the ending note of ""Touch"" Clay Aiken brings you into a world where good things do happen to the nerdy guys and the runner-up does finish 1st! If you are searching for a true pop superstar...you will find him in Clay Aiken. Every word of every song comes from his heart and can actually be understood! This guy is awesome and I congratulate him on his outstanding 1st album!"
1,"Not bad, not bad at all! This album is flawed, but is still excellent for a freshmen album. The songs have great lyrics and catchy tunes. This is not boyband. Boybands couldn't sing their ways out of a paper bag and all their lyrics contain may 5 words at the most. Clay actually can sing WELL and his songs are meaningful, especially MOAM. You get a variety from teen pop (Invisible) to rock (I Will Carry You, No More Sad Song, I Survive You) to even Beatlesque (Shine) and SALSA (Touch)!! Of course there are the beautiful ballads too. Get this CD, you won't be dissappointed."
1,"Measure of a Man I first fell in love with Clay's voice on American Idol. He has a rich, powerful voice with a wide range. I think he can take almost any song and make it sound wonderful. I think he proved that on American Idol. His voice is appealing to people of all ages. I am 62, my Mother is 86, my four daughters are ages 33 to 39, my granddaughter is 12, and we all love his voice and music. My husband is 63 and he admires him as a wonderful, refreshing new talent with a marvelous voice. I loved his CD, Measure of a Man, so much I bought 10 of his CD,s to give as Christmas gifts. I wanted to share something I loved with someone I love. May God continue to bless him and enrich his life. May he always stay the wonderful wholesome young man he is today. That's my Christmas wish for him."
1,"That's the most inaccurate review ever by Jaan There is no way that Amazon's reviewer can compare Clay to talentless boybands that rely on catchy background music and over-exaggerated dance moves to move CDS. Clay has real talent, something that boybands sorely lack. Even Ruben Studdard, the American Idol champion cannot come close to Clay in terms of voice quality and pure singing talent. IMO, Clay deserves his success, this is a fabulous CD by a very talented singer. And his performance at the American Music Awards was simply stunning, why else would some members of the audience give a standing ovation? Remember that the audience was made up of singers and entertainment industry people, and i'm pretty sure they weren't applauding Ruben's performance, good as it may have been, Clay was just simply spectacular. A great singer and a great CD, they don't make singers like this anymore."
1,"Measure of A Man I love this album! In order, my favorites are: Touch, Measure of A Man, No More Sad Songs, I Will Survive You and Invisible. In my opinion, these showcase his voice the best."
1,"AWESOME! WOW THIS CD IS AMAZING! I WOULD BUY 700 OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE SO GOOD! I LOVE CLAY AIKEN! THIS CD BLEW ME AWAY! WOW, WHAT A VOICE!"
1,"Clay come through with a Strong Breakout CD This CD definitely secures Clay a place in the music industry. He has strong vocals, that would make you think he's been in the music business MUCH longer than American Idol has been on TV. Clay is a singer who has a future, keep watching, he is already good, and will likely get better."
1,"DHGM CLAY IS THE BEST I'VE HEARD IN YEARS. I just love his voice. It's clear and he sings soooooooo well. Love his album. I'm sooooooooo happy he sold over 600,000 in a week. Wish him the best in the future. I excited for him to do another album in the future. His voice is the best."
1,"As great as I expected Clay Aiken has an amazing God given gift! All of his songs are well done and decent songs. They have nice lyrics that in no way would offend anyone. As a mother with small children, I would recommend this to everyone! Clay's phenomenal voice is one I could listen to every day, and have ever since getting the CD last Thursday! He has amazing range and diversity! Do yourself a favor and buy this one!"
1,Great cd! This is a great cd. Clay's voice is wonderful and the songs really grow on you. The people that gave this cd a bad review were either tone deaf or are Ruben fans that are upset because Clay will sell more cds then Ruben. Clay should have been the American Idol winner and the sales will prove it.
1,great pipes Clay Aiken's great set of pipes and classic style are a win/win for this CD. The CD has a variety of songs in different styles and is appealing to all ages.
1,"Clay is awesome once again! What a performance!!! Clay sang ""Invisible"" in 2003 and then ushered in the new year with ""The Way"" from his CD Measure of a Man on MTVs 2004 show. He was totally awesome! Even though Clay has not personally written these songs, like on AI-2 he takes them and makes them his own!Way to go Clay in 2004!!! I would buy this CD"
1,"My BEST Christmas gift I received this CD as a gift for Christmas, and all I that I can say is WOW! Whenever I had the chance, I listened to Clay during the American Idol competition and my opinion was that he should have won.I enjoy all of the songs that are on this CD, but my favorites are ""The Way,"" ""Invisible,"" ""I Survived You,"" ""Measure of a Man,"" and of course, the smash single from the summer, ""This is the Night."" I can't wait to wear out this CD in my cars CD player and my CD player at work. No worries though, if I wear out this CD I will just buy another one!Buy this CD, because IT IS EXCELLENT! No one else out there even comes close to the talent of Clay Aiken. He will be around for a long time to come!Oh, and Janet, thanks for giving me this wonderful CD! :)"
1,"Clay Aiken Has The Voice Of A Lifetime I love this CD and couldn't wait for it to come out. I have loved Clay's voice from the first AI tryout. It just seems that anything he sings becomes a beautiful song. I have listened to the first CD so much my family is ready to kick me out. They are just glad I am playing a new one. This CD has great songs that any age can listen to. I just wish they would stop putting so many back up singers, and loud music to back him. We want to hear Clay. We don't want anything so loud that you can't hear that beautiful voice on it's own. He has such a stong voice - he doesn't need all the stuff many singers use - to make them sound good. He is all class and I will love him forever."
1,"Beautiful! I rooted for Clay all throughout American Idol 2 and knew that his CD would be amazing. I listened to this CD and was not disappointed a bit. His voice is so beautiful, and the songs are very very well written. Great Job Clay! Thankyou for sharing your incredible talents with the world."
1,"awesome! This CD really reflects the artist. Every track is excellent! If you are a Clay fan, I highly recommend this CD. If you aren't yet a fan, after hearing this you will be!"
1,"A Winner Love Clay, love his incredible voice, love this CD. Each time I listen, I have a new favorite. Some songs inspire, some make me want to dance, and some just make me feel good. As a fan of all the old standards, easy listening, etc., a future album of all covers would be nice too. In fact, I believe I would be happy to hear Clay sing just about every song ever written."
1,"MUST HAVE CD OH MY GAULD!!!!!!!!!! THIS CD IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!My mother, my daughter & myself can't get enough of it! This cd will be played for generations to come.Favorite...The Way."
1,FIVE STAR CD! I LOVE THIS CD. A VERY REFRESHING AND UNIQUE SOUND FROM THE NEWEST SUPERSTAR IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY!
1,Clay doesn't disappoint! I had to buy two copies of this CD - one for my car and one for work because I can't stop listening to it. Clay's voice is wonderful and never faulters! I haven't stopped listening to it since it was initially released. I can't wait for the second one!
1,"And, that's HOW you Measure a Man Perfection! The whole family loves the CD and him! You dont need your skip button with this CD."
1,"BETTER WATCH OUT! I think Clay's CD is ABSOLUTELY GREAT!I listen to it every day. I would just like to make a point to all the Clay bashers/Ruben Studdards' fans out there. You had BETTER WATCH OUT! If you are intentionally trying to bash Clays' CD to lower its ratings, then you should prepare yourselves for when Ruben's CD comes out. Clay's fans far out number Rubens' fans and when push comes to shove..... What's that saying WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND!? Grow up,take your toys and go home. Oh and by the way Clay's CD is doing just great despite your rude comments."
1,"Measures 'Off the Scale"" Amazon, thank you for rushing my CD - arrived yesterday and I have listened to it constantly and carefully - all the way through, then repeating each song over several times; find that I have to tear myself away to listen to the next one. Love the album - think that Clay reviewed himself the best with his talk show comment - ""progression and improvement"" over what he had previously sung. And, I thought he was perfection before.What a beautiful tribute to his Dad's memory!The songs are definitely similar, yet each could stand alone! And each song is amazingly and lovingly offered. Each song makes the listener feel special.Now I know why the Brits yelled out to Prince Charles and Princess Diana as they were leaving hospital after Prince William's birth - ""Do it again! Give us another one!""The ONLY way to improve on any of these songs would be to see Clay perform each - live, video, guest appearane, suit, stripes, sweats - wouldn't matter."
1,"Clay Rox and This is a Great C.D! This is an excellent c.d!It's great for helping you relax.My favourite songs on it are ""Measure of a Man"" and ""The Way"".As other people said,he's the real American Idol!The only bad thing about the c.d is that he didn't put the kinda more upbeat version of Invisible.But it's good how there's no music at the beginning of ""Invisible"" though.I would like to get the Christmas c.d where Clay sings ""The First Nol"".I heard a preview on a website and it sounds really good!I'm obsesed with Clay...;-)"
1,"This album has become a favorite At first I was disappointed that the only song with which I was familiar was This Is The Night...... Now, I LOVE THEM ALL... This album is great and I find myself humming the songs all the time... I would venture to guess that Run To Me will become a classic.... it will be around for a long, long time... Also, how can anyone comment about Clay's looks? He is darling!!! If anyone watched any of the Radio Music awards tonight (Oct 27) and looked at the appearance of some of those characters.... you can appreciate this attractive guy!!! He is a sweetie... Ready for another album, Clay... hope you are working on the next one! Maybe the next one can be a mixture of old and new.... Already anxiously awaiting the next album!!! Clay appeals to all age groups... I am not a teenager, but I did buy three of the albums.... (two as gifts)...Anyone who buys Measure of a Man will not be disappointed.... It it truly great...."
1,"CLAY - BEST POP ALBUM OF 2003 says BILLBOARD MAGAZINE!!!! DOUBLE PLATINUM awarded on Good Morning America from Clive Davis of RCA!!!! WOW!!! So WELL DESERVED!!! Great cd by Clay Aiken!!!!! I love all of the songs, so well done!!! You can hear Clays voice so beautifully! I am so happy for Clay, and for me getting to listen to Measure Of A Man all day long!!! I HIGHLY RECOMEND this cd!!!!"
1,"CLAY SHINES!!! WHAT A VOICE!! BEAUTIFUL ALBUM!! CLAY MEASURES UP! Could we finaly be seeing a change in the music industry? I think its about time to bring back music thats not about sex,drugs, and singers with potty mouths. Clays a nice young man who does'nt drink, smoke or swear. A good role model for our kids. He's not afraid to express his faith in god or how his faith plays a big role in his life. Clay has won the hearts of millions with his beautiful voice. NOVEMBER 30th IS CLAYS BIRTHDAY. HAPPY BIRTHDAY CLAY!!! ""25"" WE LOVE YOU!!"
1,You won't be able to stop playing it The true Clay fans will love this cd. It has songs that apeal to the country and pop fans as well as people who love the power ballad. This cd shows clays diversity and the true power of his voice. It also showcases his ability to put so much emotion into a song that it will make you cry. One warning though once you put it in your cd player you won't be able to stop playing it. If this is an indication of what Clay can do I can't wait for his next cd. It is an amazing debut cd.
1,Clay clay is an awesome performer and he is such and inspiration to me and my family. he has made me want to be a special education teacher and i want to thank him for it i love u clay eventhough i don't know u!!!
1,"Clay is the Man! This Cd was fantastic. He has such an awesome voice. I am very impressed by the way that he sang those songs because all of them just got me so excited. Clay should have won, Clay really should have one. And he is going to win again on the music sales because this CD is one of my favorites of all time now."
1,"Best Album of 2003 If you really want to know what the experts say, read the review of Clay's album on Billboard.com where the music reviewer cites this album as 'The Best Album of 2003'. Doesn't get any better than that, does it? I'm no expert, but I love listening to anything Clay sings. Do wish though that the producers of this album had included 'Solitaire' along with a couple of other classics. This is the voice of an angel...with the right material he will soar beyond the heavens. Looking forward to the next album!"
1,"His Angelic voice shines thru! I HIGHLY recommend this album for ANY Clay Aiken fan! I have watched Clay from day one, when he entered that room with Simon, Randy and Paula, and declared himself the ""American Idol"". In my opinion, he IS the American Idol! I could not wait for this album to be released and I am NOT disappointed! The first three songs are wonderful---one of my favorites being ""Measure of a Man"", the title song of this CD. This is only his FIRST album and I predict the next to be even better! Congratulations, Clay, for the release of your first album! I look forward to watching it soar thru the charts!"
1,"Great Cd! I could not wait to buy this CD and it was well worth the wait. I have listened to it a dozen or more time and love all of the songs. Even though this cd was rushed I think it was great, that means his next cd will be even better."
1,"Finally.... A CD I can listen to without skipping ANY songs. I like them all. True, this is not much of a departure from what we would expect from the AI2 Clay Aiken, but this is only the beginning of a long and successful recording/performing career for Clay. Many of us have been disenfranchised for so long from the music industry. Is the industry paying attention? Have they heard us loud enough? We want soul and beauty back in music. We want someone who isn't spewing filth and profanity to our children. And we want someone who has a conscience beyond making money. Clay has answered all those requests. This was money well spent...my favorite is ""The Way"". Can't wait to hear Clay on movie soundtracks and see him in solo tours."
1,"Surpasses the Hype! This cd is way higher than my expectations! I can't quit listening to it! Clay's voice shines through, there's no overproduction.....it's just Clay. And that's what we all fell in love with! I'd recommend this cd to my best friend, little sister, or my grandmother! Definitely something for all ages!"
1,One of the best One of the best cds i have heard in a long time. Far surpasses his AI2 performances. This is one cd that is consistently excellent material throughout. I'd recommend this cd to anyone!
1,"This CD is AWESOME! The first time I listened to this CD, I was a little disappointed because it wasn't really the same type of thing that Clay was doing on American Idol. I've listened to it non-stop despite this fact, and I have to admit it - I love it! There are some really cool songs. I love upbeat ""Invisible."" ""No More Sad Songs"" is probably one of my favorites, it reminds me of a powerful Paul McCartney ballad. If you have the McCartney CD, 'Flaming Pie' and enjoyed it, this seems kinda similar, but DEFINITELY more powerful and something you will not get sick of as fast! I also like the fact that there are songs that you can relate to that avoid negative images that the record companies try to impose on us as listeners. We can always trust Clay to only give us what he knows we REALLY want. THANK YOU CLAY!"
1,"Measure of a Man I just got my cd today and I love it. I think it has something for everyone. The songs are beautiful just listen to the song Measure of a Man and you will see what I am talking about.Clay is a breath of fresh air, as I am sick and tired of not being able to listen to the radio or buy cd's where it is not littered with filth. I love the fact that Clay is taking a stand against this kind of garbage being fed to our kids."
1,"Amazing CD for an amazing talent! Clay's CD has everything one could want. A stunningly beautiful voice, great lyrics, great songs. Clay's voice is highly recognizable when listening and does bring emotion and life to each song. You can play his CD over and over again. My favs are Invisible, I will carry you, The way, This is the night, Measure of a man, etc, etc. All the songs ""Shine"". I will never get tired of listening to this, and can't wait to see what is in store for us later. Everyone should buy his CD. You won't be dissapointed!!! Clay - a beautiful voice, a beautiful talent, a truly beautiful man."
1,"Go Clay!!! Even though he didn't win the season 2 American Idol, it's kinda like he did. There are many reasons why I say so. His album has done dropped and people acturally buy it. He's done had more videos then Ruben as on 3/3/04. He is already on tour. So, in many ways, he was a winner all along. I love this cd and I listen to it ALL the time! I'm not going to do a song by song review like I usually I do. I will however, tell you my favorite songs:This Is The Night (Bonus Cut), The Way, When You Say You Love Me, and Insivible. I will pobability have more favorite songs and when I do, I will edit this review for an up-to-date review on why I love Clay!! Go Clay!! If you LOVE Clay you will LIKE Kelly Clarkson (Season 1 winner.)"
1,"Well Done I haven't liked much recent American pop, but Clay sure is a good singer. I watched him perform ""Invisible"" on the Billboard Awards... I was completely blown away. Simply amazing. A friend had also sent me his This is The Night/Bridge Over Troubled Water single earlier this year. Amazing as well. Good work, Clay. Hope your future albums are excellent as well."
1,"This is what a pop album should be..... Clay Aiken has arrived...and with a definate flair for pop...This man knows how to sell a song...he understands when to hold back...and he understands when to hit the ""money note""...Songs like ""Invisible"" and ""Touch"" are great pop songs, very radio friendly. ""The Way"" and ""Touch"" have just the right amount of sex, which sells a song. ""Measure of A Man"" will give you a glimpse of the future of this mature individual. And of course, his signature song ""This is the Night"", still gives chills as one of the first glimpses into the soul of the individual.Each song on the album is unique, however, together, they create an incredible debut album.This is an artist, with so much more to offer. I can't wait to see what Clay Aiken will give to pop music next."
1,"MOAM I have honestly never bought a CD that I liked all of the songs on . Well, that has changed. This CD does not have a bad song on it. Clay shows that he has arrived. He has stayed true to himself and is here to stay. Highly recommend!!"
1,"A Rising Star You know that an artist is popular when he garners so many reviews from so many people that love and hate him but this guy is a rising star!It took a lot of guts to get up in front of a panel of judges to audition for American Idol and then even more guts to sing in front of Simon and the rest of America!This album contains songs from different genres of popular music so there's something for everyone. I personally love them all! Give it a chance. I'm sure that you will NOT be disappointed.We gave Clay a chance and look where he is now!And for those of you who keep saying that he's ugly, take a good look at yourself in the mirror and see what's inside."
1,A TRUE ARTIST CLAY AIKEN I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM AS SOON AS IT HIT THE STORE AND AS SOON AS I LISTENED TO IT I LOVED EVERY TRACK. IM SICK OF LISTENING TO THE STUFF THE DISC JOCKS THINK ARE GOOD SINGERS. RAP AND THE YELLING AND CURSING FOR SHOCK VALUE TO SELL SOMETHING AND CALL IT TALENT. I LIKE ALL TYPES OF MUSIC AS LONG AS THE SINGING IS GOOD AND THE MUSIC IS GOOD BUT SO MANY POP AND ROCK STATIONS DONT KNOW WHAT IS TRUE ARTISTIC WORK ANY MORE. IM NOT SAYING ITS ALL BAD BUT TOO MUCH OF IT IS. CLAY WAS WONDERFUL TO LISTEN TO ON THE SHOW AND EVEN BETTER ON THE NEW ALBUM. ITS RARE TO FIND AN ALBUM THAT ALL THE SONGS ARE GOOD BUT CLAY HAS DONE IT AND I WILL NODOUBT BUY EVERYTHING HE PUTS OUT IN THE FUTURE.I CONTINUE TO LEAVE THIS CD IN MY CAR PLAYER AND LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER.
1,"Clay Aiken Debuts at No. 1! ""Measure of a Man"" has debuted at No. 1! Billboard has named the CD as Best Pop Album of 2003!Why don't you buy one or more of Clay Aiken's CD? I guarantee you that you will love the lyrics, the music, Clay's wonderful voice, the high and low notes, the emotion that he brings into the 12 tracks, absolutely takes you to another place.""Perfect Day"" and ""Shine"" are very Beatlesque songs. I'm sure these 2 songs will do very well. ""Invisible"" is a catchy song and is already doing very well on the radio in the States; hopefully, our radio stations will play it more often soon. My favourite of the 12 is ""Measure of a Man"". A wonderful song that makes you stop and think.Buy Clay Aiken today - you won't regret it!"
1,"Every song is outstanding The song choices for this CD are excellent. As the album was playing, I couldn't decide which track I liked better. Not since the Beatles have I been able to say honestly that I loved each and every one of the songs. Invisible, The Way, When You Say You Love Me, Measure of a Man, and Touch are incredible. I hope this is only the first of a long string of great albums. Well done, Clay, well done."
1,A awesome CD I can't stop listening to this album. Every day my favorite song changes. There are no duds on this album. Clay's wonderful voice in combination talented songwriters make this CD a joy to listen to.
1,"Against All Odds- Real Music is Back I've read many of the reviews posted on Amazon- most of them echo what I felt when I first heard this CD-- it's the best CD I have bought in a long time. I listen to MOAM at least 2 to 3 times a day- Clay Aiken's voice just makes me feel happy- sounds corny; but in the world we live in today it's nice to feel that again. I didn't realize how snarky, and snotty the music industry was until I read some of the ""critics"" reviews of this CD- I guess I just don't get it- what's wrong about a pure & honest talent??Do yourself a favor-buy this CD- The Way, Shine, I Will Carry You, I Survived You- in fact the whole CD is excellent-- I never skip a song- I start my day with this CD & I end it with this CD.Clay, next time make it a double CD- & quickly."
1,"The Real American Idol I followed Clay through the American Idol process from start to finish and all I can say is I hope this is just the begining of what should be a long and successful career. This CD was fabulous and well worth the wait. There isn't a bad song on it and his voice is simply mesmerizing. I think there are several songs on it that could be hits for him. Anyway you slice it, I will buy as many CD's as this young man records. Not easy for a forty something woman to admit. : ) I am going to purchase the Idols Christmas CD just for the Clay song. My advice, buy it, you won't be sorry."
1,"a mix of james taylor meets elton john! breathtaking I personally found that this is one of the best cd's i have ever listened to. Clay aiken is not only the true american idol, but a wonderful young man with a very positve outlook and message. How refreshing. I recently tried to get concert tickets to his tour with kelly clarkson in N.C, only to find them all sold out. Instead I will will be driving to washington d.c to take my 3 year old for her birthday to his concert at the mci center. His voice is so beautiful and almost reverant. I would give this cd 10 stars if it were allowed!!!!!"
1,"Music to my Ears What an absolutely ""wonderful"" album. Perfection plus.....Clay so knows what we want to hear.....Every single song on this album is beautiful and sung with such emotion. I don't know if I ever will be able to pick a favorite out of these. I love them all. Okay, when is the next album going to be released?"
1,"A Powerful First Album A showcase for Mr. Aiken's exceptional voice, this power-pop album will have you singing along in no time. Every cut a potential Top 10 hit, there's something for everyone here, from the power-chord-filled ballad 'Run To Me', to the Beatle-esque 'Shine' and 'Perfect Day', to the country-flavored 'When You Say You Love Me', to the breathtakingly beautiful love ballad 'The Way'. A tiny disappointment for this fan: Mr. Aiken's lower register is barely in evidence. Still, that doesn't stop this album from being 100% en-JOY-able."
1,"A Stunning Debut If your musical tastes run to terrific songs sung by a stunningly beautiful voice, this album is for you. It's a quality product from beginning to end. A bit retro without ever sounding dated, each song on the album allows a different facet of Aiken's talent to shine through. If you loved Journey, you'll be thrilled with Run to Me. If you remember Beatlemania, you'll adore Shine. And yet, Aiken is always, uniquely himself. If you know anything of his history, you'll know that No More Sad Songs, while seemingly a breakup song, probably has a different meaning for Aiken. If you know anything of his values, you'll understand why Measure of a Man is the title track. This is, without a doubt, the most enjoyable pop album I've heard in a long time!"
1,"SIMPLY WONDERFUL! Every song in this CD is wonderful! AIKEN proves that real talent still exists and after purchasing this album (along with his earlier single BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER,)it is no wonder why so many people love him. I look forward to his future albums! AIKEN is my IDOL!!!"
1,"GREAT MUSIC !! I think Clay Aiken is the best thing that has happened to music in a long time. This CD is great and I listen to it over and over again. Clay is a fantastic singer, a great person who is sincere, giving and a wonderful all around good human being. I am looking forward to many more CDs from him. I am also looking forward to attending his solo concert tomorrow evening at Sioux Falls, SD. Can't wait."
1,Measure of a Man - beautiful Clay's first CD is wonderful. It showcases his range and the uniqueness of his voice. Invisible and Touch are upbeat and can easily be danced to. The Way and Measure of a Man highlight Clay's ability to do ballads like no other. When You Say You Love Me has a bit of a country flavour and Shine and I Survived You are on the edgier side. The CD just gets better and better everytime you listen and Clay sings every song with passion and emotion. A great first album.
1,"Measure of a Man- beautiful Clay's Cd is just magnificent. I can honestly say there is not one bad track on the album. Everytime you listen to it, it just gets better and better. Invisible and Touch are upbeat and make you want to get up and dance. When You Say You Love Me has a little bit of a country flavour and The Way and Measure of a Man are pure ballads. And Clay just doesn't sing the lyrics, he is the lyrics. It showcases his amazing range and the uniqueness of his voice. Listen to the CD a few times and you will agree it is a wonderful first album for Clay Aiken."
1,"AWESOME CD!! :) Clay Aiken has got to be the BEST singer in the world! I LOVE this dude! His first CD, 'Measure of a Man', was absolutely AWESOME!! It includes hit songs such as 'Ivisible', 'The Way', 'When You Say You Love Me', 'No More Sad Songs', and 'Measure of a Man'. Not only are all the songs on the CD an awesome showcase and display of his voice, but they are all appropriate; no cussing or inappropriate references. I'm so proud that of him for being clean and staying true to his values. Kudos for Clay! Go out and buy this CD today! You will not regret it! :)"
1,"EXCELLENT ALBUM by CLAY AIKEN!!!!! I really like Measure Of A Man so much, and the thing is I have kids and I can play it loud and don't have to worry about anything bad being said! My daughter loves singing along with Clay. GREAT CD!!! My mom likes it so much too!!! Clay thank you so much for this, truly!!!! Thank you so much!!!"
1,"Clay is the best. Jaan is not! I bought MOAM as soon as it came out and I love it. It's amazing that the disc isn't worn out already. When and if it does, I will just buy another one. lol :) Clay sings with such feeling and each song touches my soul. As for Jaan, I am really upset. If you do not like Clay, why are you giving a review of the album? You have no idea what you are talking about. I agree with the others: Amazon should let you go. Besides, those who have yet to discover Clay (who hasn't) may be swayed by your comments and that would be a shame!"
1,"I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT!! I can't remember of any other CD in recent years that has had such a mushroom effect as this wonderful CD. It's popularity just grows and grows. I can see why. I have listened to this CD for a month straight - I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT!! What wonderful vocal ability!It is of no wonder to me why this CD continually registers in the top 10 best sellers here. It deserves it.If you want to hear wonderful, uplifting, fresh music, and generally just amazing singing, then buy Measure of a Man. You won't be disappointed."
1,MEASURE OF A SUPERSTAR!! This is absolutely everything I have been waiting for! It has ballads- pop songs- and to my pleasant surprise-- a bit of a rock edge to it. I am normally a heavy metal girl- and that is why my friends and family have a hard time understanding my Clay obsession- but he truly represents a man whose talent goes beyond what was presented on American Idol. Very Impressive Clayton!!
1,"THE MAN HAS BEEN MEASURED After listenting to this CD since 10/14/03 numerous times daily---I enjoy each song every time I listen to the CD. ""The Way"" ""Run to Me"" ""Shine"" ""Touch"" are my front runners right now but I enjoy all the songs. Why is Clay so intesting--his eyes, his mouth and his incredible voice!! Can the guy sing-YES! I saw Clay in concert during the AI tour--he has that quality that comes out and WOWS the crowd and holds you thru each and every performance and he has done the same with his first CD! I will continue buying his music because of his wonderful qualities!!!You go CLAY! And if you have not heard him sing ""Noel"" on the Holiday CD you are missing probably the best verison of the song I have ever heard!!! Makes you want to stand up and shout to the heavens!Clay measures up in every way as a true entertainer in every way possible!"
1,Claymania Buy It!!!... He's such a great singer he is my American Idol!!!you will not be disappointed.
1,"As Perfect as expected! Just fantastic! You won't be disapointed! The ""true"" winner of AI2 shines!! There isn't a bad song on the album! I couldn't pick a favorite! What are you waiting for?? GO GET IT!"
1,Great debut from a promising young artist... I found this CD excellent. I always enjoy hearing talented singers. The songs on this helped make my drive (I listen to music in the car) a very relaxing experience. He has a very good voice and a lot of natural talent. I think this was a great album to test out his wings and improve upon. I'm sure he'll only get better. I'm looking forward to his follow up work!
1,"Measure of a Fantastic CD I love this CD and do not feel that 838,000 people are wrong about it. Why do fans of this CD have to take such abuse, i.e. we are tone deaf, don't know anything about music, etc. We just happen to like this CD and especially the singer, and are looking forward to many more Clay Aiken CD's. The boy can sing."
1,"I LOVE CLAY AIKEN!!!!! I loved Clay Aiken the moment I saw him during the American Idol season 2 auditions (before his dramatic change) and has proved to be the best. I have seen him twice, during the American Idol seasonal tour and the Kelly Clarkson/Clay Aiken Independent tour and he just keeps getting better! My favorite song on his album is ""Measure of a Man"" because, I feel, that he is talking about God. I also love ""The Way"" because it's a really romantic song and the music video is absolutely wonderful. I HIGHLY recommend this CD to any American Idol fans or ""Claymates""-not that I am one. You won't be disappointed!"
1,"Simply the best Clay Aiken has a voice that touches my heart and soothes my soul. I love every song on this CD, so it's a tough call to name a favorite when they all gave me chills...and a few brought tears to my eyes. ""Run To Me"" is so very haunting and beautiful, and ""Measure of a Man"" and ""The Way"" are both touching and tender and exquisitely performed. An awesome debut, well worth the wait."
1,"A Great CD!!! I love this CD!!! It is not too Broadway at all, which is what i was worried about. Although I am sure that Clay could have a sucessful career on Broadway, this album proves that he can sing pop just as well. The songs fit his voice very well and the album is very easy to listen to. I like Rueben as well as Clay and I don't see why you can't just buy both albums. Why pick one when American Idol 2 delivered two amazing and talented performers."
1,"AWESOME CD FROM THE FIRST NOT TO THE LAST! Clay has captured the hearts of America, especially mine, from day one! His ability to sing any song well made him my ""American Idol"" and this CD is nothing less than perfect! He knows how to make my heart melt! Every song on this album makes you appreciate his voice even more with every note. I found myself eagerly anticipating what the next song would bring! Every song has a wonderful message and is appropriate for any age! I love his pure natural talant! I'm proud to be a Clay Aiken fan!!!"
1,"CREAM RISES TO THE TOP It is evident that the previous reviewer who uses profanity - totally uncalled for - has used this forum to simply bash Clay. He has not purchased the CD nor listened to it. Let's grow up and use this for the reason it is intended - to review the CD, not bash the artist.The CD is awesome, and as time will tell, cream always rises to the top....."
1,"WOW!!!! This cd leaves me speechless, breathless, just amazed. Clay's voice has matured so much since his first audition and this cd emphasizes this. The songs are beautiful. It's worth every penny and every second of waiting and more!!!!! go buy it!!! :D:D:D"
1,Best CD I have ever owned All I can say is WOW! I think this is the best CD I have ever owned. All the songs are wonderful. I have already listened to it several times today.
1,"AMAZING.. I knew this would be more than a typical cd. It has more meaning than most pop cds. Compare this Clay to the likes of the world's most popular artists, ie, Justin, Britney, even going back to *NSYNC, and one will find that Clay has more depth and range than any recent artist. His songs are not bubble-gum, not by a long shot. They have so much meaning. They are all song beautifully and I guarantee you can listen to this through and through, over and over again. His voice is so soothing, the songs so beautifully written. He is definitely going places with this cd. He is no longer a part of the American Idol franchise. He has been able to break away from that and start his own path. Congrats Clay."
1,"What a debut really thought for a first album this kid from north carolina that no-one even heard of a year ago...this was pretty sensational..wasn't sure I was going to buy it but they were playing in the music store..the song was ""shine"" and I really found it ""music to my ears""..now I can say that ""the way"" and ""perfect day"" are Clay's best on this cd..the song ""measure of a man"" is very good also..hope all the other skeptics out there like it as much as I do..would not want to see such a real talent fade away."
1,"A Legend is Born Once in a great while an artist comes along that sets the world on it's ear.Elvis did it. The Beatles did it. Heck, people who grew up in the 80's can argue that Duran Duran did it. Now it's Clay Aiken's turn.Make no mistake that this album is Pure Pop Pleasure. From the very catchy kick off track ""Invisible"" to the extremely sensual closer ""Touch"" there isn't a bad song in the bunch.Clay's voice soars and stirs the soul. Measure of a Man is without doubt a triumphant debut."
1,"Marvellous piece I am really impressed and love the cd. So great to have one in my collection. His voice is so marvellous and powerful. No doubt, his songs are going to touch everyone hearts. He is the one !!!!!"
1,"Not a fan of American Idol... but I found myself really liking Clay Aiken while flipping through channels one evening. He may not have won, but he has won the hearts of Americans all over. I eagerly anticipated this CD. Bought it on release day and loved it immediately! Definately one of the best recording I have heard in a long time. And it's a CD that you can share with anyone and not be afraid of them being offended in any way. Here's hoping that Clay is around for a very long time!"
1,"""Measure of a Man"" is Excellent! Clay Aiken can sing any song beautifully. Every song on his CD is beautiful and sung perfectly. You can always feel Clay in your heart when he sings. I recommend this CD to everyone. Every age group can listen to this CD. Clay puts his heart in to every performance (as always). For once I bought a CD where I can listen to every song and not have to skip through to one that sounds good because every one is good. My favorites: ""Run To Me,"" ""Perfect Day,"" and ""Meaure of a Man."""
1,"Who cares???? Who cares if Clay got his beginning from a TV show? Who cares if Clay is very effeminate? Who cares if he doesn't write his materials (that's a songwriter's job, not a singer's)? And who cares if he looks like Howdy Doody?THE ONLY THING THAT MATTER IS CLAY CAN SING LIKE NO ONE HAS EVER SUNG BEFORE. His voice just reaches out to you and when you let down your guard, it sucks you in and never lets go. If the world lets this one slips away, then it's a very sorry world. A singer like this only comes once in a lifetime."
1,"An Amazing C.D. Clay has an absolutely fantastic voice and ""Measure of a Man"" showcases his voice beautifully. Clay is a true artist and a natural talent unlike I have ever heard before. I will purchase any C.D. that he releases!"
1,"a gorgeous cd Clay Aiken's voice is golden - anbd this cd proves it. you will get ongs with edge, ballads, feel good songs, angsty songs. worth every penny you will spend on it."
1,"Measure Of A Man I love, love, love this CD very much!!! Clay Aiken's vocals are perfect and sings so well! Clay Aiken deserves a whole lot more radio airplay."
1,"listen again to appreciate I did not like the songs at first but listened again and found three songs I really like- Touch (wish they would play this on the radio), Measure of a Man, and a country music sounding Do you love me?Look forward to hearing Solitare again soon!"
1,"It's about time! It's about time an artist gave us music that everyone can enjoy. The pop music business, for the most part, thinks all people want to hear about are negative images. I have a feeling sales of this CD will prove people want positive music. It's refreshing to be able to actually understand the lyrics and not feel uncomfortable listening to them. Three generations of our family have been ""taken"" by Clay Aiken and can't wait to hear more. I highly recommend this CD."
1,"Superstar! Clay Aiken will be around for many years to come! His first CD, Measure of a man doesn't have a bad track on it. Every one of the songs is suited to Clay's ballad style voice. I think it is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. Invisible, Shine, Measure of a Man, all great...Clay is here to stay!"
1,"Even better than expected! Clay Aiken's outstanding voice and song delivery are showcased perfectly on this cd. His vocal power and range are phenomenal and the songs themselves are terrific as well. At long last, a person rises to the top of the charts who is in actual possession of real talent! At long last, a major label has produced a cd with the recognition that the content of the music can be mature without being trash or treating vices as though they're, indeed, acceptable. It's been a long time since I've listened to pop for the simple reason that I was tired of wading through the filth and innuendo to hear a few bars I liked. Clay Aiken appeals to true emotion and feeling. This only came out today and already, I'm anxiously waiting for the next CD."
1,Clay measures up!!!!! This young man is so talented.I can't pick a favorite..I like them all.I can't help but notice that a very few amt of those who wrote reviews on Clays album dtd'nt like it.No artist gets a 100 percent in his favor but Clay sure comes close. I've also noticed that those who say they don't like it really don't like it. Read those reviews too. It reads more like they are anger. Why do they express them selves that way? Could it be that they wanted it to fail? I'm a 65 year old grandma... not a clay mate..I'm a clay grandma and I love this cd. Grandma Pence
1,Fabulous CD I love this CD and the more I listen the better it gets. I certainly got my money's worth with this CD. Great going Clay!!
1,"Music Lover in Wi I bought this CD the day it came out in Oct and I am still playing it every day. I can't remember ever owning a CD that I would listen to every song and still play that CD everyday five months later! Well worth the money I spent on it.It is a shame that people are using this review area to bash Mr. Aiken because he is out selling the person that actually won American Idol. I didn't watch the show so I can't say why someone would feel the need to do this? I bought the CD because after hearing Mr. Aiken's ""This is the Night"" on the radio I fell in love with his voice. I am looking forward to his next album!"
1,"simply wonderful I like this debut very much. Clay did not win American Idol but he is a success after the show. Clay reminds me of a young Barry Manilow. I like that Clay is a clean cut guy and that his cd and lyrics are clean as well, that's a nice and refreshing change in celebrities and music. This is a wonderful cd. I can't wait to see Clay's career flourish and I hope to see Clay Aiken have a wonderful career for a long time to come. He truly deserves it.There are no lyrics printed on the cd booklet and I don't think you really need them either, it would have been nice but its not necessary. You can hear Clay sing the lyrics clearly and fans like me can sing along with him. Still I wish that the record label had printed the lyrics, that would have been a nice addition. The cd booklet also pulls out into a poster of Clay."
1,"I loved it My favorite is ""The Way"". Great song for him and he delivers.""I Will Carry You"" is another goodie. There are a couple of songs that seem a little odd for him (almost country-ish....yuk), but he still does a great job with them.Buy the CD!"
1,"TERRIFIC! This CD is packed with absolutely wonderful songs, I can't stop playing it! There's a little bit of everything, so if you don't like one, just skip to the next track. What am I saying? How could you not LOVE CLAY AIKEN!"
1,"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! I enjoyed every song on this album. Clay and his producers did a great job picking out songs that showcase Clay's wonderful voice. The songs were all unique and I predict that there will be several number one songs generated off this CD. Congratulations Clay, you did a fantastic job!!"
1,"SPECTACULAR!!! Clay Aiken shows that you can still sing songs without the language. His respect for himself as well as for others is projected very well through his music. I am proud to be from Raleigh and can't wait to go to a concert with my daughters, yes I am a mom. To be able to capture an audience of all ages is just amazing."
1,"***CLAY is hot....""THE""only true american idol**** Oh my god!!this cd is great..it has awesome lyrics,music,melodys,and tunes.whoever doesnt like this album is crazy!all the songs are spirtual lifting and they really touch ur heart!not to mention clay is so cute and has a great voice...he is a good guy.if you dont like him u have to like this grat cd..with beautiful songs!thank u clay ...for makin my day.....theres no mistakin,i luv aiken!"
1,"THIS IS AN AWESOME CD IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY BOUGHT THIS CD, YOU NEED TOO!!!!! Every song is so excellent and Clay's talent is proved over and over. Beat that Ruben! Also, The American Idol Holiday CD is awsome!!!"
1,"Unbelievable This CD is absolutley excellent. I adore Clay and I don't know of any other singers with such a pure, and REAL voice. I just hate how singers today are for image. Clay's not about image at all, even though his has improved! Anyway, my favorite songs are The Way, I Survived You, and Measure of a Man. The Way is SO romantic, it's perfect, he sings it beautifully. Then I think that I Survived You is about how his biological father abused him when he was a child. It was obviously very sad, but it made me think. Then Measure of a Man was very good too. I definitley suggest you buy it!"
1,"Unbelievable Talent - Great, CD for a new artist! WOW Clay is an amazing talent. This has rapidly become my favorite CD. I listen to it over and over when I am traveling, which is all the time. If you enjoy listening to inspirational songs by a pure and wonderfully gifted young artist, this is the CD for you! Enjoy."
1,great cd This album is just wonderful. Each song is a winner. The more I listen to it the better it gets.
1,"Just what I expected This guy is the real deal. I expected this CD to be great and Clay didn't let anyone down. He'll be around for a long time. I hope to see him write or collaberate with other writers on his future projects.I think both Clay & Ruben have dealt with whatever controversy there has been with class and respect for one another, I just wish their fans would follow suit. The reality of the situation is... they both won. At this point, who came in first really doesn't matter."
1,"Was there any doubt Clay is the new-age Frank Sinatra. I have listened to nothing else since I got the CD on 10/14.Clay is an amazing singer who appeals to many different age groups. In my home alone, we are 3 people...13, 40, 74.I don't have a favorite song as they all showcase Clay's talent. This album is well worth the money."
1,"WONDERFUL CD!!!! GREA JOB CLAAAAAAAAAY!!!!! WOW!!! Great Album!! I love listening to this CD over and over and over again! Thank you so much Clay, Love ALL of the songs, it is hard to pick a favorite, but I will try, I really love Measure of a Man, The Way, I Will Carry You, Perfect Day, Touch, When You Say You Love Me, Run To Me, No More Sad Songs and of course This Is The Night!!! Great job sweetie!! Clay will be making Christmas shopping easy this year!!! My goodness, I will be buying some more of this cd!!!!! 5 STARS!!!!"
1,"Music at its best This album is a must-own for all those people who want a role model to look up to and admire. His personal views and emotional convictions can be heard throughout this album. Clay's strong, powerful voice combined with the wonderfully worded lyrics make this project an essential to every music collection. Most every person can find a song to suit their musical tastes on this album. Up-tempo songs like ""Invisible"" and ""I Will Carry You"" start the album off just right. ""Measure of a Man"" and ""Run to Me"" are really thought provoking and amazingly real. And it's not just a few song that are great, but the whole album is awesome. I don't get tired of listening to each song over and over. There is always something new and exciting that I discover each time I listen to this album. I can't wait to see what other amazing music Clay introduces to the world. Until that time, I'm going to listen to my Clay Aiken cd again and again and again."
1,"Well deserving Superstar. Clay Aiken is one of the most talented singers out there. Not only does he have a voice from heaven but is an all around nice guy. What I love the most about this guy is that he's not afraid to be himself. He doesn't follow the fads and raunchy behavior the music industry is so used to. Clay is so unique, refreshing and is a joy to listen to. I am a fan forever!!! I absolutely love his voice, music and of course the man."
1,"Measyre of a Man AWESOME congrats CLAY This is an awesome album...way to go Clay ...We have waited for months for this album and now that it is here we are all learning the words and singing right along with Clay...Can't wait to see him in Concert, and hear more songs from this amazing young man. He thrills all ages..What an amazing ambassador you have..Clay is also OUR American Idol in CANADA as well..Please come here on your concert tour too"
1,"Great cd, didn't care for the show, but the music is good This cd is great, his voice is infactuating. I bought this cd and immediately bought one for my entire family. I recommend this cd to anyone, who wants good happy music. Who would have thought me, a fan of death metal, glitch, and trip-hop would have listend to a clay aiken cd, and liked it.Of course i'm lying though."
1,"Clay's debut is just plain great! Even though Clay was runner up on American Idol, he proved his talent and ability with this great album. If you like pop/adult contemporary music, this album has something for you. The album starts off with great songs such as ""Invisible"", ""I Will Carry You"" and ""The Way"", and the latter two will be singles for sure. The country-pop of ""When You Say You Love Me"" leads into the almost intense ""No More Sad Song"". Then comes the beautiful ""Run To Me"" and the inspirational ""Shine"". This is followed by the great ""I Survived You"" and Clay's #1 single ""This Is The Night"". Then comes a trio of simply wonderful tunes: the glorious ""Perfect Day"", the passionate ""Measure of a Man"", and the sensual ""Touch"". Clay's voice is remarkable on every song, and there truly is something for all pop fans here. Billboard didn't name this the best pop album of 2003 for nothing."
1,"Totally Awesome Clay has a wonderful, unique voice which most singers do not have. It is hard to believe that such a beautiful comes out such a tall skinny dude!"
1,"Clay Aiken at his finest No matter how many times you listen to this CD you are astonished by the strength and purity of this man's talent.All the emotions are here, displayed with style and class."
1,"AARGH!!! I PITY THE FOOLS THAT BOUGHT THIS ALBUM!! DON'T WANT TO HEAR NO MORE CLAY AIKEN!! IF I HEAR THE SONG 'INVISIBLE"" ONE MORE TIME...I AM GOING TO GO TO LA. AND FIND THAT LITTLE TOOTHPICK WHITE BOY AND BREAK HIM IN HALF!! UGGG!! DON""T BE MAKING NO MORE RECORDS CLAY!! I PITY YOU IF YOU DO!!"
1,"AWESOME! Clay Aiken's debut album is absolutely incredible. Every song is good. Invisble, I Will Carry You, Measure of a Man, just all the songs are wonderful. His voice has so much range. The songs are ones you can listen to over and over. Buy this CD, you will not be disappointed. Clay Aiken has a refreshing sound and will be around for a long time."
1,"Excellent first CD. I agree that the songs aren't groundbreaking AND that they are still great! Clay sounds fantastic on everything and I can't begin to pick a favorite! Shine and Perfect Day remind me a little of the Crowded House days, The Way would be a perfect slow song at a high school dance (swoon), Measure of a Man has depth and feeling, When You Say You Love Me has a fun pop/country sound with a beat that just makes you feel happy (would LOVE to hear the rumors of a Clay/Faith Hill duet come true)! I Survived You is wonderful. Each song just gets better with every listen!! I am really glad they didn't try to saddle Clay with a bunch of oldies. Maybe someday, but not now. I look forward to his next CD and hope that Clay continues to add ""edge"" and a little ""funk"" without compromising his values. Until then, I will listen to this CD until it wears out and eagerly await his solo tour!"
1,"Can't get enough!! I ran out in the rain to go buy this album over lunch today and I would have made it through a tornado to get to this CD. After listening to ""measure of a man"", it only confirmed that is was worth it. If you watched Clay during American Idol, you heard the frequent comment about Clay's ""broadway"" voice. Well, he has toned that down and his voice is just candy for the ears. (not that it was ever bad) Also, the selection of songs on this CD are wonderful. The songs are ones that you can find yourself really paying attention to and can relate to. All I can say is what a great marriage of song and voice. Clay, congrats!! I am your fan!!"
1,"Buy this album! This is a terrific album. Combine Clay Aiken's georgeous, soaring pop tenor voice with some great songs and you end up with an album you want to listen to again and again. On most albums there are a few good tracks and others that aren't so great, but every track on ""Measure of a Man"" is good and I am never tempted to skip over one song or another. ""Invisible"" is a fun pop-rock song, ""The Way"" is a romantic ballad, ""Shine"" is inspirational with beautiful lyrics, ""Perfect Day"" is a surprising and unusual ballad, ""Measure of a Man"" is great, but then so are ""No More Sad Song"" and ""Run to Me."" I am impressed with this first effort from a singer who - I hope - has a long career turning out music this good."
1,"Clay Is The Man! I think he is the best! He really is a STAR on my list and ""Shines"" completely in his new album. It's refreshing to have a talent like this in the music industry and I hope he makes another album. Absolutely heart felt and amazing."
1,"Very Worthwhile Listening I normally buy CD's for one or two songs, and then burn my own compilations to play in the car.This is one cd that goes in the car stereo as is - too many good songs to choose only one or two.Good music, wonderful voice, crazy hairstyle - looking forward to the next cd from Clay."
1,"Highly Recommended I am addicted to this CD. I thoroughly enjoy every song and find myself humming a different song each day. Clay's voice is beautiful and these songs highlight his range and wonderful earnestness. The words are clearly enunciated and as any fan knows, Clay can belt out notes with the best. A couple of the songs are reminiscent of Chicago in that the choruses are catchy and inspire you to sing along to them while driving in your car. My personal favorites are The Way, Perfect Day, Measure of a Man, Run to Me, I Survived You, and Shine. Several of these songs seem to tell a story and you can imagine them being played in a movie soundtrack. I have been a fan of Clay's since American Idol and I am so happy and proud of his accomplishments in this debut album."
1,Measure of this Man! The CD was even better then I could have wished for! My only complaint is that I wish there have been more songs to listen too! Just listening to the CD makes my heart sing and my soul melt. It has all the flavor that a person could stand! Can't wait until the next CD is released! Clay just keeps getting better with every song he sings!
1,Can't stop listening There is not one song on this CD that I have to skip. I love every single one of them. Thank goodness someone has brought back good pop music. And Clay Aiken has more talent in his little finger I think that any of the so called pop artists out there today. Good for you Clay this CD is a real pleaser.
1,"Best Album of 2003 I am amazed at the number of reviews posted for this album. It has become my favorite and plays once or twice a day in our house and/or car. Actually, had to buy two as my CD changer loader/ejector is broken and you have to unscrew the top, and do all sorts of gymnastics to get CD's in and out....it was easier to buy another for the car. This is an album that gets better with age, it grows and grows on you. It is an album to sing along to, an album to play softly in the background and an album to listen to with headphones. All the songs are good, I don't skip ANY of them, which as I (and other reviewers) usually do. Measure of a Man and The Way are probably my favorites, although Shine is marvelous - well, darn - they are all marvelous and I hightly recommend this CD to all ages. I eagerly await more albums from Clay and predict his career will be spectacular."
1,"IT IS INCREDIBLE Clay's Measure of a Man CD is wonderful. I usually buy a CD and end up skipping 3 or 4 songs everytime I listen to it, but not this one. I love every single song. Clay has an incredible voice. My 4 year old loves him too. We get in the car and he says ""Mom, please put Clay on"" and I am only too happy to do it. He is a great role model, and we need them today. And he is singing music that anyone can listen to and love, from my 4 year old to me (34) to my mother (I'd better not say). Thanks, Clay, for being real! and for sharing your beautiful voice and attitude with the world."
1,"Good start Whoever said Clay needs to sing covers of old Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mathis, and other older songs, you are wrong. Clay is establishing himself as an artist, not a kareokie singer. Singing cover tunes would be bad right now. I'm glad he stayed away from cover tunes. He is proving himself and breaking out on his own. These songs cover everything from soft rock to country to pop. He doesn't even have the same vocal styles as Frank Sinatra and Johnny Mathis and Barry Manilow. He has a much stronger instrument and it is used to his advantage in songs like The Way, Run to Me, Perfect Day, and Measure of a Man. Other songs, like When You Say You Love Me, Invisible, and Touch are more uptempo and sexy. Frank Sinatra and Johnny Mathis did not have a lot of range. Clay would only waste his voice if he sang songs from them. In any case, these songs are a perfect showcase of his talent and versatility."
1,"CAN'T GET ENOUGH!! I can't get enough of this marvelous CD. I have to admit I play it over and over again, every day. It is mesmerizing.To those who say the album does not reflect this singer (i.e., he is not a song writer so he doesn't know squat), I say WHO CARES? How many artists out there today actually write their own songs and have lived every word of them?? To naysayers who do not believe a good singing voice makes an artist, well, I think there are about two million people out there who would tend to disagree with that assumption!!I have news for all of you doubters. This IS real music; music that has been sorely missing from the airwaves for years. So,you'd better get used to it - Clay is here to stay.AND I, FOR ONE, WILL CONTINUE TO BUY HIS MUSIC AS LONG AS HE CHOOSES TO GRACE US WITH HIS REFRESHING STYLE AND MARVELOUS VOCAL ABILITIES!Buy Measure of a Man and see for yourself what REAL SINGING is!"
1,"To the reviewer who wrote""Dont buy this CD"" Dont you buy it either Honey, you take that money and buy you some reading material on how to spell, or better yet, get back into school, its very clear you are brainless.As for MOAM, it is one of the most refreshing CD's to come on the market in eons, I can understand the words even, isnt that amazing!! You go Clay!!"
1,"Wonderful and entertaining After eagerly awaiting the release of measure of a man, I purchased it after attending a meeting on Tuesday night. I listened to it on my way home enjoying each song. I would listen to one and say it was the best but then listen to the next one declaring it the best. My favorite on the CD is When You Say You Love Me. Each song displays Clay's talent as a singer displaying all of the ranges that Clay can sing. I enjoyed the CD so much and listen to it over and over on my way in to work and also while at work and on my way home from work. I did lend the CD to my daughter and she too loved it(I will purchase her own CD for her.)I hope Clay will come out with another CD soon maybe singing alot of Neil Sedak's music and even some of Barry Manilow's. Again, every Clay fan will be highly entertained when listening to the CD. Keep up the good work."
1,"THE BEST CD!!! everyone MUST go out and buy this wonderful cd by super star Clay Aiken!! it will leave you breathless and wanting more!! don't delay, it will sell out fast!!!"
1,"Great Album It's just such a wonderful thing to have an incredible talent now bringing us family friendly 'pop' content that we can enjoy as a family. And to have an artist that touches the hearts of 12 year olds, as well as 60 year olds, when was the last time we had this. This album will touch the heart of every member of the family, from child to grandparent, while being a new pop album. No one else out there can claim that now. And the songs on it are wonderful, the voice is so amazing. This guy will be around for many, many more years to come!"
1,"A beautiful book ""Divine Chuckles"" is a treasure. ""Spirit""'s wisdom, warmth and humor has something great to offer anyone who chooses to listen."
1,"Super! This group have crossed the lines of the typical merengue rythm. the lyrics and the musical compositions are so different and unique. These guys have a style and flavor that other groups don't have. I had the oportunity to see them live and ""MY GOD"" they are really, really good. their show is incomparable and their dance steps are a mix of the NY, flavor combined with hte true caibean Sazon. Good luck to you guys."
1,This CD is da BOMB!! Elder is very talented and I know that he will go far in his musical career. Congrats! from Mari at SourceOne!
1,"Old School Metal! Love this band&ALWAY'S WILL,Seen him a dozen times&will continue to do so along with my teenage Son,rather take him to see an old school metal band than a rapper any old night!"
1,"Melanie is the best!!! I don't know why I took so long to buy this single or any of Melanie's other singles.I think Melanie is the best artist out there, I've loved her and her music since her spice girl days.This album is great.I really love ""Angel on my Shoulder,"" its a nice touching song.I would also recommend buying the Goin' Down CD 2(if you don't already have it) because ""I Want You Back"" is the greatest song ever.It's my fave and if you haven't heard it, you should."
1,Wonderful I have a 10mth old girl and she just loves this book. I found the seller great to purchase with. I had no hassel at all. Makes buying fun when you don't have to worry about delays.
1,"A most comprehensive and even funny Mac book I taught computer classes at a high school and had every sort of Mac from the SE/30 to IMac in the same room. This book helped me with every computer, with every problem, and stopped many classroom disasters. The format is easy, the index very complete, and you will never need another book for your Mac but this one! The fact that it is concisely and even humorously written is a bonus!"
1,"I love this show I love this show, it looks like it is going to be cancelled, such a waste. If they'd give it time, I think it would grow into a real hit. The story lines are engaging, the acting is wonderful. The premise is unique and interesting. Shows which are different need a time to grow, it is a pity this show will not be given that chance."
1,Ranchers vs Old Vegas Mob Great series featuring the beginnings of Las Vegas. Dennis Quaid is delightful as the Sheriff and I gotta love the mobsters too.
1,Capacity is key These bags can hold so much debris that I still haven't had to replace the original since I bought the vacuum about 5 months ago!
1,I'm a VERY lucky man!!!! I had this album on vinyl when it was first released in 1982 and regretted the loss of it for years!! I've been searching online for it and could only find it available for $250+!! I finally found someone selling it for a reasonable price and I GOT IT!! This is by far one the most important musical purchases I've made in years. This CD is astounding...Chaka at her best!!
1,Underated soul Diva Barbara Mason is a very underated singer. I never heard of her and purchased this cd by chance it really surprised me that this material wasnt recognized since Im always up on my music. the one song that really stands out is bed and board which is sang with depth. then there is the splendid song with the futures we got each other which really puts you in the mood for some good old soul music.
1,"...could've, should've, would've.... This album was to have been a collaborative work of Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton. But Dylan just liked to play his music and get on with it, while Slow Hand was forever and a day refining and refining and refining. So Dylan, frustrated, laid down ""Sign Language"" and then just walked away from the project. That song happens to be the best track on an otherwise not-too-shabby effort in its own right, but the question always will beg to be asked...what might have been?For some reason this work is never recognized for its intrinsic qualities, but in some respects it represents the best of what the various Eric Clapton personae were about. Dylan, of course, is Dylan. Good stuff!"
1,Great Clapton Album! Clapton just has so many great albums. No Reason To Cry is no exception. Every song on the album is great. Buy it.
1,"Gone through 2 copies - Can't wait for the Kindle edition I read roughly a book a week. This is one of my favourites. I've re-read it enough to have two copies fall apart. It's a challenging read, but a great one."
1,"One of the Best, but not for the inexperienced reader This is clearly one of the greatest SF novels of all time, but the novice reader of Science Fiction should put off reading it till they are more familiar with the genre. Zelazny was a master of one of the special joys of SF: the joy of figuring out what is going on. (note that in the first Amber novel, the narrator has amnesia and you are right there with him figuring out what is going on....) At first glance Lord of Light might seem a religious mish mash, but in fact is a techno/politico masterpiece (a really wild technolgy but not so unfamiliar politics...) Combined with the out of order chapters, it is easy to see how someone who had not read much science ficture could find this book incomprehensible. But it will give great enjoyment to the more experienced reader, (and re-reader.)"
1,"Don't let this be your first Zelazny book... or your last! This is a great book, but it is also a long and complex book. It is not a fast read. It would help if you knew something of the Hindu and Buddhist beliefs. I was suspicious at first that the author would write and write and write and then end the book without finishing it, if you know what I mean. I HATE it when a writer does that. Rest assured that Roger Zelazny finishes what he starts. If you want proof, then read his book This Immortal. It too, is a great book but way easier to read than Lord of Light. Zelazny is a fantastic writer. The images he creates in you might are nothing short of spectacular. When the book was written in 1967 motion picture special effects were not up to the task. Now though, in 2002, after Lord of the Rings, I wonder..."
1,"Zelazny's best, and one of the best ever. I read this novel in 1970 a couple of years after it was first published, and probably half a dozen times since. This story works on many levels, making it enjoyable to a wide audience. Its works as an adventure novel, a mythological fable, and as hard sci-fi with a sharp edge of social conscience. The characters are well developed throughout the story, but only late in the plot line do we really begin to understand their true motivations. And from start to finish, there's enough mystery, intrigue, and action to satisfy most anyone. In the end, the story works as a parable illustrating the greed, and lust for power common in human nature and history. It shows as well, that the true motivation of our ""heroes"" is seldom what it appears on the surface to be. So, whether you enjoy Lord of Light as a fantasy, an adventurous escape from reality, hard Sci-Fi, or as social commentary on human weaknesses, excesses, and strengths, enjoy it you most certainly will!"
1,"My favorite book of all time I've read science fiction since the third grade, and I've read alot. I am now in my early forties and have recently reread Lord of Light. It is still my favorite book. It is thought provoking, full of colorful characters, and as is often the case in Zelazny's books, it has a reluctant hero/protagonist (Sam/Buddah) whose primary attribute is his humanity. Ultimately, Sam's heroism is demonstrated by his ability to convince his peer's of their own ties to humanity."
1,"Step into Ancient Greece This is the best series of books I have found for history for 9-12 year olds. I teach 4th and 5th graders and they love these books. They have interesting pictures and are written at the perfect level. I like all the art project ideas they include, the organized method in which they are written, and the timeline which runs the bottom of the pages. This is a great resource. I can't recommend it highly enough."
1,One of my all time favorites I have been looking for this album in CD form since my turntable died and never could. This is one of my all time favorites and I was devistated when I couldn't listen to it. It brings back some very pleasant memories and I always long for them when I hear this great album. I hope everyone gets a chance to listen to the great vocal qualities of the members of LRB. They blend in a way few bands ever have. The words of Cool Change are powerful and speak of a point in my life when I knew it really was time for a change. What a great album!
1,"LOVE IT! Love Redkin Spray Starch! I can go to bed with wet hair and still style as usual in the mornings -- (and my hair doesn't break or feel damaged!) I would definitely recommed this product for women with longer hair styles - mine is about shoulder-length. Feels sticky at first, but the heat breaks the product down and hair feels natural."
1,"growing in spiritual maturity in a quick reading of 'restless souls' i find persons of courage and determination who look beyond echoes to provide voices that help move us beyond traditionally divisive conceptions of faith and value toward building inclusive community characterized by respect, justice, and mercy. i look forward to spending more time here. gr"
1,"Exactly what I've been needing! This is a fantastic book! I am a teacher and graduate student, but I could never manage to read the Bible. The significance of the passages always escaped me, the Bible seemed overwhelming and confusing, and I couldn't fathom how people could read so much into a single line. This book is exactly what I have been needing. The authors pick out a huge variety of Bible readings, and then explain their significance and context in a way that's both profound and completely understandable. I am finally able to see ""the big picture."" It's also removing a source of guilt from my life - one of those things that you don't realize is such a thorn in your side until it's gone. I've wanted to read the Bible for so long, but previously it just never ""clicked."""
1,"paradise war is one of the best series I,v ever read .thanks I,v read this series three times and it still fasinates me!!!! ....sabrin"
1,good Good book.well written and keeps your attention all the way through.excellent discriptive writing.
1,"Lawhead's Best Work I've been an avid fan of Stephen Lawhead's work for some years now, and I truly believe that the Song of Albion triology is his best work to date. Our world is but a shadow compared to the world Lawhead creates when Lewis and Simon cross over into the Otherworld. It's incredibly vivid and the plot is so engaging and well thought out that you can't help but be drawn into it. Celtic mythology is also something so different from any other culture in the world, and Stephen Lawhead the master of the Celtic/Fantasy genre. I can't speak highly enough of these books, and for me they sit equal with 'Magician' and just below 'The Lord of The Rings' as all time fantasy classics."
1,Great I love the SprinBrush heads for my toothbrush. These work so much better as both heads move and give me really clean teeth.
1,His books enlighten me! I had studied a lot of techniques but Meisner. One day at the book store I decided to buy this book to start learning Meisner and when I finished the first one I ordered the rest right away. The technique is explained very clear. It is helpful for me as a teacher. I don't know how can he simplify this complicated exercises into something very concrete. It is a REAL workbook!

1,"Sanctuary: The Complete Second Season Thanks, Amazon, for making it so easy to keep getting seasons of my absolute favorite television series. Sanctuary and all the Stargate series are great!!! My whole family love Helen Magnus and her crew. Even gotmy husband, who is strictly a sports and western fan, to watch and now he's hooked. Never need to worry thatmerchandise will be anything but perfect when it arrives, barring any problems during transit."

Danial Jackson, Todd and Beckett!!! LOVE IT!!! The stories are fresh! Ugh I hate the ""continued"" at the end of the season!!! I am impatient!!! I like the new monsters weekly! Always a bad guy to contend with! I look forward to season three!!!"
1,"Sanctuary Fan Sanctuary is the best and very imaginative in it story lines. I love Amanda Tapping and the whole cast, they are so talented. The bonus features were great too, I liked hearing what they had to say about an episode or anything else. I love Sanctuary, I can not wait for season 3.Big Fan,Christine Martin"
1,"Sanctuary, Season Two Season two built on season one perfectly. I love this series and cannot wait until season three has been released so I can find out what happens to Will (and the world) in relation to Kali."
1,"So organized now! When I first got the bag I thought the color was a bit too neon for me but I decided that the great features of the bag far outweighed the color. Now, I am way over the color and actually really like it now. I think this bag is amazing. I love all the room, tons of pockets, it's easy to wear, it's iPod friendly and I really like that it hangs from my stroller. I think they thought of just about everything when designing this bag. I recommend this bag to every mom out there. Don't be afraid of the green. It's totally retro and it grows on you very fast. I'd buy it all over again."
1,"Political Dub for the 21st century I picked this CD up in spain and upon coming back to the united states was surprised that ADF's CDs were nowhere to be found in american record stores. But after a listen to Community music you can understand why. This album has grooves that infect your mind and some of the most powerful anti-capitalistic lyrics around. If your a fan of reggae, dub, indian music, techo, or just meaningful music, this cd is a must buy."
1,"A Rare Find First published in Hungary in 1940, this is the first English publcation of this novel.The story is an erotic telling of the story of Giacomo Casanova after his escape from Venice's most infamous jail. He goes to Bolzano to rebuild his life and to resume his life of seduction. He picks Bolzano because of his history with the place and this particular lady. The story picks up when her husband, the elderly duke ....Well you can guess the story from there. It marks the second novel of Sandai Marai that's in print. It also makes you wonder what other great novels were printed in a time, place and language waiting to be rediscovered."
1,"best fit ever for on-line purchase these are the best ever fit and comfort shoes i have ever purchased online I am on my feet for hours and my feet feel great , Jessica Simpson shoes are to die for."
1,Work it! I love this shoe! I tried it on at Macy's and looooved it! I actually bought the wrong size on Amazon and had to return them but i will definitely get them again in the correct size! Because of the patent leather they fit really snug so i'd go with your size or just a 1/2 size below your normal size. These make your legs look long and gorgeous move over boots I believe these pumps were made for walking the streets of our city and the hallways at the office! Jessica's shoes are so beautiful and fit great. Work it girls!

1,"anatomy of a dream If your looking for a guide to help you understand and interpret your dreams, this book is excellent! With the knowledge and awareness attained in this book you open yourself to having more fruitful experiences when you dream.this book helped me solve many of my own dream realm puzzles"
1,Dreams Sylvia is talented and can help with dreams. She has helped a lot of people in life. suggestive Recommending: = The Discovery of Dreams A-Z.
1,Very helpful for parents The best thing about this book is the practical advice she provides about helping children deal with and eliminate nightmares. Her insights into protecting children from needless violent images are excellent. I can't say it strongly enough she provides sensible suggestions that if implemented would benefit generations of children.
1,"Awesome With multiple objectives, this game will keep you coming back to play again and again. First, find the way out. Second, search for secret items. Third, see how quickly the scenario can be completed. Fourth, do the first three objectives in one of the four difficulty levels.Some fans may find it a bit boring after Resident Evil 4 as this game has more of a classic Resident Evil feel. Also, even on the easier modes, this game is very challenging. It's not for the impatient or easily frustrated.I gave it five out of five for fun, overall play and another 5 for replay value. No Resident Evil collection is complete without this game."
1,"Challenging and Lifechanging Reverend Gainous presents a tremendous challenge to move beyond the medicraty of sideline Christianity by moving into a position of power and faith, which leads to ultimate victory that all believers can enjoy. His practical and personal experiences adds life to each phase of development in order to become the contenders that God expects for Christians to be. I salute this work and highly recommend it for it's excellence toward bringing believers into the reality of the personal sacrifices and price to be paid to truly enjoy God given victories. The athletic and military analagies allows the reader to relate to biblical and spiritual principles from a practical perspective."
1,Taking Charge of Your Life Reverend Gainous offer us in his book more than strong inspirational quotes and passages...he offer us the clear roadmap in how to take charge of our affairs in life and became a true successful contender in the eyes of The Lord.
1,"Crown Molding by Wayne Drake Wayne,I searched the web for some good info on crown molding. Your book is nothing short of fantastic. After making my own templates I felt confident enough for the real thing. Every cut was perfect. No gaps....WOW.

1,"Futuro Support this product was shipped promptly and is of good quality. it helps relieve the pain of tendinitis in the forearm but most importantly, when worn, it is a constant reminder to take it easy. pains often come on quickly but healing requires time."
1,"Thank Goodness! Thank goodness I bought these. I have tennis elbow in both elbows because of my career. (Flower design.) I have been suffering for quite awhile and I just got these braces and put them on and I can immediately feel a difference. My fiance better watch out, I can already tell this will help my bowling! A great relief for a great price!"
1,"rmcfurball I like this elbow support very much. I am wearing it right now and have had it on all day. It is very comfortable. It is so hard to find the right support, that I was so glad that I found it on Amazon.com. I have had a nerve problem for many years and have had to wear a support just about every day. If I don't I have major pain down my arm and into my fingers. This support does what it is intended to do."
1,"Amazing, supportive, comfortable, and awesome boots. Honestly, I rely heavily on reviews, which is why I must comment on these. They are awesome! I have never bought a pair of boots at this price that are so comfortable. I love them. I typically wear Vasque hiking boots or Montrails, but I did not want to spend over seventy-five dollars on boots. After all, they are just going to get muddy and trashed, right?These fit the bill, and they are plenty good for hiking. I cannot comment on the waterproof capabilities because I do not plan on using them when it is wet. I just don't want to chance ruining these. Although, they are very well made boots and I highly recommend them if you do not want to spend too much money on hiking boots. Save your money and buy these if they are still priced fairly (under sixty-five dollars). Don't go after those one hundred dollar or more pairs of boots. It is simply just wasting your money. These work as well as any hiking boots that I have ever worn for walking."
1,"Indispensable I now have all three grades, and find them indispensable! After I purchased this, I read the home vs professional style, and have to say that I don't have a problem with the home series."

I have been in the martial arts for a long time and I always recommendstudents and parents of students to read this book.It so happens the Master Peter Urban was my SENSEI back in the 60's.There has been a lot of SENSEI'S but nothing like Master Peter Urban.
1,Excellent shirts!!! Two co-workers and I ordered these shirts. We are all extremely satisfied with them. These shirts are an excellent value. We would recommend them highly to all our friends and colleagues.
1,"The shirt that killed my dog and made my wife leave... First, a horrifying coincidence happened when the UPS man dropped the package containing my Bill Blass Dress Shirt with Fashion Pointed Collar onto my doorstep just as The General, my wife's wiener dog, was exiting through his doggy door . The weight of this seemingly light package crushed The General's aft legs on impact as he went for his morning tinkle. The General gimped back into the house, without tinkling, limping and screeching. Since my wife was gone, and I had recently seen a program on the Discovery Channel about amputation, I decided to take it upon myself to help The General out of his misery. As I was cutting off his hind legs, my wife came home. End of story. Apart from that, it's a lovely shirt, and I'd recommend it to anyone! Good luck."
1,Cute and functional! Ordered this as a gift for a friend and they absolutely love it! Its very durable and just plain fun to serve out of.
1,"Outstanding This is would have to be without doubt one of the best live concerts on DVD. Buy it, put it on and turn it up full blast. You won't be disappointed, I assure you."
1,"Another brilliant performance by the Scorpions I just watched this DVD for the first time,and what a show! The Scorpions prove again that they are the BEST LIVE BAND EVER! I have been saying that for 30 years now and this DVD proves it again. The band is awesome. And with guests Uli Jon Roth,Micheal Schenker, and Herman Rarebell this is truly a must have for any Scorpions fan.It was shot during the tour for the Unbreakable album,and the track list covers all era's of the band's extensive record catalog.From Speedy's Coming and Pictured Life to Love 'Em or Leave 'Em.This show ROCKS! Crank up the surround sound and enjoy!"
1,"An excellent instructional Video. Killy only does the inro and trailer section. Jens Husted and Chris Ryman skiing together,as in their Black Diamond video, do the demonstrations. Sybervison presents the skiers perfect turns from all angles, in slow motion and reverse photography so the viewer can see how all body parts work together in linking short and medium radius turns on moderate, steep, mogul and powder conditions. The Killy and Black Diamod tapes are both excellent. The music is great as well. Even though the tape was made 15 years ago the form is timeless. Watch this video several times a week during the ski season to implant the image of perfect turns in your head. Ski and watch again. You will improve. Add to this video Ellen Post Fosters Skiing and the Art of carving which describes the subtle differences with the new shaped Skis and your collection of training videos will be complete."
1,the book is amazing!!! i just like to say that it is worth 5stars and its worth reading more than once.it 's interesting!!!! kartik mahajan age 12
1,"Five Stars For Verne!! Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, is a great book packed with adventure and suspense. In 1866, there is a mission to kill a giant cetacean out at sea. A group of men go out to kill the strange creature, which turns out to be something unexpected. The men are taken prisoners of the strange creature and have to find a way to escape! Jule Verne was a great author born in Naotes, France in 1828. He always was fascinated by science, which inspired him to write about submarines, television, atomic bombs, and automobiles even before they were invented! Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is fantastic!! Read it!!!!!"
1,A Great read This book was an amazing book that I could not put down after I started reading it. If you like adventure and a little bit of fictional history you will love this book. In Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea there are lots of great adventure scenes. I also like how Jules Verne describes everything in such detail. I would definitely recommend this book.
1,"Loved it! I want to read it again! This is a awesome book. I like this better than Journey to the Center of the Earth. It's a little long but its worth the time it takes to read it. An exciting journey is waiting for you with in the pages of the wonderful classic book. My fave parts are when they; visit Atlantis, go hunting underwater, and go pearl diving. However, I still want to know more about Captain Nemo. The book didn't answer all my questions about him. God bless ya."
1,"Lots of thumbs up! 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA is a great book by Jules Verne. It is about a ship that gets attacked by a giant sea monster. Professor Aronnay sets off in his steel plated submarine to find the monster. Captain Nemo is near, and agrees to to go into a new world. He doesn't expect a sea monster, though! Lots of action in this book - blowing things up, great escapes, and. . . you can find out the rest for yourself!"
1,I love this book! I LOVE this book!!!<3I gave this rating because this book is awesome!! Also because I could imagine the book in my head
1,"Great aid to the real story. We are reading the unabridged version to the kids and this is an indespensible aid for understanding the descriptive story. The pictures are great and very accurate to the descriptions. Historical notes put the story in context of when it was written (i.e. marvels at an electric engine, extant knowledge of sea life, predictions about underwater scuba gear). The kids can follow along in this while I read and the text is very close. I heartily recommend it as a reading aid."
1,"Challenging but beautiful. The original story is lush with great vocabulary and detailed description, a little work, but well worth it. I'm reading it aloud to my 10, 9, and 6 year olds. The DK illustrated abridgement is a good supplement too."
1,"Dated, but a great read Sure the language has changed since it was written, and it was translated from French. But the ideas hold up great, the plot is cool, and the characters are entertaining. A great read, entertaining to see what J.V. predicted correctly and what was totally off. The introduction was pretty cr*ppy. It tried to make J.V. seem like a futurist without peer. One example - he predicted the escape velocity of a rocket. I believe an Italian dude figured that out in the 1600's.Want to read a good classic? This is it. Need to discover a tried and true sci-fi original? Ditto."
1,Luis's review This book is a good book. I like this book beacause Buster won the Brain.IT is a cool book to read.IT is a funny book. THE END.
1,"Zooooooom! I bought this while in the throes of tech-horror. I was trying to get a wireless network going with my mac and stereo and spent days fooling with settings and rebooting my old Actiontec wireless modem each time. Yuk! A mac tech suggested a new modem. It didn't help with the network--noone could figure out why, but I never could set one up. However, I'm very happy with the modem. It's strong, it restarts and connects flawlessly, and I've had absolutely no trouble with it. As far as I'm concerned, the best electronic equipment is the stuff that I can just forget about. The zoom is just that."
1,"I hate Chevy Chase, too! This book is a must read for anyone who grew up watching Saturday Night Live, even in the bad years. I really enjoyed reading this book because it gave first hand accounts of events,from several different points of view. The thing that struck me most about reading this was how much talent Lorne Michaels had and misused through the years. He is nothing, if not short sighted!I also love how cast members and writers all just aired their dirty laundry. All of the feuds and petty arguments came through! What can I say, I'm sycophantic for the original cast, and several of the later casts. If you are a fan of SNL, any cast, this book is for you!"
1,"Some reviews are mean-spirited & personal ...It's a fun book, full of fascinating stories, and if you like SNL, the odds are overwhelming you'll like Live from NY too. Thanks!"
1,"For anyone who LOVES SNL! This book may look big in size but it is a quick read. It is mostly old cast members, writers, and hosts talking about the show. It is the most honest look at the show that I have ever seen. It is sweet, touching, funny, and raw. I couldn't put down. I was fascinated by people who actually knew John Belushi talking about his last days. Also Adam Sandler's dismissile from SNL. No matter what cast is your favorite this behind the scenes book will give you a new perspective of the show."
1,"The Mackintosh Treasury This is an amazing, in-depth book which everyone should read! C. H. Mackintosh has the Spirit-filled ability to travel wonderfully deep into the Word of God. I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a closer walk with God!"
1,Very good movie I thorougly enjoyed watching the Chronicles of Narnia movies. They are greatly entertaining and the 3D amazing. Recommended for the whole family.
1,"A continuation of cinematic excellence As the previous film of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" septalogy, ""Prince Caspian"" honours the original fantasy novel by Professor C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) with its high standard of acting, cinematography, special effects, and, of course, a good screen play. As the previous one did, this film grows on the viewer, and, when seen for the first time, although impressive and endearing, it is perhaps not as deeply successful as when seen repeatedly, allowing the viewer to better capture many beautiful details missed before."
1,"Excellent Service Classic 3-disk Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian:I can only comment that the disk came 2-3 days after my order, so it was really delivered fast.Due to the combination of many situations over the past month we have been unable to watch the film, outtakes, etc. I'm sure the quality will be excellent, and I look forward to a breathing spell to watch it all."
1,"the best narnia movie yet! Full of action, cool war scenes, and engaging characters, ""Prince Caspian"" is by far the BEST NARNIA MOVIE YET!!! (and yes, I have seen all three several times!)There is one scene with two 'things' named Thirst and Hunger that is pretty... well, scary for younger kids.Other than that, this is a great family film!"
1,"Prince Caspian When it came out on the ""big screen"" the film was not nearly as well receieved as The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe was. I admit that when I first saw it, I thought it was not quite as complex as the first one. However, after watching it again (I bought this and The L,W&W so my children could see them before watching Dawn Treader at the theater) my opinion has changed. I greatly enjoyed this film, even with the differences from the book. (The differences from the books in each of the movies, including Dawn Treader, might disappoint faithful fans of C.S. Lewis, and I understand. Yet, in some ways, the differences provide for broadened ideas of how the same or similar truths can be told.)"
1,Fantastic! This is a great movie. It is very entertaining. I will look forward to seeing the other movies in this series!
1,"One word: AMAZING! I saw ""Prince Caspian"" immediately after watching ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"" on TV. I was blown away by LWW, and I knew I had to watch Prince Caspian.Get this, I wasn't a fan of Narnia (or didn't even knew about Narnia, for that matter).So I decided to watch trailers for Prince Caspian, and it looked AMAZING!I watched it in theater, and I was just blown away. So, I saw it three more time in theaters.ANYONE will like this movie... It's just beyond amazing.I own the DVD now, and I surely will be watching this just about every weekend!Buy it..."
1,"Good Family Movie (Age 13+) I ordered this movie for the whole family. We all enjoyed the first one.Quick delivery as usual, no problems, 5 stars again."
1,"Great movie! A bit off from the book in terms of accuracy, but still a great story line and movie. I'm glad to own it."
1,This was the only on of the set I didn't have. Now I have the complete set. I've enjoyed these dvd's since they first came out. I watch them quite often.
1,"Another Quality Production As always, Disney has produced another first-rate production of the Chronicles of Narnia. The acting, wardrobe, scenerey and graphics are flawless and leave you with a deep desire for more. I can only say that for the extra $2.00 or less, the Disney production is light-years superior to the mediocre, cheap crud that the BBC produced."
1,"Knot nuts want naught Hard to add anything to the discussion, as it has all been said. This was a good purchase. I will make one comment I didn't see elswhere: the brass rivet that holds the cards together has a big enough opening to thread a piece of 550 through as a lanyard or threaded onto the hank of rope in a pack."
1,"Great Knot Cards I purchased this item in the hopes of helping myself and my son to be better knot tiers. These little cards do a great job at educating in the art of the knot. The cards are thick plastic and should last a lifetime. If you are looking for a minimal tool to help boost your knot tying skills, a product which is long lasting, and for relatively cheap? Check this one out."
1,Very Cool I ordered this mainly to learn some Knots. This is nice to throw in the backpack and take out for a camping trip. Use the examples to try out some knots.Good product. Very useful.
1,"Great Starter Cards My nephew wanted these for his survival kit. The cards are straightforward for him, and he's practiced them on his own. He takes them with him on his camping trips now, and likes to use these practical and functional knots. He's very happy with the cards. They're light, small, and waterproof."
1,Fun and great for camping It is light weight and small so you can bring it on any adventure. Its easy to use and fun. I think most people would be very happy with this purchase.
1,"Durable and Useful Ok - this is a durable, compact, and clear guide for tying knots. I keep it in my truck so that I can always reference the right way to lash something down. The cards are made out of plastic so they aren't going anywhere and the ink seems to stay on the cards well so far."
1,"Nice Now I can tie a slip knot. A small, yet simple card with more of the most used knots you should probably know how to tie."
1,"The magic that was and will always be Connie Francis . . . Although Celine Dion nearly does with a couple of her numbers there is no female singer who can ""cry"" a tune like Connie Francis ! Her voice never ever fails to brings home to us as listeners' a true love, lost, unrequited or just never ever found. One indeed wonders to what heights this amazing performer could have taken her career if her vicious rape in a hotel room never happened. To the diva of my youth and the diva of my life time, long may your voice be heard on radios' gaga-gaga . . ."

1,"Excellent First book I've read that makes sense / is understandable to normal people. Unlike the usual stupifying fare, felt I could use some of this in the real world. Diagrams were helpful. Definitely a different take on intuition...."
1,"American history I ordered this for my grandson, but this book is filled with history, history of those that have been forgotten, but have contributed so much to this society, which has produced such great black men like Obama. It if wasn't for them, he would've never achieved the accomplishments he has."
1,Humbled I decided to read this book while on vacation. The story of Booker Talliaferro Washington touched my heart. I am a 64 year old white man born in Booker T Washingtons home state of Virginia. It hurt me to think of that great man being a slave. A genius of his calibre cannot be held down. It is my wish that all people could read his story. I was humbled when I read this book. I wish that his legacy had endured more among the black population of this country. His message of hope through education and love of labor for its own rewards is a profound statement of love and commitment to his race. He is in my mind one of the greatest men who ever lived. God bless the man and his memory. Please read this book.
1,"Well-written story of an amazing man I knew next to nothing about Booker T. Washington prior to reading this book. Now I feel honored to have had his story shared with me. Despite the risk of sounding cliche, he has become an inspiration and hero to me. If not for his convictions and spirit, he would have been quite ordinary. Instead, he accomplished incredible goals, overcoming unimaginable feats, and has reached an inumerable amount of people, generation after generation. This book is a mainstay on my bedside table. Required reading for all."
1,"Read up on Booker T. Washington I greatly enjoyed this book! I admire Booker T. Washington for his endless pursuit of education. This book is a great inspiration to any student. The only thing that I was disappointed with was the fact that Mr. Washington did not get into his personal or family life. I agree that school can change a person, And I believe that education can greatly shape who a person is, but I don't belive that education is the only thing that molds us. I would have loved to find out as much about Mr. Washington's private life as I learned about his schooling, and his work for schools. Despite all this, I think this book is wonderful. If you know a high school student, or college student, give this book to them as a gift. It is a good read."
1,"A Good Keepsake In the past, I have tried and tried to keep and journal and just didn't keep it. I would write in it for a few days and then forget to write in it. When my 13th birthday rolled around, my mom got me ""Dreams- A Notebook Journal"" and told me to try to keep it. Since my birthday, I have written in it everyday. I love the journal's design and how the pages look inside. I would recommend this to any young girl looking for a good journal to write their personal thoughts and dreams in."
1,Sexy and Irreverent This is the sound of London's Sonic Mook Experiment club trying to outscuzz New York and LA and it works exceedingly well. Guitar feedback and perversity but never at the expense of danceability. Imagine Death in Vegas but less dirge-y and with a bit more squelchy electro fun at various tempos. It is unmixed.
1,"Timeless Gems of Wisdom It's amazing how the reasoning and the tactics of an ancient Chinese warrior apply to the modern day stock investor. The battlefields are different but the strategies sre the same. The author makes these comparisons in an easy-to-read style. No wonder he's known throughout Asia as the ""Singapore Sage"". It is a fine piece of work."
1,"Redheads Rock Marion Roach, NPR correspondent, is a redhead, and aims to get to the bottom of redhead mythology in our culture. She discusses the oldest famous redheads, like Lilith (Adam's pre-Eve wife in the bible), Set, and Mary Magdalene. She also gets into the genetics of red hair, and explains why it's rare. She also discusses the historical attributes associated with red hair through time. It was formerly thought that Jews were redheads, and later, that redheads were not to be trusted. More currently, red hair is associated with sexual prowess and a hot temper. This book is a fun and intellectually satisfying read, especially for redheads."
1,Great book for boys!!! I loved this book when I was in 3rd grade and now I am reading it to my 2nd and K. They love it too! Every night we read 2 chapters so we got through it in less then a week. Now I have little inventors running all around the house. Should pay dividends come science fair time!Charlie
1,My library fees on this one are outrageous This is the one that started it all for me. The most exciting book about a smart kid you will ever find. It's been overdue ...for a long time.
1,"Great cherry table As others had said, this table is CHERRY. I bought it because I needed a larger table for my walnut chess board and the woods do not match at all -- though the table matches my cherry bookshelves perfectly (which is what I was hoping for from the other reviews). If you order from Amazon directly the packaging will be second to none and the table will arrive quickly.My only complaint was one little chip on the inside of one leg, but it's well hidden. This is a great product and you should buy without hesitation."
1,"Stanford Mission Coffee Table Love the table it is very well made and sturdy. The first shipment had to be sent back because the apron was lined up incorrectly. That was a hassle, as well as it took me over 3 months to receive the table in the first place (they had trouble locating it in the warehouse). But I am very pleased with the actual table! It is far more beautiful than the pictures depict. Beautiful wood and very elegant. Very easy assembly."
1,"solid golden oak but white as veneer..! before you order, make sure this is the color you want. if you order ""golden oak"", it is not the real golden oak, or at least this is not what I think is golden oak. the moment i opened the box, I was like, oh.. no! the top is like the veneer (yellowish white). so, i have to return and order the honey oak. in terms of quality, construction and assembly, it is great. putting the top part of the table is kinda tricky, so it took time. i was able to assemble in 10 mins, being a man with handyman inclination. you just need the right hexa-keys. but real solid and no compromise with the quality. this is exactly the quality I was looking for to adore the living room. thanks amazon for the super hassle-free return policy.then I got the honey oak that exactly mathced my other furnitures and even the wood-flooring in my dining area. wow! beautiful looking table with a solid quality. adds great value to our living room!"
1,Wonderful Guide to forming your own traditions My family was looking to develop our own traditions and to understand why traditions where as they are today. This book was a wonderful source.
1,"Superior product This beefy book will provide me with a wealth of info each year as I weave a Solstice celebration into my busy holiday schedule. Getting back to my Scandinavian ancestral heritage is important to me as I age, and this book is a thoroughly researched and comprehensive tool for observing this special event."
1,"Very Nice! The other reviews helped me decide to purchase this item. I was not disappointed. I am pleased with the quality, and particularly like the large bale on the back that enables you to use a thicker chain."
1,Robin of Sherwood Review Fun series. I used to watch it growing up and I found it incredible that I was able to find the whole series on DVD! Thank you Amazon.com
1,"works like a charm The installation of drivers for this card was easy, and I now have easy access to firewire and USB 2.0 on my notebook. There is an optional AC adapter available for this product, but for use on my desk, I just use a firewire/USB hub combo that is powered. I have nine hardware devices daisy-chained from this card to powered hubs with no problems at all. It is recommended to only use one USB port at a time unpowered, such as on the road. I don't expect to need more than that if I'm mobile."
1,Great comforter for the value price! Not bad for a down alternative - color matches the color scheme in bedroom - nice olve color - nice sheen to it - looks expensive.
1,"This thing is great! I have always one issue or another with my glasses and tiny screws. This thing is awsome. Got essentially all the precision drivers that you might need, unless you have a fairly exotic frame (I got some form Germany, Japan, USA and Denmark, it works on all)."
1,"piano bundled with piano teacher I bought two of these as gifts to musically talented children in the Ukraine and Belarus, because I wanted to deliver a self teaching piano. This is a wonderful keyboard, capable of teaching a very wide variety of songs to a beginning student."
1,"Jason Nevins does it again! Can Mr. Nevins do no wrong? His remixes for Elvis, The Blackout All-Stars, Kelly Clarkson, and Madonna have been wonderful, and he continues this tradition with Anastacia.1. Left Outside Alone (Radio Edit) (10/10, 3:59): Great.2. Get Ready (Album Version) (9.9/10, 3:33): Eh. An entertaining, but forgettable, track. She cusses a lot too.3. Left Outside Alone (J. Nevins Global Edit) (11/10, 3:49): Awesome rock-flavored mix.4. Left Outside Alone (J. Nevins Global Club Mix) (11/10, 8:10): Takes awhile to get started, but still AWESOME!!!5. Left Outside Alone (Jason Nevins Mixshow) (2000/10, 5:31): The absolute BEST remix he's ever done. More of a tribal feel than the others.Buy this if you love remixes or are an Anastacia fan. You won't be disappointed."
1,"Adzuki beans Adzuki ( or Azuki) beans are ment to be used in asian sweets. You can make sweet bean paste by boiling the beans for 30-40 min, (changing the water out at least twice) draining and mashing the beans with sugar.(strain the paste if you do not like the bean skins) What you get is a paste that can be put on ice cream, fill pasteries or stuff into Mochi Cakes."
1,"A necessity for everyone I graduated college in 1961 with an engineering degree from a highly rated school. A required non-engineering course was economics. I remember very little from that class except for a little red book authored by someone named Huff and that that book was one of the most enjoyable and educational books from my whole college career. [After an exhaustivesearch for the book, I found it and] I grabbed it! This book has saved me untold dollars by teaching me to look at most statistics with a very jaundiced eye and to laugh at most commercials. I just put my copy in with the materials I use to teach a class at a local community college since I expect that we [will be able to use the book to discussvarious issues related to current day politics.] I am also ordering several copies for gifts including one for my college freshman grandaughter. So what if the author states that a Yale graduate is doing well at an annual salary of $24,000. Everything else is current."
1,"Should be Required Reading! ""How to Lie with Statistics"" should be required reading before allowing anyone in today's world to call themselves an adult. And, yes, there should be strict testing for understanding this book before anyone is allowed to leave public (or private) schools and take part in real life.This book shows some of the ways media such as newspapers, TV, internet, etc. decieve you. Besides the media (especially advertisers); politicians, lawyers, and all sorts of other folks behave like confidence men and try to get your money, your trust, your vote, and your beliefs.IMMUNIZE YOURSELF! Read this book. Buy this book. Study this book. Memorize this book!This book will help you avoid the crooked people."
1,"Classic introduction to the topic This is a classic introduction to the language of statistics and how a few well placed numbers/graphs/terms can distort reality. I use this as a supplementary reading for my undergrad students and they love it. It helps to clarify why language, numbers, and representations are so dangerous."
1,"A great read and educational too! I currently teach statistics in Cincinnati, Ohio. The book How to lie with statistics held my attention from beginning to end. It not only informs the reader of common pitfalls in statistical studies, but it does so in a highly entertaining fashion. I believe that my students will enjoy the book, and I hope that they will start to enjoy statistics as well. The book was written some time ago and the figures are very outdated. I believe my students will find that amusing and will be even more interested in the reading."
1,"how to catch errors in statistics both the malicious and innocent kind How to lie with Statistics covers all the uses of statistics through a hit list of it's abuses. By covering how to lie with statistics the author teaches both awareness of misleading statistics and also the basics of this branch of mathematics. It is amazing how subtle a misleading statistic can be. For example there are many types of averages, the mean median and mode. In some cases they produce different results so a statistics compiler can choose the one favorable to him or her. I hoped to get a birds eye view of statistics from this book so as to improve my awareness of the constant abuse of statistics that occurs in the media. I believe I got that and more out of this book."
1,"How to Lie with Statistics It was great! I know the author's daughter, and she really wanted a copy of her father's book. So it was nice to get a great copy of the book."
1,"Great Mag I bought this for my teenage grandson and the reason I chose this magazine is because years ago I had always enjoyed it! Well, it proved that it has staying power through the years. My grandson enjoys it also an looks forward to each and every issue."
1,"BOMSHEL DROP HOW AWESOME - I CERTAINLY HOPE THEY DO MORE, I SAW THEY AT A CONCERT AND WAS TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY AND WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND THIS CD TO LISTEN TO AND SHARE WITH MY FIREND, I BOUGHT THREE OF THEM!"
1,"The ultimate novel about pure evil! I first read this book over 20 years ago, while a high school student in Connecticut (Mr. Tryon's birthplace). I never saw the movie because I was afraid ""Hollywood"" would ruin a perfect story. I have never read a novel since that is as suspenseful or frightening. Please bring this masterpiece back so other generations may enjoy(?) it."
1,"Excellent. Tryon does everything exactly right in this novel, a classic psychological horror story. I envy anyone encountering it for the first time."
1,"Find this book! My dad introduced me to the work of Thomas Tryon. A few months ago he found a handful of books up in the garage that he'd read when he was in high school, and some of Tryon's novels were among them. I cooked through Harvest Home and was very impressed with with his masterful descriptions and breathtaking plot twists/revelations. Then I read The Other... I was completely blown away. You can't miss this book. It's a masterpiece. It's not frightening in a slasher, better-look-over-your-shoulder-type way, but the concept will chill you, without a doubt. It's such a good story, and it's executed so well... It's the best book I've read in a very long time. I would recommend it to anyone who is the mood for a good, haunting, thought-provoking piece of literature. My hat is off to Thomas Tryon... I can't wait to get my hands on another one of his works."
1,"I love this album This is my favorite album this year. Although folks are calling it a ""concept"" album, I prefer to think of it a a rock opera wedged somewhere between Sgt Peppers and Eldorado. My 16 year old daughter and I are currently fighting about which song is the best, but we love them all."
1,"""Good Stuff"" I first obtained this product in a gourmet chocolate shop in Punta Gorda, Florida. I enjoyed it very much, but after returning home to Maryland I had no idea where I could purchase more. I went to Amazon and there it was. Thank you, Amazon."
1,"Excellent Once again Nick Kemp mixes music and voice to produce deep states of relaxation, whilst pointing to the deeper truths that are available to all. You may find a mantra here, or simply sounds and word.Either way this CD is highly recommended for anyone who has considered this idea... ""when you've seen beyond your SELF, you may find peace of mind is waiting there."""
1,"I always use this cookbook This cookbook is filled with easy to make recipes that are light(er) than standard and that also taste good. I say ""light(er)"" because some recipes like the easy chicken stroganoff use ingredients like light sour cream and pasta. While it isnt the lightest meal, it is lighter than is relatives and still tastes good. All of the recipes list calories, fat, carbs etc..I do not think I have actually made anything from this book that wasn't good and I have cooked at least 30 of the books recipes at least once.I am a pretty lazy cook and selfish with my free time. I do not want to mess with something that has tons of ingredients, long preparation or long cooking times. When I use this book I target recipes that can be made in around an hour or less and that have a simple list of ingredients. There are many to choose from in that category.I have recommended this book to all of my friends and several co-workers."
1,"Real Africa at it's best... Ruarks style and attention to details make this book leap off the page. Visions of the African landscape appear in your mind. Ruark describes the sights, smells, and the very face of Africa. Also the foreshadowing of his alcoholism is recounted time and again. I can't wait to read it again!"
1,"Horn of the Hunter By Robert Ruarke I purchased this any several more for my husband. He loves to read and to be informed on many different things. This coming year the oportunity came up for him to go to Africa to hunt. As he is an avid hunter and hunts all over this continent each year he jumped at the oportunity. Now part of his prep he is reading about the great safaries of the past,Ruark Hemingway Roosevelt Botington etc. We really enjoyed this book as he wrote about all aspects of the trip with very little editing. I t was about bravery in foreign country but also about his humility at the very differnt struggles of the people and thier cultures. I think everyone who reads this will be entertained in thier own way and will take something away from this that they will never forget. Happy reading and remember read some of the books on the back shelves you may just find a treasure."
1,BEST BOOK About an African Hunting Safari This is by far and away the BEST book I've ever read about a hunting safari in Africa. Ruark and his writing are in a class by himself. ALL the other books about him like Use Enough Gun were published after his untimely death. NONE of them compare. They are collections of articles and/or very short stories (some fiction) that collectively don't hold a candle to Horn of the Hunter. His writing makes you feel like you are beside him sharing his experiences. You will not regret buying this book. Simply the best!!
1,Horn of the Hunter I loved his stories of Africa! The book took me back to a better time when being on safari meant you could be killed by very dangerous animals or reptiles but humans were not quite as high up the list in the danger catalogue.
1,"WOW THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1,We Mock What We Don't Understand Words of Wisdom. Much of this book is based on scare tactics that are pretty funny actually. I liked the book for its comedy. Worth the money.
1,"The final proof that Joseph Smith was a false prophet. How To Answer A MormonIt enables the average Christian to refute Mormon missionaries with ease!.........Sword Of The Lord:Here's practical advice on how to bring a Christian witness to Mormons. Eight false prophecies from Mormon documents are discussed including the location of the ""Ten Lost Tribes"" and the discovery of people inhabiting the Moon..........Christian Bookseller's Association:This is a book we have needed for a long time. I have been confused with this problem. This book has some good guidelines on dealing with this issue"
1,"An excellent book This is truly an excellent book, and a great sequel to ""Harriet the Spy."" I read this in 2nd grade, almost immediatley after I finished ""Harriet the Spy"" and loved it. I wish Louise Fitzhugh would have written more. Louise Fitzhugh is a great author, and her books will always be classics in my library."
1,"A lovely book that stands apart from ""Harriet"" There's no question that this is a ""sequel"" to Harriet the Spy, but a fan of the first book shouldn't go in expecting more of the same. The heart of this book is not Harriet but Beth Ellen, and her shyer, more introspective nature give The Long Secret a completely different vibe. The result is a touching, beautifully observed book about one of the most challenging times of life: the point where you're just emerging from childhood and start seeing adults -- and yourself -- more clearly. It's a very funny book and a compelling mystery, but it's not just fun and games. I found the emotional currents of this book quite intense as a child, but I wouldn't trade it for anything."
1,"Condor Joe Rules! Condor Joe is the most human and endearing character of the show. He reminds me of Clint Eastwood in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". Just one tough son of a bitch."
1,"Great birthday gift I got this for my grandson for his birthday, it fit his new bow great, got bow for his birthday also. He was the happiest kid in town"
1,"Magical, and it delivered When I purchased this item, I was looking for an item that I could wear everyday, with the idea of purchasing 1 for each day of the week. The sizing is a little tricky, inspite of measuring myself. I ordered 1 size up. I had to have my husband help me put on this garment, which he could hardly do without laughing. Once the garment was on his jaw dropped to see that there was a BIG difference. The compression is awesome! This garment really helped my lower back pain! It lifted my breast, reduced my saddlebags, but most of all flattened my stomach. It was a little difficult to slide my pants on over this garment, because of the outter rubber shell. I was able to wear this garment for almost 10 hours. All in all I like this garment, but it needs to be redesigned with the crouch opening a little further to the back for potty time. This garment is magical and it delivered!"
1,"squeem squeeze! ok so I haven't had the squeem for too long to give a long term review (just received today) but I can say that it is torture just putting it on! It took me a full 30 minutes to fasten all the hook and eye closures and adjust it. With that being said, it looks very promising and am excited to see what it does in 30+ days of full time wear. Very excited. I do like it so far (the few hours I've been wearing it)"
1,A Great WWII Novel ... The story of Patty Bergen when she's only 12 is a great story and actually quite believable. I really recommend reading it.
1,"The Best Book I've Evor Read I've read meany books. I didn't realy think i had one favorit until ""Summer of my German Soldier""It made me laugh. It made me cry. I grew to know the crectors, 5to love or hate them, I aprecate my faimaly and all I have. some of you might be thinking ok this is a love story. It's that but it's so much more."
1,"A splendid book about growing up in America during a war. This wonderful book stole my heart away. Patty Bergen, the main character, is so realistic you find yourself thinking that she is going to jump right off the page and come to life. This book is suberbly written and shows the tragedy of war and how it affects people. The ending was so wonderfully written, introspective, and sad that I couldn't stop crying for a half hour!!"
1,Selected Poems I am much satisfied with the book and its dealer's rapid service. I would like them to send a receipt as soon as possible.
1,"amazing machine I absolutely love this thing. I use it constantly, for both rice and oatmeal. It almost has a happy little personality of its own. The rice it makes is delicious, with a texture that is not achievable by boiling in a pan. I am pleasantly surprised - extremely convenient if you like to eat rice. These folks seem to have thought of everything. Even the measuring is made simple. The pan is very easy to clean; the buttons are logical and not hard to learn. I especially like putting my oatmeal on the timer so that it is all nice and hot, ready for me when I wake up. I can't say enough good things, and I am not a person who likes to have appliances cluttering up my kitchen."
1,This rice cooker rules This rice cooker cooks perfect rice everytime...and it can keep the rice perfect for a day or so. Spend the extra $$ and get this one. 1 cup....10 cups....dont matter....it always does a great job. Very high quality product.
1,"rick astleys greatest hits I think this is a must have album for any dance music fan of any age I love the music and the words are quite catchy and memorable i find myself singing some of these tunes around the house.. ENJOY it's a no brainer.. Vernon E. Boardman Portsmouth, NH"
1,good stuff This does wonders for teeth and gums.First time I ordered although I used it often when in N.Y.where relatives introduced me to this product.
1,Love this Product When I am feeling lazy I love that these are quicker and easier than flossing. If you're careful they do the trick every time (but don't tell your dentist - he'll say they hurt your gums ...sure- if you use them like a pick axe...). Only problem: I can't find them anywhere - likely they are too good a value. You get a lot of them for a small price - so I'm guessing that's why my Walgreen's stopped carrying them in favor of fewer for more. I tried to order them online through amazon but it was about $20 to ship a $2.99 product...
1,Healthier Teeth I found Doctor's Brush Picks several years ago & fell in love with them. I find them gentle & easy to use which translates to my be able to keep my gums healthier. Unfortunately I can no longer find them in stores. The price on Amazon is good & being able to purchase in a larger quanity is a huge plus.
1,"The best These brushpicks are the best on the market. A friend got me started on them and I used to buy them at a chain store, but now they don't carry them anymore. I could not find them anywhere until I looked at Amazon. I am so glad the Amazon still carrys them. Please Amazon, always carry this one product."
1,GREAT toothpick ... especially when you have a bridge Love these toothpicks -- makes well and very functional ... have a bridge and this toothpicks works great / highly recommend.
1,"Outstanding product I purchased this product as a replacement for a more costly one. It performed perfectly and, for the price, is hard to beat."
1,"All that it said it was! This is such a little dust bag that holds an important part of your sanding life. The bag is made well and functions exactly like it is supposed to. Although it is a little pricey, it is necessary to have."
1,Bike Rack Genius This bike rack could not be any easier to use. The simple design fits my SUV perfectly. Very happy with this product.
1,"Easy to use, sturdy It's surprising how easy it is to strap this onto my Prius and pull it back off. It only takes about 2-3 minutes to put it into place, and the same again to put two bikes on it. It took a bit of getting used to how the tie straps work, but once I did, it's quick and easy. The rack is also very light. But the bikes stay very firmly in place. We drove four hours with these over both small state roads and interstate highways, and the bikes barely wobbled, we never feared them sliding or falling off."
1,Works great! PROS:Takes 5 minutes to install or removeFine in all weatherLooks coolSturdyCONS:Front tire is permitted limited movement (using a $2 bungee cord to secure it works well)No way to secure the bike or carrier with a lock for security
1,"BONES!!! Extremely easy to set up, works on both my 2010 Acura TL and 2004 Pontiac Vibe. I wish the space between the bikes was a little bigger, but it is not an issue. I used dog collars to fasten the wheels of both bikes together so they didn't bang around on the expressway. I thought about buying the 3 bike model for the extra room but if you are only hauling 2 bikes this model will be just fine. We ride road bikes and this rack got them to and from our destinations with ease and scratch free. The fastening strips have a nice padded lining that secures the bike so it won't mess up the paint. Great product!!!"
1,B Movie Nirvana i love these old B Movies. I remember watching these films many years ago and it;s a pleasure to see them again.
1,"Great Book The book was delivered in perfect condition and vey quickly. Having read the book I would totally recommend it. Informative, complete but maybe not ideal for a newbie."
1,"Walkthrough....................... ..................that packs lbs onto your harvest. Gains, gains and more gains. If I have any questions I turn to The Cannabis Grow Bible: the definitive guide to growing marijuana for recreational and medical use, because the answer is always in here and always top stuff. I have gone from respectable harvests to super sized gains. This is a walkthrough from start to finish that shows you all the pros and cons of doing it this way or that way. You get loads of alternatives on each of the growing methods. It even shows you how to build your own hydroponics if you want hydro. It is very cheap to grow an unbelievable bulk of quality skunk if you learn how with this book. I want to say thanks, thanks, thanks for the excellence that I found in here."
1,"You can't go wrong with this.... There is something about Amelia Bedelia that captures the attention of children, my 7 year old son can't get enough of her. If you want your child to discover the joys of laughter and fun in a book then you have to buy this!"
1,Good funny & silly books My daughter used to read Amelia Bedelia books and LOVED them! I bought these for her daughter (my granddaughter) who also loves them and is learning to read. They are funny and silly books with good morals.
1,"If I could give it TEN stars I would I had so much fun working out to this video, when it was over I wanted to do it again. The routines are challenging, but it just makes it more fun to do. If you love to dance, you will love this video."
1,Very fun video and not hard to follow! This is a great intermediate video. It's one of my favorites. It's set to Motown music and it's very fun. The moves are dancy but Donna has great cueing and after a couple of times you get it down. I don't like videos that are easy the first couple of times through because I get bored to fast. I recommend this video to anyone who enjoys dancy aerobics. IT'S FUN!
1,"great book The author relates his experience to even the most novice hunter (myself). He has a scientific, common-sense approach to deer hunting that gives confidence in his methods and makes you want to use them. His section on deer vocalizations can be confusing, but who can communicate inarticulate sounds thru plain text... However, it is fairly easy to find recordings of deer calls on the internet to clarify this matter."
1,"This book helped me bag a monster whitetail!! Thanks to Mr. Fidduccia's wonderfull section on Late Rut, I bagged a nice 12-point! To whoever reads this: I strongly recommend you purchase this book. It is well worth the money!!"
1,"Show tunes add to album! Our local reviewer said"" Show Tunes Diminish El Dorado!"" Excuse me, but I am reviewing the album,not the movie! I love this CD! And be it show tunes or not, I think it's great! I've listened to it for about 2 weeks now, and consider it one of my fav. Show tunes are in order, ""The Trail We Blaze"", ""It's Tough to Be A God"", But I also like ""16th Century Man"" which reminds me of New Orleans ""Funk"" , and I'm from South LA. Thanks , Elton John, for something new and refreshing! You win, in my book!"
1,"Love it Oh how I love this book!Vimala Thakar writes beautifully and gives you lots to think about.I bought this book as it was on the suggested reading list by OM Girl (its a blog). Then I went on to buy her other book on Raja Yoga. She is elegant and insightful and I am so glad I found her.I will keep this book forever and one day when I am a more skilled Yoga Teacher, I will use it in my class and read the quotes."
1,"Memories Come Alive My mom was appreciative of this gift. She has vivid memories of this time in our history and was pleased to receive the book- she says that at the time we were a united United States and will not ever see this agian , which is sad."
1,Purchased for my Dad Thanks. I purchased this for my Dad. He was part of that generation. Many thanks!
1,"It's A Great Book A lot of reviews make the book's simplicity of style a negative. what a surprise since it doesn't read like textbook and in fact makes history more human, and to me, more significant."
1,"Fascinating, eye-opening, heart wrenching Reading this book makes me sad that my Dad is gone and I never asked him ""What did you do in the war, Daddy"". What an opportunity I missed!"
1,"A powerful tribute I am shocked that anyone could find this book ""tedious and condescending."" I must vehemently disagree with the reviewer who states that The Greatest Generation ""minimizes every other generation of people."" It does no such thing; it is a moving tribute to a generation that deserves such a tribute. If it weren't for the struggles and heroism of that generation, we might not be here today. The reviewer I refer to writes, ""if Mr. Brokaw and others think that my generation hasn't faced death, despair, fear, illness and poverty, he and they are not truly connected to the world in which they live now."" To this reviewer, I must say that the current generations of Baby Boomers and Gen X'ers do NOT face such struggle on the same massive level as those who lived (or died) during the Depression and the World Wars. Today's ""myriad of stresses that cloud everyday life"" cannot be compared to the stresses endured by what Brokaw rightly calls the ""Great Generation."""
1,"The Next Great Generation Brokaw does a commendable job of describing how the ""Greatest Generation"" earned its name. For those who are interested in which generation is likely to be the next great one, I highly recommend a new book titled ""Millennials Rising"" by generational authors Neil Howe and Bill Strauss. They believe that in the cycle of generations, today's youngsters--the Millennials (born 1982 to the present)--will replace the G.I. generation as the next great generation. The Millennials are already reversing many of the negative social trends associated with the last generation of young adults, i.e. the Generation Xers."
1,Factual but with an emotional touch. Tom Brokaw provides a book which extends beyond dry facts and makes the events and lives come alive for the reader with the personal accounts of the people he interviewed. Highly memorable.
1,"Excellent capturing of my parents' generation.. Tom Brokaw does an excellent job of interviewing and capturing the impact of WWII on the lives of these heroes and heroines. The war experience was the common bond that elevated this generation to strive for greatness not only for their own lives but for the entire nation. Brokaw, drawing from his vast experience and skills as a newscaster, is able to extract stories of great bravery and self responsibility from each of the individuals interviewed. He brings out the sense of loyalty, duty, honor, respect and self worth, not found in today's generation."
1,Greatest Generation is the Greatest Book Tom Brokaw did a wonderful job with this book. You can really feel what all those people went through and all of the sacrifices they had to make. My faverite chapter in the book was the one about Thomas and Eileen Broderick. Thomas was a paratrooper in World War Two. He jumped into a shootout one time and a bullet hit him right in the head. He later found out that he would be blind for the rest of his life. This is just one of the many tragic and touching stories in this wonderful book. I recomend you go out and buy this book right away.
1,"Now you can FEEL the Time This book was nothing what I expected. I can now understand where some of the great people of today came from. Tom writes as if he were in awe of these people. I know I was after I read the book. This book covers the time before and during WWII. You can see the people he writes about selling newspapers, building planes, women flying the planes. This is a really feel good book. You will come away feeling great about your relatives who lived during this time. This book answered many ""Why"" questions. If you have been lucky enough to live in a close family, this will give you the reason so many familys are close, and what true family values are all about. You have heard many politicians speak of this, but this book has the answer. I didn't put it down until it was finished. I don't like Tom, but I respect his writing ability and the way he presented this book."
1,"The teachings and basics of the Golden Dawn belief system ""The Golden Dawn"" is one of the most respected systems of magic in the world: over a century old, it has its roots in long-reaching traditions. The Essential Golden Dawn is a beginner's guide geared for newcomers to Golden Dawn. The Essential Golden Dawn is written by experts on the topic and explores both the history and the spirituality of this tradition, explaining ideas of magic and magical philosophy and exploring the teachings and basics of the Golden Dawn belief system. An outstanding introduction."
1,"Great Tea DVD This is one of the most informative DVD's on tea,and how to prepare tea around today I highly recommend it. Benedic Chin"
1,"Excellent Dow Theory Explanation Robert Edwards description and analysis of the Dow Theory is, as Professor Bassetti so astutely states on page 48, a ""magisterial presentation"". I am proud to have been asked to add my interpretation to the update since Dr. Edwards death. Believe it or not, the Dow Theory is alive and well in the 21st Century and this book will help you understand why.Jack Schannep"
1,A must-have I still havn't finished this but what i have studied has been of great help in identifying chart patterns and warning me off otherwise recommended stocks. This edition in particular seems to be the ultimate edition to own as the later editions get away from the original authors' intentions.
1,"Wonderful book This book is filled with beautiful pictures that any one would enjoy. I bought it for myself, but my mother ended up with it. The photographs are amazing."
1,"Almost impossible photography The photographs in this amazing book are not only beautiful, they would have been almost impossible to capture without extreme patience and technical skill. Being a photographer for many years I was amazed to read in the end pages how the images were taken. Using a 4""x5"" camera!To be able to place a subject like a cat in front of a large-format camera which manually needs to be carefully focussed on a ground-glass at the back of the camera, the lens set to the required aperture and shutter speed, lens cocked, the film-holder dark-slide inserted and then, above all, choosing the decisive moment to take the exposure, is an amazing feat!What a fantastic photographer, a master artiste."
1,Great! This is a really cute book with beautiful pictures. I like the quotes that have been included as well.
1,MAN THESE POPS IN SPACE this cd good yeh it cool i listen and lie down yeh it good buy it but dont hop
1,"Not Supermercado but close. You either love 2 Skinnee J's or hate them. I happen to be in the first part of the equation. I have listened to Supermercado numerous times and catch them in concert whenever I can. This CD has been 4 years in the making. It is a good listen. I have had the final release for two days now and have listened to it no less than five times. But where are songs like ""Stockholm Love"" the first single that was released in 2000? This CD is definately worth buying, but it will be more meaningful if you see some of these songs performed live first."
1,"I love it! This book is wonderful- I really loved it and laughed out loud more than once. It' not for everybody, but it does have a wonderful sense of humor and it describes perfectly several situations you have lived trough. Too bad for the very British ones that I missed, not being British. But overall a wonderful read."
1,"FAST SERVICE: CLEAN, NEW BOOK This was a very interesting read about the beginning of the modern foodie movement and the Frenchman responsible for it. The historic recipies included make it possible for a modern reader to eat as royalty once did."
1,Thomas Light Perfect for a tiny bathroom. Was looking for a nautical look and ahcieved that with an upadated twist by picking the brushed nickel.
1,"An uplifting, honest publication Thank you, Kathe, for openly sharing your journey through the grief. This spiritual publication has opened up so many different emotions for me, so many unexpected feelings of loss, guilt, anger... After taking the journey myself, I have begun to walk again -- with others -- through their grief and pain. Thank you for providing the structure and 'path' which opens up the possibility for healing. Wonderful work, guided by God..."
1,"Just What I Needed... This is the perfect book for those of us who have faced the sudden and unexpected end of a pregnancy. I didn't know how to grieve my loss, after all, I had never seen or held or touched or heard my baby, but all the same, I felt an unexplainable depth of pain and loss. This book helped me to validate my unborn child's existence, give him or her an identity, and work through the process of healing. Five months after my loss, I still hurt and grieve and ache for my baby, but I know I'm on the road to recovery and will continue to recover with the help of books like this one. I also ordered one for my mother, who suffered a miscarriage 33 years ago...she said it even helped her to deal with the loss of that ""unknown"" child so long ago. I would recommend this to anyone who has suffered a pregnancy loss, who has lost a young child, or who loves someone who is going through such a difficult time as that."
1,Very helpful! I read/journaled in this book after my second miscarriage. It helped me with things that I did not even know I needed help with. I liked the guided questions and found them to be very helpful. I also know someone who read this 6 months after her miscarriage and she found she had already worked through a lot of the things that the book touches upon. Overall great book and made me feel more normal with the reactions I have had.
1,"The voices of angels I feel so sad because I can't find the Boys air choir's CDs in China.But I bought them when I saw them on Amazon by friend's help.Oh,their voices are so beautiful!In fact,5 stars is really really not enough for their CDs!And there is a question I really need your help:Why don't you have their 3-CD box set named ""Angel's Music Box""(It's really a beautiful box set!) or their 3rd album ""Air""? I trust Amazon could get them!"
1,"THEY ARE BACK They are back the girl group that has a 4x platinum cd (that means they sold over four million copies of SURVIVOR). Man i was really hesitent to buying this cd because, face it they kinda died out a whille a go, but anyways I have boughten remix cds that i am not very happy with (example: ALL SAINTS- The Remix Album) This cd is excellent I can't get over the tracks, My favorite song is jumpin jumpin (remix) lil bow wow rox on this track.

1,"Le encantÃ³ a mi niÃ±a de 3 aÃ±os... Vivo en El Salvador y tengo una niÃ±a de 3 aÃ±os, comprÃ© el video para enseÃ±arlo en la escuela dominical, mi sorpresa fuÃ© que al verlo yo en la casa mi niÃ±a de 3 aÃ±os se interesÃ³ en el video y me preguntaba que era lo que decÃ­an los vegetales (ella no habla inglÃ©s). A medida se desarrollaba el video yo le contaba la historia.... El dia siguiente ella me pidiÃ³ ver el video nuevamente y a medida ella veÃ­a el video, se lo contaba a su primito.... NO IMPORTA EL IDIOMA, las historias de la Biblia llegan al corazÃ³n, no al entendimiento....Ahora estoy pensando en comprar otro video para la escuela dominical, porque mi niÃ±a no quiere soltar el que actualmente tengo."
1,"Big Idea Productions and Lyrick Studios strick again! This is one of the best VeggieTales movies ever! Jr. Asapargus (Dave) fights a giant pickle (Golieth) in the retelling of a biblical classic. Larry the Cucumber (not a pickle) gets two thumbs up for the silly song ""I Love My Lips"". Sunday morning values and Saturday morning fun!"
1,veggie tales Veggie Tales: Dave and the Giant Pickleexcellent movie for children involving religious background from the bible with a musical twist. my granddaughter loved it.
1,"Scootering down memory lane..... Never thought this would see the light of day on CD. I wore out my viynl copy, back when we were playing at being mods. Secret Affair definately played second fiddle to The Jam, and only because Weller & Co thought of it all first (second time around). This is a wonderful platter, its not angst ridden, a stab at genuine pop music, a nod toward the 60's but original in its concept. As a band they were too clean cut to be taken seriously by the UK music press (and unfortunately, lumped in with the rest of the Mod bandwagon) but play & write they could. From the opening title cut, to the added extra tracks this is well worth the cash, and now they've re-issued the 2 following albums, also worth a listen. An album representative of a period in time when it was truly great to be young...Keep the faith! P.S. The Greatest Hits album is a winner, the best of all 3 releases, sound as a pound..."
1,"We LOVE this Game! When I saw this game in the store, I just had to have it! It was too cute for words! But, when we actually played it I was SO glad I picked it up! My whole family loves this game. Everyone can play it right down to our 3 yr old. If you've ever played Left Center Right (LCR), this game is played much like it, but with mice rather than chips. The concept is cute, the game is quick (15 minutes or less), and everyone has fun. What more could you ask for?!"
1,Helpful gadget I bought this talking compass for my grandfather who is blind. He has enjoyed taking it on his walk to the mailbox in order to make sure he does not get turned around.
1,MinnKota 3 Bank charger!! Very easy to install. A awesome product. Has really put a very deep charge into my deep cycle batteries. Love this charger!!
1,"Makes battery issues a thing of the past. I ordered this the first day I got my boat. I had a 2 bank version of this on my last boat and loved it. I see people get to the ramp with a dead battery and fiddle with charging batteries by taking them out after use and putting them on a charger. With this, you can forget all that and just plug it in and forget it."
1,I love this machine The fuzzy logic rice cooker is amazing. It took me over two years of drooling over it before I finally gave in and bought this two hundred dollar appliance. I am so happy that I did. My kitchen is full of top of the line culinary gadgets and this by far is the best. In frequency of use it comes only second after the panini press. I love this machine. I haven't had rice this good since my trip to Japan in 04. I also love the feature that lets me set the exact time for the rice to be finished.
1,"Utterly Amazing Quality I just bought this thing from Amazon, and once I popped in some sushi rice and it popped out, I could not believe the @#$@#% amazing quality of this thing. It's completely perfect.-Amazing, extremely tasty rice-Easy to clean-Simple to use yet many flexible optionsThings to know before you buy:-The # of cups (not regular measuring cups, but the little plastic cups that come with it) should be equal to the # corresponding to the Water Line for your type of rice in the bowl (NOT cups of water).-If you bought no-wash rice use the green cup, otherwise the clear cup.That's it! It's so delicious and so easy to use. I love it! :D"
1,Excellent Rice Cooker Great product. Perfect rice every time. Excellent for brown rice. Keeps rice warm. Also does excellent job of cooking grits. Easy to clean. Takes a little longer to cook rice but the flavor is worth the wait. Pricey but great quality. Would highly recommend this product.
1,"keeps on ticking I bought one of these many years ago - at least eight. It still works and does a great job. The battery the keeps the clock going on it has given out, and I haven't figured out how to replace it, so I can't program it for future times, but other than that, no problems."
1,"Superb Rice!! The best rice cooker I've ever owned. I prefer haiga rice,and this does an excellent job. Of course you rarely go wrongwith Zojirushi products."
1,"Best Rice Cooker Ive owned this rice cooker for around 7 years now and it has worked flawlessly. I have absolutely no complaints and would purchase it again. Ive used this unit in two different states without issue. Ive heard the reviews about the battery but I seem to be lucky as it has never gone out. I just purchased the one pound bread maker and really love it so far, waiting awhile to write the review. I would highly recommend this unit above others."
1,"Zojirushi Rice Cooker - Made In Japan After I read all the comments about this rice cooker, I purchased it. After I purchased it, I saw a 1 or 2 stars comment that we must take this rice cooker to an authorized dealer to replace the battery. That made me worry a while. My worry is gone now as it cooks perfect rice with this Japan made Zojirushi rice cooker. Also, the menu suggested to leave the electric plug on so no need to replace the battery so soon. But, you must unplug it when cleaning. Anyway, this is a good rice cooker but I puchased it more expensive than Ranch 99 Market. I got it at $175 for 5 1/2 cups on line but Ranch 99 is selling it at $145 for 10 cups. Suggest to look around for a good deal."
1,"Daily Use Very easy to clean, expect to use many years to come We had been using Zojirushi since day one, because it is the most famous brand among rice eating countries. Our first one is a neuro-Fuzzy, meaning it is very forgiving of the amount of water you measure, or the time you soak the rice, it intelligently figure out and give you the best cooked rice. Our 2nd one was a Inverter Heating(IH) which just like it said, invert DC to AC with frequency control, but it needs a thicker special type of inner. Now it goit some scratches on the inner, after many years of using. This is our 3rd one, and I uses kitchen paper towel to clean the inner (never use anything else like sponge to clean, unless you guarantee your sponge is as soft and dirtless as a new paper towel, so there will be no damage to the inner coating), and it performs perfect, as far as display-wise, my kids loves it, because now the menu selection is in ENGLISH."
1,excellant I use this every day for many years. Recently order inside pot.I also keep 10 cup version at my vacation home.
1,"In almost daily use since Oct 2003 and working perfectly. I was poking around looking for a rice cooker for my daughters birthday, and lo and behold, I looked up at the top of the page and it said I bought this in October of 2003.This is the same one I've used almost daily for the last 8+ years and I can tell you it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.I've been through 2 inner pans (the nonstick coating wears off, but those and all other parts are still available) and progressed from simple white rice cooking to now making most of my main meals in it with many ingredients.I've got hundreds of recipes to make rice, pasta, polenta, oatmeal, quinoa, barley, beans, bulgur, or anything that cooks with water and heat, and most all are place ingredients inside, and press cook.A wonderfully reliable little machine that may cost a little more initially, but more than pays for itself in versatility, reliability, and simple no nonsense ease of use."
1,"Upgrade of Zojirushi NS-MYC10 I wanted to submit my review here based on the older model that I had purchased.The perfect rice cooker: Zojirushi NS-MYC10I've had this rice cooker for more than 6yrs and use it to cook rice every single day. It makes 11 cups of cooked rice.The 5.5 cup volume is a little misleading for us Indians. We normally cook rice, rice:water = 1:2 ratio. So basically this rice cooker cooks a max of 3 3/4 cups of rice (using the cup provided).You will be astonished at the difference in taste between the rice cooked here versus some other cooker. I'm not exaggerating as I've two different rice cookers, the other one being Sanyo.I love the fuzzy logic feature where you can cook different rices & porridge's. The delayed time setting is a blessing... when I bought it at the end of 2005, nobody else had the delayed time setting. Obviously there are newer models now.For a family of 4 (2 kids below ages of 8yrs), this is just the perfect size!"
1,"Cheaper at local Ranch 99 supermarket Great Rice cooker. but cheaper selling at the local Ranch 99 Supermarket Store $ 149.Amazon, please consider dropping the price for anyone else looking to buy this"
1,"Induction Heating Model (NH-VBC18) I have reviewed the latest Zojirushi induction rice cooker (NH-VBC18) under that item. Previously, this new model was not available from Amazon.com but now is.If you are in the market for a superb rice cooker, please read my review. The new model is more expensive (approximately $225) but uses magnetic induction technology to produce even heating throughout the cook cycle. I have gotten excellent brown rice with this new machine."
1,"Great cooker If you're a brown rice cooker in particular, please buy this product, satisfaction guaranteed. If you want fast rice, stick with Rice-a-roni. But if you want rice to die for buy this product."
1,"Well designed product This is a super camera, and its compatability with Hi8 means all of my old tapes can be viewed. The video resolution is great, and it is loaded with special effects. The viewfinder and 4 inch screen are crisp, variable speed zoom is smooth and the battery life excellent. You should be aware that the video is not true digital. The digital refers to still pictures. Nevertheless, this is a well designed and well thought out product."
1,Great Exercise Ball I bought this to sit on at work. Works awesome. Very durable and the pump it came with works great. Great buy!!
1,"Perfect for my needs Ordered this for doing core training, situps, back hypers, etc. Was fairly easy to inflate with the provided pump. The DVD is okay as it provides a basic blast routine for beginners. Very happy with this purchase and have since purchased the 55 cm as well."
1,"Having fun with the ball My husband got this ball as an accessory to a workout program he is using. It has served that purpose very well, and also our kids love it. It's pretty big, so to them it's the ultimate toy. I'm happy its anti-burst, and I can see us using it for many years, it is very quality."
1,"Stability ball Great price, and very fast shipping. The ball was exactly what i was looking for. Unfortunately, the pump broke the first time I used it."
1,"very durable, and I like the exercise diagrams on the sid This is much thicker material than my other stability ball - it feels more stable, if you will. It was worth the extra money. I also like the diagrams of exercises around the side. I mostly use it as an office chair at work, but it gives me ideas for the gym."
1,"Meets all expectations The Beta Band first came to my notice when I saw ""High Fidelity"". Being intrigued I first picked up the soundtrack, and then this disc. This is a masterful disc. For those listeners who are not adventurous, The Beta Band may not be for you. The band can not be shoehorned into any neat category and the music is 180 degrees from today's incarnation of pop music.Given the previous high marks granted to this disc, ""The Three E.P.'s"" could have been set up for a big fall in my opinion. Happily this proved not to be the case. This disc has become one of my most heavily played discs and will remain so for a long time. Personal favorites are ""Dry The Rain"", ""She's The One"", and ""Needles In My Eyes"".I must have for the musically adventurous!"
1,The Beta Band: I can't wait to witness them... THE BETA BAND is what was good about the Beach Boys and Love & Rockets.
1,This is your brain talking - 'BUY THIS ALBUM' Beck meets the Stones . . . the party starts there . . . by the time the everyone's feeling comfortable with their cocktails . . . Primal Scream drops in for a righteous time. Beg Borrow or steal - Beta Band rocks with some originality of their own and some originality of their early brethen. Probally sound as good in your garage as they do on this album.
1,"Balm for wounded ears If you think that today's young musicians only make hardcore, ska, punk and other kind of noises, you must change your mind right now. Listen to this record, made by four art students. It's delicate, involving, vibrant, at the same time. The first E.P., ""Champion Versions"", is sublime and the best of them; the third one, ""Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos"", is excellent; the second one, ""The Patty Pattty Sound"", is less inspirated than the other two, but pretty good too. In my opinion, the highlights are ""Dry the Rain"", ""B+A"" and ""It's Over""."
1,"High Fidelity did the band a disservice? How can one say that a small, underappreciated, terrific band was done a disservice by having their music disseminated by a fairly good movie soundtrack? Dry the rain happens to be a great song that isn't necessarily in the same vein as monolith, but a good representation of the band nonetheless. After all, the band wrote it, recorded it, and made it the A side to their first EP. So who cares if their latest albums are more spacey, less poppy. The fact of the matter is, all of their output, including Dry the Rain, is amazing and interesting and innovative. To whoever is reading this 'review' - buy everything you can find by The Beta Band - it's worth it. And don't listen to those who seem to think this music is esoteric and above those who were initiated through Dry the Rain. I bet a good deal of those fans wound up loving the crazy and out stuff the band has to offer as much as the popcraft."
1,"The ""Prince of Preachers"" tells it like it is! ""My college lectures are colloquial, familiar, full of anecdote, and often humorous; they are purposely made so, to suit the occasion. At the end of the week I meet the students, and find them weary . . . and only in a condition to receive something which will attract and secure their attention, and fire their hearts.""So starts this timeless collection of lectures that the ""Prince of Preachers"" presented with insight, humor and passion to aspiring ministers.Fascinating titles include ""The Minister's Fainting Fits""; ""Posture, Action, Gesture, etc.""; and ""On the Choice of a Text,"" there are 28 of Spurgeon's classroom discourses on homiletics. Topics include the call, open-air preaching, ordinary conversations, using illustrations, and conduct outside the church, Amazingly powerful and practical over 100 years after the last lecture was delivered."
1,"Must read for all pastors, especially for aspiring pastors Absolutely every subject that a pastor needs to cover in regards to his salvation, personal life, and pulpit ministry is covered extensively in this compilation of Spurgeon's various lectures at the Pastor's College. If you feel the call to the ministry, this will strengthen you if you are truly called. If gives a real glimpse into the life of a devoted preacher and contains exceptional examples from Spurgeon's life. Awesome read."
1,"Inspiration for enriching ministry. I am using the book ""Lectures to my Students"" by C. H. Spurgeon in my Homelitics class. Spurgeon's insights have enlarged my horizions as to how I read and analyse The Holy Scriptures. The book has enhanced my teaching greatly."
1,"Fascinating History Of A Unique Time And Place If this was a fictional account about the section of New Orleans called ""Storyville,"" no one would ever believe it. That it is true is wonderful, monstrous, fascinating, horrible, and damn good reading. The birthplace of blues, jazz, Dixieland and the beginning of the ""Black take"" on music that has swept the world and reinvented itself many times...right up to the present. The sex in this book and the way it was practiced and viewed at the time is unbelievable; it boggles the mind. This book cries out to be the basis for a movie, a musical, and/or a TV series. The cast of characters defies explanation. If this book doesn't blow your mind, you don't have one. Great!"
1,Reebok Women's DMX These are absolutely the best walking shoes. My husband and I walk 4 miles every morning and I have tried all different kinds of shoes. The Reebok DMX is the most comfortable and I would recommend it to any serious walker.
1,To a very special comedian who is missed. I enjoyed reading this book written by his mom. It gave me insight into the way Freddie was raised and how he was when he was younger. One thing Freddie had... he was a gifted comedian. I read this book probably 8 years ago and I still cherish my copy. I thank his Mom for writing it and for giving his loyal fans a bit of comfort by hearing her side of the story. God bless her.
1,The Best I love this CD. Out of all his music that I own this is my favorite. Great diversity of songs. Really shows what he can do. I don't know how you couldn't like it if you like Nelly.
1,"Nelly, Nelly Nelly What can I say? I love this cd because it has all my favorite songs from sweat & suit on one cd. I don't have to take one cd out to hear songs from the other cd. Plus i love the fact it has my favorite song on there with Murphy Lee (he needs to drop a new cd) River Don't Runnn. I love the new single Grillz. Way to go Nelly."
1,Nelly's the man again Nelly's cd's are always hot. I really like Suit. Sweat is cool. Nelly keep doing what you do.

1,"Outstanding bike rack I've tried all kinds of bike racks over the years - including a very expensive Thule roof rack (don't even get me started) - and this one is hands down the best of them all. It is easy to set up, easy to adjust, and easy to put it on or take it off your car. It stays in place, holds the bike securely, and best of all, it holds the bike away from the car so it won't smash against your trunk or bumper and damage your car. I use mine all the time on my sedan and on my minivan and I've never had any trouble with it at all. All it takes is a simple adjustment to make it fit either vehicle perfectly."
1,"Great Bike Rack I did a lot of shopping around before making this purchase and I was not disappointed. On a recent 700-mile road trip, our two bikes were safe and secure; they never shifted nor slid despite rain, high winds, and lots of passing trucks. Bravo Bones!!"
1,Does not fit Honda Odyssey 2011 Looks like a nice rack; too bad they didn't make it clear that it DOES NOT FIT THE 2011 Honda Odyssey before I ordered the rack and had to send it back. The plastic faring on the top of the rear hatch is the problem.
1,"Sarius Bones and Prius2006 I purchased this rack to use on a new PRIUS. Works as it should. Lightweight, well padded and strong. Carried two bikes without a hitch (pun). No problems with the padded feet on the rear glass."
1,"Perfect for my 08 PRIUS This was the third rack I tried on my Prius. Although, it doesn't specifically say it will work, online reviews on the prius boards made me believe this was the best choice and it was. Simple to use, great website with video so its impossible to make a mistake. A part was broken when I recieved my rack , called Saris and they immeadiately put a replacement as well as 2 spares in the mail. Have only used with 2 bikes but it works great & looks awesome on my red car."
1,Excellent Opera for the Holidays Giancarlo Menotti does a superb job with making this opera understandable for all ages. It is a wonderful intro of opera for children. I first watched this as a child and now many years later am able to enjoy it again.
1,"Reviving wonderful memories I remember seeing Amahl on TV in my teenage years, and it is very hard to find it being produced. So I was delighted to find this original, and at a reasonable price. I got one for myself and one for my granddaughters. Shortly after I ordered it, there was a production on TV (in color, which was nice), but it wasn't as good quality as this original. Thanks for making it available."
1,"Remember the Wayback Machine? Well! I thought this was a lot of fun. It took me back to the time I saw this very performance - the same grainy black and white. My grandkids thought it was extremely primitive. Grainy black and white did nothing for them, they declared the set to be dorky and they were glad there were subtitles because they couldn't understand a word. We all appreciated the slice of history and those young whippersnappers got a greater appreciation for all us oldtimers went through to bring them the slick presentations of today.Delivery was quick, the DVD in 'mint' condition."
1,Childhood memory This was a Christmas memory that I had as a child. We always used to watch it. Still lovely today.
1,Marvelous I had not seen this since I was a child. How wonderful to see it again. I was just as moved as I was when I was a childPray it Forward: Spiritual Growth Meditations
1,"An old classic This film was asked for by our residents (Assisted Living and Nursing Home). It was a favorite past classic, that was shown on TV, but no longer seems to make the Christmas Movies. The discussion group that followed, was wonderful. It really triggered many memories for our viewers."
1,"Enchanting A spell binding book. One can not stop reading. Sometimes you start believing, that magic could be real. I felt with Jessex and Kirith Kirin throughout the hole book. One hopes for them to win the great war and above all to be together one day happy and untroubeld. I wish Arthen would be real and I could go there one day to become young again. I'm waiting for a sequel."
1,"Review on ""Secret Agent"" For those late Saturday nights, when all you want to do is watch a good classic thriller with the family, there is really nothing to compare with a good Alfred Hitchcock movie. In secret agent, a young soldier is summoned by his superiors, and finds out that he has been listed in the newspapers as having been killed in action. John Gielgud is excellent in this role, and is complimented by the lovely Madeleine Carroll, a thrill seeking agent who stars as his ""wife"". Robert Young, more known for his roles in musicals and a few crime dramas, plays the part of an American, and the ""third man"" in this movie, invoking more than a passing interest in Carroll. The plot twists and turns are well worked out, and the whole movie is worth watching. Peter Lorre is especially at his best, as a bloodthirsty Spanish agent working with Gielgud and Carroll. If you are a fan of Hitchcock films, then I would recommend that you add this movie to your collection."
1,"Top value stereolab Three of the best stereolab albums, on the cheap - can't go wrong. Buy it now, and then listen to the first track on 'Mars Audiac Quintet' - 'Three-Dee Melodie'. This is pop at its very finest."
1,"outstanding way to learn about he USGA I highly recommend this book. It is a great, behind-the-scenes look at how much work and planning goes into each Open Championship. It's exceptionally well-written, and easy to understand and follow. And reading it on my Kindle made the experience that much more enjoyable."
1,"Truly Inside the Ropes In his book ""Open...Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black"" John Feinstein truly takes you inside the ropes at one of the most talked about golf championships in history. Beyond Golf, the 2002 US Open at Bethpage Black was unusual for so many reasons. From the inner workings at the USGA, The New York State Parks Department, NBC Sports, to the Long Island Railroad, you get a real sense this was more than a typical 72 holes of Golf. Be prepared to miss a few rounds as this is a difficult book to put down."
1,"OTHER USES This product is coconut waste, and is excellent for potting orchids. Mix with charcoal and your orchids thrive. Coconut is notoriously slow to decompose, and has anti-fungal properties. Easy to work with and the orchids require a lot less water. Drains well."
1,Fabulous/Fantastic We had the opportunity to listen to ulu's new CD. It is fantastic! We want to own one to keep in the car and one for the house. And we'll be buying this CD to give to friends. Please let us know as soon it is available to order.
1,"THE DEADLIEST PLANE CRASH VERY GOOD DVD,NOVA DID AN EXLANT JOB RECREATING THE TWO 747'S CRASHING INTO EACH OTHER."
1,"Perfect Condition! Book was exactly as I wanted and significantly cheaper then at my school book store (65% cheaper). It looks BRAND NEW, the user said it was ""like new"", and it came very very fast. I took AP Calculus my Jr. year of high school, and I will be repeating the course as a freshman at my university. I qualified to take the 300 level math which is Calc II, but decided on Math 226, which is Calculus I at my university. The material looks challenging, and for me since I only took AP Stats my senior year, I've forgotten a bit of Calculus. I had a very very good Calculus teacher and feel very confident that I will do very well in this class since I earned a very hard A as the youngest student (16 yrs old) taking the course at my high school."
1,"Love it My seven year old loves this movie. Now he can watch it whenever he likes, so we are all happy."
1,"The others don't know what they're saying First of all, to you all who said this movie stunk, YOU'RE ALL IDIOTS! This movie is great. People said this is a horrible family movie, wrong! To the person who said if you think the movie is just as good as the tv show, then you haven't seen the show, I know every episode by heart! The movie is a perfect comedy for all ages. Featuring two of the most funny characters in Nickelodeon, this movie is full of humour and surprises. It's definately worth buying. P.S. (SpongeBob isn't gay, he acts like a little kid because that is what the target audience is. Duh.)"
1,"Such a Funny Movie! The Spongebob Movie is such a hilarious movie! Loads of laughs will leave you wondering why there wasn't such a funny movie released before! This is a story about Spongebob and Patrick's quest to find King Neptune's crown, who is left bald if in lack of this crown. THis is all part of Plankton's Plan Z, which was started to actually work. Even though it is very slap-stik, this movie will not leave you disappointed!"
1,"Funniest Movie Of 2004! I absolutly LOVED this movie! The jokes were hilarious! The quotes were SO funny! I especaly LOVED it when Patrick said, ""Did you see my underwear?"" Mindy said, ""No, Patrick."" ""Did you want to?"" I HIGHLY reccomend seeing this movie! Defedently see it if you are a HUGE SpongeBob fan, like me!"
1,"WOW! What a great jolt for Spongebob fans! I wasn't sure what to think, sitting there in the theater with my 2 boys & my husband. I knew there were alot of children in the theater, I never imagined I would hear so much adult laughter outside my own. I have been a Spongebob fan since he came on and knew I would like at least a couple things...I laughed so hard....What a great movie. I think this is a movie for people of all ages. When you are a little older you seem to really appreciate the hilarity put into Spongebob & Patrick's characters. How can you not just bust up every time you hear Spongebob tell Plankton, ""...Well, good luck with that!"" It is so in his absolutely wonderful character. My husband (50) and myself (31) are the two biggest fans in the house! What a hoot! This movie, well, it ROCKS!"
1,My Son Loves SpongeBob I bought this for my 7 year old son who loves SpongeBob. He watched it every day during the summer. I would highly recommend this DVD for kids and adults who enjoy watching SpongeBob. It was a delightful movie.
1,"children's movie review I just had to get this for my son.He is a huge Spongebob fan,and I have to admit,so am I! After seeing it just once on Nickelodeon,he wanted to watch it over and over again,and now he can!"
1,"Surprisingly Hysterical I'm a huge fan of the show so I had to see the movie. This movie is unbelievably hilarious. If you're an adult who wants to go see a funny movie but they're all rated R and the kids are home so you can't go then go with them to this. I know some people who haven't seen it will be like, ""Right. This movie looks like it's for kids."" Well think again. Most of the jokes in this movie are VERY hidden and only teens and adults will catch on (the Goofy Goober Nut Bar scene is one of them). And the kids will laugh at the occasional fart jokes too. And to give you a heads-up about a funny part then read this and if you don't want to read it then stop reading here.When Spongebob sings the ""Goofy Goober Rock"" song watch when he's screaming into the microphone on the Krusty Krab floor when the mind-slaves are walking toward him and look at what he's doing. SO FUNNY"
1,"I can't believe this! Everyone's concerned about it's ""crude humor"". You don't think your kids ever hear that stuff. Turn on the TV right now. Flick through a few channels like Fox, MTV, VH1. You don't think your kids ever stop and watch it. If you don't like this Movie.You could make your kids bored by making him or her watch Beauty and the Beast. Or Barbie's adventure to Happy Land. I could notice tons of sexual references. Just so you know this is one of the best family oriented movie ever. And they come rare now a days. There is no totally clean 1933 Mickey Mouse short anymore.I think instead of their Kids growing up too quick. I think the parents are adapting to changes in the world slower!"
1,"Squarepants CANNOT get any better than this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought this movie at best buy,and it is AWESOME!!!!!! There was this really funny part, but I'm not going to spoil the movie. Patrick is so funny! You should really see this movie. You won't be sorry!P.S. I'm a goofy goober! :)"
1,"Bad This cartoon is the worse tv show for kids nickelodeon tv shows nowadays is very lacking same with Disney channel they always Have new episode every day Back in those days that way kids don't lose interest , nowadays they always show the same episode and have one new episode once a week"
1,Full length movie for SpongeBob My son and I thoroughly enjoyed this feature-length movie. Lots and lots of laughs!
1,"Got the last one at $149 I've been searching for weeks for a compact amplified speaker system that delivered full audio response at low volume. Then I stumbled across this rebuilt Bose clock radio made in an American factory in Framingham, Mass and I realized this could be it.Apparently the capacitors in this unit go bad after years of use and create static. If you replace the capacitors it continues to provide years of service .This rebuilt unit displays the time and offers a wakeup system with AM/FM radio but I only wanted it to plug my mp3 player into the RCA jacks on the back and listen to my favorite music in high fidelity with plenty of bass. The only thing you need to connect an mp3 player,laptop,or tablet to this unit is a cable with a male stereo jack on one end and an RCA male plug on the other. These are available online or at any electronics store."
1,"The Six Sigma Way Book Review The Six Sigma Way is an easy reading book and a must have for anyone contemplating the deployment or currently deploying Six Sigma. The book not only gives an A-Z detail on why,who,what and how to rolling out Six Sigma, it is also an excellent reference tool.The author's bring to life the usefullness of Six Sigma through rela-life examples from various industries.The Six Sigma Way practices what it preaches- it's customer focused and friendly."
1,Senior Leadership Team meeting goer look how great i am.....i am a member of the senior leadership team which means i just go to meetings all day and really dont do any work....i just blowhard at work all day like i am blowing hard reviewing this book
1,Heartwarming This book has many heartwarming stories. It really discribes the way veterinary work was handled years ago. Mr. Herriot is a great story teller.
1,"They're Human Being Stories Too In has been roughly two decades since I read James Herriot's salubrious ""All Creatures..."" series, yet when I picked up this ""best of"" concoction, many of the dulcet vignettes were as fresh in my mind as if I had lived them last week. Although trained as a vet, James Herriot had a true gift with the written word. These tales about pets and their two-legged counterparts shine a light deep into the mechanisms of human nature.While he succeeded admirably as an honorable animal doctor and found worldwide fame as a late-in-life author, perhaps he missed his true calling as a psychologist. The humor, heartbreak, and humanity that he so eloquently captures in these stories shows a sagacious mind. It's no wonder that his time on earth brought many smiles and caused many a tail to wag."
1,"One of the best Easy reading, great subjects . Would recommend it to anyone. Am passing it around in the family. Great bit of humor."
1,"Great product, price & delivery Really like using landscape plastic versus the landscape fabric sold in home improvement stores. The plastic does a much better job of killing the weeds below while preventing new weeds- the fabric sold in stores is more expensive and the root system of weeds actually thrive along the material. 4MIL black plastic is my favorite to use with stones especially. Product well priced, good quality, great shipping and made in the USA."
1,Ocean's 11 Poster was in perfect condition and it was sent to me in just a few days! Great Seller! A+
1,Doctors can they be trusted This is a great true life story of doctor being deceptive with his patients. Melissa Gilbert does a great job in this movie as the victim of this arrogant doctor.
1,"Trust the teller along with the tale This is a small book yet Lawrence's genius enables him to see big things in it, especially about those large writers like Melville he felt an affinity to. ""Trust the tale and not the teller"" is one of his motto's here and he tries to show how the great works go beyond the intentions of their creators.One objection. He is especially hard on Franklin who he makes into a priggish, petty prune of a minor moralist. Franklin was a many - sided genius who was open to kind of creation Lawrence had no sense of."
1,My son loves this shirt and wears it weekly! It was a perfect form fit for my 11 year old. We bought the small and it fits exactly how he likes it.
1,Great Great shirts. I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
1,"A good product I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be. I would get an XXL next time around, but otherwise it's a great product."
1,"Shades of Gray Great awareness raised on the real person, Gray Barker, who is responsible for the making of hollowood movies that we have enjoyed. I did not want to miss a second of this documentary. Applause for a well thought out and put together documentary. Great Job!!!!"
1,Fast Really works and is convenient. I don't have to go to the salon anymore. The cold wax is more effective than hot wax.
1,great product product disappeared from store shelves here. Glad to find them online. Very quick and easy to use.
1,"Great watch Its a great watch for one with a smaller wrist. I have the Storm which has served me well since 1996 (which i hope they can repair, with a new batterry). I wear it every day doing heavy duty Construction Reno's after my years of Diving. These are serious watches (whether diving/swimming or doing serious outdoor activities). An active outdoor guy watch"
1,"You Nasty If you are an old Too Short fan, this album is just what you're looking for. But this cd is tighter than most of his albums. Just check it out and you'll know what I'm talking about."
1,"John & Paul WHO ? Definitely Maybe shows The Beatles what they were missing, that gutsiness to give the whole world the Vs. Kicking off with the rip roaring Rock 'n' Roll Star and ending with the lullaby that is Married With Children, this album is certainly the best thing Oasis have ever produced. Never mind all the hype and acclaim that came with Morning Glory, it could never match the extra punch that Definitely Maybe packs. Live Forever and Slide Away are the album's highlights and isn't it curious that from the bad's first three albums, the best song from each wasn't released as a single; Slide Away, Champagne Supernova and Fade In-Out. I'll bet Gas Panic! isn't a single!"
1,"Live forever I didn't get into Oasis until the latter part of the '90s, but I can readily imagine how revolutionary their debut sounded to British audiences when it first came out. Combining a pummeling guitar surge with the melodicism of the Beatles and the psychedelic sensibilities of the Stone Roses, ""Definitely Maybe"" still sounds like a world-beater. From Britpop touchstone ""Shakermaker"" to riff monster ""Supersonic"" to the melancholy yet anthemic ""Slide Away,"" every track is an era-defining classic. Simply put, this is one of the landmark British debut albums of all time."
1,"Transcendant Definitely Maybe ranks alongside Sgt. Pepper (concept), Murmur (College radio / alternative), Nevermind (grunge), Too Far to Care (alt country) as truly seminal works of rock and roll. This album single handedly resurrected Brit-pop and stimulated interest in a genre that was in dire need of a jolt of energy.In terms of debut, almost nothing compares to the end to end brilliance of Definitely Maybe. Amazing lyrics, otherworldly guitar by Noel, and the best chops in rock by Liam, culimating with the incredible ""Slide Away"".If you only own 10 CD's, this is a must."
1,"if you must buy a CD from Oasis, buy this one the first one sometimes became the best one. If you must choose 5 bands from 90' of Brit-music, Oasis must be in the list, but not as the best band, they can be the second best while THE VERVE stand on the top of all. Columbia is the best song forever Oasis had made, i really believe this song and its guitar chords have the power to bring us to the other side of the time-tunel. If you love this album, why don't you try the best album of 90', A storm in the heaven of The Verve?"
1,"A great combination of '90s in your face and '60s groove Oasis is one of the few bands that captures the essence of the '60s while maintaining their own style. This is what sets them apart from others that don't quite make it. Noel writes some of the greatest lyrics around, and Liam sings them in a fashion that grips the listener and makes 'em want more. The band is that good."
1,"Liam and Noel's greatest hour I cant tell you what it is about this album that makes it so appealing. If anyone can put thier finger on the undefineable attraction of this musical masterpiece they deserve a round down at the dog and duck. Full of exceptional songs, this has to be a front runner for album of the 90's. Rock 'n' roll star is a great opener which is followed by Shakermaker, a real piece of psycadelica. Other tracks that are prominent are Supersonic (Oasis' first single) and Cigarettes and Alcohol. Others such as Up in the sky and Digsy's dinner are of high standard but it is (contrary to popular belief) Slide Away that is the weakest track of the lot. A must for any self respecting music conneseur. Amazing."
1,"maybe your the same as me we'll see things they'll never see There is not a lot to say, my mates.This one of the best debut albums ever.RocknRoll Star is a very good song,but I fooking like Live Forever, in my opinion the demo versionof this song is better.Supersonic, a fooking good one, too.All in all the the lads from manchestermade a fooking good album.Cheers! Stevie"
1,"Great Album, Fastest selling album in music history!!!!!!!!! Wow, when I first heard this album, it changed my outlook on music forever! The rocking melodies and lyrics on this album are what make it good. This album rivals Be Here Now with it's greatness. OASIS ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!"
1,"Oasis is the best band in the world! Slide Away, Supersonic, and Live Forever are some of the best songs ever. but that's not suprising, since Oasis is one of the best bands in the world! I mean, Noel is a genius, Liam's voice is beautiful and Bonehead, Whitey and Guigsy are amazing. If you buy this CD, you're gonna have the best time of your life."
1,"Great for keeping stuff from little kids. I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old. The 1 year old can't open the can, the 3 year old has enough trouble that the adventure isn't worth it. So all the icky goodies stay in the can and not all over the house."
1,A ton of fun So much fun to play! The black key's first album is true blues and full of soul. and it's a limited edition 180 gram vinyl.
1,"Won't leave CD player Ok seriously folks, friends of mine turned me onto this stuff and this CD (The Big Come Up) is the greatest thing I've heard yet! I can't tell you what an unbelievable mix of blues/garage rock it is, even if you're not totally into that genre-I promise you WILL NOT be disappointed. This never leaves my cd player and my friends all play this at their parties (at NYU). The guitar and drumming beats are so raw and rough which is fantastic and is a great and perfect complement to Dan's smooth strong voice. Play this cd from beginning to end and you'll swear by it. The song ""I'll Be Your Man"" has Dan swooning you over making you believe he is singing right to you, but fret not you rockers because ""The Breaks"" will move you and groove you. These two hip guys know how to do things right and I can't wait for them to come to NYC!! Hear they are awesome live and I'm sure it helps that they are as attractive as they are talented! I say goodbye to MTV ... and hello to The Black Keys!"
1,the black keys are a very good band hi all i want to say i like the black keys the 1st time i heard them was on punk-0-rama 8 which is a good cd also so anyways the black keys were on that cd and ever since then ive been wanting to hear more and more of there music its a mix of classical rock thing and blues and kinda the whole hendix thing the black keys were inspierd by led zephlin sooo thats all i have to say oh yeah i like white stripes there a good band too
1,"Track list Once again, Amazon has failed to provide the track list for a CD in their inventory, so here it is....The Black Keys ~ ""The Big Come Up""1. Busted (2:34)2. Do The Rump (2:38)3. I'll Be Your Man (2:21)4. Countdown (2:39)5. The Breaks (3:01)6. Run Me Down (2:27)7. Leavin' Trunk (3:00)8. Heavy Soul (2:09)9. She Said, She Said (2:32)10. Them Eyes (2:23)11. Yearnin' (1:59)12. Brooklyn Bound (3:11)13. 240 Years Your Time (23:21)"
1,"Raw. I was introduced to the Black Key's through they're most recent album, Brothers. Loving what I heard, I snapped up Rubber Factory and The Big Come Up. I have to say, this might be my favorite of the three. Each album has it's fine points, but this one in particular has a rough, almost bootlegged quality of sound to it. Each track is filled with an infectious raw energy that's hard to resist. And ""Breaks"" is probably my favorite Key's song to date--a catchy-ass screeching guitar lick loops over an almost hip-hop sounding drum beat. Then Auerbach's voice slides in, smooth as ice, and I can't pull the grin off my face."
1,"A TERRIFIC BOOK! If you have read ""The Four Agreements"", you will not want to miss this excellent and energizing companion book. Like ""The Four Agreements"", much of the content in this book is based on Eastern philosophies and attaining personal freedom and happiness. This book expands upon ""The Four Agreements"" by indicating one's life is a dream, a dream that is often dictated by others. In this light, ""domestication"" is seen as the root of human suffering.There is much to be learned from the Toltec way, and I highly recommend both this book and ""Awakening the Buddha Within"" by Lama Surya Das. There is much truth and food for thought contained in both these excellent, spiritually refreshing books. The wisdom learned gives direction to the reader on a path towards a more peaceful, serene and happy life."
1,Wonderful Book!!! This is a great book about a girl who gets captured by Delaware Indians I loved it sooo much I suggest it to anyone who loves to read about pioneer life!
1,"really are ARMOR CASE I think this product is a must have for those people who need simplicity to carry on your palm TX, and who wants to have a nice looking, excelent finishing and confortable case. I am satisfied about it and I feel more confortable than the existing PALM hard case.hope it would be useful for other customers"
1,"The Mother of All Happy Ends This is a wonderfully romantic, tearful, happy, love and friendship movie with great music and the greatest happy end of all times. Maybe you would like ""Love of Siam"" to be more open gay, but that would destroy its sweet-and-sour quality. If you haven't seen it, order it quickly! If in doubt watch the trailer on youtube first."
1,hope dies last studs terkel once again studs has nailed it inspirational timely and speaks to me today as it did years ago how i miss him but his words are still alive today
1,"Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas.... ....without watching this episode of one of my favorite TV shows of all time, Northern Exposure. Christmas in Cicely, Alaska as experienced by the quirky, lovable characters of the town. This episode is filled to the brim with the spirit of the season, along with the not-so-spirit-filled attitudes that often go along with the season; in short - real-life! I've always been impressed with the way all the loose ends of the various plot lines are all resolved in the end - usually with only a musical score playing as we watch the characters go about the business of life. This episode is no different. I admit to getting choked up over Joel's gift to Maggie and Holland's gift to Shelly. Watch it and you'll see what I mean!"
1,Perfect for Church I am a youth minister and I have used this CD in our youth service for praise and worship. The children love and the music is lively and fun so everyone wants to participate in the worship experience.
1,"It's Gospel! If you don't actually like Gospel music you might not like it. It is not ""Christian Contemporary"", but there are songs that have been revamped to have more of a Gospel feel. My 3 year old loves it, she wasn't used to gospel since she only knows ""kiddie"" and Christian Contemporary. Now I am able to enjoy the Gospel that I love and she enjoys hearing other children singing praises."
1,"Blue Skies...smilin' at me... -and I'm smilin' right back. Three cheers to ""Universal"" for doing this double feature justice. Both films look and sound wonderful, better than ever. Clearly done with care. ""Birth of the Blues"" is great fun, featuring excellent and exciting small group dixieland jazz playing. ""Blue Skies"" is a little hokey-but who cares? Great numbers with Bing and Fred.Not to crazy about leading lady Joan Caulfield though. I just wish they would have cast a girl with more charisma...like Rita Hayworth. Imagine, Fred and Rita dancing in technicolor...don't get me started. Of course, this film contains one of Fred Astaire's best routines-the amazing ""Puttin' On The Ritz"". Is there anyone on this earth who could rival Astaire's class, timing and smoothness factor in this number? No,there isn't!"
1,great movie I loved this movie. It was entertaining and funny. If your a Bing Crosby fan you will want this one for your collection.
1,"It's the most wonderful book I've read. I read ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" when I was fourteen. And now I'm the mother of two kids, I still read it again and again. It's the most wonderful book I've read. Read it, and you will like it."
1,Witch Of Blackbird Pond This book is good. My mom said to give the book about 100 pages before seeing if it's good or not. I did and it turned out to be.. pretty good!
1,I loved this book The Witch of Blackbird Pond was a very good book. I loved how the characters made history come alive. This book seems like a complete fiction book because of the excitment and adventure the author puts in. I enjoyed reading this wonderful adventure story while at the same time I learned about the Salem With Trials and how the people thought back then. This book really is like a key to the minds of the people that lived in those times and why they weren't acceptant to people different than them.
1,"Excellent Read for Both Adults and Children My daughter had to read this book for school and I read it also to help her with her book report. I was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed reading this historical fiction. The main character of the book travels to the United States to live with a maternal aunt and her husband after her grandfather who raised her dies. She is accused of being a witch because she knows how to swim well and because she befriends an elderly woman who lives by Blackbird Pond. It is a story of romance, of forgiveness and of family bonding. I would suggest this book to both young and older readers alike."
1,I loved reading this book! This is a great book for fifth gr This is an exelent book. I loved it! This would be a good book for fifth graders!
1,"Kit is doing slave work but still has time to fall in love. I really loved the book. One day I just grabbed it off my classes book shelf for a book report, thinking oh great another snoozer, but when I started to read I just couldn't put it down. I'm handing the book report in tomorrow and I'm not worried because since I loved it so much I found all the right words to say."
1,"BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE! I love this book so much I read passages from it every day. I thought that the author did a really good job with describing it and everything. I thought that she did such a good job, I felt as if I was in the story and I knew the characters. (Hey, I kinda felt as if I were Kit and I knew exactly how she felt about Nat Eaton.) Any way, This book is lovely and helps you understand the Salem Witch Trials and is just a great book to read if you don't have anything to do. It would be nice to see it made into a movie!"
1,"I reccomend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction This is one of my most favorite books. Kit Tyler is the main character. Her parents died, so she went to America to her aunts house. There, was a bad-tempered uncle, sensitive aunt, and two stuck up, but mostly kind girl cousins. This story takes place in Salem Massachusetts in a time when they prosecuted witches. I thought the book was compelling, realistic, and unpredictable. I reccomend this novel to anyone especially if you enjoy historical-fiction."
1,The Witch of Blackbird Pond (MM) This book was a great book. It tells the tale of a girl who doesn't fit in and therefore is accused of being a witch. This book is a good book for some one who likes to learn about history and adventure. This book is exciting and you won't want to put it down.
1,Awesome Book!!~ This book started off pretty slow but it definately had enough excitement to keep me from putting the book down! I really liked the ending! It was one of those 'Awwwww moments'!!~ I bought this book for my step-daughter (7th grader) and decided to read it first. I finished it in 4 hours. I couldn't put it down and I'm not one who likes to read!~ A great book for a teenage girl (12-15).
1,THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE BOOK EVER!!!!!! This was the greatest book i've ever read and i think everyone in the world should read it and i think everyone should buy lots of copies for all their family and friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Moving and Profound This is a truly incredible book that I discovered in the classroom when I was about 10, maybe younger. The soap-making scene was excerpted in my history book as a lesson about how the Puritans lived in the 1600s.The detail of life during those harsh times is simply fascinating. Everything from household chores to religious beliefs to politics is covered, but the real beauty of this gem of a book lies in the subtle romance between the title character and a sea captain's son, and in the love that she comes to feel for Hannah, a suspected witch, Prudence, a young, neglected child, and her aunt's family who take her in as one of their own.This book is as pleasurable to read today as it was over 10 years ago. A true classic. For lovers of friendship, romance, loyalty and history, I highly recommend it."
1,"A unique and intrigueing thriller! This excellent novel will definitely keep you reading on. There are well thought out cliff hangers at the end of each chapter. A bit of foreshadowing adds to the suspense and mystery. All of the characters that protain to this mystifying classic are well thought out, and well developed. With the help of it's convinvcing atmostphere, this story definately depics the Puritan ways, and gives the reader a unique picture of witch trials. Not only does this novel have a special edge, but it teaches the reader a lesson as well. The lesson that is told in the Witch of Blackbird Pond not only protains to the Colonial times, but could definitely apply to the modern age."
1,"A romantic, historical fiction novel about justice, love, courage, and friendship Kit Tyler has lived her whole life in the beautiful, Caribbean country of Barbados. Her first glimpse at her new home in Connecticut tells her that her life in colonial America will be nothing like the beautiful and elegant world she has always known. She doesn't understand the stern and somber people here--especially not the mischievous sailor, Nat Eaton, who always turns up when she least expects it. In her loneliness, she develops a dangerous friendship with an outcast widow many of the townspeople think might be a witch. But how much will that friendship cost her?The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a wonderful story about coping with change and learning to be true to ourselves. Through the gentle affection of the Widow Tupper, Kit learns to find her vocation in life--and in love."
1,Really Helpful Book The book is short and very well written. It gives you the straight answers to a lot of admissions questions with a large focus on the essay part of the application. I'm convinced that the essay was one of the things that helped me get into Middlebury College. I'd encourage you to buy this book if you are going to be applying to college.
1,"harry bauld, great writer and teacher harry is my english teacher and helped me complete my college essay. We are all given his book and it helped a great deal, along with reading it and his help my essay was fabulous and i was also accepted early decision to oberlin. this is a great book, the one you should buy if you are only buying one, it is written exactly as he teaches and ""sounds"" just like him and i strongly recommend it to all high school students. Its not just dry and boring he makes sure to add humor all through the book"
1,"Happy Customer I am 5'10"" and purchased the long in both white and black. The reviews are accurate in saying that the long is truly a long, but I love this purchase. The material quality is high and the style is very nice. The adjustable straps allowed me to pull it up, and while the straps do slip a bit, I could easily pin them in place and adjust according to the length of whatever I have on. I am very happy with this purchase."
1,"successful book My criticism would be that people with emotional problems with God's grace can still be good spouses. On the other hand, it certainly helps make the marriage easier and with a higher probability of success to marry someone who is emotionally well-adjusted!A great book to help young adults to look at themselves and their relationships so they will have healthy marriages and families."
1,"Merengue Callejero with a lot more to say. This is a great album. Its definitely Merengue Callejero, but with a lot more lyrics and suprises than the usual. There is a lot more thinking and production going on here than in most Merengue. And dont get me wrong I like most Merengue, but Los Potros really have something refreshing going on here. Although Oye Mi Ritmo is the first single and is slamming, the other songs will grow on you tremendously. Vengan Todas Mujeres Latinas is the jam. Rebeca99 and Esa Morena will grow on you if they dont catch you on first listen. I like this album more everytime I listen to it."
1,Great car for the price The kids (and myself) love it. For the price this little car has a lot of features head and tailights and the ability to run another at the same time without interference due to the different frequencies available. These cars have been crashed into walls and each other over and over and seem to be ok. The only one that broke took a flight off of a desk and the steering linkage snapped on one wheel when it impacted the floor. Cant really complain about that. I bought extras for the price. What really matters is that it entertains the young ones and is helping them learn the controls before moving to more expensive models.
1,review acting leaves something to be desired but the directing is magnificient and the plot it amazing. an excellent buy
1,"GOOD MOVIE...! Very good movie. Well done, directed, written, acted. The story is amazing, it really is. And the music and the way that is made...WOW...!"
1,"Bruce Rocks I have not heard the first two albums in years. Early Bruce is so different than his current music. Hearing ""Rosalita"" reminded me of all the concerts I went to. Greetings' ""Hard to be a Saint in the City"" is one my favorite songs ever: urban and edgy. Darkness has always been my favorite Bruce album. It still is."
1,One of the best live albums ever This is quite simply one of the very best live albums ever. Plain and simple!
1,"Surprisingly good I do love that this sells as a 12 pack so I don't have to run out and get more every time I need to change the air filter but what I like even more is that these are excellent, and to my admittedly unprofessional eye, seem to last as long as the special (and expensive) 3M long lasting air filters, even though these are designed to be more frequently changed. From now on, I'll be buying these filters, and hope to continue to buy a 12 pack every 18-24 months, since these don't seem to need to be changed monthly."
1,"By the Way... My review referred to the vinyl version of Be Here Now... -with the perfect large cover-art... -yes, it all makes sense now/then... -listen on headphones... Tape it!..."
1,"""the BEST OASIS album of all times"" I don't konw why everybody critic this GREAT album, I think it's Oasis best, we got excellent guitars, a very inspired Liam that can touch the roof with his voice and the other 3. There are also a lot of classics like ""d'you know what I mean?"" personally the best Oasis Chorus ever, we got ""stand by me "", ""the girl in the dirty shirt"" wich is the best song of the entire album, ""don't go away"" and a great song that define the hole spirit of the album: All around the world. A piece of advise: don't listen to the critics, first listen to it and you'll see."
1,"Excellent. This is a fantastic album. I bought it after Definately Maybe and What's the Story (Morning Glory). It's longer, rougher, and heavier. It's just filled with great songs. The album as a whole may have some weak points, but songs like D'You Know What I Mean?, Magic Pie, Stand By Me, Fade In-Out, and of course, Don't Go Away, really make this a must-own. The album is a lot of a certain Oasis style that is unlike What's the Story, so I can see how this might be hit or miss for some people (especially if you want short songs, because the avgerage length here is 6 minutes), but I love it. Great stuff, highly recomended."
1,"4.85 STARS: A Classic Hard Rocking Album --Very Underrated I don't understand Noel's disdain for this record. Hell, it might be my FAVOURITE Oasis album of all (7) !! I bought the album on August 26, 1997 and it has been close at hand ever since. This is a pure, powerfully agressive masterpiece that I bet will get recieved better as the yrs go by. This record is about as subtle as a nuclear bomb. Raw aggression, yet still very listenable. Unlike the ""hard rock"" that is played on the radio these days, there is some quality to it. Sure, it's a bit overdone, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. To me, music serves as escapism, a mood changer of sorts and BHN completes that mission with flying colors. If you haven't listened to BHN in some time, try it again. If you have never heard BHN give it a try. THIS IS OASIS in it's purist, rawest form !!! BTW, I got to see them live on the BHN tour !!!!"
1,"Oasis Rules, Dont Go Away every song on it kicks but the song Magic Pie was not all that good. I still like the song. Oasis rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"It doesn't matter if your hopes and dreams are shattered! To the tipical Oasis fan, and hell, Oasis themselves, this album was a mess. I think that Oasis did reach a breaking point when they created this album, admitting they were plastered, and strung out on drugs. But this is Oasis at their peak: the vocals and guitar are as huge sounding as ever, the songwriting is as good, if not more endearing, than their first two records. Most people think that Oasis lost their touch after (What's the Story) Morning Glory, but if you really ignore the hype surrounding the band and focus on the music, Oasis have created a magnanimous, influential, and all around ballsy rock and roll album. D'you know what I mean?"
1,"Definitley ""not maybe"" the best Oasis album. ""...But I just think theres some good sounds on it and it was just a bit scatty and a bit mentally produced but thats who we are man, but I'd say that one (favourite album), so go f#%ken buy cause theres loads left"" Liam Gallaghar July 2000.And it is a great album, Definitley Maybe and Whats the story had the ""wonderwalls"" and ""Supersonics"" but nothing like this swirl and giant noise of guitar rock.Its a mega mega album and a triumphant album, and definitley not a dissapointment."
1,"Mediocre? I don't think so. This, to put it bluntly, is an amazing album. Sure, it's not their best, but hey, who cares? To me, Definately Maybe deserved 5.5 stars out of 5. Morning glory deserved 6 stars out of 5, and if I could give a greater rating than 5 on this album, I would. I know it is a bit repititous by the time you get to the last couple of songs, but when the first few songs are as good as this, who cares if they go back on themselves? As long as Oasis are recording quality albums like this one, I'll always be a fan."
1,Massive record! This album is great from Oasis but maybe not that great than the other albums. This album has a massive sound of rock n roll with all the guitars and electric sounds. And the songs are quite long. I would say that this album is a sort of rock n roll clishe album. Propably my favorite song from this album is It's Gettin' Better (Man! ) because it has got a massive sound and a good old-fashion rock n roll feeling. It sounds good. There are also good songs like D' You Know What I Mean? Be Here Now and The Girl In The dirty Shirt. Mad fer it!
1,"Underrated I don't understand why critics, fans, and even Oasis think this was a failure. It's easily their heaviest album through SOTSOG, and it has lyrics that are maybe the band's best. Sure, some of the songs sound distorted amidst the heavy guitar feedback, but the chourses in ""Stand By Me,"" ""D'You Know What I Mean?,"" and ""I Think, I Hope, I Know"" still shine through. BE HERE NOW even has some experimentation in songs like the countryish ""Fade In-Out"" that most of their other releases don't have. The Noel sung ""Magic Pie"" and the self-absorbed ""All Around The World"" are the only two songs that I skip over. The rest are simply Oasis playing good rock and roll with guitars roaring right behind them. Similar to the Smashing Pumpkins' ADORE, BE HERE NOW is one of this band's greatest accomplishments that basically was overlooked by fairweather ""Wonderwall"" fans and critics."
1,"Go Away, Dog I bought this book for my grandson. We have a dog, who he just loves her. He is beginning to read & loves books. He also loves any animal stories as well, especially dog & horse stories."
1,"intriging on an out of this world experiance.. The concept of being transported to Mars by an out of the body experiance or being lifted to another place is a masterpiece of wisdom by Burroughs considering his time period of life.. I read this book as a nine year old, and have started my son on the entire series last year.. he says ""WOW"" this is deep.."
1,Edgar Rice Burroughs first in the John Carter series. Burroughs is probably better known for TARZAN but I enjoyed the John Carter series much more. This is Adventure in a fantastic setting. READ IT forget about the movie.
1,"Classic Picked this up during the hype of the John Carter movie release. The book is a wonderful classic science fiction story, but one should be aware of the time and society during which it was written. The characters do not have modern sensibilities regarding racism and sexism. Still the work is an enjoyable adventure through a rich world."
1,Princess of Mars book Great story. I recommend it to anybody. I wish I would've read it a long time ago; I feel like I was cheated by not being told about this book series when I was younger.
1,"Excellent Read I loved this book! It is no wonder why disney adapted it to the big screen.As with all books turned into movies, the book is different but better. So if you are looking to follow the story of the film... just rewatch the movie lolthe moment I finished this book I went and purchased the other 6 books in the series... :-)"
1,"Fantastic! This book is exactly what all sci fi and fantasy books should be: imaginative, full of adventure, plenty of action, and so much more. It is by far the most accessible book written more than 50 years ago that I've ever read, making it suitable for all ages. And, as other reviewers have stated, it is not just for boys. It contains strong female characters,considering the time that it was written. If you like adventure novels, you will love this book. I didn't have a problem with the formatting."
1,"My favorite book ever! I read this book when I was in 5th grade. I read it over and over and it ends with a cliff-hanger that tore at my pre-teen heartstrings for several years until a teacher said to me, ""did you read the rest of the series?"" WHAT??? Paradise!I was lucky enough to have the hardbound edition illustrated by Frank Frazetta. The reviewer who said that the modern cover illustrations are too risque compared to the earlier covers obviously never SAW the earlier covers. This book is an early classic of pulp fiction and cheesecake/beefcake covers have always been a part of the deal.Burroughs was part of a generation of creative brains who would have thrived in the computer era. Thank god they had the chance to make their mark in literature."
1,Great book Like Eragon...I first watched the movie and really enjoyed it. Afterwards I read the book and realized that the movie was horribly done when compared to the book.I liked all of the character building in the book and thought it had plenty of humor and action. There was no sex and cussing (that I remember) in the book for those that don't like to read that sort of stuff.On a side note...my inner immaturity laughed when the words 'fagged' and 'ejaculated' were used to describe feelings and expressions.Five stars!
1,"Sets Fire to Imaginations Almost 30 years ago, my Dad bought me the entire series. I read through ""A Princess of Mars"" (my first novel) in three days at the age of 10. I read of the wonderful, fantastic adventures of John Carter, and was hooked--not just on Edgar Rice Burroughs, but also on science fiction, science, and, most importantly, reading.These books are not grandiose intellectual tomes. They are just pure fun! And that pure fun will inspire kids brought up with video games and Pokemon to go back to the basics and learn the joys of reading.Other reviews mention the need to get the second and third books in the series. I recommend you get them all. You'll never be satisfied until you're through them all, and then you'll be disappointed there are no more."
1,"Welcome to Barsoom Retired confederate soldier and southern gentleman John Carter is pursued by Indians, and through unexplainable circumstances finds himself transported to Barsoom, also known as the planet Mars. There he finds a dying planet of brutal and untamed savagery, contrasted sharply with the rich cultures of ancient races. Arriving alone, naked and friendless, ""A Princess of Mars"" tells the tale of how John Carter, with the aid of his earthly strength and agility, sets forth on an incredible adventure against enormous odds to rescue the beautiful Dejah Thoris, the incomparable Princess of Helium.One of Edgar Rice Burrough's earliest works, the first chapter in the Martian series is also one of his finest. A page turning adventure with lots of action make John Carter one of Burrough's most beloved heroes. His imagination ran wild in creating the martian landscape, and this is a delight to read for all ages."
1,Awesome Book but sad This was an awesome book but the part where Jackson dies I think is the saddest part of the book because it hurts bad when you lose a best friend
1,"The Jam Band Jams You only have to see the Jigglers at the live shows to understand what appeal this band has not only in Boston, but all over the country. Jiggle The Handle"" is respected by musicians and fans alike, and their jamming is legendary. This album recorded live at The Stone Coast Brewery is a great follow up to ""Mrs. White's Party"", ""Three Sets"" and ""In It Again""."
1,nice Pitcher Received the item and it is just like advertised. Purchased it to replace a small frothing pitcher so I can foam milk for more than one cup of coffee.Nice quality pitcher.
1,"Provides great frothed milk When I am making my daily latte, I always start by filling this halfway up with milk and putting it in my refrigerator while I get my machine set up. When my espresso machine is ready, I pull it out of the refrigerator and start frothing the milk. I can easily access the milk and make some good froth & heat up the milk quickly. Works great!"
1,"Great for frothing milk I bought a new latte machine and this cup for milk frothing. I am so glad I bought the 20 Oz as the milk really expands when you froth it. Easy to clean, I do not put it in the dishwasher though, just hand wash. works great"
1,stainless steel frothing cup This item is just what I needed for our new espresso machine. The item is nice and large enough to froth milk without making a mess.
1,"Convinient to use Nice handle, fits perfectly my espresso machine. Shape of the nose makes sure milk does not spill.Overall, pretty good for its purpose, though a little pricey."
1,"Great book by a great author. I have read all of Joan Hess's Claire Malloy mysteries and love them. The author uses clean language, and is very amusing and entertaining. I like a good mystery as well. In this one, she is looking for people's stolen pets. I haven't finished it yet, so it will be fun to see what happened to the animals."
1,Halo books 1-3 THis was purchased as a Christmas gift to my nephew. It came rapidly in the mail and was in great condition. My nephew was exstatic to be recieving this. Class A job.... thanks a bunch
1,Incredible and interesting This books are very useful on understanding the game if you didn't know it before. And if you are a fanatic of Halo you will like all the action involved in this wonderful books.
1,"Halo the book what a good idea. When i first played the game halo i loved it. The gameplay was great music was beutifully done and supprisingly the story was expertly told.So when a halo book came out i jumped on it to see the back round of the story. And behold it turned out great. But its no literary master piece. To compare it, its like reading a Tom Clancy novel. The author seems to have a technical name for just about every piece of equipment.So to round this review up if you like halo pick up the boxs set but be warned the series is written by two author and you may feel a chnge of writting inbetween the books, but its still all good."
1,Great Set this is actually my second set i bought; i think i lent my first set to a friend who i no longer remember and therefore cannot get back from. obviously i liked these books enough to buy them again despite the fact that i might find my old ones later.
1,"Great, Great Books These books are great. It starts off in a suspenseful environment and Eric writes this so well too keep the reader well entertained and keeps it with the videogame.The price and shipping timing were excellent. Go Eric and Go Amazon!!!!"
1,"Love the Game - Love the Books If you are a fan of the Halo games, you shouldn't be wasting your time reading this!"
1,"Looked great, worked great! Great product! I received the product quickly and found it to be exactly as expected. It matched well with smaller and larger seperator plates purchased 4+ years ago. The Wedding cake it was used for received excellent reviews."
1,"Loving This book is more than about relating to romantic love but also learning to love human kind, parent to child, yourself, etc. I really grasped the concept of how love has to be practiced everyday and like a skilled painter doesn't all of a sudden pick up a brush and create a masterpiece on a canvas, love is also an art that you have to practice everyday. You have to be a loving person in all that you do, not just romantically, not just loving your family, not just loving mankind, etc. It truly makes sense to me and since reading it, I've felt more appreciative and more open minded."
1,Great book This book contains information to help understanding oneself as well as relationships that one person has. I would recommend it to people who are confused in themselves and the relation that they have with others.
1,"The Best I have found this book to be one of the BEST books ever written about how one should really talk to and take care of oneself. Over the years, the idea of 'learning' how to really take care of oneself is soooooooo important and I have found this book to offer the central theme to both 'having a life' and 'having a good life'. I highly recommend the book to all people from late teens to early 'elders'."
1,"Still valid I first read this book about 30 years ago and loved it. I re-read it recently to see if it's still meaningful and: yes, it is. It is not a recipe book on how to love and catch a mate. It's more of a philosophical work on why love is important in our lives, including romantic love, parental love, frindship and love in society at large. It also explains what happens in societies where material values take presedence over love for a fellow human being. The book is a classic, easy to read and understand, and the content should be common knowledge. Unfortunately, it isn't. Highly recommended."
1,Maravillosamente inspirador Recomendable para cualquier persona que tenga preguntas en relaciÃ³n con su sanidad amatoria
1,"Interesting. Very interesting book. Nothing really new, but a lot of obvious stuff we normally don't think about. Will make you think twice about your current relationship, and whether it is worth being in one at all!If you have some spare time and would like to know a side opinion about love - READ IT!"
1,"A look at a popular form of needlework Whenever an embroiderer asks ""What book should I get to learn about historical blackwork"", the answer is always ""Blackwork by Mary Gostelow"".This book is very well written, and whilst I do not agree with all her conclusions about what blackwork is - her reasoning is logical and she includes lovely pictures - both of historical and modern blackwork.I would have liked to see some more pictures of historical works (especially colour photos) - and would have liked her to address some popular misconceptions about blackwork.All in all - I really do love this book and it is one that I always recommend."
1,"As above, so below Not only is this man brilliant, he's also very easy on the eyes! ;-)Beyond the obvious, though, the importance of this book at this point in time cannot be overemphasized. When we are all feeling overwhelmed and powerless about what appears to be ""World War III,"" Gregg Braden points out that we are not powerless at all. Utilizing his tremendous awarenss of prophecy and the science of human technology, this man pulls together ancient thinking with current wisdom in a way that creates hope, excitement, and empowerment. I love the way he thinks."
1,"Parkers Finest Hour I own almost every disc that William Parker has performed on and of the albums on which he the leader and primary composer this is the finest. Nice heads and song developement, strong soloing throughout and a spirituality that we do not often find in creative / free music. This is life affirming music that will surely make you think and appreciate what we as a collective share in this human experience. Parker is strong, his playing muscular yet graceful. Honest music presented without pretention. Highly recommended"
1,"What jazz is Consider this the best album in the Blue Series, although it's not in the Blue Series. Powerful, extremely thoughtful and spontaneous improvisation, and a monstrous, earth-shattering groove from Parker and Drake. It also seems just about official with this album that Rob Brown is one of the absolutes of music in our time. His playing is truly singular and always full of surprise. The only question is, ""Why hasn't someone given Louis Barnes the album under his own name that he so obviously deserves?"""
1,"A lifetime resource Kathe writes the book in a manner that enables the reader to pick and choose the right devotional resource to fit the moment. This approach provides a flexible, sensitive resource that speaks to a variety of circumstances when one may face the journey of grief. The book truly is a helpful lifetime resource. -- Carol A. Poore, author, writer and speaker specializing in topics of personal purpose, leadership and career/life direction."
1,"Definition of Brilliance I cannot recommend this CD too highly. It is a stunningly brilliant, eclectic mix of ballads that ranks near the top of the immense body of work that Engelbert has produced in his long and illustrious career. ""Definition of Love"" was crafted with tender loving care to every aspect involved in its creation. The selection of songs, the lush orchestrations, Engelbert's phrasing and interpretation of his material collectively reinforce my opinion that he is indeed the greatest baritone of the past century. Every track is an absolute gem, but if I had to select only one song it would be ""She."" Go out and purchase this CD today; in fact, get two copies and give one of them to someone else who appreciates great music that is saturated with Engelbert's unequaled interpretative artistry. I can only hope that The King of Romance continues with his recording career for many more years because vocal talents such as his only come along once in a lifetime."
1,"A must read for runners of any level This is one of the most refreshing books of the subject of running I have ever read. I heard the author speak on CNN and was very intrigued by his technical and philosophical running advice. After reading the book, I tried incorporating many of the ideas into my running form. It really seemed to help lift me to a higher level of running right away. I really feel the difference in my stride and agility, as my running seems more fluid now and less mechanical. I would reccommend this book to any beginner, intermediate or advanced runner looking for a new approach to improving their running performance."
1,"A Must Read for Old Fat Guys Who Run I am 43 and had quit running because of knee and ankle pain. Then I read this book, and discovered that I had literally been pounding the pavement when I ran before. My joints couldn't handle it. Now I have no joint or back pain when I run. I feel like a kid again. This book is the best money I have spent in years. And for the reviewer that thinks this book gives you too much to think about when you run, I recommend forgetting the book and running barefoot. I suspect that you will end up incorporating the really important Chi Running techniques this way. Myself, I'd rather read the book and run with shoes."
1,"Amazing Book! A must have for any runner! ChiRunningMy running coach told me this book would be a requirement for me if I was going to truly attain the goals I set for myself concerning running. I purchased it and have already read the book 3 times over. It truly teaches you a better and easier form of running. I have already increased my speed without any more effort. In fact, less effort. The book touches on every aspect of ones life and teaches you how to have a well balanced, well rounded life.I would recommend this book to anyone that is a serious runner or a beginner runner that wants to really learn to run."
1,"Improved my running and how I look at life ChiRunning helped me look at my running in a whole new way. It has improved my technique, but probably more importantly it has stimulated my motivation, improved my entire running program, given me tools and techniques to use in other areas of my life. Thank you, Danny Dreyer, for an informative, entertaining book on ChiRunning and ChiLiving!"
1,Best book on running EVER!!!! This book is definately the best book for reference when learning how to run correctly.Its principles add mileage to your daily run. There is a lot of information in the book so I would have it on your shelf for quick reference. If you want to learn how to run... and have always hated the way it makes you feel. This book will get you through the tough spots so you can use running as a fitness regimine as well as a way to clear your mind. WELL DONE!!!
1,"Changed my running and my life! I can truly say that this has made my running more enjoyable, more pain-free, and much more of a learning experience than just a way to suffer through exercise. I've applied it's principles to other areas of my life as well, including biking at the same cadence I'm running (180 bpm for me)."
1,"Question about shin splints For Kate, who posted a little over a month ago, yes, the running technique in this book will eliminate your shin splints. I've had shin splints for about 15 years, and ChiRunning enabled me to run without my shins hurting. I had never thought that would be possible for me."
1,Purchased as a gift... Heard many wonderful comments on this book and it was recommended to give as a gift. Receiver seems very pleased with the choice!
1,"Essential Runners Book Training for the Salt Lake City 2007 (my first) marathon, i got injured and doubted whether I would be able to do it at all. After reading this and applying it's techniques, i found that my technique was all wrong (or non-existent). Determination and commitment were not enough for an endurance race! I thought running was something you 'just did'. Wrong.Not only did I finish under 4 hours, but i had an injury-free race and even felt fine afterwards.That was all due to the book - I can't praise it enough. I also bought the video too. It was the best money I spent on running gear - after my shoes!"
1,"ChiRunning techniques work. Full stop. I have taken the author's ChiRunning workshop (which was outstanding), and this book details everything he talked about in the workshop, and a lot more on top of that -- plus, I have the book to refer to at my leisure.The techniques for running the author describes are impeccable, because the physics behind them are impeccable. The discussions, diagrams, and photographs are detailed and specific. The metaphysics... they work for the author, and if they work for you, so much the better, but even if they don't, the material in the book will be directly applicable to any fitness runner, racer, triathlete, or sportsperson.When I started doing ChiRunning I acheived *faster*, *easier* running, lower incidence of soreness and no incidence of injury, and feeling better during and after runs. I cannot expect more from a book on running, and have gotten *less*, from several books."
1,A Beautiful Find Many young pianists have the manual skills and dexterity to master these pieces but . . . the feeling and interpretation that Ms Bardin brings to us here in nothing less than marvelous. She puts you in another world.
1,"Each story is like an emotional snap shot. As an aspiring writer, I bought this book to study the style of a well-reputed short story writer. I expected it to be boring reading. Not only did I get an invaluable lesson on how to write tightly woven, meaningful, and highly insightful stories, I enjoyed every one and was sorry when the 1200+ page book ended."
1,"One of the best short story writers ever Mr. Trevor's stories are heartbreaking in their simplicity and clarity. Most often, he dissects the illusions which enable people to survive--and which are so very sad. After seven or eight Trevor stories, you begin to wonder if it is even possible to be honest with yourself. In this age where fiction so often is reduced to description, Mr. Trevor still believes in writing about love and death, honor and betrayal, duty and neglect. His physical world is narrow--usually limited to small-town or rural Ireland--but his emotional world is limitless. If you want to know how short stories should be written, read this."
1,"A Great Album hopefully Many more to come This is a great sophmore effort from Sparta. From ""The guns of memorial park"" to ""Splinter"" this has to be hands down the biggest suprise album that I purchased in 2004. While hints of At The Drive In still float in their music, Sparta has definetely struck out to seperate themselves. A track for those just getting into the band that you may want to check out is ""Vacant Skies"" on the Atticus: Dragging the Lake Volume II, A track well worth mentioning. Check out both albums you will not be disappointed at all. Maybe someday we will see a few songs with The Marts Volta and Sparta, can you imagine the possibilites?!?!?!"
1,"good this cd is awesome. tho i wont say its an improvement from wiretap, they do experiment a little. tracks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8-10, and 14 are all good tracks IMO. but the stand outs are tensioning and while oceana sleeps."
1,Best Werewolf book Yet!!! Being a avid werewolf fan I also bought this book cause of the cool cover. Gary does an excellent job making you care deeply for the the main Characters (Kyna and Cyrus). I did not want to finish the book and just wanted it to keep going and never end. I have searched for another book that would stand up to this one as far as the werewolf part and romance. I have not found one yet.

1,"Beautiful I have 4 kids 2 with a disability and this song melts my heart everytime I hear it and gives me so much hope.I really cry everytime I listen to it.When you believe,miracles do come true."
1,"Screen Issues Nonexistant I got a Creative Zen Vision for Christmas and I'm been sold since. First off, Apple's iPod (I have a second generation version and I just sold my Nano) has a great design and easy-to-use interface but honestly, I don't think the sound quality is all that amazing. Reading about Creative's products, I was interested to hear if the sound quality really was better than iPod. The reviews were true - sound quality on this PVP is simply amazing. iPods lacked bass, this player thumps on my Bose QuietComfort 2's. The screen is large enough to watch videos on (I watched several when I flew back to school). The player is meant to be held in your hand and as mentioned... it's meant to play portable video, not to as a replacement to the home theater. Check this player out (or the new Creative Zen Vision: M) before you drop money on the new iPod. You won't regret the decision."
1,"True Family Pride A really really great book. A true page turner. Written in Mrs. Jackson's usual style that is uniquely her own. I strongly suggest you pick up a copy and after pick up ""The Savvy Sistahs"". (the sequel that tells Brandy's story)"
1,"Leave your sanity at the door Seriously - take this film for what it is, watch some of the best actresses ever chew the scenery and enjoy! Don't expect anything too profound - but watch the faces! Just watching Emmanuel Beart pout is worth the cost of the film alone. This is a film in love with the idea of woman but appalled at the reality. Understand that and all else becomes clear. I rate this as one of my top 50 films because I enjoy watching actors act with subtle changes in facial expressions - only the most skilled can do it (without resorting to stock expressions a la Keanu Reaves)and this film is filled with some of the best.Oh by the way of you are a fan of cheesy French Rock and Roll I deny you not too hum along to the first number. The UK DVD has the full version of this as an extra."
1,So pleased... I've loved this movie for the longest and I'm so glass that it was available. Great customer service from the vendor and a quality product. So excited to add it to my collection.
1,"Amazing, powerful, respectful patriotism, exceptionnal, it announces the dawn of a terrible war. Nick has landed a new REFERENCE work here, I'm sure he will get lots of high level soundtracks to do in the near future.This soundtrack is immensely powerful and moving. I strongly urge you to listen to it on a powerful system with deep bass capacities!.I HIGHLY recommend it. Repeted listenings is unavoidable, it's so much deep and moving. the movie itself was reference imho."
1,"Great Companion to the Movie Like the movie, this score draws the listener into the feel, action, suspense and drama of the story. Like all great scores, this too is great to listen to while reflecting on the events of the movie/true events, and/or prepare you to see it again."
1,"Modern spirituality at its finest. Perhaps the finest spiritual book in print, Kazantzakis' _Zorba_the_Greek_ simultaneously praises the spirit and the body, affirming human existence like no other tale around.Alexis Zorba is a hero the likes of which haven't been seen since Odysseus or Sinbad the Sailor. He combines gruff physicality with love of life without falling into the selfish hedonism one might expect. Zorba is indulgent, but never in such a way that his character is destroyed.Zorba incarnates the soul, both for himself and for the reader. The ""Zorbatic"" theology provides for the world a God and a belief in that God that refuses to deny life, never turning against what it is to live."
1,"Zorba? On several unrelated occasions through college and a bit afterwards, I was told by various folk that I ""was Zorba,"" or was like Zorba, or was ""a Zorba"". I knew of the reference, but having never read the book did not understand its implications. I recommend this book not because I subsequently found the comparison to be flattering (I did), but rather because Kazantzakis is able to grab hold of grand romantic themes - youth, idealism, nationality, tradition - and really give them a solid drubbing. Similarly I would recommend ""A Hero For Our Time"", by Mikhail Lermontov. Good, earthy, bookworm-bashing timepieces, both."
1,"endearing character, lilting prose, eternal questions Zorba is perhaps the most memorable of characters. His ethos and pathos speak to each of us. He is ebullient, passionate, bruttish and fragile. He is alive with the questions of humanity and the pathos of Greek heroism. It is sad to finish the novel. Comforting to find him waiting in its pages."
1,"Jessye Norman is simply unparalleled! Instead of referring to Jessye Norman as ""Diva"", we should refer to her as the ""Supreme Diva"". Her interpretation of French and German repertoire is unequalled. Miss Norman's rich, oceanic voice enraptures the listener. Buy this recording...you will not be disappointed."
1,"Very good headphones I am overall very delighted. The headphones are sitting tight on the ears, are comfortable for hours, even if you wear glasses. The mentioned pressure is negligible and at least they produce a warm and pleasent sound. I listen mostly to classical music, so, I can't say much about other categories. With my Ipod they sound great, also with my PSP. I like the feature to disconnect the cords and have a cordless noise canceling device. I tested it in the parked car with the engine on and the A/C running on high. It is as advertised an oasis of silence. I compared them to my AKG HEARO 999 AUDIOSPHERE I, which was twice as much, and I like them more. They are well manufactured, there is no jiggle, and the carriage bag is very nice. Afterall, I don't think they should be used on skateboards (for security reasons!), or in the gym, they are too expensive to risk a damage."
1,"Excelent These earphones are fabulous! For my, noisy enviroments aren't a problem anymore. Once you put them on, you are the only one in the room! The earpieces are very comfortable."
1,"Bose knows my set of Bose QuietComfort 2 Noise cancelling headphones were purchased at a kiosk located in the heart of the Denver International Airport. i had heard of such noise cancel products and the use at the airport and on the flight were the perfect tests. this was over ten years ago the technology had only recently been made available to the public after years of perfection worn by pilots, maintenance workers and all who required phonic protection. The sound quality blew me away as i heard nuances in old familiar recordings i had never noticed and i could even run the vacuum cleaner without interference. The thing that really sold me was the genus of a design that allowed for the ease of replacement of the sound cord, the one part which always seemed to wear out or loss of signal because of weakened wiring, when meanwhile the speakers themselves are perfectly operational. Instead of losing an entire unit for replacement you can simply replace the cord. Perfection. Thank you"
1,A great historical novel This book covers Grant's life from when he was young all the way though to his death. The book showed us what a complex and interesting person Grant was. I truly enjoyed reading this book and found it very hard to put down. The book draws you into Grant's life and lets you experience his life's triumphs and tribulations. Anybody who likes good historical fiction will enjoy this book. My brother also read this book and really enjoyed it.
1,"Grant in all his Glory When I first bought this book, I thought I was taking a chance. But from page one, Robert Skimin takes you on a wonderous journey of one of the most interesting men in US History. It starts out with a few stories from U.S. Grant's early childhood and moves to his years at Westpoint, to the Mexican War, to his life during peacetime. Obviously the main part of the book is dedicated to the Civil War, but that is to be expected. Skimin takes you to Fort Henry, Donelson, Shiloh, Vicksburg, and the Wilderness Campaign. You have Lee surrendering to Grant and the Grant's life after the Civil War, including his scandal-torn presidency. Skimin keeps the book interesting as you follow the life of Ulysses S. Grant. This book is a must read if the Civil War or this point of history is even of slight interest."
1,"Cream All The Way, Baby! In regards to Eric Clapton's recording, many of his songs after Cream, though extraordinary, lack the incredible guitar solos that are on this CD (I can't speak for his stuff before because I haven't heard very much of it). I never knew that rock could be done this well before I heard this CD. ""Sunshine Of Your Love"", ""White Room"", and ""Crossroads"" are definately my favorites. I think ""Crossroads"" is among the best performances Clapton has ever done. Buy this CD, its the best."
1,"Great Band This band had a unique sound.I originaly got into this band because Kiss always mentioned this band as one of their favorite bands.As i am a huge Kiss fan,i am curious at time to listen to their musical origins.I knew Sunshine of your love and White Room.But the rest were not known at all to me.So i decided to get a copy of their best.Man i was not disappointed.Got right into it and couldnt stop playing it.Some songs seem to be addictive,probably recorded them on tapes made out of hippy weed.This collection is a must for fans of Clapton, Bruce, and Baker and the great rock of the late 60s. .Great stuff this,and i reccommend this band."
1,"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS cd is awesome. I understand the parental advisory on it. They swear like madmen in this cd, yet I still like it. I heard ""Stick 'Em Up"" on the radio, but that's not the only reason I got this cd. There r many reasonz I got this cd, but it would take me 4ever to state them all. There r a ton of awesome songs on this cd like ""Tarfur"" and ""Weirdo"" besides ""Stick 'Em Up"". I HIGHLY suggest this cd to ANYONE who likes rap-rock."
1,"Good stuff I bought this CD because I have heard the single Stick 'em up several times on the radio the lyric ""Im on the mic like a facist"" really jumps out and grabs you. The whole CD is really great, a good mix of hard rap metal stuff and a few slower balladish songs. Quarashi really reminds me a lot of 311 (think ""Down"") with a little bit of Cypress Hill mixed in. Good stuff, it sounds really smooth. If you like Linkin Park or 311 or any other rap/rock stuff you will like this. (I dont really care about Limp Bizkit anymore, most everything on Chocolate Starfish or whatever is just bad, their act is getting old)"
1,"A Must Have CD In this world of lame metal/rap fronted by bands such as Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock it has been hard to find new original music. However, Quarashi's ""Jinx"" brings a whole new and unique sound to music. Their first single ""Stick'em Up"" is full of heavy guitar laced over some hard hip hop beats. Each song on this album shows the talent and range of Quarashi. Whether it's their harmonies, rhymes, beats, rock ability, or powerful lyrics there is definitely something for everyone on this album."
1,"great book, worth the read for making bows If you are going to make a primative bow, this book is a great read. The book is to the point, easy to read and gives you the knowledge needed to make your first bow. Although there are many books written on to make a primative bow, this book is one of the most recommended."
1,"Elli Review This is a really good book, it really brings to mind things that no one could have made-up, its just way too horiffic, but it DOES open your eyes to what power one man can have, and how people follow the majority, not standing up for others."
1,"Limpy knows his stuff! Limpy takes the guess work out of sausage making. This book should be in every kitchen. From simple to complex, Limpy covers it all. I've tried some of the other sausage books out there. I've yet to find anything as good as this. Limpy brings you into the 21st century with his techniques. Some books are so out-dated you could make people sick. Limpy hides no fact or detail. You can trust him to show you how it's supposed to be done. I've been cutting wild game for over 15 years. I've come to rely on Limpy's book to guide a successful wild game processing business / sausage making business. Thanks for the wonderful book Limpy. Also, thanks for all you gave in Vietnam to make sure the rest of us could live free! Great book!"
1,"My Neice Loved it I don't draw, and have no idea about this stuff. But I heard my 16 yr old neice took an art class and became interested in charcoal sketching. Gave it for Christmas and her face lit up like the tree. Was the perfect gift in this case."
1,"An ""ancient"" story's trenchant comments on modern identity. Upon my first reading of this book as a rather fundamentalist Christian teenager, I was disappointed with its seeming lack of an ""overt"" Christian message. During my second reading (and following a conversion to Roman Catholicism) approximately 15 years later, I was moved tremendously by protagonist Orual's tendency to clothe herself in defensive strength rather than yielding to faith. The book suddenly seemed very ""modern"" to me. I smiled as I wondered what Lewis would think if he were able to see (and indeed, hopefully he is) how accurately the book he wrote some 30 years ago reflects the struggle of women in the '90s. There is something deep lurking in this spare and somber prose for female AND male readers. If you have ever longed to plunge into mystery, to learn to balance your ultra-rational side with the faith-filled portion of your soul, then I strongly recommend this book to you. (By Lori Pike, on a friend's E-Mail)"
1,"Better ten years later I recently read Till We Have Faces again, having read it with disappointment over a decade ago when I was still in high school. After my first reading I sold or gave away my copy of the book, thinking I would never desire to read it again. I'm glad I changed my mind and gave it a second shot. It is a gripping tale which probes deep into the soul as it explores the destructive fruits of self-centered love and the need for reality in facing the deformities in our own souls. I couldn't put it down and plan to read it again in the future. Needless to say, I will hang on to this copy . . ."
1,"wow and ouch! probably one of the most incredible books that I've ever read. Read most of his works, but this one is incisive and piercing every time I revisit the agony of reality it presents. ""Lekhem panim"" in hebrew refers to the bread of G-d's presence, but literally translated is ""bread of faces"" and resides in the Holy Place. Something that we need for the nourishment of our souls, and CS Lewis is definitely the consumate baker."
1,"amazing, brutal, challenging C.S. Lewis is so good at mixing faith with stories. Maybe that's why his stories are the most gripping. This retelling of Psyche and Eros is unpredictable and very moving. If Narnia is for children then ""Faces"" is a teaching fable for all adults."
1,"ONE OF HIS BEST FICTION BOOKS! UPON THE CHORE OF MOVING ALL OF OUR STUFF TO ANOTHER CITY....I had the job of selecting the ones I will keep. When I came down to Till We Have Faces, I looked thru it till I realized that it was only one I had failed to read! So it will be my next read after unpacking!I have enjoyed the first few reviews here printed! I believe I have More C.S. Lewis than any other Author! It seems that my favorite ones have been The Four Loves, The Seven Storey Mountain, The Asian Journal, New Seeds of Contemplation, CONTEMPLATIVE PRAYER, DIALOGUES WITH SILENCE! AS I RECALL BEING IN LOUISVILLE, I DROVE TO THE MONASTERY OF GETHSEMENE and I saw the little house in which he spent time in Solitude writing.When I sat in the Choir for Morning Prayers, plus later in the day for other times of prayer, I realized the Power of Silence & Prayer connected to the litergy of Chants & Hymns! I surely returned to my Prison Chaplain's office with renewed Vigor!Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood"
1,"HOLY MOLY!!!! I read this book at a time when I was starting to really dislike C.S. Lewis, but when I read this book I fell head over heels in love with him all over again. This book is PERFECT!!!! All the book is terrific but my favorite parts always fill me up with such joy!!! And oh my dear Lord in heaven, the ending!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! I was just in ecstasy over the end, which was by far the finest and most well-developed conclusion EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Till We Have Faces is a book of such psychological profoundness and depth you could sink into it and never find an end to it's meaning. I'm still not out of it yet and I don't to be."
1,"I'm no scholar, but this is just lovely! This was my first experience listening to music from such an early period, and I was spellbound. I'm not qualified tojudge the scholarly accuracy of the performance practices, nor can I compare these to other performances of the same pieces. I can say only that the music has an unearthly beauty of a kind which is not found in later music. The vocal style is different from what we find in baroque, classical and romantic choral pieces. It has a profound purity which comes, at least partly, from an absence of vibrato. There are eight composers represented, among whom Josquin and Palestrina are the best known. (One of the composers is Giacches de Wert, who, contrary to the Amazon listing, is not the conductor! The conductor is Christopher Jackson, and the ensemble is the Montreal Studio of Ancient Music, if I've translated the French correctly.) A beautiful recording. It was my first CD of ""early"" music, but it will not be my last!"
1,gone with the flakes! If you have flakes anywhere on your body znp soap will get rid of them and leave your skin baby soft. I have been using ZNP soap for 30 years and hate to see it unavailable. one bar lasts a very long time. about a year! Please bring the soap back!
1,As expected I have used the product before and ordered on line for a better price. It arrived in a timely manner as expected.
1,"Great! Great movie, got to my home very fast, could not be happier with the quality of the DVD as well!"
1,"Early is the man...I mean squid Really hilarious, but must watch from season 1 to understand all the characters and the point of the show really."
1,Skull Bones Watch My husband absolutely LOVED this watch. He rides a motorcycle and is very much into the skull theme. It works great and it looks awesome on the wrist.
1,Best Banjo This is one of the best bluegrass CD's out there. It's 7 years old and I continue to listen to it. Scott Vestal produces some of the tastiest banjo I've ever heard(and I've listened to Bela and the rest forever). Each musician is a master on their instruments. The beat is immaculate. I've been a banjo player for over 25 years and this is one of my favorites.
1,"Movie Perfection It's rare you find such a treat in the theatres these days. Disappointing acting, unoriginal stories, and recycled plots create a crapfest of bad movies. However, The Dark Knight shows us we don't need to be this way. Heath Ledger, rest his soul, was truly at the top of his game and all the choices were excellent actors. The story line, while obviously somewhat recycled (forgivably so), is as original as its going to get, and the whole movie is carried off without much in the way of flaw. Granted, you can pick things out that are ""wrong"" but all within the realm of suspension of disbelief.In any case, the movie is worth owning just for Ledger's performance!"
1,"BATMAN TRULY BEGINS EXCELLENT!!! I wish I could forget all the other Batman movies, even the ones that Tim Burton directed. Although Michelle Pfeifer was pretty hot as Catwoman. If only ALL Super Hero movies were done like this movie. In my opinion this was even better than Spiderman. Even women that I know who don't like super hero movies love, that's right, LOVE, this movie. It is basically a character driven drama with action. And for once, the villains don't upstage the main character as they did with ALL the previous Batman movies. If you are looking for a Super Hero movie that has it all, look no further. THIS IS IT! I can't wait to see the Dark Knight this summer!!!"
1,Great Flick Where it all began. Amazing movie with a great two movies following. The last movie (Dark Knight Rises) relates back to this movie a couple times so good idea to see this one first.
1,This is how you start things off What can I say that hasn't been said. This first movie of the trilogy is great. Great effort was made to really explore the Batman psyche. They explore what and how does a man become Batman. I don't think you saw Bruce Wayne in the Batman costume in the first 30 minutes of the movie. This more than made up for the previous Batman movies. As a Dark Knight fan I loved this movie.
1,good movie if you love batman then you will love this movie! we did for sure. it was awesome and we will keep watching it over and over!
1,Batman This was a gift. The person who received it just loved it. Great detail due to the blue ray. A must see for Batman fans.
1,"Love this move, the HD is awsome Would have paid even more for this as I love the new batman series. The HD is very nice and I watch it repeatedly."
1,Great entertinment Wonderfully entertaining. Nothing that will stay with you forever like with Lost or Battlestar Galactica but worth the price of a rental. Katie Holmes is particularly good in this.
1,"Best Batman since the original. Thankfully the terrible Batman movie streak has come to an end. I wish to ignore every Batman movie since Batman and Batman Returns. As far as I'm concerned those original 2 and this version are the only ones worth watching. Bale is the best Batman, with all due respect to Keaton."
1,better than war of the worlds This is the best movie so far of 05. With dissapointments to both star wars and war of the worlds I decided to go and see this. I was impressed in this movie. You get more of the story of bruce wayne training and learning to be a better fighter to then become the dark night. And don't listen to these other people because this movie is not boring. This has a story and it has great action. If you want to see a gret movie than go see this movie. Or if you want to see crap then listen to the nay sayers and watch fantastic four. But you won't regret watching this movie.
1,Sweet! I honestly expected less when I wathced this movie. Best Batman ever....loved the Scarecrow and the plot. Renting the rest of the trilogy tonight!
1,"nice movie, especially compared to the ones from the 90s i mean even with an all star cast they turned out to be a joke. This is how batman was supposed to be interpreted, i know there are many sagas of the comics, but the newer ones all have a darker theme to them."
1,Great fun! Had not seen these so got them to watch on a long flight. Enjoyed the flight even though I had to sit in the middle of a row.
1,"amazing movie Great movie composed of an amazing story and good acting. Batman Begins is one of the best Batman movies up to its release and is followed by an equally enjoyable film, Dark Knight."
1,Batman Lives!! Damn good movie with a great cast. Christina Bale IS Batman and Gary Oldman (I am a HUGE fan) breathes life into the Commissioner Gordon character. I can not wait for the sequel!
1,My Blu-ray discs collection begins with this. A great Blu-ray disc with which to start a new Blu-ray disc collection. Can't wait to see the Black Knight when it comes out later (probably around X-mas).
1,"The best Batman yet. To date, this is the best Matman movie yet. I must admit, I was a bit apprehensive since the Batman movies of the past seemed plain out cheesy, however, Batman Begins proved to be the exact opposite or it's predecessors. Starring Christian Bale, Batman Begins is more ""true-to-life"" than the one's of the past and emits a dark, goth, atmosphere. More Underworld-like (the movie). You have to see this for yourself."
1,"I'll try to keep it short Ok, here it is in a nutshell, this is almost like a watching a Batman documentary, no over the top villians, no goofy sidekicks, just the complete origin of Batman. Very good acting and well paced, this movie is the polar opposite of Batman & Robyn."
1,"Fun, well directed Batman film What a great cast... Christian Bale, Tom Wilkinson, Cilian Murphy, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and the greatest living actor today... Gary Oldman. What more could you ask for?This movie introduces the beginning of Batman, as well as introduce two new villains from the Batman live-action franchise - Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul. It has a wonderful mix of comedy, drama, and action, as well as a very nice ending. Gotham never looked as beautifully depicted as Nolan has done. You won't be disappointed with this movie."
1,"Incredible Absolutly incredible, Batman Begins is one of the best films ever. Placed upon the shoulders of Blue-Ray, Batman Begins is even better with incredible sound and amazing picture quality."
1,Well worth a better version I already had a regular version of this great film but is was well worth the expense of buying a blu ray version. The excellent quality of the rich colors and super sharpness of the blu ray version was worth the expense. I would recommend this blu-ray disc.
1,"A comment about the fight scenes Pretty much everything has already been said about this fantastic movie, which raised the comic book adaptation bar well beyond X-Men, or even Spiderman, has been said; so there is little to add.I noticed a lot of people complain about the fight scenes. They are quick, confusing and chaotic. This is EXACTLY like it is having a bunch of bats swarm by.That is the intent of the fight scenes and it is very accurate.Other then that the major complaint is that this is not a brain dead movie. There are plenty of movies to keep the mouth breathing, knuckle-dragging Budweiser crowd happy. Not every movie needs to be mindless. Go watch Die Hard or something."
1,"great action movie I loved it, the action was great . And it kept you going all the way.You should really buy this movie .It is very good."
1,"Batman is da Bomb! What can I say, Christian Bale is the best Batman yet! Remember when Clooney tried it?Hah! Buy this DVD here and save some bucks!"
1,Great BlueRay The blue ray is great and the added comic inside is cool. Great first movie of the series. I have The Dark Knight and obviously awaiting the 3rd
1,Batman Begins The Dark Knight Series is by far the best Superhero movies I have ever seen!!!! Loved every minute of it!
1,"good storyline This is not just an action movie, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the story was interesting and kept you watching."
1,"I love this movie The new Batman movies are awesome. I love Batman, I hope they come out with a third movie soon."
1,"Thanks Nolan Terrific introduction to the Dark Knight legend. This movie and its sequel assured that Mr Chris Nolan did the best job ever with the caped crusader movies. I already own it in DVD but had to buy the BD version. Specially with a less than $10 price, it is a MUST buy."
1,Great! Great Movie and great quality dvd! It fit nicely into my collection. I can't wait for the next one to hit theaters!
1,"Movie more true to the comics finally, a batman movie true to the comics.i didn't like the 4 previous batman movies but i loved this movie!! i'm picky when it comes to batman but this one remains true to the character. i have the deluxe edition dvd and its great.highly recommended for ""real"" batman fans."
1,Christian Bale as Batman This is by far the best Batman series I have seen. It is closer to the dark comics I read as a child and I am looking forward to the second movie The Dark Knight.
1,I'm so funkin' excited about this flick I wrote a song 4 it! Here's the link---> audiostreet.net/phatsk8traxjentaki76The song is called BATMAN BEGINS (2 get FUNKED UP!)Check it out & holla back with any comments!This flick is going 2 be awesome!
1,Batman Begins This was one of the greatest batman movies i ever seen prior to the dark knight. At first I did not think I was going to like it. I mean afterall I always thought no one can do batman as good as Micheal Keaton. Christian Bale proved it he can do batman in his own way. I reccomend everyone to watch this and the sequel to it The Dark Knight.
1,Great Beginning This is a great transfer. And the 5 minute prologue gives you a sweet taste of how great The Dark Knight will look on Blu ray.
1,"The Dark Knight Returns This is the Batman movie I've been waiting for! Tim Burton's Batman was my favorite until now. The storyline, the action, the sets, acting, this movie surpassed all of the previous batman movies, especially the most recent Joel Schumacher ones which were horrible. The actors picked for Batman and Ras Al Ghul were perfect, as was Scarecrow. This movie is true to the comic book, thankfully, showing it was NOT the Joker who killed Bruce Wayne's parents. It has that mood you must have for a Batman flick, without a type of pseudo-universe created for him like the Tim Burton movies. Too bad Halle Berry didn't wait for this film to become Catwoman. A better director and costume would have made her the ultimate Catwoman.Finally, a director that doesn't base his movie on the campy 60's tv series. I'm already waiting for the sequel."
1,"batman as nature intended gone are the campy over the top villans of the last movie series. no adam west silliness either. here we have a story in which we can suspend our disbelief and actually get into the character of bruce wayne/batman. the previous celluloid batmen were little more than cardboard cutouts, but this one lives and breathes. i was a bit skeptical about the new batmobile design but after seeing it in action i am now a believer. i hope this is the beginning of a long and fruitful franchise for the venerable dark knight. the bonus features on the second disk were informative and enjoyable with several mini-documentaries about set and costume design, action sequences, and a very nice segment about the comic writers and artists that were the most inspirational for this film. the bonus comic is also a nice addition to the package."
1,"Tied for best movie This is my favorite movie with Star Wars Episode IV Return of the Jedi. It's a dark movie and a tiny bit scary,but it's still great! In the end Batman fights the Ducard in a great battle on the train. It's a great movie!"
1,Batman Belongs Great addition to my DVD collection. Shipped fast and was in perfect condition when it arrived.
1,"Excellent The film is wonderfully written and beautifully shot. Nolan is perfect in the Bruce Wayne/Batman role. He plays the irresponisble playboy well, and is very credible as the fighting machine known as Batman. The movie takes its' time getting him into the Batman suit. A friend of mine who was watching the film with me and not that familar with the comics thought it dragged a bit in the beginning. I have to disagree, but I have read Batman comics since I was 7. This version of Batman seems more alone the lines of the Frank Miller version of the character. A bit on the darker side, it is a more believeable hero for our current world. This is a great character piece as well as a terrific action film. Worth picking up."
1,"Forget what you know... If you've seen the first 4 films in the Batman series and go see ""Begins"" expecting for it to expand on what you already know, you're in for some disappointment. If you're a fan of the animated series, before Robin/Nightwing and Batgirl of course, this is for you. Batman is dark, mysterious, and drives a car that looks like a Lamborghini and a tank's love child.I'm looking forward to the next movie in this revamped series. This is how it should've started 15 years ago, except Christian Bale was probably still in elementary school back then. I hear he's also interested in sequels, so keep it coming!"
1,"This one should be off the heazes!!!!!!!!!! Batman and Batman Returns rocked solid and Batman Forever and Batman & Robin ah, they're crap. This one should be the best yet! The first time I saw a prievew for it ah, it was ok. But when I saw a 2nd I was freaken excited! But my main question is... WHO WILL BE THE VILLAIN? IT BETTER BE JOKER OR ELSE I'M GONNA CRY(I'm joking)!!!"
1,"it's better than batman,returns,robin,forever!! but i think if you want dark,scary,violent get this one but i like fantastic four too but maybe they're just if you're in the mood for the OPPOSITE ok? so it's excellent and i like this but i like fantastic four too!!"
1,"WIsh it were the first Batman I just watched Batman Begins and all I can say is WOW!!!, this is ""THE"" Batman movie. Its to bad this wasn`t the first of the Batman movies. Its well written with lots of action. The first of the movie is a little slow but the rest makes up for it. If your looking for a couple of hours of good entertainment get this movie."
1,"What other Batman movies??? I heard it once before I went to see the movie. ""Once you see this one, the others will not exist..."" It's true.The best part about any of the first movies to me is the fact that Jack Nicholson played the Joker. Beyond that, those first movies cannot hold a candle to this film.Dark, cynical, brutal, wicked... All describe this version of the story. The way Batman was originally intended. Christian Bale does an great job of portraying this character. This movie actually shows us Bruce's transformation and hardcore training he goes through in order to become the superhero we all know and love.I got to see it on IMAX too. Outstanding!!!"
1,"$7.99 Blu-ray & Rental What More Can I Say I recently decided to start increasing the size of my blu-ray collection, by mainly getting some of my favorite movies. Batman Begins is by far one of my favorite movies and an amazing retelling of the Batman legend. Amazon definitely had the best price for the combo you get in the deal. For $7.99 you're not only getting the blu-ray, but you are also getting an on demand rental from Amazon. I have not used the rental yet, but saw it pop in on the Roku box. Movie came in just a few days and the quality could not have been better.Pros:- You get the blu-ray and a rental, so you can watch right away- You can't beat the price, unless you get it used somewhere- It's Batman and it's awesomeCons:- NoneOverall great movie and great price. Well done Amazon."
1,"Step away children First of all every time a superhero movie is gonna come out marvel,dc,or any other,kids are always the first in line to go see it but just cause this movie is rated pg-13 doesn't mean it's for kids not like they can't see it but you know.I mean really this batman(which is the best)is how he really is.Batman has always been a dark character who has anger,wants revenge,whether is to kill or bring them to justice and truly this is not a character children want to look up to.He's like the punisher only that he doesn't use guns but cool gadgets and they have the same intesions.This movie is waaay different from any of the other batman films(""and george clooney as batman,ARE YOU KIDDING ME!"")it takes it more serious and is just a movie for grown ups(not like there's blood,nudity,or anything else)but really once you look at this batman film you will see it really MUCH MORE MATURE,THE WHOLE STORY AND EVERYTHING,BALE RULES!"
1,"IT BEGINS....2005! I've followed this film's production for a good while now. This movie will reboot the Batman franchise. The story will be a treat for Batfans non-Batfans alike.Judging from his interviews, Christian Bale is taking this role very seriously, even dedicated it to his father who passed away the end of last. This man will become the new embodiment of Batman/Bruce Wayne.June 17th everyone...it Begins!!!"
1,"Can't decide whether I like this more than TDKR I'm in the odd group of people who were not that into The Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan did Bruce Wayne very well. His Batman however, felt a little generic. It wasn't bad, just far less interesting than his take on Bruce Wayne. Batman Begins has more Bruce Wayne than Batman, which is a very good thing for me. It depends really. What do you like more? Bruce Wayne or Batman?"
1,OUTSTANDING !!!!! We had movie night at my sisters new place after i told her how great Dark Night Rises. too my surprise my little sis has never seen any of the new Dark Night series. This was a great time for all of us.
1,"Still playing with it.... My son got this toy for his second birthday and he's still playing with it nearly two years later. When he first got it he did have a hard time building anything with it, but he loved the Bob & Wendy figures - they went everywhere he did.Lately he's been building all kinds of elaborate structures with the bricks and is not limited by the fact that the roofs don't stay - he uses them for ramps and decks and other things. We never tried building the stuff on the box, so I can't really say if that ""works"" or not. All I know is he's gotten a lot of use out this toy and we're considering buying another set."
1,Works great on my Diamondback Hybrid Haven't had any issues with the size of the frame. It is larger then a road bike frame but fits fine.
1,"In use since 1989. Bought one 21 years ago from my local bike shop.Used it to hold my bike up and as a work stand.Doesn't work well with over sized tube bikes since ""hook"" is too small to hook.Rubber came off awhile ago, but replaced with duct tape.I don't think I'll ever need to buy another one since there's nothing to break or fail."
1,"Sloan are aging well.. This is their best album since ""One chord to another"". It's very hard to find an album that rocks as consistantly as this one. Although, they don't experiment as much as they used to, this album is a keeper. If ""The rest of my life"" dosen't get your feet movin' and your pulse a racin', nothing will. Will the rest of the world take notice? This is one of Canada's best kept secrets. The secrets out!"
1,"Just don't buy there other albums.... I had not heard of Sloan, till I found this cd at a listening station. I felt it rocked enough to buy it for $23 or so, and I was right. I love every song with the great guitar work and tight vocals. The last track was very trippy and reminds me of a 3 minute Monster Magnet song (if you're a MM fan you'll hear it. In short the album was awsome.Then I went back and bought two of their previous albums, Pretty Together and some other one. That was a mistake. I'm glad they've changed their sound to this album, and hope it continues. Their other works are NOT my cup of tea. Soft/lame/ NO good guitar, etc. In short, there was nothing special about them, no good hooks.If you want a rockin cd, this is it. If not, buy their old albums and not this one."
1,weight jacket i use it alot and i enjoy it and i put xtra wieght in the water bottle pocket for more resistance and i just love the product and i can eve add a weight where the velcro strap is
1,"Great for Getting in Shape and Staying that Way Don't think walking is intense enough for you, but running is too intense? Well you can always walk with one of these ten pound vests. This is just super for building up your endurance and believe me, when you're trekking miles away from civilization, carrying everything you need on your back, that endurance you've gained by wearing this vest when you didn't have too really pays off."
1,"Confirmation that Christopher Walken truly IS weird! Great film. Walken is the only person who could have played this guy so genuinely. In my view, this is the weirdest, most convincing alien abduction film out there. Unsetling, yes. Go see it because it asks more questions than it answers, which is why we like these films, correct?"
1,"You can find 15 minutes a day for Donna When you get an exercise video, you're never quite sure if it's going to be used once or twice and then just collect dust on your video shelf or if it's one you will use over and over again. The Donna Richardson 4-Day Rotation Workout is one you'll use over and over--I promise! She focuses on upper body, hips and thighs, buns and abs, each within 15 minutes. (You can certainly do more than one segment per day if you're so inclined!) This includes warm-ups and cool-downs. It's a do-able workout and in 15 minutes you'll feel like you did something good for yourself. She also emphasises correct form/posture/breathing for doing each exercise which is very important, too. If you're interested in toning your body and spending 15 minutes a day to do it, I recommend this video."
1,"Great Exercise Video! February, 2003This is an excellent toning video. Donna provides very specific, comprehensive workout routines that quickly and effectively tone all the problem areas of the body--arms, abs, buttocks, and thighs. The exercises are intermediate level, including warm-ups and cool down exercises all in a flexible format that allows you to focus on any part of the body you choose in a variety of different ways. I use this video everyday and alternate it with either one of Donna's ""30 Days to Firmer Arms and Abs"" or ""30 Days to Firmer Thighs"". That way I get a complete workout everyday along with the fat burning exercises offered in the 30-day videos. If you use these, you will lose weight quickly and safely."
1,"Great Instructor! This is a great workout for all levels. Beginners can start with no weights, intermediates can go for small weights and as you progress you can add ankle weights and heavier dumbells. You can break the video up into 1 segment a day or do any combination. Its great because each segment has it's own warm-up and cool down. I recommend this video because she is a great instructor and very motivating."
1,"Fantastic Perry Mason Season 6 Volume 2 is fantastic and the wait for the next Season seems a long one. Beautifully restored disc and is giving great pleasure. Roll on the rest of the ""Seasons"""
1,"The quality is good. The quality, clearness, stories and diction are good. If you enjoy a good court room drama, I recommend these series."
1,I'm very happy with this as well There were no problems with this either. I watched each DVD and all was well. I was both able to hear and see them clearly. So far that hasn't changed. I'm well satisfied. You couldn't be doing things any better than you already are.
1,"Shaping Seattle Architecture A fabulous history of Seattle in word and photograph. It is a Who's Who listing those that gave Seattle her flavor and distinguished character. This is a must read and study for all native Seattleites as well as for newly arrived residents. The buildings: commercial, residential and schools show the step by step progress that the city has made through the designs of noted architects. From 1853 to date the book covers Seattle's development. It is a first class read and study."
1,Great Book This book is easy reading that takes you back to a simple time. Has a 1930's or 40.s feel to it.
1,"A taste of the south comparable to Welty Gibbons' Charms for the Easy Life captures the lives of three generations of southern women. The tale is interwoven with humor, compassion, and Gibbons' brilliant style. The power of this novel transcend the mere power of the written word - it changes and enriches the reader."
1,"This is one of the best books I have ever read! As a librarian, I am always looking for books that appeal to a variety of our clients, as well as, a book that I will enjoy. This book is absolutely wonderful! It moved me by the strength of Charlie Kate and weaving of the tale of war, romance and a coming of age for Margaret. I have read this book 3 times within the last 4 years and the ending always moves me to tears. This is a fabulous book."
1,"Great Charms of the Easy Life was an eventful filled book that left me wanting to know what happened afterwards, How Sophia and Richard went on with their lives, and if Margaret ever goes to college and what happens with she and Tom. Not only does this book excite you with backwood practice of medicine but it also intrests the minds on if the medicine would actually work. It is the story of three women, defied by men but encouraged each other to continue life and live it to the fullest. It is worth reading and passing on to a friend"
1,"So good I always own two copies... I like to keep a second copy of this book handy in case I need to recommend it to someone. I don't ever want to be without it. The women in this story all live on in my mind/heart long after the last time I read it. I was not crazy about Ellen Foster when Oprah went on and on about it...I always thought she should have chosen this book.I guess if you're ""forced"" to read this for school I would recommend that you have a quick attitude adjustment first. Having been stuck reading some seriously dry assignments long ago in the stone ages, how I WISH a story like this would have been put in my life when I was younger! I can't understand a word of the negative reviews here.It's like chocolate.I understand how people might not like brussel sprouts even though I do. I don't understand how anyone can possibly NOT adore chocolate. That's what Charms for the Easy Life is for me."
1,Essential Truth This book recognizes that our actions flow from our beliefs. It does an excellent job of using the truths of the Bible to align our beliefs with God's love for us. Our good actions flow from God's profound assurance of freedom and love.
1,a 100% indispensible handbook when visiting Alaska. This is probaly the best hiking book of any such types. truly informative. The pages seem to be made of a light density papyprus product...making it ideal for backpacking. The Author has truly captured the essense of hiking out in the Alaska Booneys.
1,Talk about moisterizing your skin..... without feeling greasy....on addition to this product I bought a body cellulite massager and the combination works great but this cream without anything else is a great moisterizer; therefore the skin looks renewed and less bumpy. While we were on vacation my husband asked me what could he used on his ankles that were so dry. I gave him this pot of cream and he wouldn't let it go. Nivea is a trade mark of years of great products! Look for my other reviews on their sun kissed products.
1,"Inspiring and Uplifting Few films these days are truly inspired and challenge the viewer to become a better person for having watched the film. This is a rare gem that does just that. This film is crammed full of emotion and heart. It is absolutely a testament to the fact that love, generosity, selflessness, having an appreciation for life and caring for each person we meet will make this world a better place. This film will challenge you to take life and your dreams to the next level. ...And keep those tissues nearby. With this much emotion packed in, you'll definitely need them."

1,Black Arrow Hits the Mark This story is fantastic. The author's grasp of the language and speech of the period is wonderful and completely creates an atmosphere that one cannot help but fall into. This is now one of my favorite books!
1,AMAZING! WOW! This is one of my favorite books.The story is well written and fairly easy to follow.The archaic english was a bit confusing at first but with kindle's built in dictionary it was actually rather fun.A book i will read over and over.i Certainly reccomend reading.
1,Beautiful Bible. This Bible by Thomas Nelson is beautiful and simple to understand. I recomend it to the Religious.Nelson Villamor y Fleitas.
1,"Great product to protect your investment I recommend everyone with a video iPod buy this. It is excellent for protecting the screen, as well as the overall finish on the iPod. This is cheap insurance for a very pricey product."
1,"Art Practice & Text Its excellent, i love it, but try interpreting this in the practical middle brow range of actually doing something with it.Thats not a complain, thats an open ended challenge -- as I've been conjuring with little success for a couple of years: all thoughtswelcome!"
1,"instrumental doesn't have to be boring Nice to hear a band that doesn't depend on vocals--this music is impressive of its own accord. Very entertaining album, with a little something for everyone--surf, jazz, blues, exotica...goes over great at parties. Excellent guitar work."

1,"By far, the best Depeche Mode album It contains the autentic Depeche sound, with the gratest songs they ever created. If you never heard any song of Depeche Mode, give a try to this amazing disc, and you will not be disappointed."
1,"The Roots of Reiki This book is a ""must have"" as it takes the reader to the Shinto/Japanese spiritual roots of Reiki and where Reiki comes from. This book has become my Reiki bible and has deepened my practice. When you perform the exercises, as specified, the energy is undescrible and so very spiritual as it takes the participant to another place and space. If you purchase no other Reiki book this is the book to have."
1,"Definitive guide to Reiki Whether you are new to Reiki energy or have been practicing for years, this book will give you the knowledge and awareness of a comprehensive approach to using Reiki for self healing. You will come to understand the true history of Reiki, and then move on to learn the various techniques used in Japanese Reiki which will allow you to deepen your practice. These techniques are rarely taught in Western courses, which are typically greatly abbreviated, and often filled with misinformation.Bronwen and Stiene have built a rock solid reputation for the accuracy and integrity of their work."
1,"What Reiki is really all about! There is so much emphesus that Reiki is only about healing others, when in fact...""Reiki is about self-practice, self-responsibility and personal development.""This book takes you back in time to what reiki is on a personal level, and what Usui-sensei originally taught. Reiki was not meant to be of just ""palm healing"" only, becoming a Reiki master/teacher and just healing others, look inside yourself and listen, Reiki is all about ""you""!Get the book, read it and when you are done, read it AGAIN! There is no other book that can compare!"
1,"nice amp! I hooked this up to my BOSE 301 series II speakers and it really works great! I first played my iPod 5g nano through this amp, and while the sound was clean I was a bit disappointed in the volume of sound, then I played my 4g ipod touch and BAM! Much better! Better amp in the 4g iPod touch. I've got PLENTY of volume, in fact more than I'll use. No need for a sub with these 301's as I don't listen to hiphop. The amp foot print is small, discreet, and free of choices, that's really a good thing! Additionally, I like Amazon, this company is always great to do internet business with, and are very smart moving forward in this new economy...down with ebay up with AMAZON!Oh yeah, sittin' here jammin to Ozric Tenticles ""Waterfall Cities"", and it's soundin' AWESOME!"
1,"A great amp to use with iTunes and power backyard speakers I used this to power a pair of outdoor Bose speakers on my back deck and it works well. Runs cool; I have the AudioSource Amp installed in a closed kitchen cabinet with no heat problems.My music source is an Apple AirPort Express with Air Tunes (M9470LL/A) connected to the amp through an headphone jack splitter. All my music is stored on an XP PC in iTunes and streamed wirelessly to the Air Tunes box. I have the AirPort Express sound jack connected to two amplifier inputs; 1-a cheap $16 powered PC speaker set (has subwoofer) for listening in the kitchen (sounds great!), and 2 - this AudioSource amplifier. Music quality is good through the AudioSource Amp. I wish it had a bass boost but I think that is a problem with my Bose speakers.A great value."
1,"Excellent product, excellent price I purchased this amp to power my outdoor speakers but it would also be great for a simple indoor system. Good,solid quality,excellent sound!! I would highly recommend."
1,"Works great for surround amp Using as the amp for surround back channels, sounds good, running cool. Would suggest this for anyone needing auxiliary amp."
1,Making the Invisible Visible by Keith Devlin What a wonderful book. You just have to read it and then you will understand.
1,"This is not a Christian book, King Hezekiah is Jewish!!!!!!!!!!! Thought this book was great. Well written, I could not stop reading.My only issue is with a lot of the other reviews that say this is a Christian book. It is not, Google King Hezekiah and learn that he is of the House of David and Jewish. For those reading that he is of the genealogy of Jesus and assuming he is Christian is forgetting that Jesus himself was Jewish.Sorry for my little rant but please know what you are reading."
1,"Makes you want to read your Bible I really enjoyed this book. It was exciting and interesting. I'm fairly familiar with my Bible, but this book had me wanting to check and double check things. I'd find myself reading my Bible to see how the story was going to go! My teenage daughter read it first and said she thought I'd like it. She was right! I recommended it to my teenage son and he was on book 2 within a couple days. You just don't want to put it down!I like it when a book can bring a Bible story to life without contradicting the Bible itself. I'm on the 3rd book so far and still loving it!"
1,"Gods & Kings by Lynn Austin I wish I could give this book 10 stars. Lynn Austin is a fabulous author and her writing is scripturally sound. Once you start this book, you don't want to put it down until you have read the 5 books in this series. I highly recommend this book and have bought several as gifts for my friends."
1,"Hallelujah! This was the first in the series, and i was ""hooked"" until I finished book#5. Amazing Bible based fiction. I was so encouraged when I saw the characters ""come to life"" with Ms. Autens' literary skills. Recommend all five as a very good read and study."
1,Brings Biblical historical events to life. This is an excellent historical novel and keeps the reader engaged to the end. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in putting a face on early Biblical historical characters.
1,"A-maz-ing! I purchased this book for my Kindle app-- mostly b/c it was free. HOWEVER! Once I started reading it, I couldn't stop! In fact, I read the entire series in a week. I know others have said this-- there are a few typos (not really a ""big deal"" in my opinion ;) ), but the book is so well written. I gained a wonderful insight to biblical history in a way that I've never had before. READ THIS BOOK! :) And go ahead and get the rest of the series, too, while you're at it..."
1,"The Bible comes alive Although this is fiction, it is an interesting way to present what the Bible says about Ahaz and Hezekiah. This book follows Hezekiah from childhood. It is so intriguing. I loved every page. Lynn Austin brings the characters in the Bible alive and makes them so real. I found myself searching the scripture to see what the Bible actually says about what happens during this time. As soon as I finished the book I was downloading the next one in the series.I totally recommend this book. It is a terrific read!"
1,"Fabulous This was the first Lynn Austin book I read, and I could not put it down. I quickly read the following books in this series. This first one started out difficult to read, simply because of the subject matter, and almost a year after I read it I still think about it from time to time. Even if you are not a fan of Biblical fiction, I would still highly suggest this book. Well done, Lynn Austin!"
1,"Exciting! This novel grabbed by interest from the very beginning and held it to the last word. Gods and Kings is a beautifully written action packed story. I recommend it to anyone interested in history, religion, action.... its a great read!"
1,Riveting! I read this book in a day. Couldn't put it down. Just purchased the next book and will start It as soon as i get some sleep!
1,"Great Read on HIstory of Israel Downloaded 2nd book as soon as i finished this one, that should tell how i felt about this book.Would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the history of Israel and enjoys a good story."
1,"Great Book! I loved this book, did not want to put it down. I really enjoy Francine Rivers books and this was very comparable to her series ""Women of the Bible"". Can't wait to read more!!!"
1,"Going Back in Time Lynn Austin has done an amazing job with Gods & Kings. She has breathed life into her characters: wicked King Ahaz, his son Hezekiah, Shebna, and all the others. I was there, watching this cast of characters become living, breathing, human beings who were not just names in the Bible. I felt their pain, their sorrow, and their joy. You won't be able to quit reading until you've read the entire series. God has gifted Austin with an amazing writing ability."
1,"AWESOME STORY!!! I loved this book so much that I read it straight through! And then I read the rest of them in succession. Austin is a great author, bringing the Biblical characters alive in a way I'd never imagined. This book series will expand your understanding of this Old Testament story of Hezekiah, and it is fascinating!"
1,"My favorite read! Lynn Austin's books are ALL great but this series is my most favorite. It's exciting, scary, sad and biblical even though it is fictional. In fact, it drives you to the Bible to check out her historical facts. I felt all the emotions that the characters felt. I wish she would write more biblical fiction. She makes it all come alive!"
1,great book Lynn Austin is my new favorite author. I really like the way she writes her books. So far I have read 3 of her books and they are all good ones.
1,Riviting! I could not put this down. The story put biblical events to life and kept me on the edge of my seat. This is a must read! Can't wait to start the next in the series...
1,"awesome book Excellent book. Very vivid imagery through details. Lynn Austin is definitely on my list of authors I like now. Pick this up and read it, it's a must!"
1,"Nobody beats Klausz as a woodworking instructor This was the first of 5 DVDs I bought of Frank Klausz. So, in a real way this is a review of his videos as a group, besides this one on hand tools. Klausz is always clear and precise. He demonstrates speed in addition to craftsmanship. Be sure to buy his DVD on dovetails and mortise and tenon joints to see Frank further demonstrate hand tools achieving wonderful results. See him use hand tools as an extension of power tool use.Since I first viewed this DVD I have added to my woodworking addiction by more frequently visiting estate sales/flea markets buying old, rusted tools in order to rehab them. This is terribly satisfying work, and my friends and son-in-law really like the vintage gifts that result.When I buy a DVD, such as this one, I figure 3 or 4 good ideas make the Amazon price for the DVD worth the investment. Frank Klausz always provides more than that."
1,"Tea that works to clear all digestive stoppage. This tea works on my fiance's digestive track as she has an issue with colitis and this product along with essential enzymes helps her to absorb and digest foods that otherwise would give her pains while in her digestive track, Thank you for making this product we plan to continue using it as long as we can."
1,"The BEST Cinnamon Tea This is far and away the best cinnamon tea I have ever found. It's quite difficult to find a cinnamon tea without added flavors like apple. This is just cinnamon tea, and it's aroma and taste is that of fresh cinnamon. Also I drink this after dinner to curb my carb cravings, and amazingly, it does the trick."
1,Great M.C. Beaton is my favorite author - I have all of her books - I so enjoy Agatha and her exploits - please write more
1,"Out of print, but excellent Five faces of darkness is almost as good as the original movie. While lacking the print quality of the original, it is excellent in content. Appearences by Trypticon amoung others, is very interesting to the dearest of fans. It's all here, the origen, and many other interesting stories. Although this cinematic masterpiece is no longer published, I wish it were, having watched it. AJauasataian, a awesome transformer also makes an appearance."
1,he's back again Robocop 3 is awesome. i don't understand why so many people don't like it. i think it's a good movie. it's a must see for robocop fans
1,"Lovely ghosts Kozinsky's interpretation of Reger's op. 57 is rather controlled; the double fugue glides without shakes, the organ seems to favour it spreading out an uniform sound mantle; if you are fond of this work, and wait for the wise ""slowdowns"" before theme's repeats, as Wheinberger or Germani did, you'll be disappointed. Moreover Bach's BWV 562, in comparison with so much discography, does not present surprises of great importance. The listener thinks: another organist philologist? Till Karg Elert's spirit on the one hand, on the other Karl Richter appear suddenly to Kozinsky on track n5: it's only possible this way to explain an incredible, rhapsodical, furious interpretation of a real masterpiece, whose I don't know different recordings. Only this one merits more than five stars; but never I saw before someone to face a program so deadly for an anthological CD. Thank's to GM Records.Roberto Ranieri"
1,Great find I was surprised to even find this battery. I have had my Bayco rechargeable light for years and one of the batteries is failing so to find a replacement for it was a very good thing. You have to love Amazon for the variety of items it sells. The battery was shipped quickly and works as advertised. Thanks Amazon!
1,"Kicks like a mule! Alright, it's pricey but if you want the best, most powerful air hammer on the market, this is it, no joke. I work for a GM dealership and do alot of front end work. My snap-on air hammer ph3045 (not blue point) can't compare to this thing. I work with a guy who has one of these and whenever I had trouble he'd break his 717 out and knock whatever it was out without a problem. Ball joints, wheel studs, bearings, no problem. Thats why I bought one. You will not be disappointed! Everyone in my shop always talks about this air hammer as the end all to anything stuck and it never disappoints!"
1,"Grew Up On This Even though this album is now well over 20 years old, it still hold a special place in my heart. I spent many car trips listening to Hooked On Classics when I was a child. The music is wonderfully arranged to cover a wide variety of classics in a single album.Highly recommended!"
1,"Troma's War After a Tromatic plane crash on an island somewhere off the face of Cuba, a few spirited Tromaville Citizens are about to find out the harsh reality of guerilla warfare. It is only a short period of time before the battle for life and death begins in one of Troma's ultimate masterpieces. If you like Troma, an interesting plot, or just a plain bloodbath, then Troma's war has it all. Though not the best Troma film, it is still worth getting. Unfortunately, it doesn't measure up to the wonderfully black standards of Terror Firmer, but then again, what could? It is still an amazing film, and a good storyline."
1,"More Action Than All Four Rambo Films Troma's War is a different kind of Troma movie. Sure, it's violent, dumb (in a good way), and has some good t & a. But it's also more of an action movie instead of a horror-comedy, which is what Troma is famous for. It's pretty much non-stop exciting, violent, and action-packed. They don't make them like this anymore, unfortunately. Also, while watching I felt like I was watching a lost entry in the Rambo series, or maybe a sequel to Commando. It's like Rambo and Commando, only done Troma-style, and I'd say it has more action than either of those or the rest in the Rambo series. I recommend Troma's War if you're a fan of Troma movies, or violent shoot em' up action movies. You won't be disappointed."
1,"recommended for all beginners There is a little detective in all of us, but in most cases one wouldn't know where to begin. If you are curious about possible existence of paranormal phenomenon this book gives you that place to start. Whether a skeptic,a believer,this book gives the information needed to begin simple investigations in a manner that is easy to understand. For someone who hasn't had years of experience in the paranormal, or criminal investigation some of the books available can be intimidating. Mr Southalls book however makes you feel that doing your own investigation is within abilities. This book is not perfect, but it give an excellent starting point for the novice to begin investigating from."
1,I loved this book. My mom read this book to me. I liked because it was a new book. I liked the sqeegy bug because he wanted wings and a stinger but instead the spider gave him wings and a light. I would recommend this book. I am 9 years old.
1,"Brilliant cellist This is truly exciting music. Played with passion, this arrangement explores little known Slavik and Eastern European music. The ensemble between the cello and piano is faultless and the richness of the cello sound (played on an 1733 Testore) makes the album memorable. Karen Kaderavek, already a well established cellist, will go far."
1,"""Post"" is a true masterpiece, showing Bjork at her finest. ""Post"" is Bjork's most outstanding effort to date. Much anticipated to follow in the success of her previous release ""Debut"", ""Post"" has emerged with new and different experiments in sound. The magical blend of dance beats and strong classical instruments like violins and cellos, sets this artist apart from all others. The powerful tracks of this album, are extremely versatile, resembling big-band, orchestral pieces, and funky techno rhythms- yet it is all Bjork. With her extraordinary vocal talents, it almost wouldn't matter what she had to say but we are thankful for the grace and poetry of her lyrics. Bjork is like no other and this album is a true musical experience."
1,"Strange, scary and special style On this wonderful album you'll find some strong and powerful songs, starting whit the opening track "" Army of me "" a very powerful song whit a strong lyric, some men may be a little scary of BjÃ¶rk because of her strong confident.The next song Hyper-ballad is a sweet but strange song, also whit a powerful lyric in it. And at last you'll find Possible Maybe a strong song and BjÃ¶rk really shows what a powerful voice she have."
1,Full of unusual sound effects.... I love this album. All the songs are great and they're so interesting with all the computer like noises in the background. You won't be disappointed with this album!
1,Great concert! This concert features Ringo playing Beatles classics that he rarely performs live (if ever)... Don't Pass Me By and Octopuses Garden! Ive seen Ringo live several time and these great songs are left out. Considering how great they sound on this concert i hope he considers including them as concert staples. This show lacks the usual greatest hits night of the supporting band (although it has Who Can It Be Now by the Men At Work guy). Wish it included more songs from the band....their contribution is half the show! Instead you get Ringos new material which some songs are surprisingly catchy..others the usual B-side at best type songs. Sound quality and picture on this blu-ray are awesome! Loved it!
1,"Ringo Starr and the Roundheads- Live (Blu-ray). ""Ringo Starr and the Rounheads- Live"" is a 55 minute long, 14 song concert disk released by Soundstage for PBS television, WTTW 11 of Chicago. It is delightful from start to finish, beginning and ending with a Beatles song. Colin Hays (Men at Work) took to the stage as a guest artist to perform ""Who Can It Be Now"".Among the Beatles songs executed by the group are ones on which Ringo Starr sang lead vocals as a Beatle, or for which he is credited as co-writer of the song: With A Little Help From My Friends, Yellow Submarine, Act Naturally, Don't Pass Me By and Octopus's Garden.While a good Beatles tribute band like ""Rain"" is around to delight audiences for many more years it's special to watch a real Beatle on stage leading his own band-the real McCoy. Audio and video quality, as well as performance are all excellent."
1,"Brilliant analysis and evaluation of a great play Granville-Barker's prefaces to Shakespeare are highly regarded as the first such written from a theatrical (as opposed to literary) point of view. This approach pays particularly high dividends in dealing with this, one of WS's least appreciated plays. (I am currently appearing in a production of it in NYC -- in a small role.) Jan Kott, in describing ""Troilus and Cressida"" in the 60's, called it ""amazing and modern."" Cymbeline, in the 90's, seems strikingly post-modern, and Granville Barker, writing in the 20's, accurately describes features of the play which speak strongly to our highly collage-like contemporary approach to art. Highly recommended (as is the Arden edition of the play itself, probably the most charming of all the Arden editions)."
1,fun I like Kari Anderson her fun nature laughing while exercising It feels good her queues are easy to follow I have just started to do the step and find it enjoyable.
1,"Outstanding Reception I bought this radio on the basis of online reviews promising outstanding reception. I need to get good reception on a relatively weak local station. I've tried several other radios that couldn't do the job, most recently a Sony that looked great, but could not detect the desired station. The Receptor distinguishes between adjoining stations and brings in the program crisply and clearly. It's also nicely compact."
1,"Incredible Sound for Modest Price We bought this radio after looking at a number of table radios at various price points. The radio was shipped quickly & arrived in original packaging. We paid circa $109. Set-up was incredibly easy; the directions are quite user-friendly & straightforward. Setting preset stations & dual alarm times was simple. Out of the box to installed & playing may have taken 10 minutes. Although we set a number of local stations, we use this Boston Acoustics radio exclusively for playing XM satellite radio (Audiovisions) through an inhouse/incar pioneer satellite radio. The sound quality is crystal clear & stunning. The bass is nicely presented without being overbearing. We wondered about the lack of tone controls but this is a total non-issue since the sound is well balanced & rich. We could have spent more for other brands, but the sound quality from this radio is stunning. Would strongly recommend!!"
1,Terrific Radio-Just what I hoped for I wanted a kitchen radio(the alarm function was not important)with great sound that I could hear throughout my fairly large apartment and this radio is just delighting me no end. I considered and looked at the Bose and higher-end Boston Acoustic radios and feel that Consumer Reports is spot on rating this their 'best buy' table-top radio. I was wary of warnings about the bass muffling spoken voice(since I mostly listen to NPR)but I'm not having a problem with that at all.
1,"Gundam Toys Rock! The Gundam series was excellent...and still is to this very day. I really like this product better over the models...although models are awesome, dont get me wrong...I just like playing with the toys and Like how durable they really are. Definetly a worthy catch, Great price for a Nice G-Gundam fighter.Strongly recomended."
1,"Use your intelligence A previous review bemoans the fact that there is ""no entry"" for saturated fat. If you look at the book, the entries are for particular foods, from abalone to zucchine; and in a separate part, for chain restaurants from Arby's to White Castle. For EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE ENTRIES there is a column that lists grams of saturated fat. Also listed are measurements for calories, protein. carbohydrates, sodium, fiber, total fat, cholesteral and percentage of fat. This seems very useful, systematic and honest. Please ignore the ranting of the previous writer, who clearly has not read or does not understand the organization of the book."
1,"Outstanding cookbook if you're a french-fry vegetarian trying to change your ways and be healthier I've been a vegetarian since I was 17 (am 24 now) and always found it hard to avoid eating way too much pasta, bread, and other starches. This cookbook has opened up a whole new world for my boyfriend and I, as we are trying to South Beach Diet. He loves this cookbook, and he's not even a vegetarian! I recommend the chili that uses red lentils (there are two chili recipes), and the Paglio e Fieno w/ Cashew Sauce recipe that uses thinly sliced and steamed zucchini and squash instead of pasta. Tonight we are making one of the Portobello Burger recipes. I can't wait!!"
1,"Works great, but confused over the ozone issue. I purchased two of the Ionic Breeze Professionals with the added ultraviolet bulb that help to kill bacteria. Based on the amount of black gunk that collects on the metal grids each time I clean it, it must be working. I have read the Consumer Reports that it emits unhealthy ozone and the air does have that after a thunderstome smell, but I have not experienced any breathing problems. My wife is a very heavy smoker (unfortunately) and I think these units are removing a lot of the tobacco smell and particulates. Some reviews say the ozone emitted is so low, it isn't really a concern anyway. Not sure who is right. I have found that the low odor water based Goof Off in the orange spray bottle cleans the black gunk right off the grids. Spray on, let it sit for a minute, wipe off with paper towels, rinse off with water and be sure all parts are completely dry before re-assembling and turning the unit on again."
1,"Best Deal Yet Received the unit and the ad said ""like new"" - well it was definitely like new and works perfectly.Great buy."
1,"Left Unsaid is the best band ever!!!! If your into good ol fast, poppy, catchy punk rock buy this cd!! I've seen Left Unsaid play many times before & everytime it gets better and better!! This cd is pretty old & they really don't play all the songs off this cd that much anymore. I think they play about 3 or 4 of them. I must say all their new stuff is the best I've heard from them yet! but, until their next cd comes out buy this one. You won't be dissapointed. If you like stuff like strung out, blink 182, get up kids, unwritten law, face to face & and more you'll love this cd!"
1,"Life Changing This book has been life-changing. I bought it and am nowing buying a copy for my wife. If you reflect on the questions it asks you, you can learn a lot about yourself. I've been able to apply what I've learned about myself and anger management with my wife, kids, co-workers, customers, etc. I would highly recommend buying the Myers-Briggs temperment book, too. Together, these 2 books make for a powerful combination in learning about yourself and others."
1,Anger Workbool A friend suggested this book - I have gained a whole new insight to some of the issues I have been dealing with in my life. This book has helped me put a lot of my life experiences in perspective and has helped me understand myself and others so much better. Even if you don't think you have anger issues (which I didn't) this will definitely have an impact and be effective in understanding anger and it's complexities. A must read!!
1,"Great help! This book changed the way i veiw anger. Yes, i am a bible believing Christian and this book does use the bible as a source of reference. I learned so much about my anger and the anger of others. It encouraged me and gave me tools to work with to choose to control my anger. I can't wait to read their next book! I also understand how to respond better to angry people. It is a real eye opener!"
1,Sisal Brush Ever want to scrub your back and you cant reach it? This brush does the trick. Although it takes a little time to get use to the stiffness it is well worth the effort. My skin has never been so soft!
1,THE BETTER BRUSH THE IS THE BEST BRUSH ON THE MARKET.AFTER CLEANING YOURSELF WITH THIS BRUSH YOU FEEL CLEAN' TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT.BUYING TWO MORE.OTHER BRUSHES WHERE TOO SOFT THIS BRUSH IS FIRM.
1,one of the best What else can one say about Meguiars??Good products - always near the top of the line at a reasonable price.Great stuff for nearly everybody...
1,"Great Collaboration of Products!!! This a great combo of cleaning/care products for my car. It was exactly what I was looking for. If you know what all these products are, then you will understand this is a great purchase. Everything included is really all that is needed for a perfectly clean car. The only thing missing is the bucket, water, and a good means of drying (I used one of those super absorbent towels rather than a chamois)."
1,"Blows You AWAY! I live in Ecuador, South America.. and have partyed at the most awesome places all over the country, even HERE the song is a HIT !!! when this song comes on it blows EVERYONE away! This song WILL give you the chills and you wont stop movin' !!!"
1,"Balanced, Objective, Well Researched I really enjoyed this one. I don't know where the other reviewers are coming from in calling it biased. I did not see that at all. Morris does not appear to be a fan of Ben Gurion, but he also did not give a lot of attention to the Israeli massacres in Lebanon. He is not into emotionalism in this book but more into just recounting the facts of history. This is not a book to build up one particular side or another on the issue. It is a good book to learn the actual history though."
1,"Just pure insanity on a small disc with a hole in the middle I downloaded Dreaming in Dog Years about a week ago now, just to get a sample of these guys. It starts with a little drum beat, very soft, quite innocent. Just before the fastest vocals I've heard explode from my speakers. It's no exaggeration to say that I actually jumped. It was just what I'd been looking for. These guys have some of the heaviests songs ever written, but still keep an intelligence about them that is welcome. They even manage to be catchy. Just see if your not singing ""It's not gonna be allright, and it's not gonna be OK"" to your local corner shop owner as you buy your morning mag. Highlights are: Dreaming in Dog Years, That Certain Special Ugly, Catalepsy and Like a Train Through a Pigeon. Rock on to y'all."
1,A great book I am 11 and this book has helped me tremendously. I believe it has saved me a lot of trouble in the future. Even the delicate subjects are explained in a way the does not make you shudder. J ames has written many other great books. My mom has bringing up boys. It was hard to put this book down. I read it in 3 days. It is the best six dollars and forty four cents I have ever spent.
1,William Powell Myrna Loy Collection What could be better than a set of great movies from two great stars!This is a wonderful collection. I hope more sets like this are on the wayfor those of us who love good movies.
1,"the best couple powell& loy, they are the quintessential couple--ever! they have the best chemistry. watching them act is like seeing astaire & rogers dance, effortless. whoever their co-stars are, they are still as one. I hardily recommend this multi-dvd ensemble. these films are meant to enjoy, over & over again. you won't be disappointed!"
1,Throw back movies Good movies to bring back old memories! These actors are legendary and having this product at such a good price made my purchase even better.
1,The Amazing Amazon I am very pleased with this box set. It was delivered sooner than expected and the quality of the DVDs is excellent. The box set has given me many hours of viewing pleasure. It was certainly money well spent! Congratulations Amazon on your superb service!
1,"CD's Love this series. I got them quickly, still watching them from time to time. Good deal, good service.word word"
1,Great gift for my wife. Myrna Loy and William Powell had such great screen chemistry that this set of films was a no-brainer. I bought my wife The Thin Man collection previously. These films have that Loy-Powell chemistry in different settings. My wife loved it.
1,"What to expect when you're expecting...MORE THAN ONE!! The first thing to buy after the doctor says...""I think I can hear another heartbeat!"" Twin pregnancies ARE different, and as a recent twin Mom, I relied on it from beginning to end of my pregnancy...right to 38 weeks, with over 14 pounds of combined birthweights. It's a great book."
1,"weigh in here The Doctor/Physician Scale I purchase had very little assembly needed and directions made it very simple to put together. As for the delivery time from this seller, I expected to receive it between 5 and 12 days and was very pleasantly surprised to receive it within 3 working days. I would use this seller again with no hesitation.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGDXL2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1,Great Scale A++ I have sons that wrestle. They need a scale that they can depend on. They check there weight multiple times a day. It was easy to put together and is very accurate would highly recommend.
1,"Pyramid Life Provided that Pyramid is heard, then it will be a modern string quartet classic. Duval and company lay out different and ever shifting layers of music that terrify and bewilder the listener to the point of how do they do this? The reward is a punishing thematic piece that lays out new territory between modern classicism and jazz, where some terrifying solos result."
1,"If it is heard, then it will be a classic. Duval and company knock out something special on this recording. An improvised theme runs throughout the cd the leads the musicians into fascinating and terrifying solos. Pyramid finds some new and interesting territory that fills a space between improvisation and modern 12 tone classicism. Under the Pyramid should be destined to be a modern string quartet classic."
1,"How do you rate a great CD? Here's my answer: If long after you have played the CD, the tune echos in your mind! It true Jonny can pick a mean mandolin -an instrument rarely used in old style bluegrass- but he also shares the spotlight with others in his group. Sam Bush and Jim Hurst can be heard taking a lead, and round out the sound nicely. Listen to ""Catch Me If You Can"" for a good lesson on harmony, and balance. And Jonny Staats drives a UPS truck by day! With music of this caliber, hopefully not for long."
1,"Great Classic Rock This is a great cd from a great rock band that came from the greatest era (in my opinion) in rock music. This is a cd that I have listened to almost everyday since I got it. It is that good. Every song on there rocks and if you are a fan of House of Lords or even just a fan of 80's rock, this is a cd for your collection."
1,"A great beginners guide As an investing novice I know very little about the financial world before reading this book. Now I understand a great deal, and have a lot more confidence with my money. Through a mixture of wit and wisdom, Tobias entertains while he educates about the wild world of money. This is truly the only investment guide I will ever need."
1,"What can you Say. Its a tail light, product is compatible to OEM works turns red and white =O).Great product would recommend to others."
1,TYC 11-3189-01 Ford Passenger Side Replacement Tail Light Assembly is as better than the picture Within two days of purchase I received the TYC 11-3189-01 Ford Passenger Side Replacement Tail Light Assembly for my dad's Ford F250 1999 model. I had accidentally backed into a tree trunk trying to get it out of a ditch this past winter. Took my dad about 20-30 minutes to instal and it looks like new. Fits perfect!.
1,Clean wash Very pleased. My compact washing machine does not accept liquid bleach. I couldn't find powder bleach in the stores. These packets are perfect. I use 1/2 a packet in each white load. Very economical and I have clean white clothes.
1,"a philosphical comedy The writings of Bernard Shaw in this particulat play, invites to you use your mind to understand life and philosphy. It has such great insight into many aspects of human nature and at the same time is exteremely funny and really takes you into it's pages. The writing has impecable style and this is truly a classic play."
1,The book would make those who demonize China unhappy. The book stays almost unknown in the U.S. only because it provides solid evidences of how aggressive India was. It is an offense to those see China as a demon and India as an angle of democracy.
1,"Just what I expected Good movie with good story line. Just what I expected from this, good story line with live issues. Not a typical Hollywood movie."
1,"one of my favorite movies at the moment Beautiful movie. Very inspiring. Couldn't have imagined better actors for it, they were perfect! Healing is possible and things look up eventually, it's just a matter of perspective ;)"
1,"Smart and Funny Good teenish movie that is for all the age groups. Funny scenes, some serious ones, and Zach has a couple of solid moments. Give it a chance, it will make you smile in a genuine way. And what would be wrong with that?"
1,A must have for beginners to pros I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book cover to cover. It goes into as much detail as you need to get started and points you to other resources if you want to go deeper into any one subject. This really is a must read for any one who wants to get involved or has been invloved for years in developing better products for end users.It seems that any book from the Adaptive Path team is an excellent resource and only adds to their leadership in this field. Well done Mike and thanks for making my job easier.
1,I liked it The IZ is really cool! I like the colors! It is always entertaining me and it is so cute! I have a red one. I like the way it's body moves! This toy is awesome!
1,The Absolute Best This is the very best of Mellencamp on a 3CD set. The only way it could be better is if it were a 4CD set with even more songs! All the favorites; all good! Mellencamp has that classic folk-rock sound; a message with a beat. This CD set is never far from my hands. It is a 100% hands down best buy.
1,"In The Wet Absolutely wonderful, one of Nevil Shute's best novels. It takes you on a journey of the mind and heart, transporting you to a different world."

1,"one of the best r&b artists of all time Any emotion you feel R. Kelly will touch it with this masterpiece of an r&b album. I know R. kelly can be a little overally sexual with his lyrics but overall this album is really good. I recommend it to any who likes r&b artist like Ginuwine. Best track is probably ""I wish"" which touches anyone who ever lost someone they truly love. Don't let the parental advisory sticker stop you from buying this album. This has to be the best r&b album this year and probably for awhile because you don't see a lot of r&b artists like R.Kelly scoring this big..."

1,"Still with me everywhere I go after 5 years... I first met Sonia in her Heart's Desire workshop (which was excellent!) 5 years ago. Since then I've had the privelege of having a reading done by her. It was amazing. Much of what she said has come true, and manifested in my life to my utter amazement! My own psychic awareness has gotten stronger as well, through the use of the book. I can't seem to live without it! It is the one book I take with me on all my travels near or far. I can refer to it for support, or inspiration whenever I feel the need, and it is a wonderful source for that. I'm sure anyone who is looking to improve thier life even the slightest bit will be happy with this purchase. It will change your life... and there are many surprises in store for you if you follow through with the excercizes in the book. Thank you Sonia for being a source of light and inspiration in my life, and so many others!"
1,"Appreciative As always, Sonia takes you on a ride worth the trouble. She is someone with a marvelous gift that she's sharing with us. I'm learning a lot."
1,"Happy, happy, okay I love the book, but the condition wasn't quite what I expected. There was a large area of water damage, but book still readable. So I'm okay with it."
1,"Sonia Choquette is wonderful! I love all of Sonia`s books. They are the easiest to read and most enjoyable ""self help"" books I have ever read. I would recommend her books to anyone even if they aren't on a spiritual path to learn how to be psychic.Her books are a gift and I am always sad when they end."
1,Interesting reading This book provides a systematic approach to finding your way in the oft-clouded world of the psychic realm. Sonia really has got it all together.
1,"Mstislav, Yo-Yo, move over How has so much of this incredibly beautiful music escaped my attention for so long? I knew the Saint-Saens and the Rachmaninov and one of the Faure pieces, but the rest were totally unfamiliar. On this disc, Han-Na Chang brings this rarely heard music out into the light of day, and renders both the unfamiliar and the familiar with superb tone coloring and deeply felt interpretations.This is simply the most beautiful and moving cello playing I have ever heard. It's going to spend a lot of time in my CD player."
1,"A Feast for the Ears! This CD is fantastic! John's poetry speaks to the human experience. Several phrases really ""struck a chord"" with me. In addition to the thought-provoking poetry, the music is awesome. The intricate rhythms develop and change with each song. John uses several culturally diverse instruments to create a sound that is truly a feast for the ears. ""Drum Poetry"" offers music to dance or do yoga to, or to simply ""chill out"" to. It is definitely a CD worth adding to your music collection."
1,excellent product. easy install This kit was super easy to install. I replaced a regular 4 wire connector. This now makes the trailer brake lights work.
1,"On the wild side... Join Jeff Corwin as he shows us the dry, hot desert of Arizona, the life and death struggle in southeastern Africa, the rain forests of Costa Rica, and the grasslands of the Venezuela. Along the way we learn about life, death, love, and the web of nature. He also pops in facts and short stories, many of which are as funny as you can get without a Nun's outfit, a donkey and a jar of peanut butter.The book itself is a lovely hardcover, with full color photos and something I would be proud to have on my coffee table if I had a coffee table. And it is so enjoyable to read you could easily finish it in a day if you wanted to."
1,"Wish I'd had it years ago I bought the EZ Can Crusher and Recycler 4 years ago. I love it. Wish I'd had it for longer than the 4 yrs. I have. It's easy to crush the cans flat, and they fall right into the collection bin. I have the bin lined with a plastic garbage bag, so all I have to do is pull the bag, close it and off to the recycle center I go. No mess. For years I used a can crusher mounted on a post on the patio, and had to crush the can then drop in a plastic garbage bag, then move the bag to an out of the way location and do the process all over again until I had the bag full. No more. This unit is all self contained. Hard plastic receptable, easy to clean, durable. If this one ever wears out, I'd definitely want another."

1,"A Must Read on the Whole ""Bible-Homo"" Question Professor Long provides a much needed and long awaited treatment of homosexuality in religious perspectives. His focus on the issues of ""gender-threat"" and its relation to why some religions are antagonistic to male homosexuality is right on target. He combines his knowledge of religious traditions with a cultural eye that gives the reader tremendous insight. I devoured this book, as should anyone interested in the whole ""bible-homo"" question."
1,"Great coming-of-age movie I've been a fan of Eliza Dushku for years. When I first heard about this film, I just had to check it out. I think C. Thomas Howell and Juliette Lewis had a great chemistry. It's one of Juliette's best role. I can't believe how cute Eliza was when she was 10. For her first film she did an incredible job. One bad thing about this movie is that is not on DVD. This movie is worth watching."
1,DVD Release For several years I have been constantly checking to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet. Who do we even contact to put in the request?!? I would love this movie on DVD!!!!
1,"A must for any serious alternative history buffs. I have a collection of over 6,000 books,and I have to say that this book is the best book I've read in ten years!It is absolutely riveting.Be prepared to read it one go,you won't be able to put it down."
1,"Resurrection Indeed Although it starts off a bit meandering, Resurrection Day quickly builds into a book difficult to put down. There are two phenomenal stories here. One is what if the Cuban Missile Crisis had turned into WWIII? The other is what the US might be like as a 3rd world nation. Both are compelling.DuBois writes engaging characters and fills his plot with enough turns to make a Ballerina tipsy. I repeatedly tried to geuss the ending, and even the next page, and was always stymied. The conversations flow convincingly, and the story is a joy to read.Here we are given a look at how Americans are like the rest of the world. If you strip them of the technological advantage, and the moral advantage of a well-constructed constitution that is actually followed, they respond like everyone else. Not badly, not well- just as humans, struggling to survive."

1,"Old School meets New School This purchase was another gift for Christmas. I bought this particular pair of shoes for my wife. Although it was not a direct Amazon.com purchase and I was redirected to another site, the process was easy. The shoes were shipped fast and on time, there was great communication from the site that sold them. Another great purchase!"
1,good shoe I bought these for a gift. The recipient loved them. Apparently it is hard to find the half sizes in stores with this shoe. No complaints with these.
1,love love these shoes. no trouble with purchase. fit just perfect. love these shoes. love this brand. love this color. love
1,Good choice for the price An Excelent choice. They are very good for everyday use. Accesible price. I am very satisfied and I recommend it.
1,"So very black I own 5 pairs of Converse sneaks, my daughter has 3 pairs, and my son has 2 pairs. We all really love our Chucks. But this is my first pair of the low top kind. I love them so much. They are really comfortable and easy to slip on and off, and so very black so they go with any kind of casual clothing well.If you're buying Converse for the first time, be aware they run just a touch big. This is wonderful for my son who has fairly wide feet, but the rest of us usually buy a half size small."
1,"the always faithful converse chuck taylor i said the always fauthful converse 'cause its simply the best shoe i ever had, they gimme all the confort that i need to walk very much!!!! i mean walk A LOT!!!!"
1,Nice shoes I ordered these and when I got them they were everything I thought they would be. I love em!
1,"great! a great shoe, buy a size below what you usually wear. comfy, durable and a great casual look with jeans."
1,"love em Converse are great for your feet. They contain little padding, so you maintain a natural walking motion. Its basically one step above being barefoot. I actually use them to weight train. They are also very stylish. Who doesn't love converse?"
1,"Haley's shoes These were a purchase for my 13 year old granddaughter. Although I have not physically seen them because they live in VA and I in MN, she tells me that they are just what she wanted. Pleased with the ease of this transaction and the speed in which they were shipped to her. Thank you."

1,Classic Chucks rock! Got these to match with my 2 and 4 year old boys. They love when we all put our chucks on together. These never go out of style.
1,"Converse All Stars rock! I have been wearing all stars for way to long now, and these are just as good as I remember. These shoes are iconic, we all know how good these are, the oxfords are a great change of pace from my high tops. These shoes will never go out style!"
1,"Perfect fit one size smaller I purchased some Converse Mens Chuck Taylor Sneaker from another store because they had some specials going on and I also had some coupons so I purchased them in the size I have always worn, size 9. Then I try them and wow way too big, felt like a clown at the gym :)I can fit a whole finger in the back of the shoe with my foot in it. Anyway I did some research here on Amazon and bought pair from Amazon, a size 8 and wow !!! I can't believe it Perfect fit, I was about to buy half size smaller but I went with the whole one size smaller instead and I'll say it again PERFECT FIT :)Buy one size smaller ,quality is amazing"
1,"Came on time. I ordered these sneakers for my cousin. He loves them! Great pair of basic sneakers that blends well with any outfit. Great decision, rather than over priced sneakers!"
1,"My distant cousin I loved this book, because it is about a relative I had never met. I have met his son, tho"
1,"good Thank you, this item was exactly what I wanted it to be. It is a good purchase on my part. thanks!"

1,"the best for me I have been using this gel for many years now. I am old enough that you would think I shouldn't get zits anymore, but every now and then they find their way back into my life, especially in the summer. This product works great for me. I start using it at the first sign that a pimple might be forming and they don't stand a chance. My skin is too dry and sensitive to use harsh products on my entire face, so I only use a small amount directly on the spot. I re-apply at least twice a day, more often if I am at home. If for some reason I do not have this product with me (such as forgot to pack it) they will form, so I know it is this product that is saving me. I am glad to see it on amazon as I just tried to order it from my usual place and they no longer have it.thanks again amazon - and beauty.com."
1,"Welcome back Goren and Eames!!! While I am a huge Goren and Eames fan, I was a little disappointed that there was little to no reference to the last episode in which Goren was fired and Eames left the department. This episode acted like it was just another day at Major Case. There was a little reference in the opening scene welcoming them back but that was it. And who is this new captain? What's his background? I truly miss Captain Deakins as he was my favorite captain for this version of Law and Order.Having said that, this was such a relief after having to live through season 9 which was just awful. Truly I am surprised that this Law and Order was renewed. This episode goes back to the earlier days of Criminal Intent and showcases D'Onofrios talent at shaping the case as Bobby Goren. It's also great to have partners who actually work with each other which wasn't happening at all last season. I am very happy to have this duo back even if its just for 10 episodes."
1,"Love, Love, Love Law & Order Criminal Intent!!! I am sooooo glad you brought back Law & Order Criminal Intent!!! I'd heard you were removing it, along with the Original Law & Order. I wish you hadn't removed the Original Law & Order:( It was my favorite also!! Whomever is writting for L&O; are wonderful writers!Thank you Very much"
1,"Masterly Disappointingly out of print. The essay on Walt Whitman is alone worth the price of admission. In it RLS is led to discuss the art and craft of poetry with surprising lucidity and characteristic concision. Also essays on Thoreau, Realism, and ""Books which Have Influenced Me"" are notable, though not all the essays here are literary. Lacking a current edition, fans of literature and 19th century eloquence should go for a used or collector's copy of this wonderful compendium."
1,Classic Laura This is a great VHS! Watching and hearing Laura sing and dance non-stop is great fun. So sad to have her out of our lives--thank heavens for CDs and tapes.

1,"Historical soviet Ballet - a real treat Considering that these recordings are more than 50 years old, they are a real delight, one could well wish for much more of this, here we have really delightful ballet. Galina Ulanova, Maya Pliserskaya are a delight to watch, especially I found The Fountains of Bakhehisarai, with the 43 year old Ulanova and the 28 year old Plisetskaya a real delight, it also reminds one of just how the Soviet Union embraced many nationalities, as did also the earlier Russia, this ballet is one not to miss, also The flames of Paris, provide an interesting view into the French Revolution, again an excellent ballet piece, this DVD IS THOROUGHLY RECOMMENDABLE"
1,"Find your misconceptions about God in this book... ...then keep reading to move towards a better understanding of him.In church school classes, in Bible studies, even in pulpits, I constantly encounter people who have a neatly categorized, labeled and filed-away God. The most common thing I see is people who reject a particular doctrine, Scriptural passage, or the like, because they know ""God wouldn't do that"". And how do they know? Because THEY wouldn't do that if THEY were God. Yes, their God is too small; and probably so is yours and mine. Reading this book will help us realize how great he is."

1,"This is banging This is how i usualy shop for cds i hear or see the video then if i like i buy the cd When i saw the video for the song chop suey i was impressed. S O A D has a metal / harmoney / guitar thing goin on and i was really feelin it. we all know how some artist have that one good song and the rest is trash. thsi is not the case here. The rest of the cd shockingly good but chop suey is still the best. The bottom line is this: if you liked chop suey then what are you waiting for buy it now. trust me, you wont be disappointed."
1,"Album of the Year System of a Down's s/t debut was an album that totally blew me away. It is among my top 10 fav. albums of all time. That was the year 1998, and it has been 3 years since SOAD has blessed us with their musical goodness, and now 3 years later SOAD has dropped Toxicity. Toxicity has picked up right where s/t left off. The same unexpected time changes and death-metal-like intensity is what SOAD is all about. Serj is sounding better than ever with his distinct hardcore growls, and Daron Malakian returns as one of the industry's most talented guitarists. Toxicity is the album of the year....plain and simple...nothing will top this album.Tracks of note--- Prison Song, Needles, Deer Dance, Chop Suey! ATWA, Science, Toxicity, Psycho and Ariels"
1,"WICKED CD!!! One of the best cd's ever!!!!!serj's voice sometimes annoys me so much (when he screams), but not to worry cuz its still a wicked cd!science is a boring trackif i were yall id take a listen to forest, ATWA, aerials,chop suey, prison song,deer dance, you wont know what its like if u dont listen to the whole cd!if u were a true soad fan u would LOVE this cd, and if u werent then listen to the cd, give it a try, who knows wat could happen after!!!!!ATWA ROCKS!!!!!!!"
1,"Toxicity- Intelligent Punk Metal Toxicity is easily one of the best releases of the year, in any genre. System of a down has taken heavy metal and interlaced it with melody and arabic influences to create an entirely new and different sound. It is heavy metal, so the faint hearted may find it a little hard to get past the sheer heaviness of the album. Daron and Serj's lyrics are at times very direct (""Prison Song,"" ""Deer Dance,"" and definetly ""Bounce"") and at other times quite mysterious (""Toxicity,"" ""Chop Suey""). Overall, a great album. They showed heaps of promise and their excellent but occasionally poor debut, and delivered on every sliver of it. Very highly recomended. High points on the album include ""Chop Suey!"", ""Prison Song,"" ""Aerials"", and ""Shimmy."""
1,"unbelievable system of a down can be described as a political band - much like rage against the machine. but this album, written by a band whos known to be a little crazy, writes about everything from the U.S. prison system to pogo sticks. great melodies, especially ""Chop Suey!"", theyre first single from this cd. u like ANY rock? you'll like this"
1,"COOL Awsome cd...almost evry song is worth listening to...prison song,pogo,and chop suey are all realy good."
1,"Killer Album!! This is a great album by SOAD. I've had this cd for awhile now and its great to listen to when your mad. They blend a lot of great stuff in this album. Serj's voice is amazing. He can have a raging voice full of angst one minute, and the next have a soft,beautiful voice. This is more polished than their 1st album and the lyrics have matured and gotten better. Musicly though I'm still convinced that their self-titled album was better. It was a lot heavier and explosive. Not to say that this album isn't. They bring out all the stuff on here. They mix raging metal with Serj's powerful voice, to soft, lyricly amazing songs. You can't go wrong on this cd. The best songs are Deer Dance, Chop Suey, Science, Toxicity,Prison Song, and Forest. If you liked their 1st album you'll like this one. Now get out there and buy this CD!!!"
1,i don't mind the political statement as a conservative I really liekd this cd the songs where really cool and yes they did express a liberal view of America but you can't just look at one side of an issue and System of A Down brought up some good points I loved Areals and the Prison Song
1,awsome CD!!! I love this cd. Deerdance and chop suey has to be my favorie songs on here. I dont see how anybody dosent like this band...I have all of their CDs including Steal This Album and i love them all but some people say that Steal this album [is bad]...it dosent. If you like any kind of music you should like this so get it!!! I gave this album 5 stars because it is just a great band.
1,"A Great Sophomore Album! Although I did not hear their first album, I still can tell a good album when I hear one. I first heard Chop Suey from a friend, as he was humming it. I liked it, and then heard toxicity on the radio. Then, I knew I needed this. Toxicity has a really great guitar part, accompanied with great sounding drums. And, to show their musical ability, Toxicity is written in 12/8 Time Signature."
1,"The best album i have ever heard Wow, I am speechless after hearing this album. This cd has very good lyrics and ausome riffs. it is the best."
1,"Even more amazing This album is even more amazing than the last album. If you liked ""System of a Down"" at all, pick up ""Toxicity"". All the songs here are awesome. They are both heavier and more beautiful than the songs on the last album. And all those anoying voice cracks of Serj are gone in this album. It rocks!"
1,"Best Rock Album of the Year These guys have influences out the wazoo, but they've managed to make their sound distinctly unique to their abilities and their message. With hints of Zappa, King Crimson, Tool and a gypsy caravan tambourine show, we're treated to incredibly tight song after tight song, and with the music ever-present despite the album's heavy politics. They don't treat the record as a chance to preach. They rock you out, and you wake up the next day thinking, ""Gee, why do I think funny now?""Classic album, seriously. And I'm not a rock head."
1,"The most excellent thing to come out of the metal genre This is an album of a touching and beautiful sort, while still managing to be a hardcore kick-... metal fest. These two qualities will often combine in there style with songs that protest, such as Science, and song that have a message like Chop Suey. I recommend this album to anyone and everyone because I am not a metal head and have this one in my stereo constantly."
1,"Contender for Metal Album of the Year The guys from SOAD out did themselves with this sophmore album. From the opening track Prison Song you are drawn into the ferocious mayhem and at the same time subtle beauty that only SOAD could create. This album blew me away, there is not a bad song on here and Serj's vocal range goes from soft melody to out right demonic growls. Serj shouts and screams his lyrics over soem truly awesome guitar work by Daron. This album is harder, heavier, more left-of-center politically then their first album. Rage Against the Machine dropped the ball musically speaking and SOAD has picked it up and they have ran with it. I urge all metal fans and RATM fans to go pick this masterpiece up because I know you'll be as blown away as I was."
1,"the messiah this album is the messiah. a gift to all true rock fans. system of a down are a 21st century metallica with a surpassing lyrical content to that of rage. the foursome hailing from armenia, based in the wonders of L.A have created a sound so original and astounding it is breath taking! their sound varies from nose-bleeding high tempo thrash metal to relaxing harmonic seronades between serj tankian and daron malakian. all conglomerating to create the 'perfect' rock album. songs to look out for are the two singles; chop suey! and toxicity and personal favourite psycho. this album will give you the highest adrenalin rush possible from a cd. to not purchase this cd would be a sacrilage to oneself and ones generation."
1,"Superb When I first heard the singles Aerials and Toxicity I knew I had to check this album out. I read some of the reviews on amazon and were more or less accurate to how I feel about this album. The vibrant 'Prison song' starts the show and sets you up for some serious rocking and it just flows from one song to another so easily. Technically they are brilliant Serj Tankian's voice is so unique and hauntingly changes from madness to mellow in seconds. There are, in my opinion 10 great songs on this album but one to look out for (after the favourites Chop suey,deer dance,Toxicity and Aerials) is 'Forest' the drumming and guitars are mind blowing. Buy this album!"
1,Good CD This is my second favorite SOAD album. It kicks ass! Here's a song rating:1. Prison Song 5/52. Needles 5/53. Deer Dance 5/54. Jet Pilot 5/55. X 4/56. Chop Suey! 10/57. Bounce 5/58. Forest 5/59. Atwa 4/510. Science 5/511. Shimmy 5/512. Toxicity 5/513. Psycho 5/514. Aerials 9/5Bottom line:: It's a good album
1,best DAMN cd ever made this is the heaviest cd ever I listened to it and the first words out of my mouth were this is the ...best cd ever best song is shimmy next chop suey next forest and last needles if you have every other cd you should buy this one or you'll regret it
1,"a new genre after reveiwing this cd, i discovered that system of a down not only revolutionzed modern rock....they also created a new genre. first, all the songs on the cd sound unique. each member of the band is highlighted in each and every second of each track. john dolmayan pounds on his drums and cymbals, making each fill in and beat match perfectly with the music. shavo's smooth bass creates a strong deep tone and Daron's immaculate guitar skills shine on guitar creative melodies and solo's. last but not least, serj tankian's great voice and deep lyrics contribute the finishing touches to perfect the band. i recommend to EVERYONE to buy this cd and give it a chance. you may think it is awkward at first. but soon you will learn to grow upon it and love it. system of a down's cd ""toxicity"" is truly a remarkable experience."
1,"Real good music. This CD is really , really awesome. It's not that i only like this heavy metal/rock genre. Quite frankly, i like every type of music, besides country, that is.(heh) This is a review coming a person who likes everything from Dido to Disturbed. rap, rock, whatever, i like it all. This is just a really good CD for anyone who likes any music at all and also has very good taste. Very great work from SOAD that should be enjoyed by everyone"
1,"MORE, DAMN IT, MORE!! I have't read all of the reviews out there for this album but i am sure that there cannot be much left unsaid... Speaking as someone who is fed up with the over produced offerings of so called ""Nu-metal"" i can say that this is truly a step above filled with Insane chord progressions and arpeggios and wait you can actually make out the Bass guitar part...wow...and vocals that send shivers down my spine and raise the hairs on the back of my neck. I wait with bated breath for a follow up!!"
1,"One Of My Most Listened To Albums Toxicity is one of the standout albums that i have in my music collection. When I first heard of System Of A Down, i brushed them off as a group that were cahing in on the craze that was sweeping the world, unitl my friend lent me their album. The standout tracks are Toxicity (my favourite track on the album and one of the best songs that I have ever heard), Aerials, Pogo, Needles (for comedy reasons), Chop Suey and Psycho. Toxicity is an album taht you will want to listen to over and over again without getting bored."
1,"Great Songs, Great Messages this Cd is great and has some truthful messages. i like ""Deer Dance"" its about brutal police and is a great metal song.another one is ""Prison Song"" its about how america has too many priaons and is true, treatment should be increased, and law enforcement decreased. this is a great CD from a great band, buy it today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"those wacky guys i just have to say that this album is just great, it follows well in the footsteps of the other.these guys know how to rock, pure and simple.do your self a favor and pick up this loud mess of great rock."
1,"Toxicity Towers Over the Music World Rarely does a band like System come to the forefront of the underground metal world. They have struck gold (maybe even platinum) with their sophomore album, Toxicity. The amazing creativity behind the minds of Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian are nothing short of godly. The spellbinding blend of political messages and energy-driven music gives the listener an amazing new view of the world. Really! ""Prison Song"" demonstrates as such. ""Science"", my favorite song on the album, also gives personal views and provides insight into the mind of Tankian. Though i cannot even compare it to their first album, Toxicity reigns near the top of the best metal albums ever! No lie."
1,"great cd i love this cd! i especially love Chop Suey. Recommendations for this song- Play on the bus to any field show or field tip, the results are usually reaaaallly funny. bnu 4evr."
1,"Best metal album I own!! There is one thing wrong with this album and that is it made me like their s/t effort less. Although there is no 'Sugar' on this album it is pure quality from start to finish. The only song i don't love is Jet Pilot because I think its a bit too heavy in all the wrong ways but its still a good track. Best songs for me were Chop Suey, Forest and ATWA.I reckon Serj is the main reason that SOAD are a brilliant band rather than just a good band but every member pulls their weight. In short a modern day classic."
1,"This Great Album! It was great! I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this! This is one of my favourite albums by system of a down, and now I finally have it!"
1,"Toxicity This album rules. Since the last release, ""System of a Down"", the group has been touring alot, and Terj, the lead singer, has developed greatly. All the tracks are excellent, especially Chop Suey! and Aerials. The bonus CD-Rom has some great features for any big fan."
1,"buy this album. now. that's an order Buy this album now. It is so incredibly rich sounding...like eating pure butter but in convenient music form. Smooth, mellow, strange, quirky, and at times incredibly hard...buy it now."
1,A Great Book This is a great book about the life of John Wayne. I think that any fan of his will be pleased with the way it was written. One of the best books written about his life.
1,"From a Duke Fan I bought this for my Dad for Christmas- we are both HUGE John Wayne fans, and he loooves it, and so do I. HIGHLY recommend it- must have for any and all Duke fans :)"
1,"I never wanted this Book to end This book is a must read if you have ever had a ""Best friend"" thier wild adventure will inspire you to wake up and want to live life to it's fullest! The author keeps you on your seat of excitment to see what happens next. Sisterchicks forever!"
1,"Funny - loveable - great! Robin has a lot of teen fans who are growing into young adulthood and womanhood. Its great that she has moved into fiction for an older crowd so her fans can grow with her.Sisterchicks is great and there's a website for fellow ""sisterchicks"" to meet at: http://www.sisterchicks.com"
1,Its Big. Very nice multimeter. It's on the large side but the leads are plenty long so you can do your work and see exactly whats on the display!
1,"ITS GREAT. I GOT WHAT I PAYED FOR! I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT WALGREENS AND I WAS SCEPTICAL B/C OF THE NAME BUT I GET ON YOUTUBE ALOT AND SEE PRODUCTS REVIEWS SO I DECIDED TO TRY IT. GOOD THING I DID. I WASHED MY HAIR WITH GIOVANNI TEA TREE TRIPLE TREAT AND THEN CONDITIONED WITH THIS PRODUCT,I KEPT IT ON FOR ABOUT 20 MINS IT SAYS 10 BUT I HAVE DRY HAIR SO I DECIDED TO KEEP IT ON A LITTLE LONGER. IT LEFT MY HAIR SOFT AND SMELLING WONDERFUL. I DO SUGGEST DOING ANOTHER DEEP CONDITIONER AFTERWARDS FOR DRY HAIR, BUT THE RESULTS ON MY 4B/4C HAIR WAS GREAT. THE SMELL WAS ABSOLUTLEY YUMMY AND THE PRICE IS MAJOR PLUS. TRY IT ASAP!!!!"
1,"Essential for the clueless soccer dad Our five year-old started getting into soccer and I immediately found myself over my head with even the basics of the sport. This DVD gave us a bunch of great exercises and ideas and inspiration for him. He is six now and is showing amazing ability (if you knew our family's level of athletic talent you'd understand better why I used the word ""amazing."") and I am actually a semi-qualified assistant coach."
1,"Great Resource for Parents and Their Soccer Players With no background in soccer, I was at a loss, and as a new soccer player, so was my son. I took advantage of the ""Parent Soccer Coach"" DVD as a tool for our family's mutual ""Soccer Education"". My son enjoyed watching the DVD and used it to reinforce what he was learning on his team. He also seemed to get a lot of self-affirmation from the DVD by pointing out his knowledge & skills.This DVD offers an easy & convenient way to build awareness of soccer for the entire family."
1,Very good. What you would expect from this author. Story could have moved a little faster. A good continuation in the series.
1,Victoria and Albert The story of Victoria and Albert relationship developing over the years is told so well.From first meetings to marriage and the adjustment of Albert as a man to wait for his duties to evolve overtime.It is so sad how tragic Albert's early death had on a young Quenn Victoria and for the effect of Albert's death on the rest of Victoria's reign. A True love story.
1,"Surprising ... This is not a depiction of the ins and outs of the political aspect of Queen Victoria's reign. It is a love story where balancing duty with depth of feeling, professional with personal relationship, is fully fleshed out.All actors involved deliver great performances. Great chemistry between the lead actors makes the story come alive. It was wonderful to picture the castle, which looks so cold and austere from the outside, as the home of a warm and loving and joyful family. Children gleefully running through the halls on holidays. A father playing with his children. A mother looking on with shining eyes.This movie shows the personal side to the monarchy. It was a delight to watch. I hated to see it end.Add it to your DVD library and prepare yourself for a few hours of total enjoyment."
1,"Good Stuff! Eventhough Vince Clark sucks at writing some songs on this album, it is still one of my faves. If you're a die hard Depeche Mode fan, this album is a must have."
1,awesome This is the version of Speak and Spell to own. It has great bonus tracks ( mostly b-sides of singles taken from the album ) plus the inclusion of Sometimes I Wish I Was Dead ( which Sire/Warner Brothers in the felt the need to delete from the US pressing of this album.) Great synth-pop. Silly lyrics. Total ear candy.
1,"P-R-E-Double T-Y!!! I got this album as a used record the other day just for fun, and now I expect I'm going to have to buy the CD anyway. Instantly recognizable as the work of Vince Clarke, master of the catchy pop tune and the cheesy lyric, there's not a weak point on this album. Side one has my favorite, ""New Life"" along with another single, ""Dreaming of Me"", and a few other songs you can't help but laugh along with. Side two shows shades of what is to come with a couple of tracks by Martin Gore, including my favorite DM instrumental of all time, ""Big Muff"". Even the tunes penned by Clarke are a little darker than usual on side two, including the extended mix of the smash single, ""Just Can't Get Enough""."
1,"Excellent remaster.... I couldn't ask for better sound and care for the album's restoration and re-release. If you've got the original CD edition, this remaster necessitates a repurchase. If you're a newcomer, SPEAK & SPELL is a real treat, displaying a young and perhaps naive Depeche Mode, with Vince Clarke as their main songwriter. A very memorable and trendsetting album. The bonus DVD's documentary is also first-rate."
1,"NOT A HORROR MOVIE! dont listen to any of the moron 1 star posters, they all complain that this is not a scary horror movie. thing is, this movie is not a horror movie you twats. This is more of a theological-sci/fi movie. There was nothing in this movie that disturbed me much, it was a well done movie, based on a comic book.i really liked this movie, and felt like i had to review it once i saww the streak of 1 star reviews, that could very well be all the same person."
1,the best i don;t kno why they rated it so low. it is so a good movie. even my friend thinks so. keanu reeves played very good in this movie.im gonna buy it when it comes out. i keep talking about this movie to my friends.the movie is not all that scary maybe at the beginnig when they show a girl possesed. thats like the only cary scene. i think u should buy this movie. i am.
1,"Great For HD I had seen this movie when it was first released and was impressed by the special effects. But with my endless quest to find hd movies (blue ray is taking over) I knew I had to purchase this one. And I am not disappointed. The extra features are easy to operate and the movie looks fantastic,not 3D like blue ray seems to bring out in their dvds. Hd movies are just that, it has outstanding clarity but doesn't give that fakey look that blue ray does."
1,"Good Movie I get the impression that some fans of the Hellblazer books did like approve of this film. I liked the film. It was one of of the few 2005 films that I did like. My advice for the Hellblazer fans is : if you don't like the film, then don't buy the DVD. Otherwise grow up and stop whining."
1,"one of my favorites First of all, I haven't read the comics at all, so I don't know how it matches up to those. Nonetheless, this is one of my favorite movies.It has action, drama, even a little romance plus great characters (acted well, too) and some far-out cultish creatures, symbols, and history. It's just one of those movies that is so in-depth you can really see this other world the author (of the comic) and directors have created.Definietly worth watching again and again. As for the extras, the second disk is very good, especially the part on ""Constantine Cosmology"" (I enjoyed because Constantine is related to the Hero Cycle of Joseph Campbell, if you are familiar as I am in my learning of mythology). The comic is just the first one, and not the entire series, and interesting to see."
1,Additional Info Didn't see this listed but if you put the supplimental disc in an X-box you can play the Constantine video game.
1,"Excellent analysis of Bateson, Recursion and Ecology Ecological understanding is a must for all generations. For those with the courage to think through the implications of an ecological world view and want to learn the scientific concepts which help facilitate greater understanding of natural systems, leading to (hopefully) better decisions regarding resource use, this is a great book. By tackling recursion and non-linear causation at multiple time scales and cognitive levels, Harrie-Jones helps enrich the recuriveness of population level learning. Bateson was, NO DOUBT, one of the most challenging thinkers of his generation. Struggling at all times to keep his focus on how to make nature and communication more intelligible to more people so that they would have the tools and wisdom to see the consequences of their action on both other people and the planet. Rigorous and enchanting cognitive medicine for all those working to make a better world."
1,"Spey Flyes A wonderful history of the major patterns. Colour plates with most of the patterns as well. If you want to fish the traditional spey, this si a book to have!!"
1,Pleased With Dealer This was a book for my husband who specializes in literature related to the topic. An out-of-print book and the dealer described condition accurately.
1,"Great for Manifestation If you have a Jewish/Christian path and are looking for a guide to manifesting things in your life, this is a powerful, but simple method. I experienced almost immediate results through the Psalms. If you find the Wicca and Pagan methods of manifestation too complicated or contrary to your beliefs, I highly recommend this book."
1,"More fun than a real pet! As a NeoAddict myself, I have spent many hours at neopets.com . Now with this toy, I can take a Yellow Aisha everywhere! It was so much fun playing games to collect neopoints (Neopian currency) then buying food, toys, and etc. Your pet sleeps at certain hours and eats 3 meals per day (you can adjust the time easily). You also have to moniter your pet's happiness, strength, and hunger, because if you don't take care of your pet, it might leave you! I loved this toy and to me it was better than a pet! (The Aisha Pocket Neopet is also available in blue)"
1,"Finally Some Good Music I've had this CD sitting on my shelf for months because I bought it after hearing Sick Little Suicide on a sampler. Just returned from Warped Tour and heard The Matches live. They were one of the best bands there. Beat out Fall Out Boy, All American Rejects, and the rest. When I got back I put this in my car and I've had it there since. Do youself a favor and if you like some of the new punk, get this. The band has some real talent is not just following a trend."
1,best cd I've heard in a long time I just wanted to reassure everyone that the real Black Crowes are now back! This is truly the best cd I've bought in a long time & I recommend it to all.
1,"The Black Crowes are RAW Take a seat on the old stool, and pop in this CD because it is the best rock album out right now. Mike Snowden Plays the lead guitar with such gusto that I sometimes cry when I listen to that one congregation song. Ethan skeels does wonders with his banjo, and Shawn ""MINI MAN"" Smith plays enter sandman perfectly. Gorbie on the drums couldn't have played any better on this album. If you get any album in your life, get this one. Its awesome. And of course, if you aint down with the black crowes, I got 2 words for ya"
1,"Crowes ROCK on this album!!!! I saw the Crowes live at the Aregon in Chicago before I heard the album and they cooked. I bought the album and it was like I was still at the concert. Great fans, great album. Chicago loves the Crowes. I can't wait to see them again May 8th."
1,"The Black Crowes Rock Again After a few mediocre albums, the Black Crowes have recorded their best album. Yes, even better than their excellent 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker. From the first song, ""Go Faster,"" to the epic ""Virtue and Vice,"" this album rocks like I thought the Black Crowes would never rock again. It also the absolute best kick drum sound I have ever heard - big, tight and mixed WAY up front. By Your Side gets my vote for best rock album of 1999."
1,"The Black Crowes are incredible!! One of the last great southern rock bands is back, and in a big way! By Your Side is a great cd which conveys the southern rock and roll styles that has been sorely missed for the past few years. This is true rock and roll at it's finest. If you enjoy Aerosmith or the Rolling Stones, I recommend this cd. The first single ""Kickin My Heart Around"" sums up what the Crowes are about. They might not have the most talent in the world, but they are great at what they do, rock hard! A must hear!"
1,"Do NOT listen to naysayers-this disc is FANTASTIC!! To all the 'drugged-out, post-hippie' fans of the Black Crowes..put down your doobies for a week or so and re-listen to this fabulous disc! This is by FAR their best,albeit most 'commercial' sounding release. Obviously, this is not what every fan of the band wanted from them. But if you enjoyed what they were trying to achieve on 'Shake Your Moneymaker', how can anyone deny the musical growth AND extremely catchy vibes of every single song on this masterpiece?! Please don't be put off from buying this because of the negative reviews. This is easily the Black Crowes I'd have liked to have heard way more of. Sadly-they decided to climb back into 'obscurityland'on their final disc,the somewhat lame 'Lions'. What a HUGE disappointment after this gem! Buy NOW & enjoy.."
1,"Ride The Tempest.... Very solid yet different release by the Clowns this time around. No more Joker Cards to keep you guessing what's next, just The Tempest that thankfully is way better than The Calm. Now that Mike Clark is back on the boards, the wicked ones are noticeably back at home. This one is filled with songs that are sure to make anyone's head bob."
1,"Bradt Guides are the best guides for Africa I love this book. Its got just enough really interesting history and cultural facts, written in a very readable way. The kind of book you can actually read when you have run out of novels whilst lying on a beach. Most of the write ups for the places we visited were spot on. Really helpful book."
1,"Ben Franklin It is nice to read a book about one of our founding fathers, it is truly an amazing story of Ben, I encourage you to read it."
1,"Should be mandatory reading for all students. I believe I read some of it in grade school. I've read it twice as and adult and am still inspired to be a better man.It shows what hard work, good motivesand faith in God and our fellow man can accomplish."
1,What a wonderful book Brilliant honest man. Would have been a leader in any era of civilization. We are blessed he left these words for our benefit.
1,Very good information on how to live your life!!! I find it amazing that Benjamin Franklin discovered and was the first to bring in the follow:Fire DepartmentsLibrariesOf Course Electricity from LighteningAlso he had wonderful insights in to morals and how to live our lives. I wish some of his other papers had survived. He talks about some of his writing being destroyed or taken by the British during the Revolutionary War in America.
1,"Truly a Timeless Classic This book is a must read for people of all ages. I don't know about the 'Dover Thrift Editions', I got mine at Barnes and Noble, so I suggest you check that version out. Old Ben Franklin was an amazing man, he truly was. This book is one of the best I have ever read. This is a must read for everyone! I can't believe we never read this in school! It should be a mandatory read.Anyway, please read this book and I assure you, you will enjoy this insightful, unprecedented man. I promise you will. How there are so few men of that class today!"
1,"Life changing book. Turns slacker into scholars. This book changed my life. I read it while in college and it changed my slacker attitude to that of a scholar. Franklin was a great man in his time. The reviewer ""barnesgene@aol.com from Fairfax County, Virginia"" is very wrong and a bit snobbish. He does not pretend to be the greatest writer, but Franklin utters the importance of self-knowledge and learning. From a boy to an adult his life story is a grand representation of the scholar in all of us."
1,school resource I love that I can get these older writings free for the Kindle. It makes a huge difference in our homeschooling budget.
1,"wha's the arcana imperi? franklin says he read the book George III's policy's are based on, the 'arcana imperi?' what's that about? and where do I find it?"
1,"My sponsor said to read this and the RubÃ¡iyÃ¡t of Omar KhayyÃ¡m Earl P's gone now. 38 years sober. He always related to this book and the RubÃ¡iyÃ¡t of Omar KhayyÃ¡m. I've just now got my Droid 2 and the kindle app and am reading this book. In Service and Gratitude, Earl...James A."
1,Great mind Awesome read into one of the great minds of humanity. Everyone should read this I got a lot out of it
1,Wow An amazing man who wrote this autobiography in a chatty way to his son. Fascinating and informative about a very intelligent man.
1,"Learning from a Master The joy of reading this autobiography comes from the personality of its writer, as Franklin discusses Franklin. His style is delightful and he feels present, here, now. His body has been dead for over two hundred years, but not his ideas and not his voice. The core of what he writes is strong, but his ideas and rules for living are alive and speak to the present. Before reading this book, I read a few harsh comments on both the book and Franklin. Writers said that Franklin falsely portrays himself as a fine guy and that he really wasn't so fine. I cannot believe that the writer of this autobiography was anything other than the voice that comes across the centuries. Such a strong and vital voice, such a story, such deeds, these could only come from a great man. Not a perfect man, but a great man. I enjoyed so much the library checkout that I immediately got on Amazon and ordered the book for my own library, to read and reread, learning and connecting with the author."
1,"best ever,(so far) This is so far the best book I have ever read...no where else will you get to experience a truly amazing, real life story that will push you to research more on the topics of genius men and women and their thought prosses."
1,Excellent experience! Would buy from again. Excellent experience! Book as described. Good price. Quick ship. Well packed. Would buy from again.
1,"Calm, cool, and collected LOVE IT!!! My dog has really bad separation anxiety. It was really bad the first few days that she was home. She howled all day. My neighbors told me they got this stuff for their cats, and it did the trick. I rushed to the store that day, and two days later, not even a whimper when I had to go to work. My dog is much more adjusted to me leaving and coming home."
1,"wrong item, again this is the third time I've ordered Farnam's Comfort Zone DAP refill, which I like very much. But I continue to receive CEVA DAP Refill. The Comfort Zone Product is good and we have had some great results. Been using for almost 6 months now and I would not be without it."
1,"Compact;concise. Great little book for the beginner.Portable,so you can take it with you on your nighttime prowling of the universe.Written in a manner that newbies such as myself can understand.A good companion to all my other amateur astronomy books.Inexpensive,as well.Not as comprehensive as those other books,but this is a field guide,and it serves its purpose well."
1,"Every Smokers need with Newer Cars Every Smoker should have at least one of these. New cars don't come with ash trays anymore but they seem to have plenty of cupholders. It slip easily into any cupholder, front, back, or way in the back (for mini vans) where smokers get ban to with an open window. The closing lid helps to extinguish anything not completely put out. The lid prevents spills or messes (when lid is closed) if knocked over. The unit is easy removed to move to another location plus ease of properly disposing of contents. It can be used as a ""stand-alone"" unit so you don't have to look for a place to flick your ash or put out butts. High quality materials used in its costruction and has a nice appearance."
1,"Painless chapstick for the hand It is all in the title. It is nothing more than applying chapstick to the affected area a few times a day. Yes, it may take a few weeks depending on the stage of your wart; however, the painless procedure is worth the results. Plus look at the price! cheapest stuff on the market. No Pain. No Wart. I'll take it!!!"
1,"a diamond in the rough! great stuff, and to think it's so cheap! i'm unfortunately prone to getting warts on my hands and feet. i've tried everything from store bought remedies to the full grade freezing at the doctor's. nothing worked for either the plantar or the common warts. i eventually got them burned away by laser. that was a pain! plus we're talking about maybe four a year and i don't always have a lot of pocket change to do that. a common wart on my finger was visibly gone within a week but i still used it for some time afterward to make sure the root was gone too. as for some plantar warts on my feet, i can't really comment on because i'm still in the process of removal. the plantar warts must be rooted a lot deeper, but i'm confident this stuff will do the trick. bottom line is this stuff is great! not dangerous at all. use as needed.buy it!"
1,"Really effective! I highly, highly recommend this product! It removed my wart in two weeks (with less-than-consistent usage). I recommend using the isolation method described in another review as a precaution, but I didn't notice any damage to the skin around my former wart. Also, remember to alternate treatment with airing out (if nothing else, letting the wart dry shows you how the treatment is working)."
1,"Wow I have tried the wart bandages, the liquid remover as well as the freeze off kinds(do it yourself and at the doctor's office) without any luck getting rid a couple of warts. In a desperate attempt I even took a razor blade and attempted to cut them out. I will never have to try that again. PediFix Wart Stick is amazing. I have not had any issues of redness in the area it's being applied as some of the other reviewers have stated. After using for about 2 weeks, the warts have been shrunken to roughly 1/4 of what they were. I just wish that I had tried this product sooner."
1,"I Would Like to Rate 10 Stars to This Product This product makes MAGIC!!! My daugther had a wart for more than 2 years n her hand. I used everything I could find over the counter. I brought her 4 times to her Pediatrician to freez it. Nothing worked until I bought this. The first time she used, 70% of the wart was gone. I only used 5 times and now it is 100% gone. I can't be happier and greatful w this product..."
1,"Works like a charm! It's been about a month and my wart is almost gone. It's still visible and I've scratched at it like a scab a couple times, but it definitely works. Great product!"
1,"This stuff REALLY works! I had a stubborn wart on my finger, and I tried everything to make it go away. I tried Compound W Wart Remover bandages, and though I thought my wart was completely removed, it returned a few weeks later. I found this product upon searching for wart remover, and I was desperate, so I just went ahead and tried it.Because it is a stick solid, it is easy to apply exactly where it is needed, instead of using a bandage with a pre-applied remover compound. It took only a few weeks for my wart to be completely deadened, and now you can't even tell that I used to have a terrible wart on my thumb. This product is great!!!!"
1,"Best product w/o precription Way better than most other over the counter products. 40% rather than the typical 17% salicylic acid. And in a semi-dry form which can be used later if needed unlike the liquid products that become useless after opening the container a few times. Very effective even on the stubborn issues. ""I didn't really want to write a review on this, but we all have problems from time to time, so I hope this helps."""
1,"Consistent use - dermatologist recommended My son had two plantar warts on his foot. Went to the dermatologist. She froze one, but the other was not a candidate for freezing (since it was right where he puts pressure when he walks, she doesn't freeze those types to avoid the chance of a scar, and said it could feel like he was walking on a pebble for the rest of his life if it scarred). She sent us home with a Wart Stick. Name sounded hoakey, but we used it. She said it will work, but the problem people have is not using it each and every day. We made it a routine and didn't miss but maybe 1-2 nights over three months and they are gone now. It's painless and odorless, no mess, quick, no big deal. Set it by your bed and make it a routine. You'll be happy you did. It was an interesting progression watching those gross things die. It was about $7. Saves you the expense of a doctor's visit."
1,"Succeeded Where Other Products Did Not! My dermatologist had frozen off the warts on one of my toes before, but they came back multiple times. I had tried the do-it-yourself freeze off products, too. Nothing worked long-term until I tried the wart stick. It's very important to apply the product to the wart and ONLY the wart. Getting the product on skin around the wart will lead to irritated skin...My only other advice is to apply the wart stick as directed. I used it every morning until my warts went away. They're still gone six months later!"
1,"Fast acting! I ordered a two-pack of this item since my 13 year old daughter had a wart on her finger. When I first read in the directions that it may take up to 12 weeks of use, I was thinking a trip to the doctor's office might be a quicker solution. We gave it a try anyway applying it twice a day and covering the area with a band-aid; her wart practically disappeared within 5 days. Great little product and does what it promises."
1,"Clean application, more potent than popular OTC products. I like the clean applicator of this medication, rather than the gels/liquids which tend to get gunky quickly. The only drawback is that it appears like a lip balm, so you'll want to keep it kept away safely for young ones and make mention to others who don't look closely at labels. I also like that the percentage of the active ingredient is much higher than other brands. We've only been using it a five days and we're quickly seeing the efficacy of this product."
1,"Worked, when others didn't! Edit* Sorry I wrote this while I was a little excited the first time so let me reword it.Anyways. I had tried many other products to remove a wart that was growing on my thumb in a place that was very noticeable. I couldn't even caress my fiances skin without bothering her with it's roughness. This worked when others didn't. It was funny since I had tried everything from burning the wart off to cutting it off and then burning the wound, so that the wart wouldn't come back. That was after I tried too many over the counter meds that didn't work. This worked for me an it might for you. It's awesome that the wart fell off with this product, after it had regrown back so many times in that same year!PS. I mostly used it 3-4 times a day and covered the spot with duct tape, every time.Be careful though, it looks just like chapstik. Your kids might put this in their mouth thinking it is!"
1,fun for beginners This is a really fun dvd for beginning dancers. Sarah teaches two very cute dances and her instruction is easy to follow. The section on costuming alone makes this dvd worth the price!
1,Full of life The Turkish Belly dancing is creative and warm. It is like the Arabic belly dancing but has more charm. Sarah Skinner gives you a good idea about the choregraphy and magic of this great art and style.
1,"Sultry Sarah's belly dance I really enjoyed this DVD! Sarah does a lovely job teaching two different choreographies and performing them beforehand. I met her in Dayton, OH last year and was very impressed with her dancing and personality."
1,WONDERFUL BOOK This book is great. The author makes you feel as if you are the heroine of this book. You live and breathe what she goes through. I love when an author sticks to the actually history of the era and does not make things up. Anyway this book was a great read if you like history and love real romance.
1,Better explainations... I have 3 books with PHP and MySql in the cover.Topic by topic I prefer this book's explanations because they are more in depth and more logically developed.
1,"I love this book! The author covers a great deal on commands and syntax, but the true strength of this title lies in its ability impart an understanding of the logic and numerous concepts behind PHP/MySQL development. I would most recommend this book to those individuals who are comfortable with HTML and CSS, and have at least minimal programming experience. Sharp and dedicated ""no-experience"" beginners could probably figure things out as they go along, but it would require some effort. I personally think that's a fair trade for a book that will prove itself invaluable to anyone seriously interested in learning PHP/MySQL development."
1,It's Just Perfect!!!!!!!! This book is perfect in every way. I won many singing and instrumental competition because of this book. It's chords are accurate in all of the notes. Thanks The Corrs for the book. You guys always rule!!!!!!
1,"Roots Rock Paper Scissors - A Hit! This record is a great example of what roots rock is supposed to be. There is a variety of music on this record from lap steel guitar to electric fiddle - all pleasing to the soul. This is the best of the seven records this group has produced yet. The variety, good rhythm, and sensational lyrics are what make this record great. This includes members of the Bruce Hornsby Band on vocals, organ, and saxophone. This record is excellent and is worth every penny."
1,"Human Landscapes of a Nation Nazim Hikmet's great Epic Poetry is written in simple lines that carry more than they seem. So much about a culture and its human side. Nazim Hikmet, regardless of his politic side, is a humanist that always believed in human beings and wished for the best for those who suffer. Human Landscapes is a masterpiece of his humanist side."
1,"Greay Buy I have a soft spot for any criterion collection DVDs and Breathless surely delivers. The feature film alone would be worth the price, in my opinion. But the special features and the small book with how Goddard viewed his film after its release are what made this purchase so special for me. Although the film was revolutionary for its time, the modern movie goer might be a little bored. Any student of film or the average francophile will fall in love with this piece of cinema history."
1,"DVD edition will be available soon! This is a great movie,and it was one of the movies which heralded the arrival of ""NOUVELLE VAGUE"" which used ""jump cuts""(Godard used the skill in ""A bout de souffle""),""location shooting"", ""improvised dialogue"". Moreover,he used ""long shots"",so the movie was experimental,and it is still enjoyable now. The story of the movie is still interesting,and see the final scene. I hope DVD edition which will be released on Oct 9 by a notorious studio ""Fox Lorber"" will be a great edition."
1,"Great Bible This Bible is great! Great translation and good size. It's not a pocket Bible, but it's not a giant book, either. It's more like a regular-sized softcover book. And the new chapter introductions are really nice, very informative and useful."
1,perfect This came exactly the way it was displayed and described online. Convenient for everyday study use as well as taking it out with me. Pretty on the outside and even prettier on the inside because it shows me the Word. The minimal footnotes at the bottom of each page are sufficient.
1,"Know exactly where to place your shot I have used this book on helping 1st time hunters on elk, and bison make the shot that will cleanly take the animal. It shows both external and internal views so that you can understand why and where to place your shot. A must have for new and old hunters that want that one shot one kill record."
1,Must Read For anybody who is presently hunting big game and all those who are thinking about it should make this book a must read. It really helps you to understand the anatomy of the animals you are hunting and prepares you to make more of your shots Kill Shots. Excellent reading.
1,A lot of Bang for the Buck Our play hut arrived recently and we haven't been able to get my toddler out of it! For $50 (plus shipping) this set is a BARGAIN! It is super easy to set up and break down and is versatile given the many options for setting it up (some or all of the pieces). I didn't realize the balls were included with the tent and tunnels but my daughter enjoys them most of all! Can't recoommend this item any higher- lots of bang for the buck!
1,Keeps my little one entertained This house is bigger than i thought it was going to be. it keeps my child entertained for long periods of time. this product came with a few plastic balls but not nearly enough to fill the main hut. i suggest you purchase an extra bag here or at your local wal mart. Overall i love it (not nearly as my daughter does)and i do not regret my decision in buying this product since it keeps the little one busy.
1,"wow....... very nice tent, that my twin sons always want to play hide and seek with me. they really like to go in and come out of the tent through tunnels. definitely, the ball, that come with this tent are not at all sufficient. and also, we need to be careful, with the kids who are very rash. they can easily drag it. only for the large tent, the bottom has a base. other has empty space on the base. so its not suitable for out doors. but we can use it on the grass or indoors. its suitable for both boys and girls. kids will enjoy when their friends come to play with them. but the price is definitely not resonable.. its very costly compared to other malls"
1,"Kids love it -- Spurs Imagination for hours Bought it for our 2-year-old, and our 6-year-old could hardly wait to get his hands on it. Both kids play for hours, and make up all kinds of imaginary scenarios for their tent set-ups. Very compact for putting away... especially considering how big the tents are when they are open. We expect to get many years of play out of these. Durability is still unknown, but we've had another Play-Hut toy for years, and it looks as good as new."
1,"Our 11-month Old LOVES IT!! We got this out for our 11-month-old yesterday, and he LOVES IT! He's at the age where he loves exploring and crawling everywhere, so he's fascinated with it. He also is at an age where he likes leaning on and grabbing everything, so the fact that this is so flexible and springs back so easily is a huge plus.My husband keeps saying that he's jealous that he didn't have a toy this cool when he was little. : We both highly recommend this!"
1,"My daughter loves this toy! I bought this for my daughter's first birthday and she loves it! She plays with it every day and sometimes brings other toys inside so she can use it as her own little house. While I would give this toy 5 stars because of how much she enjoys it, I have 3 caveats:1. Her older cousins played with it very roughly and were able to rip the fabric above the flaps.2. The balls DO come out of the play hut fairly easily so you will spend a lot of time picking them off the floor.3. The balls included are not sufficient so you do need to buy at least 100 more or plan not to use the balls at all. (That's what I did since I got tired of picking them up)With all that said though, I would purchase this toy again."
1,"maximize your human resources capital Martha knows whereof she speaks, she is always on the cutting edge of business and people issues. To maximize your human resources capital, buy and devour and digest this book. It puts a perspective back into the management equation that got lost somehow along the way. The adjective in the title of this book says it all: indispenable!"
1,"A refreshingly original and unique mystery thriller I didn't expect to be overwhelmed by this book, thinking it would be the typical albeit entertaining murder-mystery novel. Instead I encountered an exceedingly well written story with a warm, likeable protagonist and a plot that truly keeps you wondering until the last chapter. After reading this novel, I have since sought out and read all of Lindsey's novels. If you like a good, gory thriller, you have to read this book."
1,"Powerful, literate, disturbing work David Lindsey is one of the most underrated authors in the field today. His novels are always intelligent and interesting and most emerge from authentic FBI case histories. MERCY is not so much a routine who-dun-it mystery as an exploration of the psychology of fetishes and sex, particularly kinky sex - that is assuming one doesn't consider masochism, sadism, cross-dressing, and dominatrix luncheons slightly off.There is another story beneath the obvious one and that is the practice of such behavior within the confines of polite society. The ""victimes"" are upper-class women of a certain type - the country club, suburban, once-a-week therapist type. Lindsey has a real knack for looking at events through the eyes of the disturbed individual, again calling on his real-life experience (FBI profiling).The prose is rich and sweeping, the organization superb, the entire story always a little on edge. This is deeply disturbing novel but an important one."
1,"Great photos I bought this book as a gift for a friend, but ended up sharing it with various family before wrapping it up. It was also the hit of the party when it WAS opened. Very entertaining and a book easy to pick up and look at more than once. A hit for golfers or those who enjoy a photo with a message."
1,"Precious Moments: Timmy""s Gift This has to be my favorite Christmas story to show children at this very special time of the year. It kept all of my stuidents engaged and at the same time reinforce the true meaning of Christmas."
1,"No other product like it If you are looking for excercises on how to convey information visually, this is the book for you. The author is of course one of the best at this specific task so you are learning from the best. Don't expect to learn straight ""answers"" on how to make your graphics, this book is all about thinking about how to make them, but implementing the concepts can definitely vary in your actual work products."
1,"20Q I bought this product as an extra gift for my 6 year old granddaughter. It encourages her to read the questions, which helps improve reading skills. Not only did she enjoy playing with 20Q, but all the adults wanted to play with it too. They were amazed at how good the ball was at guessing the answer.Because of all the fun we shared with 20Q, one of the adults in our party bought one for his grandchildren."
1,"Fun for all ages! In my opinion, the best toys are those that educate as well as entertain, don't come with a lot of detachable parts that will just get lost or chewed up by the dog, and are small enough and durable enough to travel with. This meets all the criteria, and it's entertaining for adults as well as kids."
1,Fun for adults too!! When I first saw this toy I didn't think I would like it until I tried it. It is fun!! It's a good fun game for adults. It's funny the things you can come up with and most of the time this game is right!! [...]
1,"Surprisingly Perplexing...Even for Adults! Not just for the kids...this thing is smarter than you think. I keep it in my purse to play with while waiting for a table at a restaurant, or waiting anywhere, in the car, RV or at home. The only problem that we encountered was when the sun or light is shining right on it, it is hard to read the screen and sometimes the dots go out, but for the price, it can be easily ignored or replaced. We thought that we could trick it by answering ""NO"" to everything and seeing what it came up with...and it answered ""Nothing!"" That was the truth! We did not think of anything. We then tried answering ""Yes"" to every question and it answered ""Everything"". This thing is very surprisingly smart. It occasionally does not guess it correctly, but usually it is how the people are answering the questions that determine the outcome."
1,"AMAZING!!! My brother bought 20Q for my daughter for her 11th birthday. I love the fact that you actually have to read it, it's not just a brainless game. I couldn't believe it guess the things it guessed! (Not just 'bird' but 'turkey' and 'cardinal'!)It got a little creepy after it guessed all the things I was thinking of....! I actually thought it had ears! It has been stumped a couple of times though... Over all a really cool toy for $10 - I'm going to get one for my sister-in-law and her husband for Christmas - they'll love it!"
1,"Amazing little gadget! I went to a granddaughter's birthday party today with my wife. The other grandparents were there, other people as well, kids and grownups both. Someone started playing with the Q20 and it passed from one person to another. One of my grandkids thought ""toilet"" and it guessed right away correctly. This is a great little novelty item. I see that it's out of stock now at Amazon. Backorder it or snatch it up wherever you see it as a stockting stuffer."
1,"Fun! Some of the questions are rather lame. ""Does it weigh more than a pound of butter?"" It is a good timewaster though. Especially for kids on long car trips :)."
1,"Awesome Fun My whole family is fighting over this gem! Granted, 20Q misses some easy ones, and gets some really hard ones, but it is one of the funnest things I have played in a while. A must have for long trips. My only problem is that it is flimsy."
1,"Amazing! It knows almost EVERYTHING! My friend from school gave me this game because I was really interested in it. This game is so much fun! It knows everything you're thinking of even when you try your hardest to stump it. Sometimes, you do stump it, but if it is an obvious word like ""computer,"" ""lamp,"" or ""chair,"" it automatically knows! I love this game and it never gets old! Some adults like it more than kids do."
1,"This 20Q is Fantastic! Astounding! Amazing! and FUN If you are sitting at home and watching a television show you have seen 5 times before, pick up the 20Q for hours of fun instead. Whatever is on your mind this little computer guesser can figgure it out. From Lizzard to Poop it is all in here. Give in a try and you will be hooked!"
1,I'm addicted This is a great stocking stuffer. Once you start playing you won't be able to put it down until you stump 20Q!
1,"20th question, How do i get one i love this toy. i want it for Christmas.it is so fun and it has an amazing talent. i am hooked on mine now. Were is yours???"
1,"GET THIS TOY FOR EVERYONE ON YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST! I must say this is the funnest toy I have played with in a long time. My son, who is 8 got this toy and he played with it for hours. His Dad and I played with it for hours! We ended up buying the larger version for everyone on our Christmas list, both kids and adults! It takes a very simple game and turns it into hours of amusement. It is amazing! Order one now!!"
1,"Great toy for the reader As long as your child can read, this toy is terrific. It may be a battery drainer, though. The set it came with ran out very fast and we're waiting to see what happens with the new ones. I would expect that if we bought it in a retail store, but not online where, I assume, kids aren't toying with it beforehand."
1,"BRILLIANT!! Paul Kelly has produced a brilliant album in Under The Sun. It really describes life in Australia from humorous - ""Dumb Things"" to Joyous ""40 Miles To Saturday Night"" to sad ""To Her Door"". The best track on the album for my money is Bradman. Those in the States may not appreciate how much this man is revered in this country. I guess he could be compared to someone like Babe Ruth in baseball. Through his amazing feats on the cricket field, Bradman lifted the spirits of ordinary Australians during the dark days of the depression and the war years. Kelly tells a masterful story in this song. It really does justice to this monumental figure in Australian cricket. Great album - have a listen! You won't be disappointed."
1,"Fantastic stuff This is a must have CD. Pure, generic, pop-rock at its best.It is a shame that Paul Kelly is not really appreciated in this country. I have been a fan for last ten years and have most of the stuff on good old vinyl.This is strongly recommended for anyone who is willing to understand what Australia and Aussies are really about."
1,"Fun ""car"" bed This wooden ""car"" bed has been a hit with our toddler son. He hasn't had any trouble adjusting to it from a crib, and he hasn't had problems with rolling out of bed. A previous review that I read mentioned that the sides of the bed were hard and/or hurt, but this hasn't been a problem for our son up to this point. We have had the bed for about a month and have had no trouble with it."
1,"A great cd of Doris' early stuff, at a budget price... Doris Day is well featured here in this exellent 3 cd set! What a great budget price. The msuic is exeelnt and the sound quality fine. every Doris Day fan needs to own thsi, you won't find many of these songs elsewhere without having to pay over one hundred dollars for one of the bear box sets. A great Doris Days cd set!!! Full of lot's of rarities and surprises!!!"
1,"The true essence of a modern day story teller. So you want to start somewhere? Make this your first stop. Paul Kelly is the one artist all Australians will come back to. No matter where you are, or how you feel, the music is timeless. Forget the charts-with more accomplishments than any other he is up there, standing next to 'TheDon'."
1,"something special For all y'all Americans, PAul Kelly is probably an unknown. That's a pity - he's something very rare and special.It's hard to put a finger on what makes Kelly so good. His voice is distinctive sure, but its not very pretty - or strong for that matter. He play's guitar, even harmonica, but again don't expect anyhtng much other than a few open chords in his songs.It's as a songwriter that Kelly makes his mark. His songs are catchy, often instantly appealing and resonant. They sound familiar. Many remind me of my childhood through the 80's - like old friends.Tracks like ""From St Kilda to Kings Cross', 'Before too long', 'Dumb things', 'Too her door' and 'Lover never runs on time' are very special to me for this reason.Kelly dabbles in Rock, Pop, and Folk in this collection. He is convincing and honest. I saw that Kevin Bloody Wilson is outselling him at Amazon.com - that's a crime; this CD deserves so much more."
1,"Thought provoking with good ideas I have really enjoyed reading this book. It is packed full of information. For example there are sections on personality types and problem solving approaches, as well as sections on creating teams from disparate personalities and the challenges of building teams.I found this book thought provoking and a good introduction to a wealth of information on sociology issues in software development. People issues are important in team development of software, and most of us will have to work in teams for a large part of our careers. The bibiography is large, good for following up on topics of particular interest.I don't expect to use everything in the book, but will pick and choose what is appropriate in each particular situation."
1,"Terk HDTVLP Antenna It did a great job of receiving HD channels, we are 25 miles away from the towers."
1,"Night and Day! I initially purchased the Terk HDTVa antenna, and couldn't pick up a darn thing (see my review under that product). However, with this HDTVLP antenna, it's night and day. I now receive 20 stations from both Baltimore and DC broadcasts (over 50 miles away!) It did take me a number of trials to position the antenna so that I could receive all 20 stations at the same time, but I think I'm finally successful. For me, the Terk HDTVLP worked much better than the Terk HDTVa, like night and day!"
1,Trini tricks Ever try to make those recipes from home and had to start over. This is a wonderful guide to help you make those meals from St. James and others. Cannot go wrong.
1,"A fine caving book. Almost fifty years ago, two rock climbers entered a 'nice little cave' to survey it. They had never gone caving before, and wanted to try it out. Because of their efforts, that cave, Jewel Cave, is today the second longest cave in the US. This book tells the tale in a fluent, easy style that is sure to delight and enjoy. Next to 'The Longest Cave' it is possibly the most enjoyable exploration story about caving around. you will be amazed at the amount of work a small group of people was able to do, from the sometimes tortuous mapping of the cave, to the hard backbreaking labor involved in making a portion of their discovery open for public viewing, as part of Jewel Cave Natl. Monument. A large map comes with the book so you can follow them as they explore the ever expanding labyrynth. The 'Jewel Cave Adventure' is a great book for everyone, whether you are seriously interested in the undergorund or just looking for a darn good read."
1,caving in South Dakota What an adventure Jan and Herb Conn experienced! I have had the great experience of actually meeting the Conns in person and they are as delightful to visit with as they are in the book. Anyone who is into speleology should buy this book and relish the fun and science occuring through-out it.
1,"Much more than a survival story It's quite sad that someone with limited spelling and vocabulary felt the need to write three separate reviews against this book, merely changing the order of the complaint. Clearly, s/he didn't understand it. This book does not merely discuss the fact that Francie had a rough life that she managed to overcome; remember, as she and Neeley discussed the future after their mother remarried, they reminded each other how much fun it had all been along the way. Francie's struggles, analogous to the tree of the title, are what stimulated her young mind. Smith's writing so crisply describes tenement life, but she also gives Francie the credit for making crucial decisions along the way (changing schools, for example), rather than depending on others to think for her. My mother tried to get me to read this book for years, but it is not a book for young children--it took adulthood for me to truly appreciate this wonderful, heartfelt book."
1,"THIS BOOK IS MY HEART AFTER REVIEWING ALL THE GREAT COMMENTS ABOUT THE""TREE"" I FIND THAT EVERYTHING I FELT WAS ALREADY EXPRESSED A THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS. THE LOVE I FEEL FOR THIS BOOK IS IMEASURABLE. I DISCOVERED IT WHEN I WAS 10 YRS. OLD. I WAS READING A FICTION STORY IN A MAGAZINE, AND THEY MADE REFERENCE TO THAT BK. I AM A VORACIOUS READER AND AT THAT TIME I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOOKS I WOULD LIKE SO I WAS ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR TITLES OF BKS. I HADN'T HEARD BEFORE, AND RUSH TO THE LIBRARY TO CHECK IT OUT. FROM THAT MOMENT ON MY LIFE WAS NEVER THE SAME. FRANCIE TOUCHED MY HEART LIKE NO OTHER CHARACTER HAS. SADLY, THE WOMAN WHO GAVE ME THIS WONDERFUL GIFT HAS LONG BEEN DEAD. GOD BLESS YOU BETTY SMITH FOREVER AND EVER."
1,"My favorite I first read this book in the 6th grade. Even then I loved it. I am now in the 10th grade and I have read it 6 times since then. This is my most favorite book in the world. The entire plot is gut wrenching. It's a real page turner. Every time I read it I cry harder then the previous time. It is a long book, but its definatley worth the time."
1,"A very good book Well, I started another book on my ninth grade reading list after my dad picked up the book at a store in Halifax, NS. When I saw that the book was 80 years old, I was ready to go searching for the cliff notes. But I decided to go for it thinking it might not be that bad. In the beginnining the story was a bit confusing, but later it began to take shape. So I read it, it was done, went to Brooklyn and realized they had many trees."
1,Brought me to tears. I absolutly loved this book. It was so realistic and had me crying so hard by the end. Sarah
1,"My all-time favorite! I bought this book in the 5th grade and was absolutely mesmerized by it. Over the past 15 years I have read it over and over again and have appreciated it on a different level each time as I, too, have grown-up with the lead character of ""Francie"". If you have ever wanted to travel in time with your best childhood friend, this novel is one way to experience bustling Brooklyn, New York from the turn of the century through the first World War. I cannot recommend it enough and the movie truly does not do it any justice. A must-read for all ages!"
1,"""One of the best!"" This book is really touching. But for those of you who would rather rent the movie, your missing the point of reading and the plot. Read this book, you'll be sorry if you don't!"
1,"Wonderful story I hated to have it end. It was a genuine story of American life in the early 20th century, people rising out of poverty."
1,"Brilliantly Beautiful It's certainly easy to see why this book is a classic. The haunting story of Francie Nolan, a young girl living in poverty in Brooklyn, strikes a chord deep within all of us. Beautifully told, this story draws us into Francie's early-20th century life-her father's drunkenness, her mother's disillusionment with life, her deep love of books- and makes us respond with empathy. This is certainly one of those books that trascends descriptions-it is simply a book about life that has become a classic because of its enduring truths. Betty Smith's strong main character, keen and startlingly truthful observations about life, and stark descriptions make this an unforgettable read-deserving many more than five ""stars."""
1,"One of the best books ever I first read this book when I was around 13 years old, and I have read it over and over again for almost 30 more years. The story is timeless, the writing lucid, the characters unforgettable. It also takes me to a time and a life I never experienced. An absolute must-have for every bookshelf!"
1,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn: My favorite book A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which is similar to Angela's Ashes, is a great book. Not only is it very personal and emotional, but it also is a reflection on a society. At times it can be so horribley honest; the descriptions are very blunt. Through the experiences of Francie and many other characters, we get a picture of what life was at that time and place. Francie is surrounded by ignorance and poverty. Some of the scenes she witnesses are not very pleasent (for example, the women who gang up on the girl who has a baby and throw rocks at her). But through it all, Francie manages to have a good time. On the last page of the book, i wanted to cry, which says a lot because i NEVER cry in books."
1,"deelew Wow, this is an excellent example of american historical fiction. I feel as though I am seeing turn of the century Brooklyn through Francie's eyes. If you enjoy fiction with strong characters, details, and bits of history this one is for you. Love it."
1,"One of the best books ever written As I read this book, I find myself wishing that we valued education as much as the characters in the story. It's a great book, a classic, and one on ""the list"" of books that I want my kids to read when they are old enough."
1,"Not just for girls I read this book while home from school and ill in 1960. I was 12 and very certainly male. I still remember this vivid, moving, enthalling story while I have forgotten most any details from the usual 'thrillers' that I read in those days.I am not surprised to find that most of the reviewers are female. The central character is a young woman, but her coming of age and coping with the realities of the human condition are pertinent to anyone, anytime."
1,"One of the best examples of lasting American literature I juts finished reading this book for the first time, and I can tell it is going to be re-read and re-read again and again! The development of the characters and the nuances of the plot make for a brilliant novel, and because this book was originally written in memoir form, the story and characters are completely real and believable. The book unfolds slowly, but never at a boring pace. Everything that happens is fascinating, because it is just the way life really is. This is a MUST-READ for everyone! Possibly the best book I have ever read!"
1,"Excellent reading for just about anyone! ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" is my favorite book. All my friends to whom I have described the story are interested in it! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for good reading around the age of 13 or older."
1,"ABSOLUTE MUST READ This book is a foundation for all others. The author is a master - she has captured a life and preserved it forever for us with her words -- the life is not that of a stranger or just a randome little girl -- there is a piece of every American whose roots stretch back to poor immigrants. Many, many timeless quotes are seeded throughout the novel. I highly recommend this book to all readers!"
1,"Beautiful This book is so well written that you feel like you are living next door to the Nolans and sharing their life.You hope success finds this family, and smile when it does.I really enjoyed this wonderful classic, and will read it again someday."
1,"It was good. I had to read this book for my summer reading before I went to the 9th grade. I thought that it would be a drag reading it because it was so long, but I didn't really take a long finishing the book. I liked this book because it was very realistic. I could fit right in with Francie. Even though the story took place in the early 1900's, I felt that it could've took place today. I felt an instant connection with Francie once I picked up the book"
1,"Mistaken for the kind of book I usually avoid Knowing only that this book was written a long time ago and has been in print for many decades was all the information that I had. I knew it featured an urban family in 1900 NYC, and my understanding stopped there. One day Audible.com had a ""classics"" sale and I picked this up and stashed it away on my MP3 player. Eventually I listened. In short orded I double-bought this magnificent novel for my Kindle and read along as I listen. Then I shared my Kindle edition with all my friends and family, who were equally impressed. There is no stopping this book. I delivers history like no textbook ever will, and human insight, depth and drama, that no film ever could."
1,"Soul Gripping Story This is an incredibly amazing novel...which i believe is actually an autobiography of the author. In ""A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,"" the reader is taken through an incredible path of the main character, Francie Nolan's life. From the death of her father, to her assult in a dark hallway, to this amazing girl supporting herself into college, this book finely illustrates the transition from girl to woman. This story takes the reader back to a childs perspective, and also helps one to remember to take time to appreciate the smaller things in life."
1,"No question, it deserves all the accolades As a lifetime voracious reader, I'm not sure how all this time has passed without me having read this wonderful book. Any novel that can captivate me for 500 pages has got to be something extra special, and this one did. It has everything you want in a novel, great writing, superb characters, humor, sadness, joy and pain. I loved every word. There is really nothing more to be said, if you have not read this book you are truly missing out on something magical."
1,"this book reminds us of pride in self reliance I read this book for history and curiosity, I discovered our lost pride as a society in self reliance and perserverance without government or charity handouts no matter how poor. It's a lesson for all of us today, told in wonderful prose and unvarnished detail."
1,"Beautifully Written This is a beautiful book. I have loved it for 20+ years and read it more than 20 times. Every time, it is as if I become a part of Francie. She is a daughter, a niece, a younger sister, the neighbor, the friend....she is so real to me. Look beyond the poverty to the wealth, beyond the filth to the clean heart, beyond the wrongness to all that turns out right, all because of Francie's strength of character. This is a story that may be over 50 years old, but is just as new as if it were written yesterday."
1,"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn This book changed my life. Betty Smith has become my favorite author and inspired me to read regularly again. The characters will help young women to learn to accept themselves and understand their feelings. I highly recommend this book along with all of her other books, especially Joy in the Morning."
1,"The book was fantastic Although I have not finished this novel yet, I believe that it is an excellent novel for young readers. The novel describes the life of a young girl names Francie very well. I believe the novel is very hard to put down. It makes me want to keep going on. This is a great novel for anyone."
1,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn- a classic A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a classic. It's a story about a strong, brave, loving, girl growing up in the rough city of Brookly. If you're looking for a book to read, or even a summer reading book, this is a definite choice. Everyone you has read this book has liked it. The author wrote this book in a way that you can understand everything clearly. This is one book you must read!"
1,A great life story I was assigned this book for a college English class. After reading the first chapter I was hooked. I couldn't put it down. I recommended it to all of my friends. Betty Smith brought Francis and the whole family to life for me. They tugged at my heart and showed me what my greatgrandparetns may have gone through. Thus helped me to connect with relatives I never knew and better understand what their children had to endure. The srtugle and the determination is strengthening. You beleive that what ever hardship you are going through it isn't as bad and you can make it.
1,"""A Tree"" Brings Out Every Emotion When I read ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" I found that you experience all emotions in it. One time you could be sad, or one time you could be happy. One time you could be so mad that you wanted to put down the book and one time you could be proud of the characters. No matter what, ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" is a very good book for all ages."
1,Really Great!!! The book came in on time it is in really good shape and is so cool. I got it as a gift for my mother and she is going to love it.
1,"Now one of my top 100 books! I keep my favorite 100 books on a shelf next to my computer. After reading this touching, bold, honest biography, I had to bump another book to find a place on my shelf for Smith's gem. It is one of my all-time favorites. R.K. Tipton"
1,"It's reputation is well deserved. This was a surprising selection for my book club. I had seen the movie years ago and thought it okay. The book describes a period of growing up in difficult times with wonderful use of words and descriptive phrases not dated at all. This is, yet again, a case of the original book being much better than the movie! It is well worth a visit."
1,"Couldn't put it down I read ""Joy In The Morning"" as a teen, but this one just didn't make my reading list until now, in my 40s. What a great book. I had just finished reading Angela's Ashes and I'd thought, that even though the books are 60 years apart, and one was written by a man about a boy, and the other by a woman about a girl, they were quite similar.They both drew me in and held me. It's incredible to me when an author can touch on something as unpleasant as poverty but not weigh you down and depress you with it. You aren't horrified by it and unable to finish it, and you aren't gobbling it up for morbid thrills as if staring as you pass by the scene of an accident. You come to admire the characters, and dread the last page.This is one that will always be on my shelf."
1,"Barbershop Arrangements With Excellent Song Selection The Square Pegs sound great in this absolutely wonderful selection of songs, many from the 1920's (my favorite era). The group blends well together and the harmonies are not forced.I especially appreciate their version of Paul Whiteman's hit, ""Whispering."" Tea for Two and ""A Cuppa Coffee"" are superb, as is the well-loved classic, ""Lida Rose.""I do not sing barbershop, so my expertise is limited (though I attend the annual concert in my town), but as a listener I am well satisfied with this CD."
1,The best group from back in the day!!!! This is one of my favorite albums from my childhood. A real classic.
1,A great toy My two year old son loves the climber we can not get him off it he would play there all day if he could. It is easy to put together it only take around two hours.
1,Superb music for relaxation I bought this CD having previously purchased Nick Kemp's spoken word CDs. The music on this CD takes you on a deeply relaxing journey and is ideal for anyone who wants to destress or simply likes ambient trance style music!
1,"Concise and comprehensive This book is a complete study guide that fits the needs of engineers as well as those of newcomers to the field. Its most important feature is the way the author allows students with a little background in mathematics to go through all the topics presented without getting lost or discouraged. The purpose is achieved with a simple but efficient strategy: an easy to follow level is the main body of the book and a lot of examples provide the reader with all the tools necesary to grasp the basics. The higher level material (advanced mathematics) is therefore not indispensable to actually understand Image Enhancement, Image Restoration, Preparation for Automatic Vision, and a little bit of Image Compression."
1,"Just another kid All Torey Hayden`s books are fascinating. Easy reading for the layman, no fancy psychological terms. Excellent reading. What an incredible psychologist and writer. I have read every book she has written and would read any new ones."
1,"im just another kid im an adult now but i act like a kid because of my mental illness. i can relate to ladbrooke (not acohal mind u but the illness in my brain. torey helps the children and ladbrooke. she had an inicent about her. i disagree about leslie.

1,Silk Stalkings Season Four I've been a fan of this show for so many years and when I found out it was on box set I know I had to have it. I only like the seasons with Rob Estes and Mitzi Kapture and all I need now is season five but I can seem to find out when it is going to be released. I guess I will just have to wait and see!!!
1,THe best! This is the best silk season ever!! Except for them killing off the greatest guy ever! It has lots of passion and chemistry.
1,"Great! The t-shirt was perfect for when my nephew went to the hospital to see his little sister for the first time! It was soft, comfy, and adorable! The shirt was shipped and recieved very fast!!"
1,"A well-done blueprint to personal and financial success Just got the book and couldn't put it down! The combination of writing personality, practical tips and Stephanie's personal story of tragedy and triumph make this a must-have book."
1,"What a great read! Stephanie's personal story is a great read and full of tools to produce the results you want in your life and business. Stephanie tells it like it is and writes just like she speaks and, if you have met Stephanie, you know this is delightful. You really shouldn't miss this if you are searching to improve your business results. Most of all, enjoy!"
1,"Loved it Sooooooooooooooo Much! I can't believe some of the ratings I've read on this book that were Negative! This is an abosolute fantastic book, the photographs are superb, the rooms are fantastic! This is one of the best design books I have seen before. I wish that more were this colorful and diverse in its presentations! Thanks for allowing me to review this wonderful publication."
1,"Amazing movie Totally loved this movie. It was funny, sad and crazy too. Parker Poesy, Demi Moore, and Rip Torn are fabulous!"
1,"Hooray that I found this!!! [NOTE: The product listing is in error. The label should be listed as Columbia/Sony.]I have several Doris Day CD's, all of them spectacular. This one is quickly overtaking Day By Day/Day By Night (on Collectables) as my favorite. Doris cannot disappoint; there is not a dud in her entire song catalog. This CD is a ""2 on 1"" Sony import (from the UK, I think). These hi-fidelity stereophonic recordings both sound great - no gripes - they sound like they could have even been recorded yesterday! Doris sings flawlessly, as always. Even the most casual listener will enjoy these albums; for Doris fans they are required equipment.This is now out of print and hard to find. If you come across it in the used CD store, BUY IT AT ALL COSTS!!!! I came across it in a second hand CD store in Madison, WI recently for 1/5 of the current used price here at Amazon."
1,"Real guys writing about real life I love this group, saw them in England in 2005, going to see them summer of 2007! Outstanding live performance, both are gifted musicians. Miranda that sings with them now is talented as well. Their songs are about real issues and towns and villages in the West Country, but you can relate to them even if you aren't from their. I play their music in the car and house and my kids can sing along to just about every song. - sorry, but most radio station songs are all about sex and conquests, enough of that garbage. Give me 3 folk singers in a pub near Wells any day!!!"
1,"The best So far, this is my favorite post-apocalyptic series. It is truly POST the apocalypse. Ths is what I enjoy: finding out what comes next. This series is inventive and well-written. if you stick through to the end of the series you will feel great satisfaction if the post-apocalypse is something you enjoy reading about. This series has just the right balance of zombie, zombie explanation, zombie science and survival. Some authors waste too much time explaining how we got here. This book offers us just enough explanation to enjoy the story of what comes next."
1,"Functional, practical and looks nice I have tried many different ways to store my very large array of shoes and this product is the best. It holds many shoes and takes up very little space in my closet. This is actually the second time I have purchased the shoe tree as I decided I needed another one for my other closet. It is very easy to find the shoes I need as the rack revolves and displays all of the shoes nicely. One can adjust the different tiers to accommodate different styles of shoes - pumps, flats, flip flops and varying heights of heels. Easy to keep clean and the base is solid. I have tried other brands [ from Bed, Bath & Beyond] but they were flimsy and the entire tree kept falling over as the base was not solid enough, so buyers beware of these cheap imitations! I definitely recommend this product- get a few!"
1,4 tier shoe tree review wowee zowee I was a bit skeptical at first. I have had the item for about a month now. It is very sturdy. No problems at all whatsoever. I wish I would have bought two of them. My boyfriend uses it for his shoes too...and he has gigantic feet size 10.5 or 11. Perfect for little kids shoes. Only thing that wouldnt work with it would be boots. Love this product. Highly recommend it. Easy to assemble as well.
1,Great Space Saver This shoe tree is amazing. It is really built well and even with 24 pairs of shoes on it - no tipping over!!! I love shoes and this shoe tree makes them all available and in sight. You will be very happy with the selection of this shoe tree!
1,Good solution for small space This is a great solution for storing a lot of shoes in a small space. Good sturdy construction and easy to put together. It cleaned my shoe closet up big time.
1,"Great use of vertical Space It is nice to have found a 4 tier tree to stack the shoes vertically - I have lots of ladies heels and the spacing seems to be sufficient between the tiers. I don't revolve the rack that much, but when I do, it seems to be very fluid. I have it standing on carpet and it does have enough stability that I am comfortable with - no problem. I think this is a great tree that allows me to keep way too many shoes!"
1,"Great space saver I bought this to replace my over the door shoe organizer. I hated those plastic pockets holding dust and dirt, and they were causing some shoes to lose their shape. I put this shoe tree together myself in about 20 minutes. It saves floor space by organizing the shoes vertically, each tier spins, the shoes hang great without being squished inside a pocket, and the whole thing can be moved out of the way if needed. Great shoe storage option!"
1,"Perfect Not much to say, does exactly what it's supposed to and does it perfectly. Would definitely recommend this!"
1,"Intriguing Although we struggled with the Manchester accent, this didn't deter us from really, really enjoying the miniseries. The acting was great and the plot moved quickly. We spent a lot of time discussing the events and trying to unravel the whys and wherefores. That's what a good movie is all about. The character Dominic was a bit overdone because he started out as a sort of comical feature of the story but as it moved on he became a pathetic victim. The writers could have improved this aspect of the story. Bill Nighy, however, was fantastic.This is another keeper but to be lent out to friends."
1,"Another sterling BBC production Let's face it, the BBC puts American TV to absolute shame. While US TV continues to crank out a potpourri of lowest common denominator claptrap, the BBC produces quality, exciting, very well written and acted productions, such as State of Play. It's worth every penny! And while you're at it, check out The State Within too. Another fantastic effort from the BBC."
1,A well done British Whodonit Very intriguing British mystery. Thoroughly enjoyed it but I must admit I had to use English subtitles since some of the accents were pretty heavy. I recommend it.
1,"Great service Item was as described or better, arrived very quickly, professionally packed. Recommended. Great UK Mini-series!"
1,"THIS HAS IT ALL- GREAT PIECE OF WORK! Action, suspense, politics, social commentary, great writing, great characters, great acting- there's nothing to dislike here.Any recounting of the plot would spoil the pleasures of watching it all unfold for the first time. And the pleasures hold up on repeated viweings- I've watched this 4 times in the last year.I highly recommend this DVD- and though I've not seen the truncated and Americanized remake, I know it can't compare to the original. So watch this one!"
1,"One of the best This is simply one of the best shows I have seen, and I have seen quite a few. It is long but I wanted it to be even longer. Top notch stuff here!"
1,"An Orchestrational Treasure Trove Rimsky Korsakov is one of the greatest composers of Western music, but to many, just his orchestration knowledge is enough to study for a lifetime. That is the case with me. Dover scores are simply the best asset to anyone learning composition/orchestration. They may have printing errors or articulation inconsistencies, but that is ok, because you probably won't be using these scores to conduct a real concert program, I would hope. The three pieces provided in this book are masterpieces of comp and orchestration, and have endless learning potential. You have the Bach, Brahms, and Beethoven, now its time to get into the wonderful world of Rimsky Korsakov. Anyone can get something out of this score, and for the affordable price, its the best deal of them all."
1,"One of My favorite things Live the smell of this perfume, I always get lots of complements when I where it. It's hard to find in the stores and this is a great price and fast shipping."
1,Great very informative Its exactly written the way the Mr.. Ryder has i his very smal tarot book that came with my tarot cards. Large print and easy to interprit
1,"I love this hotdog cooker... I bought it for my husband and he loves it. I love it more than him though cause I like beef ball park hotdogs. I used to make my hot dogs grilled over charcole, or if I was lazy, boiled..but not anymore. This thing cooks my hot dogs plump and warms my buns in less that 5-10mins..no pun intended LOL. I recommend buying this if you like hot dogs as much as I do.Oh, not to mention the fact that you can clean this thing in as little as 3-5 mins. The turning grill comes off with a small tug to pull it up and nothing sticks to it. Also there is a tray where the fat falls which comes off much like the buttom of a toaster where the crums fall...you just pull it out and wash it with soup and hot water, dry it up and put it up...easy easy easy, I can't tell you enough how easy this thing really is :)"
1,"Excellent Amazon Seller, Fast Delivery.and Excellent Product! My wife and I were very surprised on how quickly we received this product. We love this hot dog grill and us it all the time. It is also very easy to clean. We would highly recomment this seller and this product."
1,"Expressive, touching, easy-to-read, educational My 3 year old autistic son learned to say ""I love you"" because these words are repeated on every page with a different noun; for example ""I love you, sun"" then ""I love you, sheep"". It's MY favorite children's book (and now his, too), so he heard me read these words a hundred times. BRAVO! to Ms. Pandell for having the foresight to write such a simple, fascinating, and educational book!"
1,"the real ""Gordon's Gold"" This is Gordon Lightfoot and folk music at its best.If I could only have one of Lighfoot's albums, this would be it."
1,"Good Read I bought an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher. I actually liked this one better than the first one (Ghost) which had a few hackneyed cliches. (co-eds interested in BDSM? Gasp! How shocking! NOT!) This one focused on moving the private, sheltered militia group out and about in the 'modern' world, which was fun. Plus, it addressed human trafficking, which is a good issue (and one in which Might Makes Right ... Just Makes Sense) ;) Remember, This Is Not Science Fiction, exactly. Just a teensy bit of alternative history (in the same vein as the Belisarius series, but not the same time period) along with some men's Action Adventure and perhaps the funniest part, sex scenes written by a man. (Or, at least, from the male's perspective.) All in all, a good read if you're looking for something different from average sci-fi, and you like to vicariously kick butt."
1,"4000 new ideas! I'm an avid embroiderer, always looking for the perfect design to embellish a cardigan or pillowtop. McCallum's collection offers plenty of ideas and serves as a springboard for some of my own. I imagine this would be an equally essential tool for many other types of hobbyists. This one is nice just to leaf through, too -- it's very well arranged. I'm tempted to order his other books right away, but there's plenty to work with right here."
1,"The best thing they've yet done I really love this release. Short, yes, but it is very VERY good, the one CD of theirs which I play the most.VERY recommended."
1,Great for HS Anatomy & Physiology I use this DVD as an intro to brain disorders in my high school anatomy and physiology course. It really drives home the idea that we learn more and more about the brain every day from patients who have suffered brain injuries. Interesting and the perfect length for viewing and discussion. Highly recommended.
1,AMAZING!!! I have been fighting dry cracked heels for years.Mine have gotten so bad that they crack open and feel like I'm walking on a nail with every step. I have tried tons of different creams to try to alleviate the painful cracking and this stuff works by far the best of any I have tried in the past. I use it with the Visco-GEL Heel-So-Smooth Heel Sleeves which I got on Amazon too. Together they are awesome!! Don't know if the cream works as well by itself because it works so well with the Visco-Gel sleeves I haven't tried it any other way.
1,"""Never Mind that the Water Is Poisoned!"" Well written, and realistic. Thomas is a well-meaning but rather tactless environmentalist. His brother Peter is more concerned about Thomas making a fool out of himself than trying to fix the situation. Just like in real life, there are no easy solutions but there are plenty of alibis and irrational negotiations from politicians (""If you'll just take back what you said...""). The only friend Thomas really has is the reader."
1,"Brilliant and Original, Period. I bought this album last fall and loved it, but wanted to wait a while before posting a review. Hsving listened to it countless times since then...I truly believe this is a masterpiece. The previous reviews are right on the money about how imaginatively eclectic the mix of styles is, and Tom Maxwell does a superb job of fitting the various pieces together into a unified musical statement. It's hard to conceive of an album where, for instance, the deep baritone voices of the Remember When soul singers and the playful high cabaret-style female voices sound at home together, but he makes it work here. Taken as a whole, the CD has a richness reminiscent of an extremely good soundtrack album, like a soundtrack to the best David Lynch or Coen Brothers movie never made. I wholeheartedly look forward to Tom's next release."
1,"CUTE WEREWOLF SPOOF I normally hate horror spoofs, but this movie made me laugh. The suspence is great and the plot does not get off the subject like most spoofs. This movie can be viewed by the whole family (YES, EVEN THE KIDS CAN SEE IT), because there is no nudity or bad language. Buy it today!"
1,"Reichs has a winner here As riveting as ""The Triumph and the Glory"" or ""Cryptonomicon"", Kathleen Reichs' ""Death du Jour"" takes up where Patricia Cornwell left off several books ago. The heiress to Cornwall's abandoned readers, Reichs pulls out all the stops in Death du Jour, weaving an intriguing yarn impossible not to enjoy. I loved it."
1,"it'll cool your warm heart on a summer day... just finished ""Death du jour and all i can stay is move over Cornwall, Reichs is here. what a read. read her first book ""Deja Dead, it was great but she is getting better. this is the kind of book to read on a hot day to cool down. can't wait to find out more aboutTempe and her cat, Birdie."
1,"I really enjoyed this book This is the first mystery novel I've read, an I really enjoyed it. I already got the next book to read."
1,Death Du Jour This story started off as all of Kathy Reichs do and as I got further into it the more intriguing it be came and I still could not work out who the Leader was until near the end.Again an excellent novel that I could not put down.
1,"Honest, Attentive Bookseller The product was actually in better condition than described, arrived before the promised delivery date. I will use this bookseller again."
1,"Canon Camcorder Extra Battery I love this, it is the only battery I use with my camcorder. This has helped me out a lot. If you have a canon camcorder and use it a lot, get this battery. It works great."
1,Love History Love the way the English language was made readable without destroying the historical content. You really get the idea of what really happened.
1,"Avid Reader It is one of my all time favourites. A definate keeper if you love stories about soldiers, Navy Seals etc. An interesting approach to combine the fantasy in written letters with the reality of the characters."
1,It gets more interesting..... The first episode has Akito beeing rescued on the moon (shades of episode 8) but thats not the coolest part on the tape. The best part is when we actually get to see what the Jovians look like in the second episode. And they are........HUMAN! What the heck is going on? What will he reveal? Is he different from us? AHHHHHHH! I'm confused! ADV HURRY UP AND RELEASE VOL. 8 OF NADESICO!
1,"AT LAST!!!! Asimov fan for over 30yrs., and never been able to find this book! Not only got it at a GREAT price, but was also in near-new condition! Idle thought to check for it on Amazon turned into a long-time wish fulfillment! THANX!!!"
1,"And God created the foundation series..... This must be one of the most imaginary and brilliant books ever written. Not only exciting to read, but also an excellent plot, especially for all the fans of the complete works of Asimov."
1,"A fitting end for asimov's Foundation series This book fulfilled my expectations of a grand finale for the Foundation series. I was captivated by Trevize's journey back to Earth; exploring planets that Asimov had written about in previous novels. The parallels of R. Daneel, Gaia, and God were very imaginative and intriquing. This was one of the more enjoyable Asimov novels to read."
1,"Ties Up the Foundation Story Nicely My introduction to Isaac Asimov was to read the first 5 Foundation novels. This one seemed to tie up all loose ends (unlike to culmination of Arthur C. Clarke's Rama series). All through the book I was anxious for the return to Earth, to see what really had transpired. Various characters throughout the series had said things like ""why would you want to go there, everyone knows it's radioactive?"" Well I for one refused to believe it. I loved the way that the one behind everything to do with the Foundation was not Hari Seldon as we thought but none other than Daneel. The reasons for all that he did were fascinating.My only regret is that Mr. Asimov decided to work on unnecessary pre-quels to the Foundation story rather than start a new series that takes place after this book. Perhaps some of the brilliant scifi writers that have been successful capturing Mar. Asimov's style in other Foundation and Robot spin-offs, may be able to complete the task."
1,"Cosmic Goodness! I prefer to read the work with all of its crossovers contained, but Infinity Gauntlet completely stands the test of time. Starlin created a masterpiece. he handles all of these characters with aplomb, and you can feel your heart racing as the climax is reached. The only drawback is that George Perez did not draw the entire series."
1,"best graphic novel ever.... As something of a comic book aficionado, I have to say this has always been and continues to be my favorite comic mini-series of all time. Well written, compelling and engrossing this is a must read. `nuff said!"
1,"The complexity of alternative history For many readers of the Honorverse expecting lots of swashbuckling combat, the Ram Rebellion will NOT be their cup of tea. But if you enjoy getting into the nitty-gritty of an alternative history and finding out what is REALLY happening behind the scenes and in odd, but crucial places, then the Ram Rebellion will keep you turning the pages. As Eric Flint himself has said, real history is messy. And 17th century Germany has tons of complications to make the 163x universe very messy indeed."
1,"I use this daily and it's great! I don't really like wearing my wedding/engagement rings on a daily basis. I'm always doing something with my hands, at the gym etc that the rings make me feel uncomfortable and I needlessly worry about whether the diamonds would drop off or I'd lose them.I bought this ring off Amazon.com as it was a cheap version of what my wedding band looked like. I have used this for the past 1 year and trust me, it's been through a lot. It still looks great! It's comfortable, no maintenance, low stress, negligible investment and it looks great. No one knows it's not my real wedding band!It really does serve my purpose. I would recommend this ring to anyone who would like something affordable for everyday use but doesn't come off like it came out of a 3rd grader's jewelry box. Quality product."
1,"Just as described - maybe better! I am very happy with this purchase. It is just as described - maybe better. It is a very comfortable ring, has just the right amount of sparkle, looks just like the picture, and saves me having to get my real wedding band sized for now as this one looks almost as good! Thanks!"
1,"Love this ring I like this ring. Inexpensive, but doesn't look it. Delivery was prompt. I probably should've gotten a slightly smaller size, but that's okay. Fits in with all my other shinies."
1,great product I recommend this product to whomever like to feel the cleanness and freshness on your feet. I am a very active person and I tried many products but nothing like this one. 100% recommended
1,"Smells like awesome! This stuff is great! Not only does it smell good, it feels great and lathers up nicely.Oh and it is doing wonders for my feet, which have a history of being dry n flaky and not super awesome to look at.With any luck, and the continued use of this, my feetsies shall once again see the public light of day!"
1,Squeaky clean toes Feet feel refreshed and moisturized. Cleaner feeling than soap. Toe fungus has dramatically improved. I would highly recommend this product to anyone for extremely clean feet.
1,"good product It's a good product and I don't regret buying it. I think it had a beneficial result on my son's skin. It indeed smells with specific odor, but this is not a problem for us.Thanks!"
1,"FUNGUS REMOVER I use this on my feet every time I shower. This really does work. If you are skeptical at first I suggest you buy the 6oz bottle. Once you see that it works, buy the 13.5oz bottle. This is a good purchase if you are embarrassed of showing your feet to people."
1,"Good Shampoo you can't find in most pharmacies If you get past the smell, this is a great shampoo to get rid of fungal skin problems in your hair. The smell is quite strong, but it seems to really help, so that is what is important."
1,"Another Amazing Album I just bought album a few hours ago, and have listened to it and have to say that it is great. I've been a fan of Gj for a while, and this album is beyond what I expected. I went into this album with an open mind, not looking for another ""Siberian Kiss"" or the next ""Piano"", I was listening to this as if I had never heard GlassJAw before, and I loved it. The songs on this album are wonderful, all as melodic as the can be angry, and beautifully written. I recommend this album to many people, but especially GlassJAw fans, because it's new material with a bit of EYEWTKAS blended with new emotion and matured writting skills. Go buy it, you won't be disappointed."
1,"Oh, the TEXTURE of it! I liked EYEWTKAS not for the lyrics (which I actually thought were sub-par), but for the interesting musical soundscapes the rest of the band created. This CD is even better in that sense. From the first five seconds, in which a guitar riff moves from one speaker to another, you know that you are in for a musical odyssey of heavy riffs, frantic drumming, and frequent change within songs, a journey that increasingly few bands can take you on nowadays. Probably the best description of this work would be ""Dillinger Escape Plan goes emo."" If you like complex, intense rock with frequent tempo changes, get this CD right now. The only songs I don't like are ""Cosmopolitan Bloodloss"" and ""Ape Dos Mil,"" the first two singles. Oh well, maybe they'll get some emo kids to stop listening to their other music... and get some taste."
1,"knowing you're right, won't you heal? After hearing this album for the first time, I was both stunned and blown away, not just by the music but how much glassjaw has evolved. They went from angst filled screaming desires to a more positive anger and more flow with the music. Right when this album starts, you will automatically get pulled into the music and whether you like it or not, you will be shown all the capabilites that glassjaw has. From Daryl's vocals to Larry's drumming, everything has changed but for the better. It's amazing just to hear how much Daryl's voice has changed. This album is definitely not a disappointment and I have had it in my stereo everyday since I've got it. It's impossible to put down and hopefully their next album will be the same way. Great job guys."
1,"A must get book! I have not enjoyed a book in a long time as much as I have with this one. The story is great, how the author describes everything with great detail that makes you feel as though you are there with the kid. It does start a little slow, but it gets so deep and amazing the more it you read it. The end, was a great ending to a book. I highly recommend this book to any age, but I do feel its for the younger audiance, but it'll prove a great read for anyone that likes adventure books."
1,A good book This book is really good. Oce you get past the begining you won't want to put it down. It was a survival-science fiction. I had never read anything like it before.
1,"The Transall Saga This book is not the usual Gary Paulsen book. But it is the best one of his I have ever read. It is about a boy who loves the nature, and hits the jackpot when his parents let him go backpacking across the Magruder Missile Range.He finds a mysterious blue light. When he aproaches it it transports him to another world. He struggles to get back to his parents. At first he does not think he will survive and get back to his parents. But his journeys show that he is more than skillfull to survive this world. At times he forgets what is importantand struggles to get back on track. It is a very good book about a boy and his struggle to get back to his family."
1,"Buy This Book My boyfriend gave me this book with the words, ""I read this when I was in like, 8th grade, and loved it. But don't think it's a kids book...just read it, okay?"" I was skeptical but so glad he finally coaxed me into starting. This book is GREAT. The characterization is excellent, there's a perfect amount of side characters, description of the world, action, to keep everything flowing but you're still engaged in the thing. Really, a great book; I'd recommend it especially if you have a tween boy who you want to coax into reading. The only complaint I have is the ending--the last fifty pages, at least--felt really rushed and I was conflicted over the ending. That's not to say it isn't suitable for the book, because it's a perfect ending, but it's because you're so invested... well, you'll see, because you just HAVE to read it."
1,"WINNER This book is about a boy that's on a solo camping trip. When he sees a blue light, he walks to it. Then a rattlesnake bites him,and he falls back into the light. Then he finds himself in what seems to be another time on another planet. Now he must survive and find the blue light again in a world that he has no clue about. On his quest, he lerns some shocking things about earth.When I read the Transall Saga by Gary Paulsen , I just could not put it down. I thought it was so cool. I read it in one day--that's 248 pages! If you like books that have adventure, I think you will like this book. I think this was the coolest book I ever read."
1,"The Transall Saga:school reveiw Wow!This book was excellent,I don't think there's one part I disliked.I would rate this book with 5 stars because it was outstanding how Gary Paulsen matched the characters with what they feel.I liked how Mark was able to survive in another culture ,after being transported from the desert in a blue light to another planet in another time.I really liked how Mark became a very important member(a warrior) of the Tsook.I thought it was a little weird though, how Mark fell in love with the cheif's daughter,Megaan, from the Tsook, rather then the slave that he had known from when he first got there.I was suprised at how many people turned against Mark and wanted to be the one to stop the outlander.If you like science ficton and mystery, this is the book for you."
1,"Great for a sequel First, if you have not read this book you have to read it, you are hooked from chapter 1. It would be great if Gary Paulsen wrote a sequel like brian's winter. What if the blue light never came and he had to make a life living on the new planet earth. I think a sequel to this book would be as great as the Hatchet sequels. Please send responses to this."
1,"Love James Burke Burke is one of my favorite authors, I have read everything he writes, I am now rereading some of my old favorites on Kindle and I would highly recommend this to readers who appreciate great ""visual"" writers who put you ""on the scene"", Burkes books are dark, violent, moody with great indepth character studies, unexpected plot twists, eccentric but believable personalities, and dialogue that is brilliant."
1,Heaven's Prisoners James Lee Burke is my favorite author and once again he didn't disappoint. I have read all of his work and recently traveled to New Orleans and found it like it had been described in his novels. Its like I had been there before. I consider him the best writer in his field. His character development is uncanny. He can't publish them fast enough for me.
1,"Amazing, absolutely amazing I read this book in 4 hours only getting up to use the bathroom. I recommend this book to all high action fantasy lovers who like to be pushed over the edge as subtle as a hammer blow to the cranium. It is amazing is all. The plot is original as well and will keep you turning those pages."
1,"Pat Travers. Putting it Straight Bought it many years ago on vinyl and still have it! Had to buy it it again in a more modern format.Simply one of my all time favorite albums. Pat is one of the most under rated guitar players out there. If you purchase this, you won't be sorry."
1,"Quintessential Pat Travers I recently bought this CD after listening to cassette copies that I made off the original LP for many years. After wearing out both the record and the Cassette(s) I was thrilled to see it re-released on CD. I have seen PT several times live and have always thought this was his best stuff. I played guitar in a rock band during the late seventies and Pat's tunes were a refreshing addition to our set lists. We just loved jamming on ""Gettin' Betta"", ""Life in London"", and other Pat Travers songs. He is truly one of the great all-time rockers and IMHO this is his best. Every track is great!As an aside, I have great seats to see him at our local venue here in Annapolis, MD (Ram's Head Tavern) on November 28, 2005. I will be about 20 feet from the stage and can't wait!"
1,"NEIL SADAKA SINGS HIS GREATEST HITS This is a GREAT CD, wished I had ordered two! One for home and one for the car."
1,"brings out the romantic in me These are the romantic songs I grew up with and that is why I bought this CD. If you need a ""shot"" in the romance department, one or more of these songs should do it."
1,Great product This cleaner is great at removing dirt and keeping my face smooth. Highly recommended.
1,"Basis Face Wash I love Basis Face Wash. It has a clean, fresh smell and gently cleans my face of all make-up, etc. I used to be able to find this at regular stores, but have not been able to find it for the last year or so. I was thrilled to be able to order it on-line."
1,"Great Cleanser I received a tube of this in a goody bag at a marathon, and the first time I used it I was hooked. I love the scent and how great my skin feels after I use it. - The 4 pack is a great bargain, especially since it is not the easiest product to find in stores where I live."
1,"Better than Robinson Crusoe I really liked the way the story unfolded, its voice, and how real it all seemed. Its like a very well written window opening into a different time and allowing you to see things from a different perspective. Defoe allows you to become Moll and feel what she's feeling- something you really can't get from movies.I'm surprised this book isn't more widely read. I mean with nice writing, plenty of sex, and daring characters you'd think this book would have more reviews. :)I recommend this book not only for those of you who enjoy fine writing for its own sake, but also to those who like an intriguing tale about adulteresses. A+ Defoe."
1,"Highly entertaining and addictive, Kaku shows his stuff Very interesting. Kaku is entertaining and very readable. Not too much math :( but it is a good book book for an intro to multi-dimensional physics."
1,"Great for core understandings Very good read - for the acolyte who's background is not in physics but interested in the topic, this books was great for me. Some of the supporting proof seemed a little weak, but heck, I'm not sure I'm qualified to dispute it.I'll read it again - that's the best recommendation that I can give."
1,"You don't have to be a rocket scientest to understand this. Kaku does a good job of explaining the basics of the different mechanics of modern day thoughts about quantum theroy... While this book does contain a great deal of speculation, its more like Kaku invites us all into a group of scientists and fills us in on all the ""gossip"", the speculations that are out there being proven or disproved right now. If you want a book to introduce you to quantum theroy, hyperspace, and space-time, Kaku's may just be the best one out there. And from this book it is much easier to move on to Hawking and the other big brains of therotical physics..."
1,The Problem with Physics The major problem that those who have opinions or theories on physics but no doctorates degree is that no one will listen to them. We need to stop making physics follow the equations and start making it follow the evidence. The equations can wait if you can prove that something works. This book opens the minds of all of us non-proffessors and allows us to start to think that maybe our ideas aren't so strange after all
1,"Simply the best of its kind ! For those with basic knowledge in physic, this is really what you need to start.Trust me, I've read tons of books from Paul Davies, John Gribben, Martin Rees, others ... but it's too difficult to comprehend. It covers most if not all the basic stuffs that you need to know. Not only that it was very well written, it was also structured just like any other good novel. A must have for physic lover !"
1,"Superb text! In my University years, I must confess there was any other issue in the Engineering career capable to match (in what difficult concerns) than Dynamics. I consider that this isolated discipline is the seventy per cent of the whole difficultness in the Five Years.Harry Nara was my beacon in the darkness, his polished concepts, kind presentation, fundamental exercises and that easy going conciseness and accuracy at the moment of solving ""heavy problems"" , constituted to me the friendly hand that saved me from the waters.Go for this, I still use it in my Consulting Timing ""to help"" the new students generations."
1,"My favorite collection of their songs There are several CDs out that have collections of the Chiffon songs. All of the CDs have their big hits like ""He's So Fine"" and ""One Fine Day"" and most of their medium hits like ""Up on the Bridge"". Each of the CDs also has some ""not so big hits"", which vary with the collection. I like this collection the best. All of the CDs have been digitally remastered, so the sound on all of them is better than the original records."
1,"looking for a song Many years ago Entertainment Tonight closed their show with a performance by Tiny Tim. It was a country song about lost love and regret but the one line I remember, and has me searching endlessly is, ""...but if you're going to leave me, leave me satisfied.""A little help will be appreciated."
1,"Gunfighter Ballads, just as I remember them! I have this record and was glad to see if on CD. Big Iron etc. It's Great!"
1,"My ""New Millenium"" Kids Even Love This! My 4 sisters and I constantly listened to this album (yes, vinyl!) as children, and Marty Robbins was our pretend boyfriend/handsome prince whenever we played. (We almost re-enacted ""El Paso"" fighting over who got to be Felina.) I had forgotten about it until I heard ""El Paso"" played at a local fair. My children (son age 7 and daughter age 5) were mesmerized by the song. I still remembered every word, and I ordered the CD for a road trip. My kids listened to it over and over, and I so enjoyed singing along again. Marty is truly the best country music singer/composer of all time. I bet my kids grow up and pass this along to their children."
1,"Best of the Gunfighter ballads! Marty Robbins is the original when it comes to gunfighter ballads. I listened to this on LP at my grandfather's 40 years ago; when he passed on, he left it to me. But I play the CD now.Simply outstanding."
1,raised on gunfighter ballad's my dad used to always play this album when I was a little kid in the seventies. I still really enjoy hearing these old song's.
1,"Husband this one My husband has always liked to listen to Marty Robbins, and this CD fits the bill. He doesn't usually listen to CDs, but he listens to this one."
1,not dissapointed the cd was good as new no scrathes just good clean sound.Gunfighter Ballads & Trail Songs
1,"This Masterpiece is the greatest album in Country-Western history! Marty Robbins / Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs (bonus tracks CD): In 1959, the U.S. was crazy for Westerns (Movies, Television, Toys, Clothes and Music). In that year, Marty Robbins recorded this album which not only turned out to be the greatest County-Western album of all time, it is an album that stands besides the other contenders (in Rock, Country, Folk, etc) as one of the Greatest Albums of All Time. Some of these songs Robbins wrote, while others are covers and still more are traditional. The total effect is a moving Western fantasy unequalled in its brilliance. This album is Highly Recommended.This is a Masterpiece album and it deserves a Sixth Star."
1,"Walk down memory lane I had heard El Paso on the radio, and, just had to have the whole album!! Great sound and quality..."
1,"Marty Robbins at his best WE who love the old west and Marty Robbins find it all in this album. The song are of a period long gone but you feel like you are there as this album unfolds. The extra songs are like a gift for fans who have followed Marty since his first appearance on The Grand Old Opery. I thought i knes all 0f his songs but was suprised as I listened to ""The Rose"" and other new songs on this album. It was like getting to visit with a friend who has passed away."
1,"I'd like to take a Big Iron, and use it on the talentless, commercialized, white trash trolls who call themselves ""country"" singers today: that idiot Trace Adkins and his hip-hop country rap crap, and Kenny Chesney et al- you guys aren't fit to shine Marty Robbins's boots. Marty is the real deal- great voice, talented guitarist, master lyricist. This disc has a great Western feel- my personal favorites here are ""Running Gun"" and ""The Master's Call."" Put this in your CD player and hit ""play through""- there isn't a bad song on here. If you're a fan of the ""Honky Tonk Badon-kadonk"" and other CMT video crap, you best look elsewhere. I hear Wal Mart has some good CD's by a talentless asshat named Garth Brooks."
1,"One of the Best Books Out This Year! ""Leeway Cottage"" is so good that I tried to SLOW DOWN so I wouldn't finish it too fast...but I couldn't! All the characters are so vivid and interesting and Gutcheon does a fabulous job showing us their growth and change. There was a wonderful wealth of historical information about the Danish experience in WWII that I had never read about before in such rich, if disturbing, detail.To call this novel ""great beach reading"" is to trivialize its impact and depth...but it certainly is the book to select if you want to be transported this summer."
1,"Get lost in the desert This book succeeds in taking me away from the everyday stresses of life and helping me appreciate the West's natural beauty, as well as its inherent danger. It offers a compelling story, interesting history of our country's struggles between preservation and population expansion, and thrilling prose contrasting the peacefulness and dangerous natural wonders of the West. I may actually have to read it again!"
1,I love this book- but why no Kindle version One of the greatest books written about the environment - still I do not understand why we would kill trees to print this and not have a kindle version available...
1,"The most compelling book on the Red Rock Desert ever I originally read the book in the early 1980's and continually reread it to refresh my memories of the most compelling, stark, unforgiving, beautiful, lonely, introspective, sensative, sensational and sensual landscape in the world. The author and his book are monuments, and unfortunately perhaps lone sentinels, to the passion that the red rock desert of the American Southwest inspires in the people who love it."
1,"One of the most important books of all time The American experience has given to the world two priceless things above all: the fullest development of the idea of the worth and dignity of the individual life, and love and value of wilderness for its own sake. Desert Solitaire is a monument to, and a celebration of, both. It is one of the most important books of all time, for in it is the evolution of human conciousness. I'm grateful to Ed Abbey for his book, and for his encompassing, inspiring vision of the American West."
1,"The book is as rare and precious as water in the desert... I've been there, the vast, silent desert. I thought no book could transport me back there, such an unworldly experience as it was. But I underestimated the power of Abbey's language. His muscular style, vivid descriptions, left me with pictures in my head, smells under my nose, sounds ringing in my ears. While some books make you feel like you're tackling a mountain, or headed towards a destination, Desert Solitaire successfully echoes the meditative, yet ruthless quality of the desert. His views about the protection of natural beauty are passionate and infectious. It can make you think twice or thrice about the fruitlessness of our petty, material lives. I plan to enjoy this one over and over, as I would a favorite song"
1,"One man, alone, in the land he loves In this fascinating ecological memoir/rant, Abbey takes us along during his time as a park ranger in the heart of Utah's harsh red rock landscape to expose its beauty and contradictions. While some things have changed since the book's publication in 1968, the majority of Abbey's thoughts and experiences remain timeless. A true classic of environmental nonfiction."
1,"Back in print, August 2000 Mouritz,London, has brought out a new edition of the Universal Constant in Living, F.M. Alexander's last book.Edited and annotated by Jean Fischer, whose editions of 'Man's Supreme Inheritance' and the 'Articles and Lectures' collection have raised the standard for the serious study of Alexander, this promises to be a MUST for teachers and students of the Alexander Technique.The book is a sort of footnote to the earlier books, there is some problem with sprawl. But Alexander never wrote more clearly and succinctly."
1,CD of Spanish Civil War songs Jamie O'Reilly's voice gives a heartfelt earnestness to this re-interpretation of the well known Spanish Civil War repertory. The ensemble is tight and introduces interesting rhythms to the songs. Many people have asked me how to purchase this CD but i think it is no longer available.
1,"What a great CD! This CD is really amazing. The songs are so powerful and are sung just beautifully. In response to ""A Music Fan from Israel,"" I'd just like to say that the CD's subtitle is ""Songs of the Spanish Civil War,"" not ""Songs from..."" and I'm sure that the title was not meant to be ""decieving."" ""Pasiones"" is a wonderful mix of languages and I enjoy the contrast between songs about the War and songs that were sung by the soldiers. This is a really wonderful CD."
1,"THE BEST BOOKS MAKE YOU SMILE, CRY AND READ ON! THIS BOOK KEPT ME READING RIGHT THROUGH AT ONE SITING TO THE END. I CONSIDER IT A BEST BOOK! HOPEFULLY MS KRUESI WILL DO IT AGAIN!"
1,"Excellent play rug My grandson(3 years old)loves this rug. He is big into farming and it is a wonderful place for him to set up his tractors, animals, fences etc. We have hardwood floors and this rug stays in place and does not slide around on the floor. He can roll the rug up (sort of) and put it away at the end of playtime. Farm equipment is easy to gather up because it is on the rug and not zoomed under the furniture. Colors are bright and cheerful does not show dirt and with a very active 3 year old boy that is an important feature! Would totally recommend this play rug."
1,"Generational Dirty Laundry Wow! This mesmerizing tale of South Carolina - flashing between 1966 and now is taut and disturbing and compelled me to make a new List: SLEEP? Who Needs SLEEP? Page turners - all night long.It's a ""Who Dunnit"" and a ""Why Dunnit"" and yet a well-crafted cousin to both ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""A Time to Kill."" Don't waste any more time reading these reviews. Rush your little cursor right up there to that ""Add to ShoppingCart"" button and get it now, ya hear?! Reviewed by TundraVision"
1,"Captivating! It took me two days to read this book, only because I was working and busy with my 8-year-old. The plot twists were unexpected; everytime I thought I knew what would happen next I found myself sent in another direction. The only disappointments were Brittany and Yvette: Brittany is way too young to be that articulate, and even though she was afraid of Jack she probably would not have been old enough to know to try to hide in the fireplace. It also would have been nice to see what happens to Yvette once her meds were weaned. Overall I loved the book and would definitely read more from this author."
1,"Entertaining and Informative I read this book as part of my research for a paper on the history of copyright policy. I found Vaidhyanathan to be both well-informed and a good writer. Unlike many resources on this topic, Copyrights and Copywrongs was quite interesting to read. Vaidhyanathan's book is both insightful and entertaining. If you've ever wondered how in the world something like Copyright policy could be interesting or relevant, you should pick up this book. Once you do, you'll almost certainly keep reading until you've reached the end. If you want to learn about the history of Copyright policy and how it affects you, you should definitely read this book. ..."
1,"Unicornis: on the History and Truth of the Unicorn Defanitly one of the best books That I have ever had the pleasure of inturpretting.Filled with Images of visual mastery, yet, langauge as vibrant as the origanal Unicorn Manuscript itself. Personaly, I beleve that the Prophecy states the horn is hidden some where in the rocky mountains. If at any point in time, you have any possibility of receving Unicornis: on the History and Truth of the Unicorn, I suggest you take the Oppertunity.Chris Snead"
1,"Jamie O'Reilly goes deeper Jamie O'Reilly's new cd is a complete listening pleasure for any Sunday afternoon. I found myself humming ""The Riddle Song"" and singing along to the standard ballad ""Annie Laurie"". Michael Smith's ""The Snow Queen"" excerpts and the token ""Waving to Picasso"" from their show ""Hello: Dali"" left me wanting to hear more. I could listen to Jamie sing all day. Although she bills herself as an alto on this recording, it is her crystal clear, warm high notes that tug at my heart strings everytime."
1,Fresh Prince Will I love the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and was happy to add to my collection season 5. I will look to add season 6 soon.
1,A great classic! This a wonderful classic that is worth watching during the holidays! A child and her grandfather develope a wonderful loving bond. A refreshing family movie!
1,"great kids movie! After being totally dissapointed by the Emma Bolger version of Heidi, I purchased this one. It was beautiful. Sweet, innocent, funny, even a little sad. All the characters did an excellant job. Children don't need high paced drama to be impressed. They giggled and wiggled over parts such as Heidi milking the goat, the monkeying around, and the sleigh chase near the end. And don't forget Andrew trying to milk ""Bearly"" either! I am a mother with six children. We all loved this movie. I would recomend it to anyone who wants a bit of innocent entertainment."
1,Best version of Heidi I think all young people should see this movie as it is a classic. Shirley Temple played Heidi as no other actress has been able to.
1,Great family movie Shirley Temple is great in this movie and it is a wonderful family movie about how love can warm a heart. This movie is in black and white which is good but would have been better in color.
1,"Ah, Shirley Temple! What a beautiful little story! My girls LOVED it, and I really appreciated the G rating. Definitely a must-see for the whole family!"
1,excellent Best movie ever always loved it i recommend it to others a true classic upgrade to dvd for best view
1,"Heidi This movie use to be shown at Christmas every year thats were i remember it from....its a pity they don't show it any more,I think the kids would really enjoy it."
1,Excellent Photography book This informative book about Kern County is filled with beautiful photographs of the four seasons. They are identified by season in a colorful map featured in the front of the book. This central California book should be viewed by anyone interested in the scenic beauty of California.
1,Eighteenth century epic. A captivating tale of war and love in an eighteenth century setting during the war between England and France. A charming swashbucklimg hero that continually survives impossible odds such as those Hollywood film-makers love. Have fun!
1,great show gritty realistic and severe. I wish this was the only show on T V because there is notihg lie it and it is well acted and great story line. very real.
1,awesome Ive watched this show from the beginning. This show is laugh out loud funny. You can really relate to the characters and if not you just enjoy the story.
1,Love It This is is most messed up family I have ever encountered. Entertainment to the Max. Shameless is a must see.
1,"Totally GREAT I can't wait until season two comes out on DVD. Shameless is totally different and fantastically written, directed and the actors superbly cast. If it continues with this great ensemble, it will last season after season for years."
1,"very funny This series has some really funny skits and some parts of it are really hard to take if your at all sensitive to the human condition.My wife is a social worker and had a hard time with some of the dialog, but we still recommend the show to our friends. The writing is probably some of the best on TV and the acting is truly wonderful, the whole cast makes the series real."
1,"Great show! Fun to watch! I love love love this show! The characters are so well written play out great. Nothing clean about this humor though folks, so if you are looking for a show to watch with the family, try something else."
1,"Great show! This is one of the best shows ever. It's irreverent, funny, outrageous and makes me laugh more than any show that I can remember."
1,Sweet !!! This movie is completely useless to any normal person! I lost whatever brain cells I have left watching it then couldn't find my way home from the movie theater! This is a masterpiece that would have Siskel holding 2 thumbs up from below. A must for the whole family.
1,"Incredibly Well-Written for Something so Cheesy Dude, Where's My Car? rocketed straight to the top of my 'favorite movies' list after the first time I saw it. A great fan of bad puns, one-liners, and just overall tacky, I found myself laughing my head off. What really struck me about this movie, though, was how well-written it was. There was not a single part of the movie that was not integral to the plot in one way or another, which is made all the more dumbfounding after seeing jokes like ""Dude, Llamas!"" ""Dude, those are ostriches."" <a while later> ""Stupid Llamas!!!!"" *l* If you love whimsical, cheesy, and just a little tacky, this is definitely the movie for you!"
1,"Shibby! Dude, Where's My Car first struck me as a cheap... movie that a couple of teenagers made in their spare time; that was, of course, before I watched it! Not only do Jesse and Chester make you laugh your toes off, but they also have a sweet, semi-innocent look about them. Dude, Where's My Car is like a stoner version of Dumb and Dumber and is one movie that I'm going to have to add to my collection!"
1,"Dude, Wheres My Car? Alright, this isnt the funniest movie to come out. And all the 1 star reviews, I dont bother to read. This movie was funny when I first seen it. I have the DVD. Its just REALLY stupid, and it makes it hilarious. Like when the dog was high, tell me that wasnt funny? I was rollin. This movie is funny from beggining to end trust me. Just give it a try, rent it at first to try it out. If it dont make you laugh, then you need to lighten up. Both the main actors in this movie, are known by everyone, and they can be funny. In this movie they are really stupid/funny. When they get captured by the nerds, wow, I was literally rolling, it was hilarious at how they acted. It has good stuff in this movie, just check it out. Its really worth the watch!!"
1,"The eye-popping true story of how raucous and undisciplined American journalism once was Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism is the eye-popping true story of how raucous and undisciplined American journalism once was. Feuds, partisanship, and outright lies often colored journalism of the era. Some founding fathers, such as Ben Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and Sam Adams, were leading journalists, others, such as George Washington and John Adams, passionately disdained journalists; and Thomas Jefferson was a skillful manipulator of journalists. Infamous Scribblers is divided into three sections: ""The Role of Authority"", ""The Approach of War"", and ""The Tumult of Peace"", all tracing the contentious relationship between the founding fathers and journalism throughout the birth of America. Highly recommended for American history shelves, and an absolute ""must-have"" for public and college libraries."
1,"Newspapers are still a rag ""Infamous Scribblers"" was a fantastic read. Newspapers haven't changed much since colonial times. the best part of the book was the historical facts brought up, and the infighting of politicians and printers, among themselves and with each other. It brought out things about our founding fathers that aren't in your regular history books. There is a very great likeness of events and people then and now, The one big difference today is newspapers don't attack like they did then. They didn't hold back much at all and would keep it up and not backdown. Give it a try I think you will enjoy it....Ken"
1,"They are everywhere Have read both books. Love them. I really respect the way these zombies are different. They re-animate differently and don't seem like a huge pack of rabid dogs from the beginning. The writer gives them a more human quality, and has more to talk about the morality of killing them because of it. This is not just a gash and slash blood fest. It is a zombie book, but it develops the characters very well. Will there be a 3? I hope so."
1,"give him his props Little Walter Jacobs doesn't seem to get the respect he deserves. Let's fix that right now: it says here that ""Hate to See You Go"" is one of the top five blues studio recordings...ever! First off, there's the huge, steely sound of Little Walter's harmonica, amplified (he was the first in Chicago to do so) and drenched in lonely reverb. Then comes the biting lead/rhythm guitar of Walter's pal Muddy Waters, along with primitive, powerful drumming. This is a fine set of songs, very diverse by blues standards, mostly written by Jacobs or Willie Dixon. But best of all is Walter's vocal approach: raw, primal, but controlled, full of personality. He emotes the pain of a Robert Johnson or Billie Holiday, and the aggression and power of Muddy. This is a must for anyone with even a passing interest in Chicago Blues."
1,great curtain rod rings! These work great on my curtains...they are big enough for the larger curtain rods. Look very professional.
1,"rings on the windows these are the best for hanging curtains, just open the clamp put in the curtain material, slide on the rod and the window treatments are finished,I use these rings for all my windows.quality metal, smoothly finished and well made."
1,"Grasshopper Pilot I read this book through twice. I found it to be easily read and kept my attention. I am glad that I found and read this book, because it gave me a perspective about military aviation that I knew about, but did not have the information about how effective it really was. All the fighter and bomber pilots wrote about their exploits, and little was ever said about light aircraft used in WWII. I am glad that was written to document this type of military aviation to preserve it's history and give it the respect it deserves."
1,"I've played it 5,000 times since I bought it. My favorites are May I Serve Thee and Wrap You In Love"
1,"What a masterpiece! I had only heard of Moby before this from his song ""Oil 1"" from The Saint soundtrack. One of my friends is responsible for turning me onto one of the ten best CD's of my 900+ collection. I cannot even begin to tell you how great this CD is. Usually ""GREAT"" CD's have 8 or 9 great tracks out of 12. Every single track on this album is great. Of course some stand out in my mind like the beautiful ""Porcelain"" and ""Natural Blues"", and the tropical island reminiscence of ""My Weakness."" The combination of Old Jazz samples, modern techno beats, and hauting vocals; works to perfection in creating one the the best albums of all time, OF ANY GENRE! Moby's faith seems to play a large part in creating an ethereal ambience of heaven! You don't have to be an arrogant sophisocate to like this, just a lover of music. Buy it, and if you don't like it, I will personally refund your money."
1,"Simply Genius Words can hardly express what Moby has done to music coming into a new decade. Moby has inspired thousands of people to look beyond there normal window of musical vision. Play has turned mothers, fathers, children and other cultures into eclectic music lovers. Music is suppose to move you or reflect a mood and I can tell you Moby has created a masterpeice that has touched many people, myself included. It's simplistic nature is the true genius and I can not imagine ever getting sick of it."
1,"Moby is a genious! For some strange reason, I haven't seen any bad reviews. It's nice to know people like the same kind of music as me. Moby's ""Play"" is the first album I've ever bought by the artist. If I had never seen him on MTV or Space Ghost I probably never would have bought the album. This is the second best electronnica album I've bought in a long time, right next to Norman Cook's ""Better Living Trough Chemistry""."
1,"Love ya Moby! Moby music is awesome. I pity the fool who does not like it. If you don't have it, buy it!"
1,"So far, the best CD of 1999. An amazing recording. Congratulations Moby; thank you for the moving music and for the enlightening essays."
1,"Best CD of 1999 Sadly neglected at the Grammy's, this collection of gospel-techno-ambient-soul food was the best CD of 1999. Each track is different, but all favor the unique, almost subliminal beat and subtle sampling that is Moby's trademark. Ideal for creating Spinning(R) mixes, or play the first 7 tracks straight through. This album is the benchmark from which all future ""DJ/Dance"" releases will be judged. favorite cuts ""Southside"" and ""Natural Blues"""
1,"Play it again If I would have to name top 10 songs list, about 5 of them would be in this CD. I like techno-like music which happens to be almost all the time very annoying when listened too much. Moby is something else because of his original style putting peaceful samples in tracks. Like Porcelain isn't actually quite usual for any genre of music. Overall: Best album ever and it's long, too! Not any 40 minute 10 track album but 18 tracks and length over an hour. It's unfair to hope better album from him, but I still hope that his next would be even better (if possible)"
1,"A spur of the moment purchase, but what an album! When I moved up to university I was listening to the singles charts on the radio, and ""Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?"" charted at number 16 (in the UK) and I thought ""wow!""! It really captured the mood I was in during that period.Few months later, I heard ""Natural Blues"", followed by ""Porcelain"".Whilst shopping, I thought I should take a chance and buy this album and it was a chance well taken.There is an interesting mixture of songs, (When I heard ""Honey"" for the first time I laughed, as I didn't know what to expect!), with the atmospheric, relaxing songs near the end of the 18 track album."
1,"It was all good. Full of excitement and ready to jam. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. Oh yeah, it was all good."
1,"amazing work of music i bought this cd used, just a few weeks after it came out (i guess someone didn't like it, their loss). i hadn't heard much of moby's stuff other than his dance-y material but this was a welcome surprise. it's musical beauty permeates your soul and fills one with goodness (i know that sounds cheesy). moby does a wonderful job with the voice samples he uses and his mellow, slow instrumentals are his best yet (i favor track 14, everloving)."
1,"If God wrote pop One moment Moby seems to distill the wisdom of the ages, the next moment the music exists for the sheer joy of being. Elegantly balanced, superbly crafted. Want a soundtrack for your life? You could do no better than this work."
1,"truly superb mix of eclectic sounds I won't bore you with the same ecstatic praise as all the other fans of this album. One recommendation, though. Listen to track 14 with headphones. Loud, of course."
1,"Moby's lastest is awesome! This is one of my favorite electronic albums. I rate it up there with Basement Jaxx ""Remedy"", Daft Punk, Prodigy's first 2 albums, Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld, DJ Shadow, ect. Its a good album with alot of variety. Songs like ""Porcelien"", ""My Weakness"", are the best, but every song is great! I love this album, and I'm looking forward to furture Moby releases."
1,"Improvement on a great product Purchased this lamp as a replacement for one that died after 8+ years of daily use. Even though the old one died (had to do with the lighting up when opening mechanism breaking) few lights compare for bright light on a compact footprint. And with the new swivel base in this model, it is even better!"
1,"Fantastic This light is in use as I type...I love it's compact design, great light and easy on and off with closing it down. Would definitely recommend this one!!"
1,"WON'T YOU MISS ME ? WE SURE WILL SIMPLY PUT, AMUST HAVE FOR ALL FLOYD FANS, WHO WANT TO GET THE EARLY FLOYD HISTORY FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP THEMSELVES."
1,"Syd Barrett, RIP Syd Barrett will be greatly missed. His whimsical songwriting style was unique and greatly influenced many famous musicians like David Bowie. This dvd is an essential purchase for those wishing to know about a genuis."
1,Substantial AWOS was the first fiction novel that I read that I fell in love with the character. Emma Harte is a terrific heroine. One for the ages. I read it over 20 years ago and I have never found a novel to compare. It's not the easiest book to read and I often had to pick up a dictionary to search for a word. Nevertheless it is a wonderful rags to riches tale. I will never forget this book.
1,"I'm a non-reader and couldn't put this book down. I watch more TV than I read, but Barbara Taylor Bradford has changed my thinking. I specifically am searching for her books now, because ""A Woman of Substance"" really grabbed me.I laughed and I cried and I was really shocked. When I got near the end of the book, I did not want the story to end.I could really feel the friendships with Emma and Blackie. They were always there for eachother through everything. They're relationship moved me.And the book was very inspiring for me as a woman. She didn't wimp out and kept fighting for what she wanted and what she earned."
1,Excellent Prompt Delivery. Correct parts. You can't do business with a better company. Hats off! I will definitely buy more products from this company.
1,Works fine This unit works as advertised. It was easy to install. I had to buy a 4 pin molex to SATA adapter because the 3 SATA connectors supplied would not reach all my drives. It runs very quite.It is worth the money.
1,CASTRO 'S MUSIC IS ANOTHER MODERN BLUES SIGN POST. THIS RIGHT AS RAIN ALBUM IS ALL GOOD. CASTRO'S GUITAR PLAYING IS TOP SHELF. LIKE HIS OTHER ALBUM THIS MUSIC WILL OPEN ALOT OF YOUNG MUSIC LISTENERS EYES AND EARS TO THE BLUES. THIS ALBUM SHOWS WHERE BLUES WILL BE GOING IN 2K.
1,"A foot-tappin, hand snappin, air guitar'n good time Tommy Castro takes a pinch of R&B, adds a jigger of motown, stirs in some soul and cools things off with some icy guitar riffs. He gets the foot tapping and lifts the spirits with his ever-improving ability to get into the right groove."
1,plantronics Bluetooth 665 charger This charger is great for times when you don't have access to your computer. I would highly recommend it for those who travel frequently.
1,Plantronics Charger Great product; does the job. Inexpensive. Great shipping. Would order from this vendor again.
1,"Hilarious! Love this movie...there are so many scenes of which I can relate to at my job. Funny Funny, you are guaranteed to laugh."
1,"Classic Office Space has quickly become one of those cult classics. I cannot remember this movie even hitting theaters and I saw it after it was recommended by a friend. I immediately went out and bought it after watching it once. It is one of those movies that has classic lines and characters that you'll be quoting and referring too often. Personally, I would rank this as one of the 10 funniest comedies I've ever seen."
1,Great movie great blue ray Office space is a classic movie for your typical cubical worker. I have the DVD version and it looks kind of pix-elated on some screens in certain scenes. I haven't noticed it on my LCD screen with his blue ray version so I am a happy camper.
1,"A very good movie....... When this movie came out to rent I new I had to rent it because I had not been able to see it at the theater.The poblem was it was checked out and video store usally has like 10 videos of a new release,so I knew it Had to be good.When I finally got to see it I thought it was so funny that Ikept rewinding it just see the parts I missed! I'm going to get this DVD today.If your looking for a great laugh,Rent this,See this,Buy this"
1,"A must for any one who has ever worked in a cubicle! This movie is a classic. Mike Judge, the man who brought the world ""Beavis and Butthead,"" surprizingly brings us an increadibly clever, fun, and a ""God I wish I could do that"" movie. Every one who has ever worked in an office will see this movie as the gospell. People can associate with every character in the film. Ron Livingston, also a bit part in ""Swingers"" was a wonderful lead. He plays the ""stand up and fight the man"" role to perfection. Well done, fun, and a must have in any DVD collection. Well worth the money, and something you'll watch over and over and laugh each time."
1,"Yeah, we're going to need you to come in on Sunday! This is an absolute must own dvd. Some of the reviewers here have made it very clear why you should have this dvd in your collection. A top 10 comedy of all time!"
1,"Hilarious movie I love this movie. It was on Comedy Central a few times a week one summer and I watched it every time it was on.Like Dilbert, it has something any office worker can relate to but will still be funny regardless of where you work"
1,"Whaats happening? Yeaah, that would be great Outstanding. And I don't enjoy other works of Mike Judge like Beavis and Butthead. This movie provides a much more subtle context for its humor. The facial expressions and interaction between co-workers are unconventioal and hilarious. See this with friends and the quotes will flow for weeks."
1,"Brilliant There are two types of people who will fail to understand the brilliance of this movie: 1. The clueless 2. Those who are not experienced with American pop culture and all of its inane qualities.That said, you don't have to have experience working in an office to enjoy this movie. For me, it has a universal message in that most of what we do is not at all pleasant. To survive, you have to find stuff that amuses you (such as this movie). A must own DVD."
1,"For anyone who ever worked and hated their job! This movie take place in a office .The company is a Silcon Valley type operation.For some of the worker , it means possible lay offs,more work for others and some even get promoted.We see this movie though the workers as they toil for the boss(played the Brady Bunch's Gary Cole).The workers conspire on a way to get rich off their employer's accounts. The movie shows us what also happens at a restuarant when Jennifer Aniston works.One of the employees falls in love with her.Eventually the workers must find a way to return the money back to their boss.The ending was kinda what I expected with the employee who off in some dark corner finding something he was after the whole time! paychecks! Office Space is rated R for swearing(in speaking and soundtrack)nudity and violence towards office machines (especially printers! )See this movie even if you do not work in an office! any one who works (and who does not) can relate to this movie!"
1,"So So Funny This movie is hilarious. I recently gave it as a gift to a colleague and it was a huge hit. If you're looking for a gift for a co-worker who has any sense of humor at all, you cannot go wrong with this movie. Pairing it with the red Swingline stapler would be a great gift! :)"
1,Remember the memo An awesomely absurd movie on the trials and trivialization of being a programmer in a large corporation. I highly recommend it. Just don't touch my red stapler.
1,A Classic Comedy! This film is a classic comedy. It has a lot of subtle funny moments that make you laugh really hard. Peter's calm demeanor make for a great character that is just fed up with his life and doesnt really care anymore. Anyone who works or has worked in an office knows exactly what its like to be in his shoes along with the rest of the cast of characters. It's a classic comedy because it's so real and true to everyday life that people can relate to the movie and find solace in the film. It's all the things people in his situation wish they could do but never really could sacrifice there career for.
1,"cult classic The ability of almost anybody to relate to this movie help elevate this movie to a cult classic. Upon the release of this movie, Twentieth Century Fox spent almost no money for promotion. In spite of this through word of mouth it has become an unbelievable success. Dealing with issues that almost anyone to relate to, relationships, dim-witted bosses, unruly electronics, frustration with the redundancy of bureaucracy, etc. has helped elevate this film to a cult classic. This is one of the few movies that can be watched and enjoyed over and over again. Save yourself the money of repeatedly renting it and the aggravation of waiting for it to appear on network or cable television and add it to your dvd collection."
1,A classic now looks better than ever I had the DVD edition of this and I can say the Blu-ray looks amazing compared to the DVD copy. The menus are not quite up to par with newer Blu-ray menus but the bonus features and commentary are great.
1,"It's funny cause it's true! I haven't been in the work force for too long, but there's so much in this movie that i relate to. The sick thing is that so many of the gags are so dead-on to reality; you don't know if you should laugh or cry. If you work in an office (unfortunately) you will know all the characters in this movie. My last boss definitely had a good dose of Lumberg in him. All of the main characters are solidly funny, and it doesn't hurt to have Jennifer Aniston as the love interest. There's a moderate amount of harsh language and a naked girl on a TV for about 2 seconds, but nothing gross or in exceptional bad taste. Final Note: It might help to see ""Superman III"" before you watch."
1,"One of the best comedies ever! As the title says, I can watch this one again and again (there is hardly a movie I'll watch repeats save for few exceptions like Office Space)."
1,"Great Movie - Instant Classic This is one that EVERY potential office manager should be forced to watch. You will find yourself saying ""I know that guy"" with every scene. Really great, hillarious, definate Calssic right off the bat!"
1,"One of my 2 Favorite Comedies Ever The other being ""Better Off Dead"". It's witty, it's hilarious, and appeals to the GEN-X group."
1,"Ummmmmm, yeaaaaa....... Yeaaaaaa, I'm gonna need you to use the TPS report from now on....I really wasn't interested in watching this movie when my husband brought it home, but it is now one of my favorites! It's a cult gathering, and the minute you say those two little words ""ummmm, yeaaaa"" if you've seen this movie, you know EXACTLY what the person is talking about! I love Jennifer Aniston in Friends, but this is one of her better parts. It's small, but it just fits her. GREAT movie and recommend it to ANYONE who loves comedy."
1,"It's all about the memo This DVD is a must for anyone who has ever worked a technical job or in any company that subjected its employees to the now ubiquitous ""cubicle farm.""!"
1,"This is my life Excellent movie! I've rented it 2 weekends in a row now, buying it today...absolutely hilarious. The cast is perfect. Anyone who has worked in this enviorment can relate completely...you'll think it's your life on camera. With my company downsizing at the moment, this movie couldn't have come at a better time...life truly is to short to put up with the BS of the corporate world...This movie is just what I needed to finally make the decision to leave! WOOHOO!"
1,Hilarious I recomend this movie to anyone with a good sense of humor at first I laughed so hard I was crying. It might be a little unacceptable for young children but I give this one 2 thumbs up.!
1,"Comedy Classic Great humor always has elements of the truth. This movie is a cult classic. Watch it and you'll identify some of the characters from your own office experience. Let's face it, for the most part work [stinks] and Office Space does a great job of poking fun at all the reasons why. I especilly identitified with the themes surrounding the printer. I hate printers and copy machines with a passion. I loved the part where they take a baseball bat to the evil machine. And then there's the boss, Lundbergh - we've all worked for someone that smug and sleazy at one point or another. They you've got the crazy co-workers whom you're sure are certifiably insane. This movie hits the nail on the head in so many places! Buy it and laugh!"
1,"One of the funniest movie's ever I was sitting home bored one day when I happened to catch this movie on cable. I couldn't believe this gem was overlooked in theatrical release. Talk about hilarious. After watching this movie I went out and bought it. It's that funny. Being a person who worked in a situation similar to the one our main character, Peter Gibbons, worked in I could totally relate to this movie. Made me laugh and laugh. All the characters are funny. Great comedy."
1,It was histerical I was on the floor I was laughing so hard. You can relate it to your work as well with the jams with paper to dorky co workers and annoying boses
1,"Office Space Movie My favorite comedy of all time. I went to get my DVD out of my original DVD case and the DVD was missing, my roomate probably stole it among other things.So I decided I had to have it again. Today anytime I purchase new DVDs they are usually Blue Ray, yes even comedies."
1,"What would I do with a million dollars? Absolutely nothing.. Office Space could very well be the funniest movie ever made. Yes, that's a bold statement, but watch this movie, and you'll most likely agree! Is this movie only for those who have worked in an office environment? No, but those who have will get the most out of it.It's really hard to find many faults with this movie. The characters are developed well, Mike Judge (Beavis and Butthead, King of the Hill) did a great job in directing his first live action film, and the story is amusing and easy to relate to.By the time you see this movie 5 or 6 times (beleive me, you will) you'll be reciting all of the funniest lines Monday morning at work. (There are more than enough to last for weeks) And that brings me to my next point. If you really dislike your job, watch this movie after an exceptionally bad day. You'll feel so much better afterwards! Just don't try any of the things that go on in this movie at work. You'll be fired for sure!"
1,"Yay! This is a surprisingly pleasing movie, whether you work or are too young to get a job. The film makes fun of work, all sorts. From Cubicles, to peppy waiters, to the wonderful ""ehs"" of construction workers.Ron Livingston plays a man who is tired of his job. After getting hypnotized, he quits caring about his job, and gets his friends to go in on a scheme with him to get rich by stealing bit by bit from the company. But, when one of his accomplices screws up and too much money is taken out, they have to worry about what they'll do to cover up to keep from getting put into a federal prison.The only problem I have with this movie is that its content got a little too needlessly mature for me. This film could have been just as good without all the cussing. But that's just one problem with an otherwise REALLY funny film."
1,"great movie So funny; and it gets funnier each time you view it. Goofy plot, but has lots of ties to the reality of the workplace."
1,"Mother NIght All I can say is, this book changed my life. I read it in the mid 70's, and have never forgotten it's message: You are who you pretend to be. So, you had better be very careful who you pretend to be."
1,"Mother Night Vonnegut is tied as my favorite author along with Philip k Dick, however that doesn't mean I have loved all his books. But I must place this one under the ""love"" column. It has Vonnegut's trademark sarcasm and satiric voice going in full force along with his mastery of subtle humor. I would strongly recommend reading this book along with others of his; more specifically Breakfast of Champions, Cat's Cradle, and Slaughterhouse Five."
1,At his best!! Mother Night is Slaughterhouse Five without time travel nor aliens. It's hysterical and puzzling. A great book for any fan of Kurt Vonnegut.
1,"Vintage Vonnegut and much, much more! In Mother Night, Kurt Vonnegut gives perhaps the most humerous(but still respectful) view of the Holocaust and Nazism ever thought up. As he always does, Vonnegut pushes the envelope of what is acceptable and while doing that makes us ponder if we're acceptable. WOW! I haven't yet seen the movie, but I can't wait. Even Hollywood couldn't screw up this astounding peace of literature."
1,Brilliant. A brilliant book that examines the evil that humans are so easily capable of doing to their fellow humans. This book is a very fast read but it is worth it. Highly recommended.
1,"Everything one would want. This is not a classic KV book in the sense that there is no science fiction element, but everything else one has come to expect from KV can be found. Even in such a serious book Vonnegut finds a way to add his dark humor without disrespecting his message. And as usual Vonnegut offers an original perspective on a topic that is commonly used. Any Vonnegut lover should make sure that this book gets entered into their library. This may not be Vonnegut's best (my opinion it is Cats Cradle) but it is still an incredible read. My only problem is the same problem with most of his books; they are too short. It always feels like he has so much else to say, but I guess we cannot get greedy. This is a book for everybody."
1,I love this book I can't put it down!!!!!!!! This book was terrfic! It's about a guy named Jackson who sees this monster killing someone on the way to his aunts. Then the aunt starts to search for this monster. Then the aunt gets bitten and its all up to Jackson to risk his life to find this monster. But the bite on the aunt gets worse and the monster starts to control the aunts mind and she's going crazy! Read this book its great!!!!!!!!!
1,"Spine tingling suspense on every page! AN Incredible book! Doom Stone keps you wondering what will happen on the next page. Not reccomended for younger childern, It even kept me listneing for that eerie ticking sound."
1,"Doom Stone I give this excting book a 5 star rating.The book starts out as a normal trip to visit our Aunt, but then picks up as Jackson sees something at Stone Hinge. His aunt fills him in on the beast and why the army wanted her to look for this beast. They get a call that the beast is on the move. They take off in a helocopter and they are atacked. His aunt goes crazy in the hospital. Jackson finds out something that might help kill the beast but does not know where to find the Doom Stone. Will Jackson Find the the the Domm Stone? Read this amazing book and you will find out."
1,"John Steinbeck - great author - one of the classic writers of America The Short Novels of John Steinbeck includes some noteworthy books, like the Red Pony and Of Mice and Men. Steinbeck wanders around a lot when he weaves his descriptive tales. After awhile, reading Canary Row, which is included in this digital collection, I've come to the conclusion that he really likes to wander a LOT and develop his characters, and sometimes seems to lack direction in his story as a whole, but perhaps that's the point. Anyway, a great collection of classics by one of the more famous of American writers."
1,very addicting game it is a great game which in many ways feels like a metal gear solid meets resident evil 4 arcade stealth shooter and is very fun and hard to put down once you start playing
1,"It's a cross of Metal Gear, Syphon Filter and Mission:Imp. If you're a fan of Metal Gear Solid, Syphon Filter, GoldenEye 007, or Mission Impossible you'll love this game. This game has an excellent multiplayer, an even better story with one of the best plots ever and is plain out fun. If you buy one shooter this year by WinBack."
1,"Watch out Goldeneye, you've got a good rival. This game is the best spy game in a long time. In Goldeneye, the enemies just stand there and shoot at you hoping to hit you. Not in Winback. The Terrorists will wait for you to show your head and then blow you away. And, Goldeneye's dudes will shoot at you if they see you or not. Winback's will wait until they see you. Winback: Covert Operations offers an exellent training program to teach you all you need to know how to do in the game. The ""Crying Lyons""(the terrorists) show some artificial intellegence. Winback's multiplayer mode isn't as great, but offers more ways to challenge one another. Overall, if you were to buy Winback or Goldeneye, go for Winback. Goldeneye is horrible compared to Winback."
1,Great and fun This game has mild vilonce but no blood it is about a retired swat guy destroying a terorist ware house. Its Wonderful!
1,"Fun well worth the money buy it! This is a extremely fun game it is hard though on your first time playing it. It took me and my friend a couple of days to beat the first level.it has a lot of sercrets to unlock such as sudden death mode,trial,max power however you do not need cheats! to access these modes I beat the game on hard and got all of them.The multiplayer aspect needs some serious work(larger levels,with more detail),but after just beating the game you can use all of the bosses in multiplayer mostly its a good game and could probalbly hold its own at a arcade its well worth the money!"
1,"Great book for teaching how to deal with feelings This is an old book, but the information in it is timeless. A boy about 10 relates short common situations and events that happen to him and how he felt. Then on the next page is a brief paragraph on how he dealt with the situation and how that impacted his feelings. Great for teaching children about thoughts and feelings that go with problems and how to handle them."
1,The definitive narrative of Lincoln's army The premiere work from the War Between the States' best author. I've read nearly all of Bruce Catton's Civil War work and this one is the best--buy it and read it again and again.
1,"Spectacular film, beautiful cinematography This film is AMAZING. Its now on my top ten list of the best films ever made.Great character development, and full of irony.It makes viewers realize how trivial and unimportant ""things"" are. It also makes me sick of American culture, because simplicity is not an acceptable part of life here. I gained a greater appreciation of what I have and that I don't need more. I love movies that make me think!"
1,"Nowhere in Africa It's a special form of torture to watch DVDs that feature Africa's natural beauty when you live in China. The typical movie about what the Nazis did to the Jews doesn't make me feel a damn thing. They're so heavy-handed that all I come away with is blunt force trauma. This one's different. A family ran like hell to Kenya or Nairobi or some damn place in Africa so isolated that it doesn't even matter what we call it. Think of all the obvious themes you can. Then stretch your imagination and come up with a few more. All are covered here, with a subtle hand, and you feel it. Powerfully. You're moved. You cringe over here and laugh over there, and in this other place you just get kinda disgusted with some people. Autobiographical, and it deserves its Oscar and its other awards."
1,Beautiful Cinematography; Beautiful Story This is yet another movie that I've had on my list for years and finally rented (gotta love [...] deals) and I'm so glad I did. I can't wait to read the book too. I had no idea that during WWII some Jews escaped to Africa. This movie follows one family's struggles surviving and acclimating to live in Africa. Phenomenal work. Yet another example of why most foreign films are quite a bit better than ours lately.
1,"The Perfect Paula Performance I was so excitted to find this on DVD, I grew up #1 FANS OF Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul. They were very popular at the same time but Paula was never able to capture the audience of the mid 90's with her follow up to Spellbound, ""Head Over Heals"", instead Janet took over. I think it's a shame we lost her as a recording artist and performer. I remember seeing Paula for the first time in December of 1991, in Phoenix,AZ,when I was 13 and in the 7th grade. It was ""The Under My Spell Tour"" and I was so excited to finaly see her Live. I saw her in ""92"" as she performed her encore perfomance, and I became so dazzled by her performance. She was truely talented. I wish she would make a come back! At least I can re live my Paula fanatic days with this performance."
1,"Makes geology fun While the lessons are enjoyable, the awesome hands-on activities in the Kaleidoscope Books are what set this series apart from other books. Kaleidoscope Kids Geology contains directions for the ultimately cool baking soda and vinegar bubbling volcano (or couse). Other hands-on fun included in the book also include making adobe bricks with grass and mud. Yes, your school day can officially be about playing in the mud! Like all of the Kaleidoscope Kids Books, the Geology book is full of one hands-on activity after another as kids learn about types of rocks, the Mohs' Scale of hardness, volcanoes, earthquakes, even which birthstone represents which month."
1,fun things to do The book has a wide variety. You're sure to find something that you and children can do together. The kids thought they looked to be fun when they glanced through.
1,"makes my face very soft I went for a facial the other day. The final result didn't make my skin as smooth or as soft as just my own home facial and seacret face cream does. I use this lotion as a day lotion, when I stay indoors and don't need sun protection. The results are instant and my skin gets very soft."
1,"Great gift for the enthusiast... This makes a great gift for the car enthusiast. Nice references and illustrations to common automotive terms. I originally bought it as a gift, but later purchased one for myself too."
1,quick reference to automotive engineering I found this to be a useful tool as a quick reference to automotive engineering.
1,"Like it a lot This is one of those oils I would buy again. It smells great, nice to put on after you shave your legs or just rub on to smell nice."
1,Arrington the Great!! I love the Arrington Jersey so glad that it is available on my favorite website!!!!!!!
1,"Amazing fit!!! I have never, ever, ever in the history of owning my Prius found a sunshade that didn't fit like crap. My hat is off to these guys. It fit like a glove."
1,"Brilliant, moving, helpful to family members If you're looking for a way to help a mentally ill relative, you must read this compelling book and its (equally compelling) successor, ""Transforming Madness: New Lives for People Living with Mental Illness,"" also by Morrow. No, don't just read them. Buy them; tuck them away in a visible, dust-free spot; pull them out for inspiration when your relationship with your relative falls into a pothole. Big Neugie and Little Neugie will help pull the two of you out of it and go on with your lives together."
1,"Perfect Fit This came well packed, and is a perfect replacement for my 1999 Ford Explorer. Fits and looks exactly like the original!"
1,"great great quality love this show as good as I remembered would recommend this to anyone.love this all time classic, I watched this as a kid and it stuck in my memory as a funny good tv show and my memory was right"
1,F Troop The Complete First season I found seeing F Troop for the first time for years.It was great to see it all again.I enjoyed it so well it brought great memories back to me. The transfer from the film to dvd was excited !! .It worth seeing over again. I be looking forward to see F Troop the complete second season when it comes out.Highly recommended.
1,"F Troop, watch and laugh F Troop has been a favorite for a long time. I was delighted to find it available on DVD. It is timeless humor, enjoyable over and over.The cast was great, Hard to believe the female lead, Melody Anderson, was only 16 at the series start! One thing nice about the older TV series is that they don't cover up the dialog with dumb songs.F Troop - The Complete First Two Seasons 1&2"
1,laughs galore F Troop made me laugh until the end and you will laugh too.They couldn't have picked a better cast.F Troopo is a definite must for Your collection.You will not be disapointed.
1,"I really like my laptop!! This laptop is very user friendly, and an enjoyable peice of equipment. The battery life isgreat, as well as memory capability; however the price is too expensive. I got my laptopfor FREE! Just paste this site in your address bar, and have fun with it!(...)"
1,"I played the role of Dawn Divito in the stage version I played Dawn Divito in the stage version and I thougth the character was amazing. It gave a nice character development, from the shy girl to the outrageous and confident student at the end. The audience howled at the plays, all six of them. Particular favorites were The Universal Language, Var. on the Death of Trotsky and A Philadelphia. Buy this play! It's outrageous."
1,"It's All In The Timing This is one of the funniest plays I've ever had the experience of getting to know. I just finished a run of it at my high school last week (I was Mrs. Trotsky), and I don't think I've ever laughed so hard! I highly, HIGHLY reccommend this play to anyone and everyone."
1,"he's got rhythm! This excellent collection of one act plays shows Ives' great sense of rhythm, randomly interesting observations about life, and excellent sensitivity towards relationships. I highly recommend it, particularly for the plays English Made Simple and Ancient History."
1,"The New Shakespeare All in the Timing is a wonderful collection of some of the funniest plays I've ever read, heard, or performed. I highly recommend this book if you like to laugh."
1,When Wolf knew how to write This book sums up New York and the criminal justice system. Don't waste your time on A Man in Full. Wolf lost the gift after Bonfire.
1,"I know it's cheesy to say this, but I couldn't put it down! This not only happens to be my favorite Tom Wolfe book, but my favorite book period. The plot is exciting and realistic. Readers will relate with every single character depicted here. And no one matches Wolfe's descriptive capabilities. What the rest of us would need a million words to say, Wolfe manages to express with a few key and very visual phrases. So far, there isn't a book I've enjoyed more."
1,Great Book - Very Enjoyable Great Book. Very enjoyable. The writing is probably better than the story. There are sentences in this book which I think are probably the finest ever written. An absolute treat.
1,"Engaging and Good ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" is a good book...one of those books that are enjoyable to read and educate you in some way at the same time. Richly drawn with a well-developed plot line and memorable characters (and caricatures), this is a book that should stand the test of time.What I enjoyed most about this book was how well the scenes, settings and characters were drawn by Wolfe. He has a gift for capturing the essence of a time and place...something he does quite well in ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" for different sides of New York City in the 1980s.This is a great and memorable book."
1,"Great book Well written, kept your interest all the way to the end. The story showed how far man would go for his vanity."
1,"Entertaining and fascinating A friend of mine gave me the book to read over the Christmas break. What a treat. Some parts caused me to laugh out loud. I found the ending to be appropriate because it could very well be the true ending for a ridiculous case such as the one McCoy was in. When you're dealing with the politics of situations, this is sometimes the way things unfortunately end. I did like Judge Kovitsky, he was one of the characters who actually was decent."
1,"""Boomer-Man"": Tom Wolfe's Modern Everyman in Bonfire Hell If F. Scott Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby was the Modern-Man of his generation, Tom Wolf's everyman hero in ""Bonfire of the Vanities is our Boomer man,"" the guy who can't quite make ends meet on 998,000 bucks a year. Although Wolfe is best known for his ""new journalism"" stethopscopic view of America in works like ""Electric Acid Cool Aid Test"" and ""The Pump House Gang,"" his first foray into the land of the novel is novel indeed.Bonfire is a hybrid of novel and journalism with a pinch of Woody Allen. Wolfe's ""social X-rays"" scavenge cosmopolitan Manhattan cocktail parties as the vultures of the downtown poverty industry exploit a yuppie faux pas that sends his Boomer hero into a crashing Sartrean abyss.Angular as a spaghetti Western, zanier than Monty Python, and truer than Sinclair Lewis, Mr. Wolf's excursion as a novelist leaves us wondering why he doesn't do more."
1,"Shades Of Purple I think this CD is the best CD I've ever listened to! Especially Mirror Mirror. I love the piano playing! I'm a piano player, so I should know."
1,"Fantastic If you enjoy Marvel comics, then this book is a must have!!!!! The art work is incredible and the information provided for each Superhero, and Villian is outstanding!!!!! This book is FANTASTIC."
1,"Excellent book for any marvel fan This book has the best illustrations, not too mention the history behind each Marvel Character. Great book for anyone"
1,Good information and pretty well updated A lot of superheroes that you have totally forgot about. Plus multiple histories for heroes that have been reborn or changed over time. An A+ for any comic book fan. A real great way to teach your kids about the comics or to have a significant other learn about the charactors of the movies.
1,"My comic loving boyfriend, loved this book I don't know much about comics, but my boyfriend said it was the best gift I had ever given him. We have been dating for 7 years, so it was saying a lot."
1,Great Deal Received merchandise in a timely manner. And for the price we paid (half off cover) the condition of the book was good
1,"High dose, good price, no side effects I am using this to help keep my acne under control. You have to be careful about the dose, I take it twice a day for a total of 50,000 iu which is a lot. I check my liver function tests on a regular basis. Liver toxicity has been reported on doses as low as 15,000 iu per day. Check with your doctor before you take this product. If your doctor has no idea, find another doctor!"
1,"good if taken when directed After taking this I've noticed a difference in my skin improving. I've had fewer break outs and has been great for my vision as well. When at the range and focusing on the 300 meter target, it hasn't been as blury. It was always hard to focus in on, up to this point. That was after taking this product for about 3 months.If you aren't taking this as directed by a doctor, then at least look up the facts from a credible source. One thing that I've noticed is that when I take this before going to bed, I have very vivid dreams. Almost to the point of being lucid. That might be a common side effect."
1,"A+ for 25,000 IU Vitamin A Very good price for the stonger dose of Vitamin A I look for which are not always easy to find without visiting a health store with overpriced products. This is exactly what I want and I am VERY pleased to find it in the dosage and price I was looking for. Expiration date of 10/2015!"
1,"Convection heat transfer made ""streamlined"" With this book, Bejan makes convection heat transfer ""streamlined"". Powerful --yet simple and handy-- tools such as constructal theory, scale analysis, intersection of asymptotes method, heatlines, etc., are presented and used in the book to provide readers with a deep understanding of how and why things are happening the way they are. The author's viewpoint on the field is refreshing and original. This is the one book that I would recommend to graduate students interested in convection heat transfer."
1,"Excellent Book. Useless however, for convincing ""educated"" athiests. Being a former athiest, I appreciate all of the arguments that can be made against Lewis' apologetics. That being said, I feel that it is impossible to convince someone through reason and logic, who has already convinced themselves otherwise through reason and logic. Either God gave you the convictions/morals you have, or mankind developed them to cope with survival on Earth. It really remains the Holy Spirit's responsibility to convict men of the truth. On that note, if you are already convicted, and take comfort knowing that beleif is still reasonable, involving your brain as well as your heart, this book speaks volumes. For those who've read it and object to his stance on evolution, or universalism, remember that He is still a man, and subject to error. I personally don't have a problem with those two beliefs. To sum it up, this book is perfect for someone who just responded to an altar call."
1,Recommend the writer to everyone Book was in okay shape but the material inside is a must foranyone seeking truth.
1,"Mere Christianity is a Winner! This was the first book by C.S. Lewis that I read. I have now read about 10 of this great author's works. In my opinion it is a must read for everyone; Christian or non-believer, it says it like it is. At times when I am having trouble explaining things to my friends that are consumed by the secular world, I purchase this book for them as a gift. If they are still confused about a supreme being after such a read then I would question their comprehension or desire to learn the truth. Once you begin to read this book it is very difficult to put it down; it is a catalyst for intellectual thought and enlightenment.Dr. Long"
1,"Review of the Complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classics I had read two of C.S. Lewis' works- Mere Christianity and the Chronicles of Narnia-and wanted to read more of his books.This book is great in that it contains some of classics like the Screwtape Letters, Miracles, etc. in one edition.I have not completed the entire work yet, but have enjoyed what I have read so far. C.S. Lewis is one of the intellectual giants of the 20th century and you will see why when you read some of his literary masterpieces contained in this edition. I recommend it highly."
1,"You can never go wrong with C.S. Lewis- The perfect gift idea! These books are wonderful and a ""must have"" for any C.S. Lewis fan. They are light weight and easy to handle. The print is very small so I wouldn't recommend this particular set for anyone with vision problems. The type is double spaced though, making it easier to read. If you are looking for a gift for a devoted Christian, this set of books would be a safe bet."
1,An excellent defense of the Christian Faith C.S. Lewis (my favorite non-fiction author) has written an excellent defense of the Christian faith. This book is the foundation for modern apologetics. A must read for Christians in a modern intellectual society.
1,"Solid, consistent and enjoyable Originally a series of radio broadcasts that were transcribed into book form with the author's help, C. S. Lewis' witty and systematically logical defense of Christianity still endures as a favorite today. Although intellectual works of this caliber can seem intimidating, his conversational style of communication makes the book approachable and thoroughly enjoyable. He not only addresses the common sense of Christianity, but also thoughtfully doesn't neglect the practical need, the heartfelt void, that Christ alone can fill. All in all, this book is an all-around, solid work that consistently covers all the bases of thought and makes for a great read."
1,"Every Christian should read Lewis I love C.S. Lewis. He has never dissapointed me. But Lewis absolutly out did himself in Mere Christianity. I wish every nonbeliever would read this book to learn a bout the basic teaching and theologies of Christianity, and that every Christian would read this book to find out how much they really have in common with each other. Beautifully written. A true classic for all time."
1,"C.S. Lewis is a master communicator If you love to think, you will love this book.If you don't love to think, you will after reading this book!So many great contemporary thinkers of modern day have been influenced by C.S. Lewis.No matter what flavor of apologetic thinker you can think of, if you listen or read long enough to them you will find Lewis' defense used by everyone as a base for their arguments. Don't be left in the dark, think for yourself, read this book!"
1,"Thought provoking writing This was the first C.S Lewis piece I had ever read, and it was compelling. He put a spin on the whole realm of Christianity unlike anything I've read before. Some of the chapters were a bit difficult to absorb, so I reread them and it started to make more sense. Lewis doesn't claim to know all the answers about being a Christian, but he certainly makes a good case for why we should all give Christianity a chance."
1,"Beautiful as only simplicity can be This book is truly astonishing. It explains the concepts that lie at the heart of Christianity with amazing simplicity and clarity.I have found it to be a true treasure, a book I am certain I will return to many times over.C.S. Lewis is masterful in his poignant honesty and colourful metaphors."
1,"Outstanding Known as one of the greatest Christian writers of the 20th century, of all time for that matter, Lewis' title would perhaps be better titled Why Christianity? His arguements are strong yet simple with many real world examples to illustrate his points. The text is perfect for the new Christian, the layman, the clergy, and, in my case, the teacher/Seminary student working on a second masters.Rev. Thom Reed M.Th."
1,"The Complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classics Arrived early. Very prompt service. Just as described, excellent condition. It is a gift and the person who received it loved it."
1,"Basic Premises of common Christian doctrine Written in 1943 at the tail end of WWII, Mere Christianity was originally produced as a radio broadcast where the author presented the basic premises of common Christian doctrine. It became so popular Lewis produced a written form of his broadcast which became this book."
1,"Don't Wait! I waited a long time before I got around to reading C.S. Lewis and regret my procrastination. He is not only a prolific writer but he comes across as a humble person. How refreshing to find one who is so brilliant. He is not only close to God but he is able to articulate his views allowing many of us to make progress on our personal journeys. He may have some philosophical flaws but ""Mere Christianity"" is a great starting point for those with no religion. I found his short chapters to be easy and pleasant readings while fortifying my faith. I was able to merge many of his thoughts into my own positions. This is not a take it or leave it offering. I have to strongly recommend this book to all at the risk of drawing people into a Christian sect other than my own. Borrow it or buy it and then read it. It should change you as it has changed so many others."
1,"What we, as Christians, believe (in a nutshell). Read it for the second or third time and it is always amazingly new. I plan to go to a seminar this summer at the Kilns (Jack's home near Oxford) so I wanted to get back up to speed. Also recommend George Sayers' bio of Lewis."
1,Attractive Edition of a Classic I am grate for this beautiful edition of this classic. I gave new copies to my children. Knowing that the wonderful text will be well preserved and presented for a life-time of enjoyment and inspiration is a real value.
1,"Merely . . . Phenomenal If you are honestly searching for answers, then you have found the ultimate book. This book isn't for the feint at heart, it's not for bubble-gum churchgoers, and it's not for people who have no desire to objectively search for the Lord. I was totally blown away by Lewis's intellectual examination of Christianity. I had never seen anything even remotely close to what Lewis has done. Lewis's arguments are so unique that you will be left wondering, ""How come nobody ever has addressed these issues in this way before?"" It's almost like the Lord gave Lewis a unique gift to appeal to the intellectuals who are on the fence. If you are on the fence, then Lewis will push you onto the right track (if you are willing)."
1,"C.S. Lewis - Mere Christianity Especially read the chapter on Forgiveness, chapter 7. The whole book is really, really good. I love this author."
1,"Great Apologetics! I forget how much I enjoy reading Lewis when I haven't read anything by him in a while. I hadn't read this book before but decided to give it a try after reading a friend's review last year, and I'm so glad that I did! Lewis takes so many of the truths of Christianity and explains them in practical ways. His illustrations and examples are wonderful, really helping his readers to understand what he is talking about. While this book is geared more toward non-Christians, there is a lot that Christians can get from reading this book. In case you can't tell, I really enjoyed this book!"
1,"a ""must have"" for thinking people and slackers alike i read mere christianity and screwtape years ago and was delighted to see them in one volume with other 'signature classics' by ol' clive staples lewis. if you want to go to narnia on the pop culture train, pass on this. if you want contemporary thought by a man long dead, but his words still live and indict the modern mind to stretch beyond complacency, get this volume NOW!"
1,"Titles can be misleading - This book serves a great purpose. By ""mere"" Christianity, Lewis means that he is writing about the fundamental issues that all Christ-based religions can agree upon. It is written in a conversational tone, with few references to particular bible verses. An outstanding work. This was written 50 years ago but is timeless and accurate today."
1,"Christian insights I decided to reread ""Mere Christianity"" to see if I could rekindle insights into what is God, what has He done and what should we be doing.I had underlined several sentences and paragraphs from my previous reading of this book. I found that these underlined passages were still applicable. I recorded several new thoughts to aid my understanding of God.Lewis takes on the tough issues facing Christians. For example, we know what morality is but do not practice it completely. When we understand how much more we have to do to be a better person, we are progressing in the right direction.I was particularly interested in two thoughts from Lewis' book.1. Try to become a better person by taking one step at a time. Ask for God's help. This is really good advice. It works!!2. Religious leaders who politicize God's word are not working for God. Religion and political party platforms should remain separate and apart."
1,"""One of the best books on Christanity I have ever read!"" Lewis's descriptions and illustrations of the basics of the Christian life are very practical for the one investigating the tenents of Christianity. I have read and re-read ""Mere Chistianity"" several times and each time gaining new insight. Next to the Holy Bible it holds a place of regular usage."
1,"The definitive essay on why Christianity is the one choice to make C.S.Lewis has the ability to teach us why Christianity makes sense and why God Himself, makes sense. In words we can all understand he lays out the various reasons to accept Christianity and why it is right and intelligent to do so.As a previous Athiest, his commentary on why we should believe as he does is even more umnderstandable as he takes it from concept to certainty. Very well written by a very smart guy. Written during WWII in England it is also a commentary on the war, in some parts, in relation to good and evil.Another book that should be read by all believers and non-believers alike is ""I don""t have enough faith to be an Athiest"" written by Norman Geisler and Frank Turek. For the believer it is all you need to make sound arguments for why you believe and for the non-believer I challenge you to continue in non-belief after you read the definitive evidence in these pages."
1,"Mere Christianity This is a step-by-step path to reinforcing the faith journey. I found the reasoning Mr. Lewis used to be understandable and irrefutable and I intend to use it, where possible, to dispel disbelief."
1,C.S. Lewis Signature Classics amazing collection of writings that allow its readers to know how Lewis came to Christ....a motivational and factual read to help others understand
1,C.S. Lewis I bought this book to pass onto my sister. I bought the complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classics because I want to read more of his stories. Everyone can learn about life and religion through C.S. Lewis. Excellent!
1,Excellent Book It tremendously helped me renew my Christian conviction. He explains what Christian is better than anybody I know of. I recommend this book to anybody who is interested in Christian life without any reservation.
1,"Absolutely breathtaking Any doubts about Christianity, or just want to learn exactly what it is all about?This is the book."
1,"A Must Read This is truly a life changing book. What an incredible mind C S Lewis had. It has been an honor to have the opportunity to read this collection. I won't stop until I have read everything I can find about, or by C S Lewis."
1,Review of Mere Christianity It might be helpful for some skeptics of orthodox Christian teachings. I like it because it doesn't come on strong like some Christian apologists books. Tom Dougherty
1,A Christian Classic! This book gives a purely objective view on Christianity. C.S. Lewis starts out with the plain facts and just methodically explains why Christianity makes sense. A comprehensive book that flawlessly spells out Christianity! A Must read for all Christians and non-Christians who are seeking the truth.
1,C.S. Lewis is Brilliant I don't know if he could have possibly covered all the ground he did in any fewer words. It is incredible how he goes from assuming you believe in absolute nothing to getting down the heart of Christianity in a matter of pages. I also like Lewis b/c he often gives credit where credit is due. This book shall stand the test of time.
1,Great book I've really enjoyed reading this book. The Great Divorce is what turned me onto reading C.S. Lewis and also hearing him quoted by some great preachers. He knows his stuff and presents it in a way that even a reader with just a basic education can read and understand. Anyone looking to dive a little further into their walk with Christ will find this beneficial!
1,C.S. Lewis is amazing I find his works to be amazing even after my third or forth read through. I cannot not think of anybody else who is better in the field.
1,"For Skeptics and Believers ""Mere Christianity"" by C.S Lewis is an erudite, cogent view of Christianity. Skeptics will appreciate Lewis' willingness to look at the harder questions of the Christian God, while true believers will gain confidence as they see the logic of God presented sensibly and pursuaively.Not to be compared with Augustine, or any of the church fathers, Lewis does bring a modern, yet classical examination of what Christianity is and why it is reasonable to believe. He doesn't get caught up in anything but the core and substantive matters of the faith. Lewis is eloquent here in his clarity.For an entertaining and insightful expose of human sin, read his ""Screwtape Letters.""I fully recommend ""Mere Christianity"" by C.S. Lewis.Anthony Trendl"
1,Good Collection Convenient collection of Lewis. The book is perhaps too heavy to be handled easily by the elderly or infirm.
1,"A classic among classics Any person, young or old who has the faintest interest in Christianity should read this book. I first read it at least 10 years ago, while serving in the U.S. Army. It is one of those books that you find yourself thinking about for weeks after you've read it. If you're curious, if you're just interested in the classics of religious literature, buy this book."
1,"Christianity: Simply Explained C.S. Lewis is a well known author for many reasons, and for many books. My very favorite of his books is ""Mere Christianity"" which can be read by both branches of Christianity.....Protestant, and Catholic alike, and enjoyed by those who are new to this religion. The explanations given are just as valid today, as when C. S. Lewis wrote them way back when! I highly recomend this book to the new Christian, and to the old one alike. This book is both inspiring and captivating!"
1,"Essential Reading One of the top Christian books on apologetics ever written. A very personal account...moving and persuasive. If you're a Christian, it will bolster your faith and make you smile. If you're not, you may very well be after reading this wonderful book."
1,"This is the book that changed my life I was raised in a Christian family and attended Sunday School faithfully all through my childhood; but until I read Mere Christianity, I never really understood my relationship with God -- and His with me. Back in college, in '73, I borrowed some books from a friend and she slipped it in, saying, ""You might enjoy this, too."" Well, by the time I finished it, Christ -- the living Lord -- became so real to me, I asked Him to forgive me and lead me. Now, 25 years later, I still reread this book several times each year! Sometimes the Bible is hard for newcomers to get into so, I take a paperback copy of it with me on airline flights, and leave one in the seatback pocket, inscribed, ""A friend left me here for you!"" That's because it meant so much to me, and I believe it is the best explanation of Christianity ever written. You might want to invest in spreading the Word this way, too!"
1,"Beyond this world.... wonderful, thought provoking, massively intellectual (and way too much for me) - it's a constant re-read. Some of his thoughts go way over my head and I am not on his wave length intellectually or iq - but somethings I totally get - and he talks sense (when I get it). I take some, i leave what I don't get, but that is the beauty of the journey of christianity - not just questioning - but realising that it just IS. and knowing that is just AWESOME!"
1,"Merely Life Changing There is nothing ""Mere"" about this book; it will merely change your life. Lewis lays out in plain english a logical argument for the existence of God and the definitive apologetic for christianity since St. Thomas Aquinis. His use of metaphore makes difficult abstract concepts understandable. Christianity claims to change lives and Mere Christianity lives up to its name. A must read for anyone seriously seeking the truth."
1,"Mere christianity I felt that I was given pieces of a jig-saw that I did not know were missing, and this enabled me to see pictures I was not aware God had been preparing. If you know the code this book will be a revelation. If not I pray for you."
1,great perspective This was my first C.S. Lewis book and I found it so interesting that he approaches the Christian faith from such a straight forward and practical perspective- especially him previously being an atheist! Very interesting.
1,"An Eminently Logical Case for the Christian Faith Mere Christianity is one of the two best logical logical cases for the Christian faith I have read. Lewis first brilliantly lays a foundation, logically showing that the universe (external and internal) demands logically that some form of God exists. He then compares various theories of God with what we find in reality, and finds that only the Christian one honestly stands. At this point, he continues into details of the Christian faith. Any one honestly seeking to understand Christianity, and/or trying to decide if it is true, will find a powerful, rational case here for ""yes."" The other book I mentioned is Charles Colson's How Now Shall We Live, whose conlusions are based on real-life studies and experiences, rather the more pure logical base of Lewis' writing. They are two halves of a whole perspective, the theory and the application, and I would especially suggest both to any Christian reader."
1,An orginal thinker An orginal thinker that is suited for our times that is rampant with seculiar thinking that leading to moral decay
1,"Practically handy In times when the morality and the common human sense seems to be in decay due to the relativity subjected to these concepts, Lewis, in an understandable way and with a variety of examples, elucidate the reality of right and wrong hidden in the human being exposed as the Law of nature. With that, as a start point, the author give sense, in many ways, to the human behavior and clarify why the christian moral is the most proper way for a person to live."
1,One of favourite books I read this book ages ago and still can't find anything to compare story to. Love it and I would always recommend it to everyone who like good literature.
1,"a sexual odyssey in search of identity and secure attachment Erica Jong takes us on an intrapsychic merry-go-round as her heroine searches for the right blend of sexual satisfaction, secure attachment and love. Her lusty odyssey is tempered by her self-deprecating humour and ambivalent relationships with psychoanalysis and psychoanalysts.This book remains a groundbreaking classic and opens our eyes to the progression of feminine sensibility.Alan Eppel author of ""Sweet Sorrow: Love, Loss and Attachment in Human Life"".Sweet Sorrow: Love, Loss and Attachment In Human Life"
1,Love the sets! I ordered all of the seasons for my husband as a Christmas present. We have absolutely no complaints. Love the series!
1,"Definetly Fuse's best english book Tomoko Fuse is popular for her amazing origami figures that she creates with unique units (over 50 books in print). This book is no exeption. Possibly her best book ever, this book is a combination of all her most interesting items taken from her other books in Japanese and Korean. I own a few of the forgein language books and I find many things in the book that I enjoy folding, and many that I hate. This book has MOST of the cooler items from her most famous books. If you are a fan of unit origami or just like geometry, then buy this book."
1,"A wonderful, colorful accounting of Mr. Green's work Conroy has done a splendid job of putting together the works of Jonathan Green. Not only does the book show Green's unique style to best advantage, but includes great information about the Gullah people and the artist. A must have book for anyone interested in the Gullahs or Jonathan Green."
1,"Classic Lenin Democratic Centralism, the whys and wherefores along with history and positions detailing the split within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Some of the references that Lenin makes would have been easily known in his time though for us, checking the writings of Karl Kautsky and Plekhanov are recommended as with most of Lenin's works. If one cannot find the works of the above mentioned see [...]"
1,"Uke Of Ages Swings & Grooves Dan Sawyer's Uke Of Ages is a beautifully conceived, arranged and performed collection of eclectic songs for this unique instrument. The selections, of various styles, have kept me entertained over and over. The swinging Sheik, the grooving Sloop John B, Coming Home, the lyrical When You Wish Upon A Star, and his fine vocal style make this a winner for me! It's a one-of-a-kind. Five stars!"
1,"This is the best album ever! Ralph Stanley II really has a lot to look forward to. This new album is nothing but great. Every song is wonderful, and I guarantee this one will not come out of your cd player for a long time, it's that good. Pathway of Danger is my personal favorite."
1,"This is a cool album, I really like the way mark moves on stage.He really got the moves for all of his songs."
1,"This practice can change your life. Working with the Divine Light Invocation has changed my life, and this book presents clear instructions for how to do the invocation. It also includes the history of the Divine Light Invocation and questions by students and answers by the author. This book is essential for anyone interested in bringing more light into their lives."
1,"A lovely book A lovely ramble with a fascinating old gentleman, quaint, charming, sunny and a true picture of one aspect of a bygone age and of the way our great-great grandfathers talked and lived. The fishing lore and natural history are hopelessly out of date but who cares? Has been in print for centuries and deservedly so."
1,"Simple Beauty I spontaneously picked up this book at the library the other day and have been more than delighted. This book is like reading a series of short stories on different subjects, i.e., marriage, friendship, sex, rural life, and others, but yet is woven in such a way as to thread in her experiences at a Benedictine monastery, which is really the core subject of the book. Her style is quirky and endearing, yet in many ways, fearless.I loved it and can't wait to read her other works."
1,"Excellent faith prodding material! I loved the book -- used it for my morning devotions for about three weeks, reading a bit a day. Her topical, short chapter focus is perfect for this approach. I also passed it on to my sister who is reading it; we now talk about how we understood each passage as she reads. Great discussion starters."
1,"Great smelling ,,,,great feeling cream I love this product and all Exuviance products..they have a great smell and seem to work well."
1,"You have to like Ben Stiller to like this movie but if you do, this is one funny movie. I couldn't stop laughing from beginning to end. The humor is stupid, but in a sort of intellectually cynical way. Stiller is over the top as the owner of the megagym, and deadpan Vince Vaughn sets him off perfectly. This is a great movie to watch in a group!"
1,"Gaar! A beauty o a flim, matey! I almost snorted spirte out my nose watching this movie.I'll admit, it's not for everyone. If you enjoyed Zoolander, Harold and Kumar go to Whitecastle, and Get Shorty, this movie will have you in stitches.I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh."
1,"One of the best movies of the year! Too funny to describe. We were rolling in the ailes. If you like Vince Vaughn, you'll like this movie."
1,Nice game I thought this was one of the best sport movies i have ever seen in my life.I liked the actors like Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller I was surprised though because Ben Stiller won best villain at the MTV movie awards.Instead of Rachael McAdams for Mean Girls.I thought the best scene in the movie was when Ben Stiller became that fat guy and he sang Kelis' Milkshake song.I thought it was hilarious and we made un of a fat kid that it was him.But it was hilarious so i recommend you see this movie.
1,"Great A HILARIOUS movie! Kept me laughing the entire time. Plenty of primitive and crude humor that covers up the fairly simple plot line.By the way, watch through the credits, it's worth it."
1,"One of the best books written about how the indigenous population of California was affected by the change in government. Although this is entirely a work of fiction, the author, Helen Hunt Jackson, spent a significant amount of time with the indigenous population of California and asked them extensively about how they felt about their land changing hands from the government of Mexico to that of the United States of America. This is a must-read for everyone who lives and have lived in California, so they can gain a much clearer perspective of what it means to be a Californian. As painful as it is to read about Ramona's life experiences, it is humbling to know what she went through. It leaves the reader wanting to know what happens next."
1,It's a Fit! It's perfect. Purchased one that was supposed to be for a Prius but it didn't fit the way this one does. I'm so pleased I'm going to purchase the one that goes on the back now. Thanks.
1,"Hoax? I dont think so I believe that Berkwoitz is really a born again christian. He may have been baptized before the killings but he was not born again. Being born again is something that happens in your heart. If he really was pretending im sure he would have taken parole but he said he deserves to be in jail for what he has done, isnt that proof enought that he he is sincere?"
1,Great product but expensive here. $6.49 at TRU and $6+ at Walmart for 32 Large disposable bibs. The bib itself is quite large and stays put. Too much liquid will leak at the bottom.
1,"Lovin' it! I was nervous about buying a skillet that was not non-stick, but it was a GREAT decision, and I'll never go back. I am impressed by how the product evenly distributes heat so that there's no worry about your food being unevenly cooked. I also find that the food tastes much better. In sum, I want to marry this skillet."
1,"giant fry pan with lid, not too heavy I looked quite a while to find a large frying pan that was NOT non-stick. Some were extremely expensive, some had no lids, some were way too heavy, or the handles were awkward to hold. I wanted a lid! This pan is great. It is a bit heavy, but has the helper handle, so I can lift it full of food even though I'm rather weak. The main handle is comfortable. The pan cooks fine as far as what I need. I can cook a lot of vegetables or chicken at a time using oil. If bits remains stuck after cooking, I let the pan soak in water for a while and clean it with soap and a plastic scrubby. I store it hanging by the main handle on a hook, with the helper handle resting on another support hook below. I've had it several years now with no problems, using it about once a month."
1,"AWESOME FRY PAN I have my original set of Farberware Classic pots & pans when I got married 36 yrs. ago. It did not include the 12"" fry pan which I wanted. It's a sturdy pan and cleans up easily. The BEST feature is the helper handle. This handle makes taking the pan from cooktop to table sooooo much easier, since a large pan as this can get very heavy when filled.A GREAT FRY PAN AT A GREAT PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"A great resource for study I've found this software VERY useful for Bible study. Being able to search for words (or a brief sequence of letters), whether in English, Hebrew or Greek, saves a lot of time. The lexicon and Strong's numbering is handy for translating and parsing. I'd recommend this for any college student, Minister or preacher... and I know I've only dipped into the ""shallow end"" of the tools it has available. Do read the small print for what's included / not included - but it's VERY worthwhile."
1,"by far the best free bible software! Online Bible is by far the best bible software I found. It is extremely flexible, as it allows the user to incorporate his own materials, books etc. Apart from my bible hardcopy its the tool I use most for preparing bible studies. Just try it..."
1,"Riveting Story Eddie Nye has been sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit - he thinks he knows who's responsible, and is determined to find the man when he's released after 15 years. Eddie has changed - a once top-flight swimmer destined for college, he's become a hardened, vicious fighter who's not easily intimidated. Once out, he savors his freedom - then realizes he's still not safe from former prison acquaintances. The novel traces his odyssey from prison to New England to the Caribbean island where his problems began. This is a real page-turner. Some might not like the ending, but to me it seemed almost poetic in its perfect rounding off of the story."
1,Happy days A teenage fantasy for sure. I would go to more class reunions if they were like this.A fun movie.
1,"funny and very sad I feel this movie is very funny and all actors did a great job all those years ago. It's really is funny, BUT has some very sad moments. Going back for a second chance at things and or reliving parts of your life, seeing and interacting with people you have since lost... well, that would be kind of emotional. Great movie in my book."
1,classic I loved this blast from the past. Nicholas Cage is great in this movie and I watched it twice in a row. Great for something to do.
1,"Cobalt drills rule! I know Cobalt (both M-35 and M-42) are way more expensive than regular HSS drills, but if you've got exotic metals or steel to drill it's like night and day. I wouldn't go back to HSS except for wood and maybe aluminum after this!"
1,"WIFE JUST LOVES IT........ Bought this for my wife on her 40th as a surprise,i did some looking around and found this one.it is big and thick,my wife loves the vibration on it,she says this is the best one she has ever had.As far as getting it in you do have to work it in,problem was solved with lubrication.It does have a smell to it which might put some people off,but other than that great toy and the vibrations are out of this world according to my wife."
1,"Impressed I just bought the DVD last month and I am very impressed. I've had both VHS and laserdisc versions of this film for some time, but the vibrance of the color and the quality of the sound has never been better. Definitely one of the better DVD transfers out there. Well worth the money! Go Babs!"
1,"Don't Let Today's Barbra Stop You From Watching Yesterday's To those Celine Dion fans who don't understand why she will never quite equal Streisand in the eyes of many of Barbra's fans, I present exhibit A: Funny Girl. I was 15 years old when I first saw this film and fell in love with Barbra. She simply wowed me. Bounced off the screen with her presence. And that voice! Just an extraordinary talent. Yes, she's become a bit out of control and beyond full of herself as the years have gone by. I can't sit through Mirror Has To Faces and some of her later films. But show me Funny Girl (or The Way We Were) and I'm that 15 year old again who fell in love with ""The Greatest Star."" If you have never seen this movie before, don't let biases that you might have formed against Streisand in recent years stop you. It is really, truly a must-see. She more than deserved that Oscar! (Something I guess Celine still has on her To-Do List.)"
1,"Classic One of my all-time favorites.I would love to see this,as well as Funny Lady on blu-ray.I can't wait! Hopefully it will be soon!"
1,"The Last Best Star Plays One of the First How appropriate that Streisand brought this role to us. She appeared on the scene just after the end of the great musicals and great musical stars, so it is no surprise that she is our connection to those movies and that time. Her performance as Fanny Brice, though lacking much connection to the reality of Brice's style or life, also bridges the gap between old time and new style musicals. The emotional, idealized treatment of the material suited her talents perfectly. In my opinion, Streisand's closing number in this film, ""My Man,"" is what clinched her Best Actress Oscar. Also in my opinion, it is one of the three most electrifying moments ever caught on film. (Judy Garland's ""The Man that Got Away"" from ""A Star is Born"" being the second. I'm still deciding on the third ...)"
1,"""People who see FUNNY GIRL, are the luckiest people . . ."" "". . . in the world!""Back in '68 that's how the tagline for FUNNY GIRL read, taking it's insiration from Streisand's signature tune. For once, the line that was only meant to sell tickets was actually telling the truth.I've seen this film nearly 100, and evey time it never fails to humor me, touch me, and inpire me. I will never be able to describe what this film means to me."
1,Great gift I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She loves this movie! She used to look up the songs on YouTube and sing them and now she doesn't have to!
1,amazing debut Barbra is wonderful in her first movie. She and Fanny Brice have a lot in common and Streisand did a wonderful job.
1,"Tanya Michaels is at the top of her game with... ...Not Quite as Advertised.Jocelyn McBride hates coming in second...especially coming in second to Hugh Brannon, an ex-lover and current nemesis. But the more she's around Hugh, the more she discovers a man who makes her laugh...who makes her discover something that's been missing in her life. Could it be love, like Hugh claims?Tanya Michael shines in this romantic comedy!"
1,"Great--but, unfortunately, largely overlooked--work. Perhaps the fact that this great work receives so little attention is indicative of what ails education: educators focus their attention on all the latest drivel concerning education while only paying lip service to Dewey, who remains the highest-ranking educational philosopher. It pains me to hear and read bungling educators mindlessly parrot Dewey's catch phrases (e.g., ""learning by doing"") while pushing educational doctrines completely antithetical to Dewey's ideas. Dewey had it right, but is grossly misunderstood by the bozos who vapidly regurgitate his words and phrases. In other words, I recommend that you go to the source.If you are in any way concerned with or interested in education and happen to stumble upon this lonely page, do yourself, your kids, and/or your students a favor and study this book carefully; It eclipses all other books on education."
1,Saddest Story Ever What can you say about this novel? The story of Jude's expectations and the downfall of his family is overwhelmingly tragic. I bought this novel for my teenager--hoping she'd appreciate how good she has it.
1,"The book to start reading Hardy. I remember this book -one of my 5 favourite- specially for the impact that made on me when I read it back in college. If you read first other books by Hardy you may think this one is a little sentimental and ""soap-operistic"". But this is trully a gem, a work of art.I felt identified with the hero and I could sense the things and places that show in the whole book. It is so real, and the feelings are so real and strong that you suffer with the characters.Trully a masterpiece. You must read it."
1,"Agony of Moral Decisions This book is about the struggle of having character. As such, it addresses perhaps a timeless question: should we follow our hearts and do what we want or should we follow convention and do what we think is demanded?Although they try desperately, and for a time succeed, Jude and Sue never fully escape the demands of conscious, obligation, and social convention. And it destroys them. Jude and Sue thus personify the agonizing struggle to make moral decisions. If we knew right from wrong, we would choose right every time. But, what makes Jude and Sue's struggles so painful is that they are trying to choose between right and right, or wrong and wrong. Either decision provides as much pain, although in a different way. So what do you do?Hardy doesn't give any easy answers. But, especially today when most of us all the time do exactly what we want, perhaps the question is worth thinking seriously about."
1,"Fate It seems to me, after reading a couple of Thomas Hardy novels, that although Hardy's stories are rich in narrative, they're working on a more abtract level or meant to convey more universal themes. My impression is that the point of the novel is made in the very title of the book. One doesn't have to consider this story in the context of the 19th century. The same set of circumstances could have occurred in any century. Jude was living his life according to his own values; outside forces played upon his choices, and the results were unfortunately, unhappy for Jude. I guess in today's competitive world where people believe they control every turn of their destiny, it may seem the outcomes in this novel should have been different. But, look again. You'll simply find a man living his life the best way he knows how to."
1,"A compelling and excellent novel of human nature The issues of marriage, children, passions and revelations of the ordinary dominate this detailed and gripping novel.Hardy's tragic novel leads the reader along the lives of the main character, Jude, and his lover, Sue so well that it's a small wonder that this book hadn't been made into a feature film before this year. This is a book of longing for dreams, but finding only stark reality again and again. Though this point may not be a happy one, Hardy's concern for his characters and their settings make this book impossible for the reader to set down for any length of time. A must read."
1,"Jude the Obscure The book is new and arrived sooner that I expected.Thank you for include a book mark. Everytime I buy something here, Im so happy. Thank you!"
1,"Classy It only holds a small volume of water, but it's classy and cute. I feel classy and cute while using it."
1,"A real treat I first found these at the Park Hyatt Washington D.C.They still make me smile and feel like I am drinking in luxury with this think wonderful glasses. They are very clear and the right size. They have a flat bottom so if they sweat they stick to a glass table a little, but I just love them. I thought of getting the wine glasses for water/juice but these work better without hitting your nose and are easier to wash."
1,"Best Steamer Ever It was a great addition to my set. I was tired of the other hard to clean steamer thing-a-ma-jigs, this cleans up wonderfully."
1,"Replacement I bought this to replace an old Faberware steamer set that was showing its age. Works well, stacks and stores easy."
1,Love It I really enjoy the 3-qt. steamer. It is the right size for me. It is attractive and I like the heavy weight. I recommend it.
1,"If you're going to own only one pot. . . This is a set which I've purchased as a gift for many young people and couples starting out. It is great for steaming vegetables, with the insert, or any other cooking without it. Because it doesn't have a non-stick coating it will not deteriorate and you will own it as long as you wish. (Mine has a steamer insert which looks a little different, but I've had it for more than thirty years).While the insert isn't deep enough to use as a pull-out drainer of pasta, cooking pasta in the pot, and then using the steamer insert as a colander, in the sink, works quite well."
1,"Awesome! This steamer was exactly what I was looking for. It is the perfect size to steam two servings of vegetables perfectly. This is perfect for one or two people. I would say if you need to steam larger portions you will not be happy with this. I have also steamed fish in this as well. I use this at least three times a week. The pan is not tiny, neither is it big and bulky so it does not take up a lot of room in the cabinets. It does feel sturdy and feels like it has a good weight to it. I always hand wash this set as soon as I use it and it is very easy to clean. I love this set!"
1,"CAN'T DO WITHOUT THIS HANDY POT This little steamer is the most used pot in my kitchen.REASONS I REACH FOR IT EVERYDAY:A. NO HANDLE TO EXTEND OVER FRONT OF COOKTOPB. NO HANDLE TO EXTEND OVER ANOTHER BURNERC. HOLDS ENOUGH VEGETABLES FOR SIXD. COMPACT TO STOREE. EASE OF USE ENCOURAGES ME TO COOK ""HEALTHY""I have purchased 9 of these steamers and have encouraged friends to buy them. Total count of steamers in use by my friends is 27!! (and not a one of them would part with it)"
1,"Works well and Looks nice in the process This was a gift for someone else. That said, I've heard nothing but good things about how well it works. The price is very reasonable, and its a nice sturdy steamer."
1,Great Steamer This Steamer is exactly as advertised...works very very well...nothing but great vegetables all the time!!!...Looked at all the local stores but found it at Amazon.com...Will buy again from Amazon for sure...
1,Farbareware Classic Cookware I enjoy my Farbarware Classic cookware. It heats up fast and even. I like the stainless steel-clad bottom much better that the old aluminum-clad bottom. The stainless steel bottom is much easier to clean off tuff grease stains if you have to you an oven cleaner. I lost all of my Farbareware cookware to Hurricane Katrina and have replaced it. needed.
1,Excellent product. This pan has worked very well for me. I steamed vegetables in the steamer pan and noodles in the bottom at the same time. I used it with my DuLux Induction cook top.
1,"Farberware Steamer I really love steamers... Veggies never tasted so good!I'll put 5 stars here, but I wish they came in different sizes (6-Quart wouldn't be bad huh?)."
1,"Great read Fight for joy in Jesus. This book is very helpful, and Scripture filled. Not a Christian? This book can benefit the Christian and non-Christian alike."
1,"Practical and insightful This is a really practical and insightful work of John Piper. It helped me a lot to rethink my behavior towards God. This book is in fact an answer from God for my prayers, then I really needed to think about the importance of Joy in my life."
1,"Challenging I found this book to be very challenging. Not because it's hard to read--not at all. The author makes his point very clear and makes it easy to understand. What is challenging is applying the concept to your life. Once you've read this book you understand how important it is to serve God with joy, not just with deeds. Everyone should be trying to find the joy that John Piper talks about in this book. If every Christian could fully embrace this idea we really would be walking, talking billboards for God."
1,"Great Price, Works Well HDMI cables are notoriously expensive in brick-and-mortar shops. The combination of great prices and free shipping makes this a HDMI cable a bargain."
1,"GREAT!!! its worth buying!!! it comes like new!!! its nice looking!!! its worth risking the very small chance of getting it in bad condition. If its not what you expect, remember it was practically free."
1,Great cable great price This HDMI cable was a great price and just as good as the store ones that cost double or triple this price. It works great and we will always buy these from Amazon!
1,HDMI Cable Cat 2 Everything is as advertised. At first I thought the ends weren't gold as advertised but everything is great. Highly recommend.
1,HDMI or HDMI ? This HDMI cable is a good quality one. Even If I have never seen a bad quality HDMI cable. It does a good job connecting my Xbox 360 and DVD player to an HDTV.
1,I liked I liked also an excellent product and I am happy to deal with you and I would recommend buying the product
1,Good and Cheap! I bought this cable because it was far cheaper than buying one in the store. I wasn't sure if it was good quality or not. I hoooked it up to our new Blue Ray Player and it worked great. It's not too long or too short. Perfect!
1,Definitely recommend this! I bought this and it works great. It is much cheaper then buying one in a store for much more.
1,what u see is what u get Works perfectly. I dont see why other cables are in the $50-$100 dollar range. That seems preposterous. It is just cable for heaven's sakes.This one had the correct price for me.
1,"Great product This is a great product at a very reasonable price, I have HDMI cables on all of our TVs and love the quality we get!!"
1,I Love These Cables!!!! I bought these cables because my friend got some for like $40.00 and it looked nice but i didn't want to spend all that money so i went on amazon and i found these for like $4.00 and they look they same as my friend. I would defintly buy these. why would you want to pay $40.00 for HD cables when you can get these for $4.00 and have it look excatly the same.
1,Great HDMI Cable for Price!! The cable was very inexpensive and shipping was very quick and product was as described.
1,Works perfect on PS3 I bought this cable to go with my PS3 and it works just fine. I have an LG 3D LED and the picture looks great in 2D and 3D. Still don't understand why people pay more than a few bucks for a cable.
1,"HDMI ""The 6 foot HDMI product is better than the picture provided as it included cable end caps that protect the gold ends during shipment, storage, or when not in use. Also, the quality can be readily appreciated in the well made connector ends - where the rubber meets the road sort to speak, SUPER!It works perfect like any pricier monsterous etc product out there for much, much less! Yes, I have one of those too - ouch!Amazon, thanx for offering this on our Super free market here in America, my hat off to you! I would like to add that May God Bless America so that she will live on 4 ever without the current push for huge govt controls which history proves do lead to Socialism - Totalitarianism and of course no free markets... unless you consider the illegal/dangerous black markets free and dictators cool..."
1,Great Movie even still.. I remember as a young child going to the movie theaters with my family. Seeing this movie brings back so many memories. I remember feeling scared for the Unicorn as well as hoping that everything would turn out good. I am really glad I was able to find this movie on amazon. Great Movie!!!!!
1,"Mystical This movie meant so much to me, because I remember it from when I was a child. I am so in love with the way the cartoons were drawn. I also love their responses to the questions and task they are asked. There truly is no other movie like it."
1,"Absolutely magical. This movie really does the book justice, which makes sense since Peter S. Beagle adapted the script from the novel himself. The voices fit their characters perfectly, and the animation is wonderful. The opening sequence with the unicorn tapestry is especially nice. And the soundtrack with songs by America can be stuck in your head for days. Overall, a fantastic magical movie. Perfect for any age."
1,"Five stars or more This is an excellent movie for everyone. I first saw it in highschool and was enchanted then and am just as so now. It has beautiful music, great acting, and is funny and serious. When I feel down in this ugly hum drum world of mondainity I pop This wonderful fantasy in the VCR and escape for a while. A good intriguing story. Rankin and Bass are always good. The animation/drawing to some may not seem the best but it is appropriate for this fantasy and is very pretty. A good fantasy anime for the whole family."
1,"the best cartoon to remeber I remeber watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid and I cried every time. I hadn't seen it for over ten years and now I once again own a copy. Even though I'm in college now I still watch it a lot. It's not only a awesome movie, but something that should remind everyone of when they were watching it when they were young."
1,"Enchanting and Beautiful This is one of my favorite movies. When I was really little, my friend had this and we always watched it. When she moved away, she gave it to me. I still have it (I'm 13 now). It's so incredible!! This isn't really a little kid movie, because the storyline is mature for little kids to follow. I love how they make it with the Japanese anime style of animation. Especially when the unicorn turns human, she is so gorgeous. And the music is so touching. I love it also because I love unicorns. If you're an adult, this will bring back childhood memories for you."
1,"The Goodness that is Unicorns and the Movie about Them. I love this movie. My grandparents had it at their house when I was little, and they would let me watch it sometines when I came over. It is of no little amount of sentimental value to me. I love Unicorns, and I always thought that the way this movie ended was a beautiful way to reaffirm the magik in life in a world that has altoghther forgotten it. Again, a beautiful thing. (...)"
1,"Pure magic and heart. A timeless classic. I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was four, and I remember loving it. That was fifteen years ago, and The Last Unicorn continues to inspire me. The animation is amazing for the time, and the music is euphoric and memorable. Above all, the story is captivating and real, and will encourage everyone to believe in the magic and existence of unicorns. It's a timeless movie about believing in what your heart knows to be the truth...and there's even a mean, red bull for the boys who don't care much for magic."
1,"Wonderful, but another site is better this newest version is stunning, now with better picture and sound quality. Unfortunately, and not many people know this, the author of the book and writer of screenplay Peter Beagle does not earn a single cent off of the sale of this movie, except through a special website. [...]"
1,"An absolutely excellent fantasy movie for everyone I absolutely loved this movie as a child and must have watched it over a thousand times. I could hardly believe that I would ever find it again. This movie is so true to the book, which is very rare nowadays. It sparked my interest in fantasy and has to me been a classic for all times. It's touching love story, element of fantasy, and endearing characters have stuck with me throughout my life.I would recommend it for anyone of any age!"
1,"Oldy, but goody I watched this when I was young. My daughter loves the fantasy horses like unicorns and pegusus. She enjoyed the movie. Thanks."
1,"A misterious breathe taking tale of hope, and imagination! This amazing movie stole all of my emotions and put them on film. I laughed, cried, and I stood on the edge of my seat through out the entire movie! I am still just a child and enjoy watching it over and over with my friends and family. It's a great movie that I would love to share with my children. (when I grow up and have some). END"
1,"A Truly Beautiful Film! When I was about four or five years old I loved to watch The Last Unicorn. Spotting it at Blockbuster, I decided to rent it, wondering how I would see it now.I was worried when I saw that the animation was Rankin/Bass, but in the end I found it to be a visual confection.Some of the characters do look a little cheesy, but most of the time the animation dazzled me. In particular Mommy Fortuna's tree stump hat is very cool, forestscapes are ethereal, and I love Molly's BIG brown eyes.My favorite scene is the meeting of Molly and the Unicorn...The woman is angered that the Unicorn came to her at a low point in her life rather than when she was ""new and innocent."" After that schpiel Molly embraces her and whispers, ""I forgive you.""To my mind, this is one of those works like The Little Prince or The Mouse and His Child that is meant for chidren but is sincere enough to captivate adults as well. Well done."
1,"One of the great animated classics I remember loving ""The Last Unicorn"" as a child, and was thrilled to find it for sale on Amazon.com! This movie in it's fantasy setting, with it's subtle yet strong references to the endless struggle of good and evil...is absolutely amazing. This is a movie that will keep you spellbound with a story of love, beauty, greed, and sorrow. It is beautifully animated, and it keeps my own kids glued to their seats each time they watch it. ""The Last Unicorn"" is a must have for your video collection whether you are 5 or 105."
1,Classic !! The Last Unicorn is and always will be one of the greatest animated films of all time. The character journey is one of a kind and is a must see for all who have not been introduced.
1,"One of the best cartoons ever This so brings me back to my childhood, I can't wait to be able to share it with my children."
1,"A true Classic One of the best cartoon movies of the 80s. If you have a child or want to go back to your days as a child, then this wonderful cartoon will bring back those golden moments. Also, if your pagan, this is one of the better movies on the list !...Highly recommended !"
1,"So far so good I haven't watched this DVD yet because it's a present for someone, but it arrived sooner than expected and the DVD is in priginal packaging so it should be perfect. :)"
1,"An Unforgettable Timeless Classic! I have seen this movie countless times since I was a little girl, and it has never ceased to amaze me. I have also read the book, and the movie follows it quite well. The music is spectacular, and sends chills down my spine every time I hear it. It is the story of a unicorn who is in search of the other unicorns, to find out what happened to them. Along the way she encounters both friends and enemies, and disguises herself as human to get past the Red Bull and free the other unicorns. it is an enchanting tale, one both children and adults are sure to fall in love with! I never get tired of it!"
1,"Fairy Tale of the Search for Happiness Growing up in the 1st through the 8th grade I watched this movie through a school summer program every year. I have always loved it.This story is a wonderful fable about the search for happiness. An evil king eternally searches for happiness in the Unicorn. The gallant knight searches for happiness in ""The Lady Amalphia."" The wizard ""Smendrick"" searches for happiness in magic. Molly Grue searches for happiness in legends. But story asks the question of when are people truly happy--but I won't ruin the story. The ending is the best part of the whole story.The movie was a wonderful adaptation of the book, but I say to anyone who likes this movie--read the book and get the FULL story."
1,"For six years i've been searching for it... Ever sinse i watched The Last Unicorn in primary school, i've been searching EVERYWHERE to find it. There was an option for my class, to either visit a gladiator and get an autograph, or stay and watch this video called the last unicorn. I stayed, and i've never regretted it. There was only about 8 of us, and as soon as it started we were fasinated by it. I can only vagualy[can't spell] remember parts, but the rest of the class came in about 20 minutes before the end, and guess what? We weren't allowed to watch the rest. The bull completely hypnotised me! I love fantasy and scary things and the bull terrified me! I can remember a tower with a clock, and a red kind of airy bull along with cages and an eagle, but that's all."
1,"It's the BEST! It ranks right up there with Legend, Labyrinth, and Sleeping Beauty as all time best movies. It's scary, beautiful, and breathtaking."
1,"GREAT ANIMATION!!! The last unicorn is a favorite when i was a kid...this movie got an great story with superb graphics...really good animation, really recommend this unicorn..."
1,Radiates all the best from my childhood I watched this at least a dozen times when I was a kid and I could never get past the beauty and wonder of this movie. I have been waiting 15 years for the DVD.
1,"The last Unicorn movie I first saw this movie when It was given to me on my eight birthday by my grandparents. It stole my heart, no sooner had I recieved it had I seen over and over every day. It broke over time, so my mother bought me another. I can still remeber the songs from the movie before I got my second copy. You'll never see a better movie than this if you love fantasy or your kids do.Excert, said by the Unicorn, "" What she calls a manticore looks to be nothing more than a shabby toothless old lion, and she make them believe that poor old ape with a twisted ankle is a satyr. Deception, Illusion, Mirages, your mommy Fortuna can not truly change things...."" written from my memory."
1,Perfect for a little girl... I watched this movie all the time when I was young. It was my favorite childhood movie. The unicorn and the whole movie just seemed so magical to me. I highly recommend this movie for all children of all ages! An excellent movie.
1,"One of the best films of all time I can't remember when I first saw this, but I really enjoyed watching every so often, now even after all these years, it still brings a tear to my eyes."
1,"Awsome! This was my favorite movie when I was younger. Now I'm in college, and my friends and I are sititng here drinking beer and chilling with ""The Last Unicorn""! I will always love this movie....it will always be a part of me, and it can be a part of you, too!"
1,"Forget all others This is the one. I paid about $89 for the Genica Taurus MP3 CD player. Let me tell you how big a mistake that was, it was defective, so I returned it and it took them 3 weeks to send me a new one, guess what that was more defective then the 1st.Now for the DLINK. Its da bomb folks. It has bass boost, it charges your batteries with the AC adapter, it lets you enter what MP3 number you want, doesnt skip a whole lot, doesnt drain batteries quickly, its the greatest I have tried. Also its the cheapest at $39 after rebates and amazon coupons.Buy DLINK stay away from GENICA"

1,"Essential Music From The Best If you were stranded on an island and could only take one Elvis cd with you this would be the perfect one.There is not a bad song on this cd and it is a good and pleasant listening mix of all of his music.You get the blues,rock,rockabilly,gospel,movies,and some live concert music.One of the best arrangements of songs of all the cds that have been released since his untimely death.If you grew up listening to Elvis music it will bring back so many memories and if you are just getting acquainted with his music you will be pleased and will build happy memories.Not a bad price.Buy it,play it once and you will not want to play anything else for a long time.You will be hooked.This cd brings to mind what all the fuss was about."
1,Elvis Rules This 2 disc CD is wonderful! We have listened to it several times and it never gets old. The song selection is wide range and covers everything from sentimental to romance to rock! I would recommend this to everyone!!
1,"Happy Birthday&Great collection I've always Dug Elvis Presley. this is a Great Introduction collection a Double set that is on point. Suspicious Minds is My Favorite Presley song to this day. these Songs still hold up so well&Elvis's voice is the main reason. he left a distinctive impression with how he presented his take on songs. i already have Elvis collections,but this One is a very Good. a Must have."
1,"Nick Carter's Favorite Book This was an excellent movie. It is Nick Carter of the BSB's favorite book. I would definitely recommed it to everyone, unless you are an N Sync fan."
1,Heartfelt and brave This book is heartfelt and brave and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Stacy Lewis is an amazingly wise and gifted person. And Java is an amazing being in a dog's body! The two of them were destined to meet to inspire all of us to be more conscious in our relationships.
1,"Couldn't put it down! I just started reading JAVA last night, I could not put it down. It's been a long time since a book has been able to make me laugh and cry and totally escape!! I am a dog owner ofcourse so that is the great part, Stacy shares her relationship with her beauty Java and also relates to her own self as a human and how in life we go through many paths and she uses introspect through her relatinoship and experience with Java to depict this very thing! The way the book is written lures you in and makes you think of lots of different things. Even non dog owners I feel would love and learn a lot from this book. I highly recommend it, it's great! WEll done STacy and Java!"
1,"Great Read ""JAVA: The True Story of a Shelter Dog Who Rescued a Woman"" is a very compelling autobiography about how adopting a dog from a shelter and going in the direction life was nudging her (rather than digging her heels in trying to stay put) changed the life of Stacy Lewis in positive and unimaginable ways. Through trying to find help for her very scared and reactive dog Java, Stacy embraces a new career path, new home, new friends and a new lease on life. The story shows how opening ones self up to new possibilities and saying ""yes"", can help a person create a life that is more full than they could have come up with on their own. A good book for animal lovers, life lovers and those who would like to learn how to love life."
1,"great addition to Barney collection If your kid is hooked on Barney, this CD will contain a lot of songs that are in the Barney videos. My daughter recognizes the songs and grunts along, very interactive! Because she is hooked on Barney, we need to have him on TV, in the car and all the time, so this is the CD we play while we are in the bathtub. Her favorites are the ""raindrop song"" (ah-ah-ah she goes!), the yum-yum song and the ""clapping song"". Anything that makes her happy in the bathtub wins points with me. Thanks, Barney!"
1,"great dancing CD this is a CD you can dance to. it's a real energy boost, and everyone can listen to it. a real treat for former viewers of ""the all new mickey mouse club"" is that there is a song by the group MMC on there. (also a treat for 'n sync fans, since JC Chasez sings lead on that song) very good CD"
1,Let's hear more from these artists The Retelling of Dreams is the most mesmerizing music I have heard in a very long time. I hope more cds will be coming along shortly.
1,"Born Free Once again a very awesome family film. Everyone can enjoy this film without exception. It covers love, inner strengths, patience and remarkable friendships that are hard to find now a days."
1,Born Free Excellent movie to watch with friends and family. We enjoyed it thoroughly. Kids will like it as well as adults.
1,Elsa I loved this film just as much as I did when I first watched it as a young girl. I even showed it to a group of teenagers and they were completely captivated.
1,Great Film A classic movie that is still as good as when it was filmed. I enjoyed watching this film with my family and I think you will too.
1,"Excellent movie Saw this movie when it first came out in the early '60s. Quality of the DVD is very good. It's what made me love the big cats and I've loved and respected them ever since. If I could, I'd devote my life to them as George and Joy Adamson did."
1,"Great book.. reflects how Japanese works. Ok, first of all, you *must* learn hiragana & katakana to use this book. I recommend getting James Heisig's book on learning both.That said, this book jumps right into Japanese, and assumes you will *work* to learn the language. Each chapter, assuming you do the exercises will take several days. But they are well worth it.One great thing this book does is use realistic Japanese conversational structures. Most books use convoluted (to the japanese ear) but educational (to the learner) sentences. This book always presents a ""typical"" japanese construct (as well as the more educational styles).One disappointing thing with this book is that I have not been able to locate the tapes that go with it. Other than that, this is a great book to learn japanese with (tho you have to be willing to work hard!)"
1,"an excellent book for language learners at any level This book is excellent. I have used it for years. I just recently bought another one as the old one was getting old. It is straightforward and well-written. It is simple and easy to use. It moves the reader/language learner from the basics to the more advanced stages. It is also very communicative. It is also very non-threatening. I have used so many other books, and found that this is probably the best Japanese textbook I have ever used. Even textbooks used at most colleges are not this good as they often do not take a communicative approach. Japanese should be seen as a language which any person at any age can learn. I have the tapes and I would recommend that you too buy them (if you can find them... not on amazon...OOP). I would recommend that you also watch Japanese television or movies with subtitles to help you also get used to the sounds and conversations. This book may go out of print one day, so I do recommend you pick one up yourself."
1,"Truly outstanding introduction to Japanese I'm currently an exchange student to Japan, and this book did wonders for my Japanese ability. The only ""complaint"" I have is that there is no ""Japanese for Everyone 2"" ... when I finished this book, I searched forever to find a book that could pick up where this left off.Japanese for Everyone covers in one volume what many series cover in three. I use Japanese in my everyday life as an exchange student, so I know first hand- this book is a blessing."
1,"Listen the the Carrie Fisher Commentary I've always loved this film. It has great dialog, great casting, great production and direction. Carrie Fisher wrote the screeplay based on her book, and her commentary on the film is very insightful, honest and funny. She discusses her rehab from drug addiction and her relationship with her mother, Debbie Reynolds. She points how the film differs from her real relationships with her family, discusses the writing process and how she had never written a screenplay before and wasn't sure how to do. And, of course, she's very funny on top of everything else. Buy the movie because its a good movie. The commentary is the icing on the cake."
1,"entertaining and inspiring at the same time Postcards from the Edge is fantastic. Streep and Maclaine bring biting human qualities to the shallow world of Hollywood...realistic, moving, hysterical and first rate performances. Excellent, excellent, excellent."
1,"One of my all time favorite movies Entertaining from start to finish. Carrie Fisher is brilliant, flawed and perfect. Wonderful tale, told on screen by an amazing cast. A movie to be watched over and over again."
1,"Light From Heaven-Mitford series #9 Another wonderful read from the Mitford series. All of Jan Karon's books are comfy, cozy and make you feel at home."
1,"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9) When I started reading The Mitford Years #1, I couldn't put it down until I finished book #8. The story keeps you glued and you feel you know and love Father Tim and his wife personally. I was happy to find that there was a book #9 which brought the whole series to a close. You have to start at the beginning, but it's well worth the read."
1,Worth the price I very rarely buy hardback editions because of the cost but couldn't wait for a paperback version. I was not dissapointed! This finally episode of The Mitford Years wraps up every loose end up beautifully and gives the reader even more insight into the lives of a group that now feels like my own family. Have kleenex handy; I started sniffling on page nine and and didn't stop for the rest of the book.
1,"Jan Karon never fails to deliver! I just finished reading Jan Karon's last book in The Mitford Series, A Light From Heaven, and I kept hoping it would never end. Every book in this series, in my estimation, was as good as, or better than, the previous one. The first one in her next series about Fr. Timothy Kavanaugh is on my bedside table; and even though I've just recently begun reading it, I can tell it's another great book by this lady! For those of you familiar with the Mitford Series, I have just bought my granddaughter the first of the children's books about Cynthia's sweet little white cat, Violet.

1,"My favorite color, brand This color is perfect by itself or over any color- it does a great job toning down colors that are too bright. I have one in every purse, in my drawer at work and in my car!!"
1,"An astoundingly beautiful recording of duduk music. I've been impressed by Minassian's playing with Peter Gabriel and Afro Celt Sound System, and was intrigued when I found he was releasing an album. As a collector of Duduk music (and duduks), I'm utterly astounded at how beautiful this album is. Levon's tone is gorgeous and his accompanists (piano, keyboards, ney flute, violin, tenpur, oud, and percussion) do a wonderful job of complimenting it. Most of the tracks feature Levon's duduk soaring over wonderfully minimal backing tracks, but a few feature some breathtaking vocals courtesy of Roselyne Minassian and Herve Teboul as well. This is the most genuine and successful world music albums I've ever heard."
1,"mellow joys I was a little nervous that this might be a world music exercise in the worst sense of the phrase, particularly with the other instruments listed, since the duduk is at its best when solo or solo with a drone.However I was very impressed by the whole CD. The playing is first class, and manages to be both mellow and incisive. It is always good to hear other duduk players, apart from Gasparyan, since outside Armenia itself, few other ""names"" appear on the CDs available (although there is a Californian Armenian label - which is available in Armenia but which I have never seen in the UK).Wonderful !"
1,"I Love This and I Don't Even Have Kids Warning: Do not read this in a public place or you will make a fool of yourself. I started reading it in a store out of curiousity and was moved to tears in the middle of the aisle. And trust me, I am the biggest Christmas Crab around. But when I read this I felt like the Winter Warlock in ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" when his big icy heart melts. This is a classic. This needs to be an animated special. Until then, get this book and treasure it. Everyone needs this in their lives."
1,"OUTSTANDING!!! I have two girls, ages 4&amp;5. When I read them this book, we all cried together. Max Lucado's, ""The Crippled Lamb"", has got to be one of the finest children's books I've read yet. With it's vivid descriptions of the poor lamb's feelings, and the message of how God turns bad situations into blessings. Thanks to all who worked so hard to put such a wonderful book together.

1,"WONDERFUL Story!!! My mother bought this book and the DVD for my 2 year old daughter. Both the book & the movie instantly became her favorite -- she'll ask to read the book and watch the movie several times a day.It is a wonderful story that will bring almost anyone to tears (maybe even ""Daddy""!).I highly recommend this book & movie for children of all ages (from 1 to 99)."
1,"A ""must-read"" for children of all ages! Max Lucado is a ""master illustrator."" He artistically paints pictures with words and ""The Crippled Lamb"" is no disappointment!Little Joshua, a lamb, feels so different from others. He bears spots while others don't. He doesn't have a mom or dad. He can't run, jump and play like the others, for he has a bad leg. Often feeling down on himself, he finds encouragement in a friend named Abigail, an aging cow.Then one unexpected night, Joshua finds that there is a specialness about his differences. There is a unique role only he can fill.Get the tissues ready! This is a book sure to move even the hardest heart. How vividly it portrays the love of a Father Who loves us inspite of our blemishes and sees each one of His children as special, with purpose!Beautifully illustrated by Liz Bonham, this is a work you should not miss. This one is a ""keeper"" you'll wish to pass on from generation to generation."
