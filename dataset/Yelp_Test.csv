0,"My wife and I used to love Arriba's, til recently when we joined some friends at the end of their table for dinner. We arrived about an hour after they did, and they were finished when we got there.\n I ordered a stuffed poblano chili dish and it really was not good at all. Bad enough that the food was bad, but when we were ready to leave, we asked the waitress for our check, so she gives us a check for the whole table.\n My wife said, \""No-we want our check only\"" and the waitress said that they do not do seperate checks, which is B.S. because we always have gotten seperate checks at the Arriba's in Arrowhead. This created a big hassle for us because we never carry cash, so my wife had to pay back one of her friends for our share of the bill the following week.\n This is no way to conduct a business, and I also sent the main office an email telling them about what had happened, but they never answered the email. I guess customer satisfaction means nothing to them, so we will NEVER go back! \n\n Anyplace can roast chilis, so thats nothing special for Arriba's.\n\n Macayos is the place from now on, and the food there is superior to Arriba's."
0,You get what you pay for.  The food is inexpensive but taste that way.  The only thing good is the bean dip and salsa that you get at the beginning of the meal along with hot corn and flour chips.  The rest of the meal is bland.
0,"Unfortunately, yesterday's visit was one of the worst dining experiences I've had during my 10 years in Phoenix. The food was sub-awful (seriously, a cheese crisp that a 7-year-old deems inedible?), the service was terrible (zero smiles, and I had to basically tackle our server get the check, much less some refills on water glasses), and the atmosphere was equal to that of the third lunch shift at a nursing home.\n\nI won't go back. Ever."
0,"I went into the Scottsdale location yesterday.  I was going to be seated right by the kitchen by the host when the restaurant was 20% full and then asked to be seated in another area where there were more people around and better lighting.  The waiter never cleared our plates, and I had to order 3 meals before I could even eat anything.  This restaurant had dirty menus dirty plates/glasses, slow waiters, the food was unedible and the kitchen was slow...  I think this time I am calling the food inspector.  I am sure that there are many violations happening in this restaurant.  I tried to give them feedback, however, they  did not recieve it well.\n\nPlease don't waste your money.  This is such a poor example of no service and bad food.  I expected to get food poisoning after this experience."
0,"It takes a lot for me to write a review and blast a company like this and to be fair, all the negatives come from their Gilbert location; the auwatukee location has always been good.  I've tried Ariba's several times and have been disappointed every time.  In the four of the last five visits, I've found the floors sticky and the tables dirty.  If they pay this little attention to the cleanliness of the front, I'm scared of what I might find in the kitchen.  Although I've always found the service to be slow and the waiters inattentive, Sunday's (8/5/12) experience was one of the worst I've ever experienced anywhere.  I thought I would take some out of town relatives to a good AZ Mexican dinner, but once we received our water/Ice tea, they were refilled once during our visit and that only after flagging down the waiter.  Minor, maybe, but when the food was delivered to the table, one of the meals was missing and I was assured it would be right out.  20 minutes later I flagged down the waiter once again and with apologizes, was told they would get it right out.  Another 20 minutes went by and my guests had all finished their meals before the waiter came by to see if we needed anything else. When I told him we still hadn't received the meal and since everyone else was done, we no longer wanted the meal and wanted it removed from our bill.  Again with apologies, he left and finally returned 20 minutes later with the meal removed.  Annoyed with the slow service I tried to return the bill with my credit card immediately.  I was ignored and waited another 20 minutes for him to return to take my money.  Save yourself a lot of aggravation and disappointment and go somewhere else."
0,"Arriba has been one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, but tonight I have really had to examine my love of this restaurant. It has been at least 6 months since I ate there and I was really excited about going back. I was seated in the back room. I immediately noticed that it looked like it needed a deep cleaning. My table was clean, but the walls and the areas surrounding the cheesy nature scenes in the back were filthy. The service was good, and my meal came quickly. As I was eating, something caught my eye not far from my table in the nature scene plants. It was a set mousetrap. This really turned my stomach. The food that I was eating was great as usual, but it really creeped me out that the place was so dirty and that they apparently had a rodent problem. My advice to the owners is to bring in a professional cleaning team and for heaven's sake don't leave mousetraps out for the patrons to see."
0,I got sick eating this food.. DONT EAT HERE.. my wifes co workers had the same experience
0,"Omg, what happened to this place. Had some shopping to do across the street.  Me & boyfriend stopped in after work, sat in the bar. Checked out the grease covered hh menu,  order a beer & Jim beam. \nDrinks come & the beer is half ass cold, Jim was fine. Chit chatting with the old man & we noticed a fly...no big deal...As the conversation progressed we couldn't keep the conversation going without swatting flies.  After a while I burst out into hysterical laughter,  this shit was ridiculous!\n Instantly transported back to rocky point hungover eating fly infested tacos roadside and you don't care because your lucky to have survived the night in Mexico!  Its Ok, I'm Mexican I can say this shit!\nAnyway still sitting at the bar waiting for pozole & enchiladas,  the couple right behind us is in sneezing distance - literally this fucking guy is sneezing open mouth all over the place, my back was wet. \nFuck it, I actually taste the food. Eh,  the posole was decent & the spinach enchiladas salty. \n\nOh wait we also ordered taquitos appetizer.  See the photo, the fucking fly posted for a SELFIE! \n\nYou want Mexican,  tons of other places. Skip this place, overpriced.  Loved it back in the day, crash & burn this place is toast!"
0,"Very low budget! Margaritas in a plastic Dixie cup!!! Will not return. We were told because of budgeting. The server Josh was great,he made the visit good. Give him a raise!"
0,"Surly, poor service - we spotted a couple of thick gray-white hairs floating on top of my girlfriend's wine. After scowling at us for bringing it up, the new bartender from Flagstaff poured out the wine and then informed us that these were tiny strands of cheese from our con queso, which my girlfrind didn't touch and was about 2 feet away from her. It is obvious when you have hairs in your drink!\nIn attentive service from that point on, but when we left after awarding the bartender the 5% tip (more than he deserved) he pursued us down the sidewalk to the south, outside the building by walking along the plate glass windows on the inside, banging on them alongside as we walked. \nWhat a weird experience! Been going here for years and years, some of their dishes are quite good, others not so hot; wine list pretty indifferent and slipping. But this kind of behavior is a game changer. I will never go back."
0,"After making a dinner reservation for two, arrived to find several people waiting.  We waited 15 mins past our reservation time and with no other choice, were seated at an after-thought, tv tray-sized table crammed into the corner behind the frosted glass partition at the front door.  On top of that lovely description, every time someone went in or out the door, it slammed against the glass and sounded like a gunshot.  This was enjoyed during our one drink and appetizer before leaving.  So if you're a party of two, be forewarned."
0,"If only zero star was available. After one sip of my drink, I wanted to leave; ordered a Coke but got a flat diet soda. I am allergic to diet soda. The food was just plainly bad. Couldn't wait to get home to use mouthwash and brush my mouth to get rid of the flavor of their food. Please, I am serious, when you want to find a place to go out to eat then go some where else. Not here."
0,"Boo bestbuy. You are a major inconvinience for me. And your employees are brain dead. I only like the fact that you are close to my house, but that sorta doesn't count anymore because Circuit city is now closer to me. You know best by, your not the best and maybe I don't wanna buy from you anymore! Why don't you put that in your back pocket?"
0,The WORST Best Buy I've ever been to.  I was charged $231.27 for an AMP install ... and they crossed the wiring so my right speaker was in the front left and the left speaker was in the right back ... and it kept shorting out on me.  And it sounded like compete shit (go figure) because they never played with the settings.  I went to the Manager Kevin S (he would NOT give me his last name) and he was a total unhelpful prick.  Anthony was the kid who f'ed up my install ... finally I got Keith to FIX the mess up ... Shop ANYWHERE but this store run by complete ASSHOLE PRICKS.  And what ever you do don't let Anthony touch your vehicle!
0,"This is the dirtiest and mostly disorganized Best Buy I've ever been to.   Today it took some girl in customer service 10 minutes to look up whether they had a PC game I wanted.  As it turns out, the game hits shelves tomorrow, not today, but I had to go to 5 stores to figure that out.  The folks at Best Buy said they would not carry it, which is hilarious since I know they'll carry it since it's an expansion pack for a top-selling game they have on the shelves.\n\nIn the words of Napolean Dynamite: \""Gosh, idiot.\"""
0,"Oh yeah, this place absolutely blows. I'll enter in a new reason (though all mentioned are perfectly valid): Limited Clint Eastwood selections in the movie department. Fie!"
0,"Picture it: August 2009.  My HD TV suffers from some unknown affliction.  Luckily I purchased an extended warranty through Best Buy which covers parts and labor through 2011.  Geek Squad's earliest appointment (in-home service) is almost two weeks away.  Day of appointment I miss work to be home.  Supposed to hear between 7 and 9 am.  Nothing, so I call at 9 am to confirm.  Yes, appointment...between 8 and 12.  1 pm: \""Oh, he called and line was busy.\""  No.  No, he really didn't.  After pressing...and pressing...for additional info, turns out the tech didn't go to work that day!  He wasn't at work...but the line was busy when he tried to call.  Huh?!!  Had it been a Saturday, it would have been an annoyance, but I missed work and was then lied to.  I've got a bitter taste in my mouth..."
0,I have shopped at bestbuy on a handful of occasions.  Once at this particular store.  I have never had genuine customer service experience from this establishment.   Every time I shopped here I feel like I am bothering an employee when I ask questions or call in for service status.    \n\nMy last experience was with a camera that had an issue.  This issue was covered under the extra plan I purchased.  I took the camera in.   After 2 weeks I received an automated phone call that my camera was ready for pick-up at the Geek Squad counter.  Before leaving the store I did as most do and I checked out the repair.   The camera was exactly the same as it was before I gave it to the geek squad.  I showed the customer service lady and she said that the paper work shows it was repaired.  She said if I was not happy with the repair I could sign the paper work and re-submit the claim.  This is when I got furious.   I was being asked to sign a paper stating I was happy with the repair and then re-submit the claim that the camera was still broken!!  I refused to sign the paper and asked that the camera be re-submitted with out a second claim.  During all of this I was never apologized to or offered an expedited service.  I had to ask for the camera to be expedited the second time around.  I don't believe they expedited the second claim since it still took another 2 weeks for the camera to come in.  They camera was repaired the second time but I was out of a camera for a month and never did receive an apology. \n\nI have learned my lesson for the last time.   I will now purchase my electronics from one place and this place is newegg.com  These guys know customer service and have a customer for life.
0,"Let me start by saying, historically, I like Best Buy. I like what they stand for, I like their products and I like their customer service. For these reasons, when I recently bought a condo and I was in need of a washer, dryer, refrigerator and television, the first place I looked was Best Buy. However, I picked the wrong Best Buy to make my purchase. \n\nThis review is not about ALL Best Buys. This is about the Best Buy on 20th and Camelback. \n\nLike I said, I purchased a washer, dryer and television and the Geek Squad mounting from this Best Buy. \n\nThe washer, dryer and TV were to be delivered on a Saturday morning by 10:30 a.m.  I received the call on Friday confirming my delivery. On Saturday at 10 a.m. the delivery truck arrived, but there was one MAIN problem. They only had the dryer. Where were my TV and washer? Good question. Well, the washer was on a truck that apparently \""broke down\"" while coming from California. Best Buy didn't bother calling me to tell me that my washer wouldn't be delivered. The television was a whole other story. The sales associate apparently filled out the form incorrectly, and so the order was cancelled. Was I called about either of these issues? No. It wasn't until I talked to the delivery company and 3 different people at Best Buy to \""resolve\"" the problem. At this point it was too late to have my items delivered on Saturday and because I work, I had to wait another week to have them delivered.\n\nBut, this saga isn't over yet. When they messed up my order, they PROMISED me I would have my washer and television delivered by 10:30 a.m. the following Saturday since they messed up my order. I had to be somewhere at 11 so it was impertinent it was delivered before then. They said, not a problem and promised it would be there. \nI called the Geek Squad on Thursday to confirm that my TV would be installed and delivered Saturday. They confirmed that the Geek Squad would arrive WITH the TV and install it. \n\nI then got a call from the delivery truck about my washing machine (remember, they promised it would be there by 10:30 am.) They told me the washer would be delivered between 1-3 pm. I had to argue for a half an hour with the manager before he  final \""pulled strings\"" to \""accommodate\"" my original delivery request. \nBut...it's not over yet. \n\nThe second Saturday morning arrives. The washer gets there. Check that off the list. Then, the Geek Squad arrives to install my TV. Remember, they PROMISED me they'd arrive with the TV. Guess what. They didn't. The poor guys had no idea they were supposed to pick up the TV. In fact, I learned that they aren't even allowed to pick up deliveries from this store. So, my installation guys are there and the TV is missing yet again. They did me a HUGE favor and actually drove across town to this store to pick up the TV (shocking fact; these guys don't work at the store on Camelback. They work at the one on Frank Lloyd Wright). So, they go all the way to the Camelback location to pick up my TV....which they learn was about to be shipped to Texas for some random reason. If they hadn't picked up my TV, I'm sure I'd still be missing it today. Was I ever called by Best Buy with an apology? No. \n\nI don't think I need to explain further why I would never shop at this Best Buy again. I bought my refrigerator from the Best Buy on Shea and it went off without a hitch. \n\nSo my Yelp friends, if you want a seamless experience with your pricey purchases of major appliances, I would suggest you shop anywhere but the Best Buy on Camelback and 20th. Not only did they mess up my order on multiple levels, the sales associate staff was rude on top of it. \n\nThis is not the experience you want when you are making a large financial commitment."
0,"Best Buy is a necessary evil because I don't know where else to get/do the things they have/can do for me.  But if anyone does know a good local electronics place, let me know.  ASAP.\n\nI took my computer to Best Buy to get it recycled.  Computer parts are super toxic and should NOT be thrown into the trash.  They wanted to charge me $10 to recycle it.  Someone step out there and pass a dammed law saying that recycling charges must be included in purchases, for the love of god.  It doesn't take a genius to determine cause-and-effect incentive structures and figure this out.  Oh, tangent.\n\nBut I didn't have to pay $10, because they were going to charge me $20 to remove my harddrive, and that apparently trumps the recycling charge.  $20.  TWENTY.  It's 4 screws.  That's it.  That's $5 per screw.  I asked him if i could just borrow a screwdriver and I'd do it right there.  He said no.  So I went to try and find a screwdriver for purchase in the store.  The only one came in a $30 computer toolkit set.  Defeated, i retreated back to the Thief Squad and paid them $5 per screw, which took them all of 40 seconds, and left harddrive in hand and $20 lighter.\n\nBest Buy, I hate you."
0,"I generally like Best Buy and have always had very good luck with them.  I recently moved just a few blocks away from the 20th St and Camelback store -- This has got to be the nastiest and most disorganized Best Buy I have ever been to. \n\nLast week I was there to purchase a tv bracket -- 70% of the items were out of stock.  The next day I went to purchase a simple cable for my phone -- out of stock.  Last night I went to return an item -- no one was in line, however it took close to 20 minutes for someone to come to the customer service desk.  Once she was there, she didn't know how to use the register, then register ran out of paper once she was ready to process my return and took another 10 minutes for her to find a manger to change the receipt paper.  Employees are rude and mostly brain dead at this store.  I'd rather drive 20-30 minutes to Fry's Electronics in Tempe than ever return to this store again. The manager of this store needs to be fired."
0,"Worst customer service EVER.  This is a repeat offense with the car audio install bay.  \n\nThe rep Anthony has a really offensive sales tactic of treating customers like idiots.  He must have some kind of super power because he told me (over the phone) that what I had in my car currently sounded \""okay\"" but not as good as it could if I bought some new speakers in addition to the deck I was inquiring about having installed.  \n\nYou know what Anthony, I'll go to Fry's or better yet order from Crutchfield."
0,"Ok has been 7 months since my 1 star rating.  I thought I'd stop in to buy a new camcorder.  BIG MISTAKE.  One guy working in the department while the store manager and other employees talked at the customer service counter about what they watched on TV last night.  After asking 3 times for the camera guy to request some help, I gave up after waiting 40+ minutes.  I have now sworn to never go back to this store.  I have no idea how they even stay in business."
0,"Best Buy,you really suck.\nTried to buy a camera the other day.\nMid day,mid week,store pretty empty.\n3 employees hanging around the camera department as I started to look at options.\nNo one asked if they could help,in fact they first stopped their conversation in an attempt to become invisible.\nNo problem,I'll poke around till I either find what I want ,or until I have comparison questions to narrow down choices.\nI think I have it,I'm ready to select.\nWhere'd everyone go?\nI'm so lonely.\nI start to wander a bit and see if they're doing laundry in the appliance section.\nnope.\nMaybe around by the video cameras.\nNope nope.\nUnder a display cabinet?\nNah,that would be silly...\nThey were just gone.\nPoofed.\nVanished.\nVaporized.\nI decided it had to be the nefarious work of aliens.\nYes,I said \""nefarious\"".\nI became frightened in my alone-ness Fearing next would be an invasion of the Apple People of the Crack Basha's.\nWho would protect me?\nThe aliens abducted all the staff of Best Buy,so it would just be me.\nI couldn't possibly stop them all.\nThey would come,snarling their toofless grimaces at me.\nI would be defenseless.\nFearing my life and existance as I know it,I saw only 3 choices.\n1)Face them all.Aliens and Apple People of the Crack Basha's.Fight till the end or vaporization.\n2)Take what I wanted as there was no one left to stop me.\n3)Make a hasty retreat and go elsewhere to purchase a camera.\nGentle readers,as you read this harrowing tale,you can safely assume I chose plan #3.\nNew camera in my possession,safe at home taking pictures of the pets grateful to have gotten out alive.\nSince all the help at Best Buy has been vaporized,you may want to go elsewhere if you'd like to purchase anything that isn't self serve.\nRemember to get a subscription to some crap magazine on your way out.\nThank you,come again."
0,"I am NOT surprised that this store is the lowest rated in the area.\n\nExcuse me, I have a return.  It's unopened but I bought it more than thirty days ago.  I DO have the receipt and you still sell the product, Linksys router.\n\nMgr:  I'm sorry.  We do not take returns over 30 days.\n\nMe:  If I didn't show you the receipt, would you accept it?\n\nMgr  Yes, but you did show it to me.\n\nWay to go mgr, you got me there.  Took it to Frank Lloyd Wright store- they accepted it immediately and told me they didn't care when I bought it but, could only give me a store credit. \n\nGood job guys, got me for $1.75 in gas."
0,"here's a tip - they don't stock their shelves, so what's on display they might not have, and they often have discontinued items on display. lame."
0,Client service is awful. Nobody knows what they can or can't do. Waited on manager to come over to see if they could sell a video game and he said if it's not our policy we can't. Real qualified manager if u don't know the policies. Have had bad experiences multiple times at this location maybe why they have such bad ratings. Try and help the client that is your job don't just try and find every reason why u can't help.
0,The employees of Best Buy are super shady. Purchased over 2000 laptop out of state. Purchased additional ram to be installed by best buy and their geek squad. I stopped by to pick up and they want to charge another $30 for the install. I can't believe how dishonest this company is. The geek squad manager implied she didn't care what the salesman from another store told me. I guess they are all independent!  Customer service is extremely lacking. I knew I should have went to Fry's Electronics!
0,Geek squad is the worst to deal with and NEVER shows for appointments..When you call they can't find work order and when you provide the number that was given for service call they tell you it is someone else and where did you get the number.\nNever again!!!!
0,"DO NOT BUY GEEK SQUAD INSURANCE.\n\nI just bought a brand new galaxy note 4 last week with the full package insurance. After being told I would get $100 off for trading in my iphone, I had to ask as I'm about to swipe my card why I would not get credited, reason, I had a small crack on the back. This crack does not influence phone function or the front screen, cameras, or any phone function. Thanks guys for telling me after I have the plastic out.\n\nA week later, my phone was lost/stolen after a night out. I go to geek squad and after waiting on the phone for upwards of an hour. I finally get to the deductable for the phone. It's $240. The same price as a new Galaxy with a new 2 year contract. OHHHHH and the real kickers are, it takes 2-5 business days for it to arrive AND it's a refurbished phone, not a brand new phone a flippin broken and fixed leftover. I'm beyond furious with them. Also I had to ask the manager about anyway to walk out of the store with some sort of phone, and she more or less dismissed me. This 1 star goes to geek squad. Well done guys seriously you earned this one.\n\nLike I said this review is for Geek Squad NOT the rest of best buy. The computer guys there are fantastic. I've talked to a couple of them and they have been nothing but knowledgeable, honest, and straightforward. If you have computer problems they are the ones to go to hands down. They won't steer you in the wrong direction."
0,"So, they're good for a few things when in a pinch.  Problem is, tags are always mislabeled, they don't stock most items, they're over priced, and they have the worst return policy I have ever seen.\n\nI have a theory that amazon purchased best buy years ago, and made them really crappy so that people would just shop at amazon.\n\nI am just going to buy what I needed on amazon and do same day delivery - which is free during the Christmas season, and have what I need tomorrow afternoon."
0,"I've never seen so many fat, ugly people working in one place and all of them doing nothing.  Yet another store that claims to carry PC games but couldn't tell me when or if ever they would carry a major-market PC game expansion.  This is my 2nd trip there, the last time they tried to sell me a laptop with Vista despite a quick explanation that we were just trying to see if they had any XP inventory.  \n\nUg."
0,"Man what a mess! I found myself walking in circles trying to figure out where to start and where to end. Everything is out of order and the placement of new releases (movies and music) makes absolutely no sense. This store could use a training day in merchandising. The staff seem disengaged and not familiar with the product. Want to throw the staff for a loop, ask for a copy of LA VIE EN ROSE...had to repeat the title several times to two different people who could not figure out what I was asking for. Oh forget it! \nSincerely,  Empty Handed"
0,"Very disappointed and wouldn't recommend them to anyone, actually I would go out of my way to make sure my dogs story is heard. After three vet visits and a month worth of medication and permanent eye damage, my shih tzu is partially blind because of this shops negligence. When I noticed my dogs eye I immediately called the owner who denied any potential wrong doing. Coincidentally my dog was fine before I dropped him off but when I picked him up he all of a sudden either got burned by a blow dryer or cut with scissors per the vet... ON HIS EYEBALL!!! I'm certain it happened at puff n fluff. The owner sounded concerned for his health and said she would follow up in a few days after the vet visit ... Here we are three months later and still no call. Sad because I went there for more than 6 years and no longer feel safe there. Highly recommend looking for alternate groomers."
0,"I'm not sure what gain I would get by accusing your shop of doing this to my dog. As I said I've been going there for years and never had an issue. I'd actually preferred to continue going but your behavior changed that. It was not 6 days after he was there and I'm sorry you don't remember. He was there on Thursday and if you recall my conversation on Monday w you and not just try to refute my credibility, you'd remember I said I walked him Thursday night and noticed he couldn't bare walking near car lights, which made me wonder what happened so I took him to vet Monday when they opened, when he could no longer keep his puss filled eye open. I didn't ask for any vet bills or future bills, but a little accountability would have been nice. So to say it didn't happen and it's a matter of right or wrong doesn't make sense. It's not my integrity that's compromised by writing a review, it's your pure denial and lack of accountability that's questionable. If you notice I don't yelp often and felt compelled to share my story so other eyeballs could be spared. You know we all know accidents happen and we have to deal with things and that's just life. This was an accident and he survived and we are doing just fine, as suspected. If he and my other dog were really like family you would have returned your end of the bargain and checked back, regardless of what you think happened. I never insinuated your shop didn't treat animals like they're family and again have absolutely nothing to gain by purposely putting negative feedback here other than my experience. \n\nCoincidence? Hmm I don't think so, nor did my vet. You would have known had you followed up as you said you would. It's your conscience that needs to be cleansed, not mine."
0,"Martin's auto Repair NOT THAT GREAT!\n\nYELP REVIEWS ON MARTIN'S AUTO - SO POSITIVE, \nBUT THAT'S NOT MY EXPERIENCE\n\n I called Martin's and a guy asked to call me back.  He had time to research my question, what will an oil change cost?  He called me back and said, \""oil change, with oil weight and model specified, $35.  He told me it would take 30-60 minutes and it would cost $35.  But they took two hours and charged \""$55\"".  \n\nI won't/can't dispute the very positive reviews, their lengthy history, hell, these are the actual reviews that led me here.  My experience?  I was overcharged by 57%.  FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT!\n\nAs I complained, the owner, I assume he was the owner, came out but there was no give: the bill; was the bill. \n\nListen, this was a $55 oil change vs the promised $35 oil change.  It was handled.  But I did my research, I called around, I read all the feel-good reviews Martin's had and they still shived me.\n\nMY ADVICE?  BE CAREFUL WITH MARTIN'S.  I DID NOT FIND THEM TO BE THE RELIABLE, LOVABLE NEIGHBORHOOD-AUTOGUYS.  \n\nTHEY OVERCHARGED ME AND KEPT ME WAITING."
0,"The only thing NIbblers is good at is being on time. (Kind of...)\nI ordered basic box lunches, tea, coffee and water for an event for 80 people. The bill was $1500. That comes to $18.75 per person. The sandwiches were those things that have a lump of stuff in the middle which are then cut in half to display said middle. What you end up with is mostly bread. \nThe tea was in gallon sized plastic milk jugs which were just left on the table. Just like everything else, there was no presentation at all. They were on time, but forgot to bring several things so they had to run back to Hq and get them. \nI don't have a lot of experience with catering, so maybe for 20 bucks a person you shouldn't expect much, but this was just cheap, cheap, cheap. I would not use them again."
0,They deserve negative stars I heard that there is new owners and it shows from a terrific caterer to a terrible one I've used them for many charitable events it was always on point now I wouldn't recommend them to the dog pound
0,"I arrived mid-day, with one goal in mind - buying a new mattress for the guest room.  This should have been a very quick purchase, since I pretty much knew exactly what I wanted.  Unfortunately, the salesperson didn't even bother to acknowledge my presence for over 5 minutes.  Finally, I got a quick \""hi\"", and he went back to his other customer.  I walked up and down every aisle in the store, waiting, waiting, waiting, while he walked them from bed to bed while they tried laying on each one.  Seriously? I could have chosen and paid for my bed in the amount of time it took them to try out just one!  Someone needs to instruct him on handling multiple customers at once.  Two isn't really that many! Since the salesman was clearly more interested in serving them, I left and bought my bed at Mattress Firm instead."
0,"About 7 years ago I purchased one of their mix-n-match 99.00 deals for my spare bedroom! After the set-up, I noticed that the box spring was completely made of cardboard!! The mattress was not much better and the WHOLE thing was thrown out in about 6 months! Well, I figured, you get what you paid for..my bad!! About 9 months ago I was back at Sleep America....thinking it was my mistake the last time...this time I spent almost 900.00 for a queen set for my teenage son. Every morning I have noticed a really funny sound when he is getting out of bed, and low and behold ...the box spring is CARDBOARD!!! MY BAD AGAIN for not inspecting, but I feel SOOO CHEATED!!! The mattress isn't that great either!! I will be replacing shortly and I can ASSURE you that I will NEVER step foor in a Sleep America again!! ughhh..BTW...it was not at this store...the store I purchased from was in Gilbert and is no longer there!"
0,"We purchased a high end mattress that was delivered on May 30, 2011. It has become very uncomfortable to sleep on it and the concern to make it right is non-existent at this point. They have received a report from Integrated Bedding Group but so far have failed to acknowledge that report. One of their reps told me that just because it was uncomfortable didn't mean it was defective. They tell you to shop local so you would think they would care about satisfying a customer. Never again will I shop there!"
0,"Very poor customer service. Apparently when you only have one customer sitting at your computer is more important. In addition, very rude sales person who must assume they are the only mattress provider in Phoenix. Needless to say we walked out from what could have been an easy sale and I rather go spend my money elsewhere."
0,"I took my BMW here because the dealership I purchased it from (used) took it here to have an oil leak repaired.  First off, the oil leak was \""repaired\"" only to find out later that it really wasn't.  Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket, which either occurred when this shop put the part in, or they purchased it with the defect, but either way, the problem was missed on their part, which tells me they do not pay attention to detail.  \n\nSo, when we noticed the leak was still an issue, it was under warranty through this shop for the original work, so I took it back.  I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley, they did repair it, however later that day my \""service engine\"" light came on, then went off.  A few days later, I parked my car, turned it off, and went to start it again after picking up my mail, and the car would not start.  Thankfully, my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty), we towed my vehicle back to my house, which was only down the road, but it was dead.  Come to find out, the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way, which is what tripped my \""service engine\"" light a couple of days before, and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle, the vehicle finally wouldn't start.  My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak), and there have been zero issues since.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if this shop did this on purpose, or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well.  But, given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn't notice was defective or they messed up themselves, and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished, I am not very happy.  On top of it, I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance!), and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son, and I were both sick at the time.\n\nI would NEVER recommend this shop to anyone, I will never ever go back, and I also intend on notifying the dealership I purchased my vehicle from of the issues in the hopes that they choose another BMW shop in the future to service any used BMW's that come onto their lot.  What a complete and utter nightmare."
0,"If I could give negative stars I would. One of the used car salesman hit me with one of their cars. After being cited by Phoenix PD, he proceeded to lie about who owned the car and what insurance was responsible. Later, after finding out that Auto-Europa actually owned the car and was responsible I tried calling to get insurance information. I spoke with Jason who was rude and dismissive and refused to give me any info so now I have to hire an attorney to file a civil suit. If this salesman Joseph Pratt and the owner/manager Jason are any indication of the type of service and sales it's my duty to warn everyone of their scumbag practices."
0,"Recently purchased a car here. Thought it would be decent, due to average reviews and featured on an app I downloaded for recommended dealers. By far not the best experience. They will tell you what you want to hear during the dealing process, and then make all sorts of excuses not to follow through with promises. \n\nHave had issues with the car, drivers window quit working, so they told us to let the guy who was replacing the windshield know. We did, the guy fixed it, we were on our way. \n\nCame time to make our first payment, which they told us wasn't due for another two weeks, and then a few days later was supposedly due and late, and informed us that we owe them now for the drivers side window. And since we were late, it \""threw up red flags\"" for them. Really?! So not coming through on your cheap little 500 mile warranty didn't throw up \""red flags\"" for us as consumers? Whatever.  \n\nThese people are very shady. Do not let the initial welcoming manner fool you. They are money sharks and will not help you whatsoever in good faith. Shop around and stay away from them. The only reason we didn't give the car back is the 1000 dollars we had already paid. We are just going to go to our regular mechanic now, and deal with them as less as possible.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, the car blew a head gasket a month after we bought it. They want $2600 to fix it, and will not do anything in good faith. Waste of a lot of money $1700 to be exact (down payment, first month worth of payments and all the towing)... Words of advise...STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE. There are way better dealers in the valley that will help you. We now have to save up for another down payment for a different car. They can eat s**t."
0,"Wow, I have never received such crappy service in my life. The Barista must've worked for the welfare office or dmv, or another city service job, cause her attitude showed. Sometimes these people forget what they do and who they work for. Avoid this location, either go to the on on camelback or 7 st."
0,"Shady pricing!!! I took my 12 year old nephew there and they charged me $17.00 for a fade. The price chart say that children under 13 are $14.00. When I questioned the inaccurate fee I was told that it's an extra $3.00 to get \""lined up\"" which wasn't even given to us as an option nor was it on the price chart. We will never go back and we will continue to spread the word about their shady prices and hidden fees."
0,"I don't understand the regular bustle and patio crowd here, except for maybe the wine.  I thought the sandwiches were just so so, unmemorable.\nthe tea as well."
0,"So, I've been going to this place for years, not b/c the food blows my mind, but rather it hits the spot. Plus, I love sitting on the patio drinking wine when the weather is nice with my best gal. \n\nAnyhow, my other best gal, my mom had never tried this spot. I  thought Duck would be great for a quick casual lunch. She's a vegetarian so we ordered the Where's the Beef sandwich to share. It took about 20 minutes to make the sandwich, which feels like an eternity when your hungry.\n\nWhen I glanced at the sandwich I thought perhaps they had added some portobello mushrooms to it. Turns out, the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado. REALLY!!!!??? I mean come on! Avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians. How can you F this up? It was truly nasty. It got me to thinking, if someone actually put this into the sandwich, what else would their low standards allow them to place into an unsuspecting victims sammie. It's not like they make them with blindfolds on. I was really grossed out.\n\nWhen I brought it to the manager's attention, she didn't seem that bothered by it. They remade half a sandwich for me, and that was that.\n\nIt was annoying b/c I left feeling that Duck & Decanter takes for granted the fact that loyal customers will stick with them no matter what. Well, not this one.\n\nPlus, that place needs a serious dusting. Yuck."
0,"I was very shocked to see that my review from yesterday had been hidden! What is the point of this website if people can't write their opinion? Obviously whoever is in charge of this restaurant's yelp site didn't want people to see how POORLY my children and I were treated at this establishment. A friend of mine and our 3 little boys (two of them babies) came into eat yesterday when a manager came to us and told us we needed to quiet it down. It was quite ridiculous and offensive, seeing that two of the children are ONE year. Yes sir, let me talk some sense into my baby and tell him that he is being rude. I bring my children out to eat quite often and have never had this issue, my kids are not in any way out of control or bratty. Also, a note to whomever this concerns in management in control of this site: if you take my post down again, I will continue to write this review."
0,"I was a fan of this place 10 years ago and moved out of state. I recently moved back and was excited to take my partner and out of town guests to this eatery!  It was awful, long wait, skimpy sandwich, loud music on patio, so loud and somewhat abrasive when the singer talked to the audience. I couldn't hear or talk to the person sitting right next to me.   This was the 29th and a Sunday brunch.  Disappointed, will not go back, especially since there are so many new and fantastic eateries in Phoenix!  You can't rely on a name, Duck and Decanter, your poor service, etc will catch up and you will not survive.  My advice to all who ask,  where is a good place to eat, I will say not Duck and Decanter!"
0,"I arrived a bit earlier than their opening time of 11am (about 5minutes too soon), and figured I would wait until they opened because I needed a new flat iron. I peeked through the front window because the flat irons were on a display facing the window so I figured I'd window browse until they opened. At 11:03 the brunette \""manager\"" (she was pretty young) started unlocking the doors for the employee who had just arrived, smoking a cigarette on her way in the door. Then the same manager opened up the gates on the windows and walked away. I tried to make eye contact with her because it appeared that the gate opening signalled they were open and I wanted the go-ahead to enter but she refused to look at me. So finally I just opened the door and asked \""are you open now?\"" very politely. The manager snipped \""Yes, we don't open earlier than 11. Those are the hours!\"" with a frown and a white-trash attitude. I said \""okay thats fine... I just wasn't sure if you were opening the gates because it was officially open or not.. wow.\"" \n\nNow, I know how irritating the \""waiting at the window\"" customer can be so I tried my best not to be that person - but was not greeted, was treated rudely and received a nasty \""welcome\"" by the angry-at-life manager.\n\nThen the employee girl and manager started talking together about going out to clubs, about how they were 30 dollars short on the till the day before because they counted it too fast the night before because they wanted to \""get out of here and go out!\"" and other inappropriate conversation. The employee did her best to be polite and helpful, but it was clear she had never been trained on proper customer service (probably because her manager is so awful).\n\nI ended up buying the flat iron thanks to the help of the employee. At one point another customer tried to pay with a credit card, but the employee had to wait for the manager to get off the phone so she could use the dial-up to swipe the card. When the employee asked the manager to end the conversation so she could help the customer the manager yelled \""No just wait!\"" from the back of the store. I was shocked!\n\nToday is a Sunday so I don't know if this is the regular manager, but this relatively young brownhaired woman was like a bad joke. I won't be returning again, even if this styling iron fries up tomorrow! Not worth it!"

0,"Today is 4-15-2011 and myself and my husband were driving back from another place and came upon Europa Pastry Cafe. I am European and my husband is Middle Eastern so we love authentic cuisines from all over. My husbands sister-in-law is of the boat Polish and cooks like a goddess and we were craving some good food/pastry. We went in and right off the bat there was such a great aroma of pastry. My mouth was watering. I still did not go over board as we have learned our lessons from the past. Place was clean and well organized. Not much of selection of anything but i guess for the space it is was ok. We were asked if we were ready to order, we were asked in a cold way. Jeeze, we are customers say hello or have a smile. So this was a bit of a turn off. We ordered 4 different things. 10 minutes after ordering we were home and cut the cinnamon/raison bread holy crap it was horrible. It was dry it fell apart and had a stale and bland flavor. I want so much to return the crap right back to them. I have not tried any of the other 3 items but, I hope they are good where I can forget the crap raison bread.\n\nI will never go back. Knowing first hand how Polish pastries and food is supposed to taste I can say this place rates at the bottom. Polish food is VERY GOOD and very favorable and this place does not add up."
0,"the bakery is okay but the service is terrible; went in on Saturday to pick up a cake I paid for and ordered on Tuesday; Waited 40 minutes and then when they finally got to me they said they had not started on the cake yet! I waited 40 minutes and there were only 2 people ahead of me. 3 employees walked by and did not aknowledge the wait; They told me to come back (too bad I pre-paid for the cake) and did not apologize, just went to the next customer; there are much better European bakeries in N. Central such as Karl's or Jana's that are better bakeries and better in service"

0,"My words in this review will most likely not convey my disappointment with this establishment.  However, I will try my best.  I dropped off a prescription Tuesday evening.  I pulled up to the drive-thru and waited at the window for over 5 minutes without being acknowledged.  Not a \""hi, we'll be right with you\"" Nothing.  I wasn't in a hurry and understand that these places can get crazy busy so I waited this time without pressing the \""Call for service\"" button and when I finally did, waited another several minutes before I was rudely greeted by a younger girl who looked like she would rather be doing anything at that moment besides helping me.  I then gave her the prescription and it took her another several minutes to tell me that they would have to order it and it wouldn't be available for me to pick up until that Friday!  I was a little upset that I needed my medication and would not be able to obtain it until then, but I figured what can I do, and agreed to be there Friday to pick it up.  Upon arriving Friday after work, I was in a hurry to get home and figured they had plenty of time to get it good and ready for me by Friday afternoon and assumed it wouldn't take more than a couple minutes.  First off, they only had one of what I had been expecting three of, THEN they wanted to charge me over 80 dollars for something that has always cost me 10.  I said that there must be some mistake and the \""kid\"" behind the counter said he didn't know what to tell me except this is what they are supposed to charge according to my insurance company.  So I left, extremely upset, without my medication.  Then I called my Insurance company and I was told that CVS was wrong and I was only supposed to pay the 10 dollars as usual.  When I went back, I was prepared to sit and wait as long as it took in order to get my medication at the price I was supposed to be charged.  I ended up spending over an hour in the CVS this time until they finally figured out they were wrong.  I ended up leaving that day with my medication which I paid the amount expected from the beginning and left with a smile on my face and at no time was rude to the \""less than educated\"" workers behind the counter because while I waited for them to fix their mix up, there were several customers who were presented with similar situations, all of which were not nice to the staff.  This however is no excuse for them to be little punks and not give a crap about people, this is our health we're talking about and it should not be dealt with by a bunch of dumb dumbs...  I will most likely be going elsewhere next time I need a prescription filled."
0,"Avoid this pharmacy especially if you are on any critical medications and can't risk errors and/or long delays in getting your prescriptions refilled. \n\nCVS seemed like a safe option after my insurance plan and Walgreen's parted company, but has proven to be anything but. It has now taken seven different attempts to get a simple prescription refill, one that was easily filled correctly the first time at Walgreen's with no issues. \n\nCVS has said it was ready when it wasn't; filled it with less medication than the prescription specifies; argued over what the prescription calls for;  told me on one visit that it was not covered in my plan without even checking; finally recognized they had not done it correctly and said they would; notified me it was ready to pick up and then called back to say oops, they needed more time to get the rest of it in; notified me that the new version was ready for pick up only to give me the old, incorrect version and  then go to the back to find the newer version of it, which I purchased, only to find they had gotten closer to being correct but had once again shorted me on the medication. \n\nI have cancer, and the time and energy it has taken to deal with this one prescription has been very wearing. Fortunately this is not a life-saving medication, but if a simple prescription is handled this badly I would not trust the people working at this pharmacy to handle a complex one. Additionally, the majority of the individuals that I have encountered have been rude and curt, with no real interest in serving the customer."
0,So slow. One cashier and 5 customers!!!!!
0,The pharmacy here is the WORST!  In the last several months the service has gone down the tubes.  Routinely get the wrong medicine (and sit in the store for 10 minutes and listen to how many others this happens to)!!  Service is the worst too!
0,Worst pharmacy service ever! Messed up my prescription several times this year already.
0,"I hate this CVS with a passion. There are always people hanging outside begging for money. Sometimes, CVS allows these fundraiser groups to hang outside their door and ask you for money on your way in/out. I normally wouldn't care, but I'm not handing cash to a cheerleader to go to camp when there are children dying of cancer that could use the money more. Just saying. \n\nAnyway, back to the panhandlers. About a year ago, I was coming out of this CVS and heading to the bus stop. As I turned the corner, a guy approached me asking for money and before i could answer, he pulled out a knife. Luckily, I was able to run to the bus stop and the bus came right then. I was pretty shaken up because it was summertime and nobody was really around in that area (it was by the drive thru pharmacy). That evening, I decided to call the store and ask to speak to a manager to address their issues with people begging for money. Not only did I get an attitude, but the lady from the description of the guy that I gave her, seemed to know exactly who this person was (described him as a regular customer). She defended him by saying that it didn't sound like something he'd do. Um, excuse me? I was able to give her the exact time according to her that he is around CVS, a description, etc. Why would I lie about this? So a simple task like keeping panhandlers away was proven to be too difficult for CVS to handle and their managers could care less about their customers."
0,"I am running out of CVS pharmacies to get my prescriptions correct.  I went in early yesterday with a prescription for medicine that had to be ordered from God-knows-where, and was assured that I would be able to pick it up today.  Well, my prescription sat there for 24 hours before anyone got around to placing the order. Because it is Friday now, the medicine will not arrive until Monday.  I need my medicine and nobody seems to care. Thanks, whatever your name is, for your cluelessness. One week later I have finally been advised that THIS DRUG STORE CANNOT GET MY MEDICINE, and they told me to look elsewhere.  Can you imagine having a pharmacy that does not stock/cannot get the medication you need?  I am sick to death of CVS...good f%^&*#@ bye!!!!"
0,"CVS is pretty standard, right? Pharmacy, overpriced beauty section (but you sure avoid going to Ulta if you can find what you're looking for there), great sales--on booze, on food, stationery, games--whatever. When I lived across the street, I used to come here at night when I was bored and it wasn't busy. Now, though, there are new employees and unfair practices. On more than one occasion, the employees have held sale items for themselves behind the counter. Today, there were no Connect Four on the shelf, but there was one in the cart behind the counter. When the manager was asked about it, she shrugged and pointed at another employee. I've worked in retail before, and this goes against most store policies. \n\nSo, the next time you get a CVS flyer, remember that if it's okay for the employees to shop the sales for themselves here--then it might be happening all over the place. And if they can put one item behind the counter for themselves, then they can put a lot more for their friends. Prepare to be disappointed. Make the extra trip and hit up Wal-Mart."
0,"Very frustrating experience.\n\nI came here to get my passport photo done. I walked up to the counter that had a giant overhead sign that said, \""PHOTO\"" on it. I waited for 10 minutes as I watched cashiers and the manager chit-chatting behind the counter. I kept smiling, but they just looked away. Talking about whatever they did over the weekend was much more important. Finally, I had to say, \""Excuse me?!\"" rather loudly because of the volume of their conversation. The manager turned my way and said, \""Oh! Has anyone helped you?\"".\n\nFast-forward a couple minutes. The manager didn't know how to properly take the photo. She didn't tell me when she was taking it, and when I requested to see the photos she said, \""Oh. I already printed one.\"" She made me wait then gave them to me, told me to go to the cashier's counter, and walked off.\n\nMy photo looks incredibly pissed off. Hopefully the consulate won't reject my Visa based on how angry I look, haha.\n\nOverall, annoying experience. I won't be using this CVS Pharmacy again (unless, of course, there is an apocalypse)."

It was very slow to have our order taken, and it took almost 40 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food. The food itself was tasty enough, once it finally arrived.\n\nHowever, the worst part about this meal was the COCKROACH that we discovered on the wall over our table.  Immediately, my friend and I began to point at it and talk loudly. We tried to get the attention of waitstaff for several minutes.  Finally, the cockroach fell onto our table. That was it. We leapt out of the booth and exclaimed \""COCKROACH!\"" Is this the worst part of the visit?  NO.  Waitstaff then came over, pulled back the table, squashed the cockroach, and then gestured for us to resume our meal and said \""Cockroach gone.\"" \n\nAt least the manager comped the meal.  But,  if there is one cockroach allowed to crawl around the dining room TABLES, I can only imagine what the kitchen might look like. I definitely can't imagine going back!"

Because of their errors, my paycheck was held up for a month! AND you get to pay the office $25 each time they fill out paperwork. \n\nI've been to 3 other orthopedic surgeons over the years in the valley and none with as poorly managed office as this.

Mind you this is the woman who was threatening physical violence against us not 10 minutes before. If you'd like to be treated as a CUSTOMER, and not a whipping pole, I'd suggest ANY other bar. If you'd like to be treated like absolute garbage by a raging alcoholic, head on in.  The bar tenders were ok, but clearly not fast paced enough to handle our group of 12."
0,"I was having issues with my laptop turning on, some times it would and other times it wouldn't. They were unable to figure out the problem and advised me that my computer had several viruses. Which I found odd because I had someone else already do a virus scan and they found ZERO. Data Doctors wanted me to pay a ridiculous amount of money, on top of what I paid for them to figure out the problem (which they were unable to do)  and he said its very possible that I had 250 viruses on my computer. He stated that this other expensive scan would be able to find them and then if I pay even more money then they can get rid of them. My computer was not even worth the asking price of what they wanted to fix it. I then contacted a friend and I was referred to another shop that would look at it for free....although they couldn't figure out the issue either...they told me that I have absolutely ZERO viruses on my computer. The whole thing seemed so fishy.  DD also did not finish diagnosing my computer in the time I was promised and I  had to keep calling them. They didn't even start looking at it until I was on my way."
0,"Horrible customer service.  Paid $400 to get computer fixed, however after reinstalling computer my printer would not work.  The lady on the phone said they would have to charge me AGAIN for reinstalling proper drivers.  Really?  I will never use these people again."
0,"Bah!  Below is my outdated review.  I hate Danny's. Do not come here.  I got my oil changed and they forgot to put a plate back on the bottom of my car.  I found out when I brought my car into the dealer for a repair.  They were like, uh, do you know part of your car is missing....  my friend also had a bad experience.  Over $200 for a crappy detail job.  Don't bother.\n\n\nWhat to say about Danny's...    It's a full service joint.  You can have your car washed, oil changed, tank filled all while relaxing in an air conditioned sitting area.  The prices are on the high side and it can be quite busy.    I'm still looking for a cheap place to get my car washed, but I do bring my car to Danny's for oil changes."
0,"\""Been there - done that\"", with this discrepant racket.  Besides the mediocre wash jobs - the customer service, in a blatant word - SUCKS.  First, they threw out my clothes that were slated to be taken to the dry cleaners.  That car washing cost me nearly $300.  I boycotted the place after the owners claimed no responsiblity.  \n\nThen, in a desperate moment over a year later - I had an oil change and a wash just before leaving town on a Sunday morning road trip - nothing else was open.  I was told that the transmission fluid was low and it needed to be filled.  Halfway up the hill on I-17 North there was  pinkish crap blowing out of the tail pipe all over the back of the SUV and the idiot light on the dash indicated trouble.  The diagnosis given to me by the car repairman enroute was the transmission fluid had been over filled.  Nice.  Of course, Danny's Car Wash was not responsible.  I now done with them - figuring I got off lucky with the vehicle still in tact.  \n\nBut, you'd think I was from East Texas - the third time is really the charm.  The car was \""For Sale\"" and I had painted this fact on the outside of the back windows in water soluble paint.  In my final heinous act - I ran it thru this car wash, calling attention to the windows to the incipient attendant.  He assured me it was \""No problem.  We'll get you all taken care of.\""  The car wash complete and not outside my realm of expectation.  It was rendered to me with remnants of paint still plainly on the windows and the attendent present shrugged his shoulders.  When I pressed the issue, he suggested I to speak to the manager.  The rudimentary attendant was no where to be found.  The manager appeared.  Cut to the chase - they didn't even try to reclean the windows.  In the final scene I was driving out of the lot with dirty windows and the entire outside staff flagrantly geering and laughing!   \n\nI know... sounds like the dumb chick in the horror film - but I think it's safe to say - that was the last time I left tracks in that driveway.  If I could deduct stars from this business, I'd give them MINUS - 5 stars.  There's my experience and opinion of Danny's Family Calamity Car Wash.\n  \nCheck out Quick n Clean on 16th Street and Colter - Fabulous!  Inexpensive.  Excellent customer service!"
0,"They just phone it in.  On top of that, they bother the heck out of you to spend more money there, and then they take so long to finish that you're in too big of a hurry to notice just what a lousy job they have actually done.\n\nThis review is especially for their Scottsdale location at Shea/Scottsdale Road, but it really applies to all of their locations as I have used many of them over the years.\n\nI lived in the Phoenix Area for more than 40 years before my current job took me to Southern California.  During that time I drove vintage cars and always wanted them to be looking nice.  In the mid-nineties, the car wash that I had frequented 2-3 times per week for years changed hands and the quality just fell apart.  I had noticed Danny's all over town, and decided to give them a try.\n\nThey were spectacular in those early years.  I got great service, everyone was friendly, and you didn't have those annoying \""how about a detail, oil change, upgrade to first class\"" upselling as you drove up.  You chose, you paid, you hung out in a nice place while they really cleaned your car up nice.\n\nThen somebody got greedy...  At first, there was this attack of the upsell elves coming up to your car and asking you if you wanted to buy more stuff, sometimes two-to-three times.  I fended them off at first, but they became so persistent that I complained, and well, I got a bewildered \""it's our right to make money\"" attitude from them, so I basically started looking elsewhere and just used them when I was desperate.\n\nCut to the present.  I came back this last weekend to visit family, and my volvo wagon was a mess.  Kid, dogs and busy wives lead to a critical mass where the car just needs to get washed once a month.  I had some time so I took it to Danny's which was close by.  Bought the \""Royal\"" wash which set me back nearly 30 bux.  I was sure my car would be clean enough to build a satellite in when I got it out the other side.\n\nWell, after being chased around the exterior waiting area by bees for 45 minutes, I finally saw the attendant waving his rag at me that my car was done.  Or at least to their standards.\n\nBut not mine, oh heaven's no.  There was still bird poo on the roof.  When I pointed this out, the guy sheepishly griinned and made a half-hearted attempt to rub a few of them off with a rag.  When I scratched at a couple with my nail and they just came away, he just shrugged his shoulders.\n\nWe were in  a hurry at this point, so we just got in and sped off.  But wait, there's more.  While we were driving back to the house, we noticed that they hadn't vaccuumed around the inside of the car in any \""not so hard to reach\"" areas like the center console or under the front of the seats.  I can sometimes forgive not getting in the nooks and crannies, but there was still TRASH in some of the places.  \n\nLooking around more, I noticed that the car's interior handn't really been \""protected\"" with the goo they use -- the tops of the doors, the dash top, and that's about it.  The center armrest was filthy and definitely not clean, and the back seats were still dry as a bone.  I noticed that the workers there obsess over new cars and cars with lots of chrome.  As I was dodging the killer bees I watched in amazement as the chrome bumper of a very large Ford pickup was polished like the mirror of the Hubble Telescope.\n\nBut they are totally phoning in the work on the family car.  My 8-year-old Volvo is far from a beater, but it doesn't compare to some of the exotic French and Italian stuff I used to have.  I still feel it should get the same attention, especially at $30."
0,"I have been several times just because it is convenient. Last time, I had two shirts stolen out of my backseat. I went in and told the manager. He acted like I was making it up. I paid to have my car detailed and spent almost $80.00, and it looked like I got the basic wash. They didn't even get all of the tar (my main reason for detailing) off of the guards. I will never go back. I would rather do it myself than be so mad that I wasted the money everytime I go to Danny's. Ok, the owner must be a complete idiot. He will have the guys for immigration in soon asking for green cards. Talk about a \""run for the border\"". Taco Bell."
0,"Everytime I go to this place I wonder why.  Why do I pay for the VIP wash when they do no more than what you get for the basic?  I went this last weekend and my SUV literally went from vacuum to wash to interior in less than 10 minutes. \nYes, you'd think that would be a good thing.  But there were literally 3 cars ahead of mine in the row it was in.  This place is based on pushing cars through, NOT cleaning them.\n\nThey did nothing more than smear their cheap version of armor-all on the tires and wash the windows.  This is VIP?  What a joke.  I told the attendant (who actually spoke english!) to run it through again, this was pathetic, but he said, no I'll clean it, and he took a dirty rag out of the back of his shorts (he might as well have used his tighty-whities, they'd be cleaner) and started rubbing down the console and such.  \n\nYeah, that's what I want.  Danny, you should be ashamed to put your name on this joke of a car wash.  And I should be double ashamed to have run my car through this place repeatedly over the years.   What am I thinking?  I'm an idiot.  Never again."
0,"No shock at all on the numerous bad reviews for Danny's. I wish I would have read them before I took my car in. Why you ask? Here goes:\n\nThey stole my change (probably over 15 bucks).\nExterior was dripping with water and back was streaked with mud.\nThey wrote on the car window, \""basic wash\"" and it did not come off after the wash.\nIf they vacuumed the interior I couldn't tell, I can tell you they didn't vacuum the floor mats, or the driver's side.\nThey didn't wipe down the interior; there was still dust exactly where I left it.\n\nNormally I would have back to complain, but after waiting over an hour I just wanted to get F out of there. Danny's should take some lessons from Los Olivos, they do a proper car wash.\n\n1 Star is generous."
0,"Wife took our vehicle in today for a wash - said she was thinking of skipping it because it looked like rain.  Hindsight that was a BIG mistake.  Arrived evening - just after 5pm.  Paid for wash that was adequate at best.  They had the drivers door open on the vehicle when she walked out - pretty normal protocol.  She got in and drove home - only to realize the interior driver's side door latch was broken.  She had to power the window down to reach and release the exterior door.  I was jammed up so she drove straight back.  Spoke to manager - Martin Mejia.  He claimed the vehicle was like that when she arrived, which begs the response she provided 'your employees saw me get out of the vehicle - i would have had to roll the window down to do that'.  He was NOT interested in taking any responsibility and said they had looked all over for her - it was 5:20 and my wife and daughter were inside the waiting area and there was only ONE other customer in the building.  None of what he said was true and when my wife looked at the cashier - who had started to speak up - the manager stared her down.  My wife said 'are you going to coax her into lying now because she knows no one came to find us as you are saying'?  Here's the reality - and yeah i watched Columbo as a kid - was after hours, the cleaning guys on the cars were rockin and rollin, blowing over the windows with big damp rags, one of the rags wrapped around the interior plastic door trigger, and some tugged hard.  End of Story.  Now i get to see if there is any integrity in the corporate office.  I'm not optimistic."
0,"Go to Lindstroms on Indian School!!!!!!!!\n\nIts been 3 or 4 weeks since I last washed my car, so I took it to Danny's yesterday because the location was more convenient than Lindstroms - Trader Joes was on my to-do list.\n\nI had little mud splatters on one side of the car - somebody must have driven through a puddle while I was parked.  But I was getting the car washed for general reasons, not just because of the mud splatters, so I made the mistake of not looking closely after Danny and his Family were done washing.\n\nWhen I got back home, I noticed most of the little mud splatters were still there.  My first thought was \""sh%t, its paint and not mud\"" but I scraped one with my finger and it came right off.  And there are water spots all over one window, coffee and dust in the cup holder, etc etc.\n\nSo now I need to go back and argue with a manager, or pay again at Lindstroms.  I think I will pay again and go to Lindstroms - I've been a big fan ever since they got raided by the Country's Worst Sheriff:)  You get raided by Sheriff Joe, you must be doing something right."
0,"Uhh should have listened to yelpers! My roommate said this place was good so I went this morning and now, I'm regretting it. My car is still dirty but now I have messed up tint on my back window! I have no idea how they managed to mess up factory tint but now every time I look out my review mirror it's a reminder of how terrible this place is. When I brought this to there attention a guy with gold teeth pretended like he all of a sudden didn't speak english! I didn't have the time to try and speak with anyone else but, if I ever go back it will be to complain. The car is dirty and I'm sad. Don't do it!"
0,"Danny's Family Car Wash is a reminder of all that is wrong with this world.  \n\nThis is nothing less than a third world car wash with all the dirty water, inattentive labor and indifference that you would expect from people that really do not want to be there.\n\nLook Danny, here it is bro.  If you don't want to run a car wash, do something else.  If I was in your family, I would be the one that does not talk to you."
0,"Danny's Car Wash has become synonymous for me with the words \""HELL NO!\""\n\nDanny's was a 5 star Car Wash 15 years ago! \nThis place use to really have the WOW FACTOR!\nI liked it so much I had my vehicle dolled up here as if it came out of the factory show room several times a week... Going to Danny's was a Friday ritual before going out on the town! With the friendliest customer service & a Job #1 attitude, I use to think how I can motivate people like this! I even went to different locations, because I thought maybe the people @ the highland location think I'm a repeat customer & are going the extra mile to keep me coming back!\n\nDanny's Family Carousel Car Wash is now all about the Up-sell! No Danny's Family Carousel Car Wash is now all about the Pressure Up-sell! \nI understand this is a business & there is a bottom line, but to pressure your customers to purchase more than they intend is not up-selling, it is unscrupulous!\nThey hit you full force the second you pull into the station! Instead of earning repeat business like they use to they are trying to up-sell you get the works, an oil change and windshield damage repair, and everything else they have to sell! When you decline all the extras they disappear as quickly as they showed up & everywhere else you get nothing but bad attitudes!  They try to rush you out of there as quickly as possible, to the point that they always miss something... I've left there several times in a rush to find the front end of my car still covered with bug marks!\n\nIn the past several years I've had countless bad experiences. \nSo bad that I go out of my way not to use a Danny's Family Car Wash!"
0,"I had been planning on getting a complete car detail, somewhere, and was still reading reviews on where to go, but needed a quick wash in the meantime, so I stopped by Dannys. The Dannys salesperson, Jorge, presented the complete detail package and although I explained I didn't have time to do it then the hard sale included \""we'll give you 3 free quick washes you can use 1 now, and come back for the detail when you have time. The price started high, then kept rapidly dropping and including more features the more I declined. Finally came down to the \""I give you good deal if you do it now, includes complete interior and exterior wash, engine clean, and more things just kept getting circled on the paperwork\"". Out of exhaustion, sympathy for the people waiting in line behind me, vacuum people waiting ahead of me, and really needing the detail anyway, I gave in, signed the form, gave them my credit card, used my \""free\"" quick wash and was on my way. (average job on the wash then, btw.) \nPart 2- \nFinally scheduled and went in for my detail. Upon arrival the \""greeter\"" promptly looked in my window, read the damn \""need oil change\"" service reminder that's been glaring at me for a few hundred miles, and suckered me in to that service too. (whatever- convenience to me). I explained I was there for my detail, They popped the hood, Jorge (again) said I he had given me a good deal but didn't I want the engine cleaned too? I tried to remind him he had included that in the deal, but apparently since he hadn't circled it, it wasn't really included. Jorge says \""I can't give that for free, you'd have to talk to the manager\"". When I asked for the managers name, he seemed surprised that I would actually do it, so I did. The manager \""Alex\"", was actually quite nice, gave me the engine detail, apologized and said he told Jorge to not push the sale so hard in the future. I was told 2.5- 3 hrs and I would get a call when it was done. So 4 hrs later, I call, find out it's done. Pay for the oil change, hunt down my car and someone w/ the keys. So-overall results, looked all bright and shiny at first, but they just gooped on extra armorall on my leather seats, still had finger smudges on the interior of the sun roof, white spots where the wax had not been rubbed off, small scratches that I'm pretty sure would have come out anywhere else. The kicker was on the inside of the windshield there were 2 spots where parking permits had left a residue (one with part of the paper liner still attached) and they didn't do ANYTHING to try to remove ANY of it. I drove away, again exhausted and vowing to write my first ever negative yelp review. Sorry for the long review, but I hope it helps someone save the time, money and energy. Good Luck!"
0,"Bad wash as usual and NO customer service. Now they expect you to do what they can do in 30 seconds (change my new license plate number in their system) - now the customer has to go online and do it. Convenient yes - but never going back!!! The good news is they get you in and out quickly, the bad news is the quality of the wash leaves little to be desired and they beat you up for everything from windshield repair to oil changes to details and so on. After many years, I have had enough!!!"
0,"Visited them today to spruce up the Tacoma. Filled up the tank and chatted with the attendant, nice guy. Truck went through the wash. While in the drying line the guy that was supposed to be drying my truck spent more time flirting with his co-worker. He barely ran the rag around door jams. When they flagged me down, I walked around the truck. I asked if they were going to actually dry it  or was that extra?  Had to get them to finish washing the spots off. The windshield is still dirty. Had to remind them to put the antenna back on.   Could understand if they were busy,  but it was slow  This place is a joke. Wonder if the owners have any quality control in mind."
0,"I had a whole review written and then IE crashed and I lost it but essentially, here's the gist:\n\nDon't go to this joint. It used to be decent to good..more towards the good. Now you bring your car in dirty and it leaves dirtier after they've used dirty, damp towels to swish the dirt around.\n\nSave your money,. I'm not sure where to go unfortunately because I can't seem to find ANY decent car wash in the valley anymore, but I can tell you not to bother with any of the Danny's car washes in the valley."
0,"This place is cheesy, cheesy \""Daryl's O.K. used cars\"" type of feel. They have about 67 sketchy characters trying to wash your car at once, and the end result is a car with water spots? I was very upset with how poorly they handled the simple task of washing my car. The worst part of the whole thing: THEY STOLE 6 QUARTERS I HAD IN MY CUP-HOLDER!! If you are a recently paroled felon, or person who has no hope for a decent shot at a career- get a job at Danny's on E Highland Ave. I tried this because my regular car wash is closed on Sundays.. I would recommend everyone go to Hot Shots on 16th street. The management there has some integrity requirements when they hire employees."
0,"Customer service inside was decent...the people outside though weren't as nice. After my car was washed, they let it roll in neutral nearly hitting a wall. Guess they didn't realize it's a manual transmission. So after some guy jumping in and slamming on the brakes, he took it to start drying it off. As he was driving it to the drying area, he started driving it hard.  After drying it off, another guy got in to park it. He was driving my car hard like a race car...just like the young man before him. I told him that I'd appreciate it if he didn't drive my car or any other customer's cars like that. He looked at me with a smirk and pretended like he didn't speak English. They obviously have no respect for other people's personal vehicles or opinions."
0,"I have been a customer for many years. I ALWAYS get the VIP carwash. The VIP carwash includes WASHING THE CAR, correct?  And the windows, and vacuuming the inside of the car? And cleaning off the door and window sills? \n\nThe last two times I have been at the Highland Avenue location I have had poor service. Today was (again) a poor experience. Even after specifically asking that they clean the bugs off the front end (assuming they would do the rest of car without being asked) I still had to ask (again) at the end to please wipe off the bugs.  Last time the car did not even looked like it had been washed.  Just the top/superficial dirt was removed. \n\nThe attitude of the workers is that they are doing me a big favour by wiping off my car - and I always tip when they are finished so it's not like I am being overly picky. Additionally - when you have three or four workers all speaking Spanish and all of them looking at me, snickering, pointing at the car and then looking at me, laughing and the young lady actually rolling her eyes; well being rude to the customer and not making me feel welcome when the car was not clean is inexcusable.\n\nIt was just after 8:45 this morning that I was there.  You were NOT busy - there was not a big line and you had plenty of workers in the finishing area.  Seems like 4 or 5 guys were quite happy to work on shining up a large white Humvee that was there for over 30 minutes while the (less than) 10 minutes spent on my Mariner was half-hearted and sloppy. The mirror inside was dirty and pushed all the way to one side - I thought the idea was to put the mirror back in an approximation of where it was when the customer gets back in? Both seats in front were moved and the passenger seat was wet. The center console area had not even been cursorily wiped, and the areas inside all the door and windows was filthy and looked to have never even been touched,.  This is the same sloppy work the last time I was there.\n\nI have had to ask a couple of times in the past to get the car wiped down better -- 18 dollars and I cannot even get a clean car? Lately there seems to be no one outside managing the lines or workers. I pull in -- no one bothers to look up or point me to the lane they want me in.  Someone else pulls up after me and they get waved into another lane and serviced before me. \n\nI specifically ask that the front end is wiped down and all the bugs are removed. The young man checking me in assures me this will be done and he writes a note on the window. I do not stand out there and watch every move they make - I assume the car will get vacuumed out and then sent through.\n\nSo today:\nFront end is filthy after wash and I have to ask AGAIN that they clean it\nRude and disrespectful employees laughing at me is not a good way to do business\nThe center console has not been wiped and still has dirt in it from when I pulled in. \nThe passenger seat is wet.\nThe inside of all the doors sills and windows sills are filthy and have not been touched at all\nThe water dripping down from the door seams and from around the back window streak up the finish by the time I pull across the street to Trader Joe's. I saw them happily blowing all the water out from the Humvee - I guess no one bothered to do mine.\n  \nI should not have to go back AGAIN and spend another 30-45 minutes waiting for them to wash it right. They should do it the first time without me having to ask specifically.  Especially for 18 dollars.\n\nI am extremely unhappy. I have tried to contact the management.  Let's see if anyone cares enough to email or call me back. Otherwise - do not go here. EVER."
0,"Let's use the power of Social Media to inform people about Danny's Carwash at 83rd Ave & W. Bell Road.....Please share my bad experience with your contact list. \n\nBell Road has the worst customer service ever. After forgetting 4 things I paid for and only addressing 1, I was told by the GM Tim B.-H., that he was sure that I put grease on my windshield so I could complain and request a refund. I was there just 8/25/2012, around noon with my 20 month old grandson around noon and if you have toddlers I'm sure you know that hanging around a carwash in the heat of the day ...when he just wants to take a nap is not my idea of fun. When I asked him to at least fix the windshield his reply was.... he would but it was going to take him quite a while to get it fixed. When I went to the counter to ask for the phone number to corporate, he advise them not to share any phone numbers or names etc..... with me. I then proceeded to ask one of the workers to please just get the grease ...off my windshield...he tried but was stopped by Mr. Tim B.-H., and instructed not to help me. Danny's car was has had huge financial issue recently and I have still been a faithfull customer for the past 10 yeas, but obviously this will now change. The best part of the story is when I did call corporate this morning I was instructed by Corey who answered the phone... that all issues must be resolved at the location in which you had the problem....He would not let me speak to anyone at the corporate level and told me not to even try cause he would make sure I didn't get to speak with anyone in the corporate office.  Later I called back and Corey did give me an email address.   So anyone out there know a good carwash in the NW Valley?\n\n Thanks, April Blair Childs-Brossman"
0,"Called to make an appointment for a \""Complete\"" car wash and was quoted a price.  When I arrived, the price doubled.  The salesman thought it was really funny.  The manager backed him.  I used to be a regular customer (four cars!) for many years.  Time to move onto another car wash company."
0,"I reviewed these idiots back in July and filed a Better Business Bureau complaint against them.  \n\nThe empty platitudes from Heather at Danny's corporate that they do a great job for a good price ... Really?  20+ dollars for a VIP wash and the back is not vacuumed, the windows are streaky, there are still bugs all over the grill and hood?  \n\nOffering me a \""free\"" crappy carwash  or try and intimidate me when I point out the car is not clean is no offer at all.  I do not feel safe patronising this business at this location.  Maybe someone has had good service from another location but stay away from this one.\n\nI actually never expected to get a refund as these folks have over and over demonstrated they DO NOT CARE when you attempt to bring something to their attention. They have the worst customer service I think I have ever experienced anywhere and getting your car washed there is a complete waste of time and money.  They do a crappy job, and you may get items stolen from your car or something broken on your vehicle and they will say it's not their fault.\n\nLos Olivos Car Wash charges 20 dollars for a hand washed car that is immaculate and the staff is pleasant, friendly and honest. Go to Los Olivos and see for yourself.  You will never settle for the inferior work and service at Danny's ever again.\n\nI will post my most scathing review of this horrible business everywhere I can.  Someone will see it and Danny's will NOT get the business of another unsuspecting fool like me.\n\nRead the other reviews on this place.  It's stay away or you are throwing your money away plus you'll get intimidated or insulted for your trouble."
0,"I went to Danny's this weekend to get an oil change and car wash and I paid for a VIP car wash.   After picking up my car I was disappointed that there was still dirt on my car floor.  I later noticed that money I had in my car for parking was missing.  I'm highly upset that I paid for these services, tipped the staff, and had my property stolen.  I've been going to Danny's on and off for years as they are close to my home but I will never frequent their establishment again."
0,"This place is horrible. So, so horrible. Please don't get your car washed here! This is a quick and convenient car wash for me, and I am just so over it. I will make the hike to Los Olivos, because Danny's is just awful. They don't vacuum the back of the car, wipe off my door handles, wipe down the cup holders. Nothing. They mess with all of my seats, don't fix the door mats, then give me a dirty look when I don't tip them. What do they expect?"
0,"Major suck.\n\nI have been here 3 times with three separate vehicles. I think \""Hey? Why not try again?\""\n\nEvery time I get my car washed here I feel like they always forget something: the very bottom of your front and rear bumpers, the water that dripped from your liftgate onto the bumper, anything on the windshield that isn't dust......\n\n\nI could go on and on, but my point is that they don't seem to care, they just want their tip and you leave. I feel bad so I tip, as it's hot and I sure as hell ain't doing the job.\n\nGo somewhere where your car actually comes out clean though."
0,"This is one of those places you want to give negative stars to--that's really all you need to glean from this review. \n\nAre you a lady who hasn't had her fill of being talked down to or hit on by sleazy dudes today? Do you need an oil change but really can't be bothered to find out how much it will cost? Do you like overpaying for a carwash whose end result you could have paid $3 at Clean Freak to achieve? Well, sounds like you want to go to visit the total clowns at Danny's. \n\nI went here once about a year ago for an oil change and car wash. It took over an hour and I was really annoyed by the clumsy, gross flirting from the guy and that he forgot to give me the free car wash that came with it and how long it took them to give it to me when I pointed out that I was owed one. Don't make my mistake and go back because they happened to by close to your work and open when all other options were closed and you really need an oil change. \n\nFirst, I pulled up and waited five minutes for someone to make eye contact so I can figure out what bay to pull up to for an oil change. Seriously, if I'm not supposed to pull up to where the signs say OIL CHANGE to get one then get a sign to tell me where else to go to arrange this. Finally, I'm approached by some guy who stared at my cleavage the whole time he gave me the runaround of what costs what. Oh, you want me to pay $10 so that you CHECK--not act upon--the fluid levels in my car and check the tire pressure? Is this ridiculous upcharge only for ladies who you assume to be total dummies or are you an equal opportunity rip-off artist? \n\nAfter about five minutes of conversation, I still have no idea what an oil change costs there, only what extra fees they'd like to charge me for stuff that should be free and I'm pretty sure the employee doesn't either because he wants to be paid under the table. He told me he'd do a full service oil change if I just left $20 in the car. Like, don't exchange money with him out in the open, but leave it in the car, like he's an oil change hooker and I'm the john. I'm assuming your employer isn't keen on you not paying taxes, dude, but thanks for the offer?\n\nI never followed up with these guys to figure out why the employee would tell me that it's $31.95 if I pay inside and $20 if I pay him by just leaving money in the car because I'd rather just stay away from these guys. I got in the car and closed the door on the employee while he was still trying to give me the hard sell because he wouldn't take no for an answer, which is every woman's dream, isn't it?\n\nOh, and the car wash I got last year with the oil change sucked, too. There's nothing to make a girl feel more self conscious about her reliable yet boring Toyota like watching her car get ignored and left with water spots drying on it while all the guys working gather around to take pictures of themselves cleaning a Lamborghini."
0,"Very scary and shady vibe. As a woman, I will never come back here. A lot of standing around and staring at customers.  I felt extremely uncomfortable."
0,Be sure to ask if your car is ready yet. They forget to announce it sometimes and leave you in the lobby waiting for Christmas.
0,"I will never be going back.  Its too bad, years ago this was a pretty good place.  recently I got a Groupon 3-pack. 2 of 3 times, my car was not cleaned well.  There were spots and when I pointed it out, the guy told me it was because I didn't add on the wax!!! \n\nThe 3rd trip was the kicker...i decided to add wax just to see whether they actually cleaned the car.  It took about 40-50 minutes(!), didn't look like they had done anything different... And when I got home, I realized they had stolen my iPod from my car!!!  On a previous trip, they stole my husbands phone charger.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE! They will rob you and then give you back a dirty car!"
0,"This place is so slow. I got the express wash at 11am on a weekday and waited 40+ minutes for my car to be done. Wtf. \n\nOh and now you must need a face or neck tattoo to work here. I didn't know if they were washing/drying my car, or figuring out how to steal it later. \n\nI'm not coming back here. It's not worth $5 to waste almost 45 minutes of my lunch hour.\n\n----\nI just got back to work from the place, and I noticed that 1/2 of my change/quarter pouch and all of my gum was gone. What the hell. My $5 car wash just became a $15 car wash. I called and complained, but what is it going to accomplish. Never again. I'm over this place."
0,"There is definitely a reason why this place gets such bad reviews. I thought it would be quick and convenient to stop in for an oil change. They up sold me on the more expensive fluid topper and \""free\"" car wash for $35. After finally getting my car I sat down to drive off and I see is a completely dirty floor mat on the driver side. I pointed it out to the guy that gave me my keys and he said \""yeah that's still dirty, should I take it back and have it redone?\"" Uh, yes, please. My windshield is still dirty on the inside and out, and the back windshield has water spots all over it! \n\nI'm tempted to take it to Jiffy Lube to have them check the fluids to see if they even topped them off. There was an attitude of less than mediocre at this place.  Unfortunately, I don't care how close you are to my house, Danny's, I won't be back."
0,Arrived there at 3:48PM today.  Had the VIP done with some detailing and was told it should take around 45 minutes.  Left there at 5:52PM.  They did a good job with the actual cleaning of the vehicle but being grossly mislead on the turn around time was inexcusable and enough to prevent me from coming back or recommending the company to anyone.
0,"Seriously Danny's. I just left, you washed my car just fine but why in the world can you not open the back hatch and vacuum!  This is the second time it's happened. Shame on me for going back. I will be calling management to complain as well. This is crazy that you have to inspect everything before you leave. \nI'd rather go to Francis and Sons on 7th St even though it takes twice as long. As least I know everything will be cleaned"
0,"I paid $20 for a crappy car wash. When I went to get in my car, the floor mats still had leaves on them, I paid extra to wipe down the doors and inside of the car and there were still marks all over the back trunk area from my dogs. The windows weren't wiped down because the writing from the type of wash I was getting was still completely legible and lastly, the back window was still covered with nose marks. I definitely won't be going back."
0,"Decent wash, sloppy dry. They had my car for 1hr 40min and still did not manage to find time to dry the car nor finish wiping down the inside. I don't know if they don't have enough employees or the employees they do have just don't care but, they took my money and delivered a piss poor product and did so in an extremely lengthy fashion. Will not be returning to this rip off spot again."
0,"Negative experience overall. The place made me feel uncomfortable. I brought my new pre-owned baby (a 2012 bright red VW) to get her first wash here, thinking it was the ultimate deluxe treatment. I was so wrong. I didn't count exactly, but from start to finish I think there were 6 people who drove my car, and they didn't drive it with care or regard, and their clothes seemed dirty. They were tapping the brakes too hard and making me uncomfortable just watching them drive it. \n\nWhen you drive up, it is entirely unclear where to go. As a first-timer, I had no clue. A lazy guy in a Danny's uniform pointed for us to get in one lane, and then pointed to another lane, which was confusing. Then he came to the window and tried to upsell us on getting our car detailed and buffed, saying it would \""return it to new\"". Buddy, it's a new car - it was washed a month ago at the dealership. When my husband politely said no, he seemed mad. We chose the VIP wash for $20 and from there it was a waiting game until our car was in the front of the giant blob that they call a line. In my opinion, it took a long time. I took my shopping bag inside with me, thank goodness I did because apparently there's been a lot of robberies there. \n\nAfter a short time through the tunnel and a half-assed rubdown from about 5 different thug-looking guys, the car was \""done\"". Yes, the bird poop was off the windshield, but the ultimate telltale sign was there was still a  Starbucks straw wrapper in the front console that they didn't even touch. The interior detailing promised in the \""VIP Wash\"" was a joke.\n\nI'm highly disappointed. My car seemed worse off than it did when it went in. Next time I will go to Los Olivos. Even a Clean Freak $3 wash would be far superior to the yuckiness we experienced here."
0,"STAY AWAY FROM THESE RIP-OFF ARTIST.  I moved here within the last year and don't know many mechanics in town.  I have always relayed on my brother who is a mechanic at Mazda to service my Mazda for me.  Before moving here my brother did complete check of my car including changing the transmission fluid at 65,000 miles.  I have taken my car to several places to get the oil changed.  Today I needed to have it done again and thought I would go at lunch by work.  I went online and visited their website and even printed a coupon for a complete oil change for $28.99. No hidden cost or shop fees the coupon said.  When I arrived my car was put in line for service. Approximately 45 minutes later a tech can in to tell me that my transmission fluid need to be changed or it was going to burn up.  When I told him I had it done at 65,000 mile at Mazda, the car only has 79,000 miles now, he said that they lied to me and I should go back and get my money back.  Now who should I believe, my brother of 51 years or this 23 year old kid I just met.  I told him that I would take care of the problem myself and he said again, \""it better be soon, this car might not make it much longer.\""  When I went to pay expecting my bill to be around $30.00 with tax but was informed that it was $35.48.  When I asked the cashier why, she told me that the oil filter is not included in the oil change.  Who does a oil change without changing the filter?  I asked to speak with the manager he was not available.  When I told the tech that I would just pay the bill and not come here again and YELP their business, he said \""DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.\""  So buyer beware of this place, they will rip you off when ever they can."
0,The worts place for service on your car they stole my wallet even though was hidden in the glove compartment. They hired criminals and illegals    to work for them I will suggest to never go to there isn't safe
0,"Here is what I can legally say:\n\nMy brand new truck went in with flawless factory chrome wheels.  My brand new truck came out with a chunk taken out of the factory chrome wheels.\n\nAlso, they didn't dry the thing - I had the attendant come back twice to dry it but gave up with water spots on my car.\n\nThe manager, Andy, will most likely raise his voice to you and deny responsibility for the damage you receive, if he treats you the way he treated me.\n\nI have been going to this car wash for years, and it has usually been nearly flawless.  Now the one time something bad happens for me there, they stand behind their \""flawless reputation\"" and, in the words of their manager Andy, they are perfect and all the others who have said they damaged their vehicles are wrong... Strange.\n\nI am waiting for the general managers response."
0,"I went there less than an hour ago- they are lucky I didn't go to a manager. I'm sitting there waiting to be called, and after 45 minutes I went out to find my car. Turns out they never called me and had parked my car in the parking lot. Took too long to track down my keys, and then the guy follows over pretty much wanting the \""tip\"". I look at my car and there's spots everywhere, the paint is scratched all over and it was obvious they hadn't bothered to get the soap off, vacuum properly, or even clean at all. Wiped my hand over the dash and came back with more dust than I had gone in with!!\n\n\nOverall, if I could give even less stars they would get it. Absolutely terrible!"
0,"I used to frequent this location - I think I'm pretty much done.\n\nI guess now that the illegals who actually took pride in their work and had a spring in their step are gone, it truly is \""bottom of the barrel\"" employment.\n\nLook, I have tattoos. I date men with tattoos and piercings. Some of the people I love the most in this world have significant alterations. However - creepy dude with the craptastic jailhouse tattoos covering a good portion of his face as one of the first employees I interact with? No thanks.\n\nEveryone looking miserable, as though they hate what they're doing and move at snail's pace to do it? No thanks.\n\nAnd I've seen the sign for years that there's an upcharge for \""large\"" vehicles. And when I had the Infinity QX4 for many years, I was never charged. (I figured it was for Suburbans and Expeditions and the like.) Well, I now have a Nissan Rogue. Which is smaller than my QX4 was. And l was charged for the oversize vehicle.\n\nMediocre at best wash done by creepy people who take no pride in the job they do that I get overcharged for?\n\nNo thanks! I'm done."
0,"After being raided several times by Arpaio's posse, apparently Arpaio started hooking them up with tent city work furlough workers. \n\nI made a huge mistake of getting my oil changed there. Halfway into the change I asked them if they replace the oil filter (I shouldn't have assumed), he said no, but he JUST MIGHT have a matching oil filter that he could install for $30 bucks. What? He then tries to upsell me on an air filter, saying oil filter and air filter costs $150, but for me he'd do it for $100. I have no doubt in my mind this guy was going to try and pocket the cash.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague."
0,"Only reason I come here is because I get $5 off the total before 9am on Sunday. This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) and I almost drove off with the marker of my wash on my windshield?! Those are the two most important parts to clean after a car wash!!!!\n\nIf I didn't need to come here, I wouldn't. Plain and simple."
0,"Damnit! They did it to me again!  I drive in for a simple car wash and end up with more dings on my fenders than Armor All on my tires!  When I brought it up, they dragged nearly every employee on the premises over to my car to take a look. Then one by one they all got Idiot's Amnesia.  Even the bonehead who I watched drive my car up to the conveyor denied he was even in my car! \n\nAs I stood there pointing out the fresh scratches with the paint color that perfectly matched the jagged block wall of their drive path, they all went dumb!\n\nMy first experience with this type of senseless customer service at Danny's was a few years back. A manager was pulling my car up to the drying area at a high rate of speed, and I actually watched him sideswipe another vehicle with my car. When I confronted him, and pointed out the fresh patch of rubber rash on my fender from the hit, he denied it...and guess what? He suddenly got that exact same case of Danny's Family Carwash Idiot's Amnesia. Luckily for me I was able to get the rubber patch off so I didn't need to follow up. \n\nAfter a recent statewide bust for hiring illegal workers -- TWICE -- you'd figure these morons at Danny's would be a little more willing to curb their bad behaviors and be a lot more customer centric. \n\nWhen Danny's Dysfunctional Family Carwash starts offering body and fender repair services along with their mediocre car washes... customers beware!"
0,"Terrible this will be their final chance, after an hour half they forgot to vacuum the back!! There was trash under the seats, windows had streaks . The exterior had dried water spots . R u kidding me ??!"
0,Won't be back...these guys stole all my Change out of my console...generally you expect random coins in the cup holders to be taken...but they went into a closed console and stole an entire change holder...don't give these guys your business!!!
0,"LAZY, UNPROFESSIONAL AND DOWNRIGHT RUDE. Three best words to explain what a horrific experience I had at this Danny's for the first (and most definitely last) time this last Tuesday. I had just gotten my car back from the shop and decided to get a full interior detail done. I live right off 16th and highland so it was a convenient choice. Well boy was I the fool to think 80 bucks would get me a somewhat decently clean car....to my shock it was actually WORSE then before I went in and wasted my money. They actually took a small contained coffee stain in the back seat and somehow spread the stain all over my cloth seats, w/ some of the stain moved onto the front passenger seat!! It was like they actually used the stain water to clean the entire car. There was a huge soap stain on the interior windshield, spilled sticky soda stains UNTOUCHED in the drink consul and on top of all of that, they soaped up my tires randomly (I didn't even buy an exterior wash) which irritated me as I pointed out to one idiot who remarked, \""oh it's to make them look shiny\"" with an imbecile grin. HELLOO!!! Why not focus on the interior and actually get it done RIGHT?!? Utterly pathetic. I am still angry w/ myself for wasting my hard earned money to this joke of a business. I was so upset I took it back and the men who worked on my car the first time were all there and just stared at me with the rudest glares. Had the guy w/ the tattoos all over his head and face redo it, who actually did a little better. It's amazing this place is still in business let alone always so busy when I drive by, must be all new-timers about to be screwed out of their money...80 dollars down the drain, for a job my two year old daughter could have done better. The raids shouldn't have stopped with the illegals, should have arrested all of the LAZY WORKERS AND STAFF AS WELL!!"
0,"The treatment I endured here was so atrocious it made me activate a Yelp account. I initially came in for a prepaid interior exterior detail package that included a wax. Upon my arrival I agreed to a polish add on/upsell. After retrieving my vehicle  I quickly observed that no detailing had occurred whatsoever;  the inside was still dusty, dirty and there were water stains in my passenger seat. Something shampooing the seats and carpets would have easily removed. It was then that I realized that  what I had originally paid for was not done, only the upsell job. Even that was hard to confirm since they parked my black car across the street under a tree that left it with a coat of green pollen powder all over it. I asked for a manager, Danny, who offered me two free washes and to actually detail the car when I could make it back. I declined the courtesy washes and brought my vehicle back later in the week to be completed. This time when I picked up the car, it was under one of their carports in the detailing area. A staff member gave me my keys with the interior floors and seats wet to the touch. Why would you shut the doors to a car with no way for it to ventilate when the interior is still wet? The mats?  They were wet as well on top of each other locked in the trunk. Why not put them in a dryer? Again, this made no sense. Then, to top it off I noticed that both my Armor All and Meguiar detailing wipes as well as the Ozium I put UNDER my seat were missing. These items were not trash, they were barely used. There was still dirt debris and leaves under my driver seat but they had time to steal my car care products. What a joke! I again asked for a manager to voice my frustration and in return a towel boy came out asking do I still need help with my windows. I ended up just leaving in  utter disgust coupled with shock that places like this really exist. I have encouraged all of my friends, family and co-workers to never, ever give any Danny's location their business. I would implore you to do the same."
0,"I've never before left a negative review for a business, but the experience was bad enough to sign up for a yelp account. I went in for a car wash, agreed to a wax for an additional $20 because it was on sale, but when I got my car back (an hour later) it had not been washed. There were spots on the outside of the car. The interior had not been cleaned at all and when I brought it to their attention, I was told that the \"" VIP wash\"" that accompanied the wax only included the vacuuming of the floor matts. If I wanted the dash dusted or the cup holders wiped down or the windows cleaned, I should have purchased the $50 detailing. So $42 later, I have a slightly less dirty car on the outside and vacuumed floor mats, but not much else to show for it. \n\nI wish I had read all the other bad reviews here before I gave them my business. It was clear to me that this business has very little regard for its customers."
0,"I've been going to Danny's for years. I would take one car, fill it up, get the Works wash and go back for the 2nd car, at least weekly. Have always been pleased with the finished product and thought it was a good value. The employees were top-notch; Friendly, efficient, had a passion for their jobs. \nIn the last 6-9 months there has been a dramatic change...zombies for employees, the service is very slow, crappy job on the cars. \nSorry Danny, you have lost a loyal, formerly happy customer. \nNow I need to find a new place!"
0,this location of Danny's is slow and they do a poor job . lack of attention to Detail. On 2 occasions I was there for over 50 minutes and had to walk out and get the car before they were done as I had to go or be late for a appointment. This was for just a standard VIP wash no extra's. If you are a crunch on time you may want to go elsewhere as you will probably have to have them redo something if you want to get what you paid for
0,The best way to waste your money: 13$ and your car is just enough cleaned outside and not vacuumed inside at all. 1h waiting. Worst service ever!!!!
0,"I went in a few weeks ago. I reached into the car when they were done and the cash in my ashtray had been stolen. This is funny only because I was going to give it to them anyway. When I told the Manager, he told me that it had been happening recently and that he would look into it. I never heard anything back. \n\nI went in again today and when I didn't tip as quickly as they had liked, the staff told me how rude I was for not tipping. \n\nCar wash is is mediocre on  a good day, but convenient location for me. Too bad the management can't manage the staff. It is a case of the inmates running the prison, if you know what I mean."
0,"Yikes!  What happened to this place?  I haven't been to this location in a couple of years.  Its awful!  So sad that management let it go!  Maybe new owners? I remember I used to come here and shop for greeting cards while my car was being washed.  The card racks are all empty.  All the snack and candy bar boxes are empty, too. But no one has bothered to remove the empty boxes.  There's a few dusty old stuffed animals And just a few air fresheners for sale. They used to take pride in displaying their merchandise. Not anymore. Even the fish tank looks awful.\n\nI hope they did a good job with by oil change but I really have no way of knowing. My VIP wash was not worth the money. The inside was not vacuumed very well and their armor all is streaked and missing in places.\n\nThe entire visit was totally disappointing. But the worst part is that my glove box has clearly been rifled through. I keep my papers in a particular order with my sunglasses on top. When I went in the glove box to get my sunglasses everything was topsy-turvy and the sunglasses were on the bottom.  What reason would the staff have to rummage through my glove box?\n\nI wonder if all of the locations are experiencing a similar decline.  I will never return."
0,"Very unprofessional and rude employees...I would not recommend coming here unless you want the most expensive car wash, an oil change, and your gas tank filled for $0.20/gallon more than Cobblestone Auto Spa. I politely cancelled my wash (due to the badgering for upgrades and oil change) and the woman did not remove the writing on my window, just wiped two streaks through it and made a few comments under her breath. They then asked me to park my truck across the street while I go inside and pay for the gas they pumped while we were talking, then I was asked to come find her outside and bring her the receipt. Even though this location is close it is far from convenient. ..two thumbs down."
0,"The worst customer service you could ever imagine!  I read the reviews and still bought a groupon because they are so close by our home.   They refused to accept our groupon because their computers were allegedly down upgrading their groupon program.  Their cashier Tereasa  had plenty of attitude in telling us that there was no way possible to redeem our groupon, so we had to pay full retail price instead!  She wrote a messy note for us to walk out and get our car back from the line of cars being washed!  She did not have a phone number for her manager, so we had to just chalk this one up as another failed effort for consumers to use a groupon at Danny's."
0,"They tried to sell me a $79 oil change. I had to call my dealership to verify the oil type. It wasn't what they told me. They super up sell products and then don't deliver the best quality. The \""$19.99 oil change and wash\"" is actually $39.99. Don't be fooled. As it does not include the wash or amount of oil needed for a full change. Still not a bad price but the principle and sneaky sales tactics make this place sketch."
0,"Last two times through Danny's my car came out with marks it didn't have to begin with and I was upsold for their removal.  Some of it is cash to the guys doing the work (which I don't mind so much) and some of it is for services that I paid the cashier.  \n\nThe clincher was a detail (can't believe I did it) that was promised in 2 hours and took 4 - and my car wasn't clean.  You see, I needed the clay wax treatment rather than the treatment they sold me with the detail.  \n\nI have friends who used to go to Danny's, but they have had the same problems recently.  Danny's wasn't like this a year ago - one of the guys working there said it got a lot worse after the raids.  All I know is I will never be back.  \n\nI promised them I would post my experience on Yelp, and they were not concerned.  They know exactly what they are doing and have no shame.  They are thieves."
0,"Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Customer service was awful and my car wasn't even clean. Seriously, as I was driving away I noticed it hadn't even been wiped down inside. I would have driven back to complain, but was too upset by how I was treated by the men who were washing my car. Never going back. Ever."
0,"Will never be back and will tell everyone I know how terrible and unsafe this place is! Today at 2 pm, John at the beginning of the line took forever to get to me - checking in 3 other people who arrived after me.  Then he asks if I wand the floors and mats cleaned and I said yes if it was fast - I asked him 3 times and told him very clearly that it had to be done fast since I had another appointment.  \""Yes, yes, fast, I know\"" is what he said.  50 minutes later I asked another guy to check on my car and he comes back to tell me it will be another 45 minutes!  That guy was really nice but I was now very late for another appointment.  I watched 3 of them gather at my car, stop work and just start talking.  I waited 7 minutes to see if they would start again and finally walked over to the car to see what was going on.  Those folks were very nice but then John walked up and told me that it was my fault because my carpets were so dirty and that he never made any promises to me.  I disagreed and did raise my voice, but never yelled, when I said, \""oh so this is my fault?\"" He immediately took a step closer, got in my face screaming at me not to yell at him and that I \""disrespected\"" him all while pointing his finger less than inch from my face. I told him, very quietly and very sternly to \""Walk away John, Walk away now\"" and he just kept going, backing me up until another very nice worker stepped in and had to physically push him away from me. FYI, I am a woman and I was alone today.  I can't remember the nice guy's name as I was pretty shaken at this point but he had a black bow tie on and he was great, apologizing and trying to make it right.  I told him that at this point i didn't feel safe staying there and to just give me my car.  It took forever since their spin dryer for the mats wasn't working and I drove home with sopping wet mats in the back of my car and quite upset.  I'm still upset and am considering filing a report with the police.  There were dozens of witnesses and one customer even stopped to give me his business card telling me to share his info if I decided to file a report.  And as for the rest of it, there were spots all over my car, 2 windows not cleaned and more crap work.  The store was a trash heap - empty racks, dirty floor, etc.  Disgusting all the way around.  If you value your safety, stay away or don't dare complain."
0,"Convenience was the only factor when choosing to come here for past car washes and, most recently, an oil change. There's something overwhelming about the amount of people that swarm your car the minute you pull up and repeatedly try to sell you additional services without your solicitation. \n\nOne of the employees asked for my phone number and I asked why he needed it. \""In case we have to up-sell you or return your car,\"" was his response. Reluctantly I gave it and sure enough I received a call while I was grocery shopping and waiting. The employee asked me if I wanted additional services after I already said no. I insisted \""no\"" and he still persisted. Very frustrating.\n\nAfter the carwash, there was oil all over the inside of my car and I had to ask the employee to wipe the writing off my windshield which obstructed my view. \n\nI will drive the distance for a better place in the future. Convenience is no longer worth the compromised service."
0,"The wash was OK and didn't take too long. But I had a coupon for an oil change so I had them change it. During that process the mechanic told me the power steering fluid was very old and detrimental to the power steering pump. I agreed to let them change that as I was planning on a long trip the next day. Two weeks later my battery died and the dealership replacing it called to tell me my power steering fluid was very old and that although the sticker on my windshield indicated my oil had just been changed, the oil filter looked old and the viscosity of the oil in the truck looked very old. Somebody is not telling me the truth. My decision will be to never give Danny's any more business."
0,"Quick Review: This place is terrible, don't ever go here. \n\nLonger: Went here to Saturday afternoon (2:30pm) to get an extremely dirty car detailed. $100 detail but the guy says \""hour and a half and it will look like it never had dirt on it\"".  We were a bit skeptical but sure man, your the pro! 3 and half hours later the place is closing and they tell us that we will have to bring it back tomorrow since they couldn't finish it. But they promise they just have a 1/2 hour left.  No one there to really  complain to since management had all left and we weren't gonna yell at the poor guys out in the heat who get paid terrible. \nNext day visit lasted another 5 hours! The car still wasn't really that clean when taken off the property! \n\nDon't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here.\n\nFind a hog wash for $3 and with free vacuum.  It will be just as good and will only be 10 minutes."
0,"I chose this place because it was really close to my new residence in Phoenix and with a ton of relocation costs, I had little money I wanted to spend on maintaining the look of my car. With the word \""carousel\"" in the name, I thought, \""Interesting idea.\"" With the word, \""family,\"" I thought, \""Can't be too bad.\"" I hadn't looked at the Yelp reviews for this place, but immediately regretted it.   \n\nFrom the minute I drove in to the minute I exited the place, I felt REALLY REALLY uncomfortable. Sometimes, I wonder why I didn't just back my car up and take off. \""High temperatures, dumb choices,\"" I keep telling myself. Going on, I was greeted (kind of) by a man with a clipboard and a bunch of choices. I had a bunch of questions, as the sheet he gave me seemed incomplete but every time I asked a question, the guy was completely distracted by whatever his fellow coworkers were doing on the other side of my car. I brushed it off, found the good person in myself, and just made a choice. After making a decision I was immediately KICKED OUT OF MY OWN CAR not really sure where I should pay or what I should do. Finally, another customer recognized my, \""deer in the headlights,\"" look and told me there was a lobby inside. As I walked in, I could hear the employees making those sounds men make when they want your attention on the street. (What kinds of women respond to this anyway? I was fully clothed, not wearing anything scandalous, mind you.) This is where I almost lost it. Really, is this a professional business? \n\nI walked in to the lobby thinking I may never see my car again (what we should think at a car wash, right?) and was greeted by a bunch of uncomfortable stares. I keep thinking back to this experience wondering if there was anything wrong with the way I looked resulting in these stares but can not think of anything out of the norm. Again, I was helped by another customer, telling me where I should pay. So I pay, no problem there. The guy even gives me a student discount after I noticed they honor them. I turn to my right and see that my car had just come out of the washing area. I followed it outside, where, again, I was greeted with more uncomfortable stares and one employee telling me that, \""your car smells like bud.\"" What? Bud?...Marijuana? Ok, I'm from California, so we use that word pretty loosely but that's definitely not a FAMILY word, nor was it very professional to say that. (I've had friend smoking cigarettes in my car awhile back in college, but never marijuana, if you were wondering. ) \n\nIn the drying station, yes, more uncomfortable stares, only to be alleviated once, by another customer who brought a very expensive luxury car to get cleaned. When this happened, the employees all started whoop hollering and praising the car. I was thankful for that, but I'm pretty sure the owner of the car was not ( but I don't know, do you buy luxury cars to be noticed?) \n\nWhen they were close to being done with my car, one of the employees asked if I could remove stuff from the cup holder so he could clean that area. I politely declined, because I was more than ready to get out of the place. I also feel incredibly bad that I didn't tip, but should I have? \n\nNever going back again. \n\nAdvice for people debating going here: Don't go here. Spend a little more. Go somewhere with customer service and professional value."
0,If we could put 0 stars we would. For what they charge they barely clean your car even if you ask for detailing. How can anyone be so bad at running a car wash? Then one of our windshield wipers got hit and torn off in the car wash and left a crack. When we asked for them to fix the $7 problem they lied to us and said it wasn't their problem. Then one of the workers who was obviously on meth started going tweeker crazy just by us asking them to fix their mistake. Everyone who works there is high on either meth or crack and they don't even try to hide it. How is this place still open?
0,"This is the worst Danny's I have ever been to. Whoever runs this location should be ashamed of yourself. I have been to the other locations and NEVER had the experience I had here. I even heard other people complaining while I was in there. I would've rather waited an extra 15 minutes to actually get my car washed.....there was dust, yes dust not dirt or grime or something hard to get off, still on my steering wheel and radio. The back of the car wasn't even vacuumed out. I paid for a works, there was no air freshener in my car. On top of not getting the car wash I paid for they stole my   auxiliary cord. When I called they asked if I saw someone steal it? Of course not they are inside my car and in sitting on the sidelines, it's not like I'm standing over my car watching their every move. They told me they would keep and eye out for it......"
0,"The worst, the store manager is unprofessional and not very bright. He brings the whole establishment down. Never ever will I ever go back there. Disgusted!!!"
0,"Pathetic use to be a good place to get the car washed, paid for their \""VIP package\"" and they didn't vacuum an inch of the car, Not the console, back seats or trunk. didn't dress the interior or even put the air freshener in.  Then use the same black greasy tire rag on my door handles, side panels & interior( exterior is candy white & interior is beige) now my interior has this awesome black grease stain in the back seats,even though I've had passangers in the back 3 times at the most. To make it worse after I got home I had to polish the interior my self, I noticed THEY BROKE my passenger window button, even though there was still crumbs and trash in that area. By far the worse place ever. Took over an hour and it wasn't even busy nor did they do a Damn thing they had been paid for. Bring back all the Hispanic people,they did a way better job. NEVER bring you're car to this joke of a business. Take you're car to los olivos or Tom thumbs fresh market."
0,"$23.99 I had to finish wiping down the dashboard, cup holders weren't wiped out at all. Floor boards were kinda vacuumed. Rear of SUV wasn't cleaned at all but I was charged extra for the size of my vehicle. :("

0,"Absolutely worst car wash! Had my truck for 5 hours after a $200 detail and it looks like a cheap wash..step boards and tires still filthy, mirrors and windows dirty, cup holders in back seat still full of gunk. Will not return and should of checked yelp reviews before I went!"
0,"I ordered the teriyaki chicken, which is apparently their specialty, and priced accordingly.  It was $7 for a medium sized bowl and drink.  The chicken was mediocre and the rice was kinda gummy.  \n\nEven still, this wouldn't have warranted the one star until I bit into a chunk of bone that they forgot to sift out.  Nasty."

0,"This does not exist.  It is now an unbelieveably soulless gay bar with the inventive name \""Bar One\"".  That is all."
0,"I have been using this store for some time now and noticed the manager was always in a bad mood. As each time passed it just seemed odd the mood was always the same. Well this last time I spoke with Ted (manager) he tried to upsell items I didn't need. In asking questions as to why I would need them it aggravated him to explain. So much so that he got argumentative, my assumption is I didn't say \""yes\"" to all the unnecessary items. I come to find out there is another store on 32nd st and Camelback, not far, that is great. Customers come first and when it becomes a problem just to do simple tasks I'd rather go elsewhere. Save yourself time and aggravation and use another store, not worth it."
0,"I had color copies made here. The staff did not know the prices and then they charged me $1.50 for me to use their computer to access the file from my flash drive. The computer was so out of date it could not even read a Word 2007 file. When I looked at the copies the next morning they were misaligned and the print quality looked like a poor inkjet rather than a laser print.\n\nI called them and they said they would have to talk to the manager. When I went back after the weekend, he was not there and the clerk would not give me a refund.\n\nPoor equipment\n\nPoor attitude\n\nPoor customer service.\n\nThere are other UPS stores relatively close. I suggest you use those. I will stick to my local one in Ahwatukee."
0,"I've been a regular customer for about one year now. I've come to learn that the owner is the main issue. When he's at the store (not always) he seems to be put off by providing assistance to any customers. He doesn't seem to know how to use all of the store's equipment. And he's particularly rude on the phone. It's too bad, since I actually like most of his staff. Don't waste your time at this store."
0,"Was not greeted or assisted when I came in. The place is disorderly and dirty looking. Finally when I figured things out on my own I waited for the ladies to finish their conversation about whatever trivial weekend blunder they were talking about. Kimberly was the raised eyebrow, gum chewing teller indifferent to the clients needs. She input the information from my sheet, and tried to tell me that if the recipient is not there upon first delivery, UPS sends it back to the sender and that I should get additional services added.  I'm no shipping pro but obviously they take it back to the nearest UPS store and leave a note at the door.  I then said that I was ok without extra services and said \""I don't care how it gets there as long as it actually gets there\"" in a friendly way. She then half rolled her eyes and smirked and said \""I don't care either\"" in a smart a** way.  Her smart attitude was a turn off considering I'm usually patient with lazy service people. All In all I do not recommend this store I don't feel trustful or secure in sending my important document with them, I'm afraid it could get lost now- I checked the status I my shipment using the tracking number and it says its not available.  Don't recommend, find another location to ship from. :)"
0,"UPS needs to do review on this store and shut them down.  They are ruining the UPS brand.  The clerks who work here are very rude.  I walked in there needing to ship something specifically \""overnight\"" and was given options that were not overnight/next day.  I was at the store at 1pm which is relatively early and before the cut off for next day.  I was assured that the shipping service I purchased was going to be next day.  \n\nThen throughout the night I was checking the tracking number and the product had not left.  The next morning I call the store and they say that they still have the product.  I was sending a passport that needed to be at my destination by 2 days after the first day I initially tried to send it (I chose next day \""overnight\"" to get it there one day before luckily).  After talking to the store over the phone and asking them why the package was not delivered, they told me I did not choose an \""overnight\"" service.  The one thing that I specifically told them was that \""this needs to be sent overnight so that it will arrive tomorrow\"".\n\nThen they tried to charge me more money saying that I did not purchase an overnight product.  Which first of all, I asked specifically only for their overnight options, why would you give me an option that is not overnight. Second, even if your incompetent clerks selected a service that is not overnight, why would it still be there.  I am assuming if it's not overnight, it should still be on it's way for 2nd day and my 1 day cushion would save me.  \n\nSo I ask the clerk to tell the owner to give me a call.  The owner did not give me a call back and told the clerk, \""I will not settle the difference for this, he will pay it or I will throw it away.\""  So the asshole wants to throw away the passport that I need to send because his staff sold me the incorrect service.  I specifically stated to his clerks that the package \""needed to be there by tomorrow\"" and said \""overnight\"" several times.  I paid a hefty premium as well for this service given that the product weights much less than 1 pound and I was there relatively early in the day.  \n\nThese guys are incompetent, distrustful and unreliable.  If you need to ship something important, consider using another UPS store or Fedex."
0,"Very poor customer service. Have been there 3 times in last few months and the same woman who I think is manager. she said some guy named John is owner. She is always rude never says hi, never has smile on, and just looks at you when you come in with blank stare. I came in to return package that needed very small amount of tape and I asked her if I could use some tape and she said it would cost me extra $1.10 for small amount of tape for top of box. She said strict orders from owner. Wow so you would rather lose a customer instead of giving them small amount if tape to help them out. I now go out of my way to go to another ups store."
0,"This is my second visit to this store. Kimberly (the woman behind the counter) is the rudest person I have ever met in retail, who does not deserve to be behind the counter of any retail counter. She is cold, un-inviting, and overall appears to hate her job by the scour look on her face.  She is useless when it comes to helping customers and overall she has a \""can't do\"" attitude.  \n\nI lodged a complaint on the corporate website and this store is privately franchised and owned.  I spoke with John the owner and apparently he must have trained Kimberly because his attitude is just as bad if not worse. He didn't show any concern for my complaint nor did he show any empathy for my experience.  He hung up on me twice in conversation. \n\nKimberly followed me out to the parking lot and show aggressive signs of intimidation with my friend and I and in my opinion that was inappropriate and unprofessional. A sales person NEVER follows a customer outside. \n\nAvoid this store at all cost. The post office is around the corner and is much cheaper. I am fling a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  \n\nGood luck John and Kimberly!!!"
0,Unbelievably bad experience.  Not only is the woman behind the counter the rudest person I have ever met in my life she refused to answer a simple question. Anyone should be able to tell you what the estimated time frame for ground shipping us. Is it 12 days or 21 she had to be given an explanation of what I was asking.  I will be using FedEx to ship anything just yo not have to deal with her again.
0,"I see nothing has changed with this store. I just watched a ups store commercial and I laughed out loud!!  Kimberly (the brunette bitch behind the counter) is still the most evil woman walking on the planet.  I have more respect for the hookers on Van Buren Street than I do for this low class, snotty, unhelpful useless piece of trash!!  Stay away from this store at all cost!!!!"
0,"Stopped in to drop off an Amazon return.  I had a prepaid label and box, but the box was opened.  At another UPS Store,  they always tape it up for me at no cost.   Not here.  They charge a $1 handling and taping fee for all prepaid packages.  I thought the guy was joking until he asked me if I had read the sign.  He pointed to a partially blocked sign, attached to a register around the counter from where I was.  If I wasn't so limited on time, I would have taken my package elsewhere.  I definitely will not return to this location."
0,"Sorry to leave a bad review since these seem to be nice people, but my experience here wasn't good. I took in a high-end CD player that wasn't reading discs, and paid a $25 diagnostic fee. A couple days later the guy phones me and says the unit needs a new laser assembly, but he can't do it because he only has one of the two calibration discs required to do the job. He recommends I send it to the Sony facility in Laredo TX. I look at the reviews for the Sony facility and they're *horrid*. I decide to try one more thing, and contact an SACD \""modder\"" I found through Audio Asylum. This guy says he can fix the unit, but he suggests I open it up and clean the pickup lenses before going through the trouble of shipping the unit to him. Long story short, the thing works like a champ now. I don't think I could trust DynaTronics to give me competent advice at this point, especially on audiophile gear. Sorry"
0,"If you are an audiophile, then stay away   FAR AWAY.!!!   I brought in a Luxman hybrid amp because of some parasitic noise that I thought was due to a dirty volume pot.  After they replaced 5 capacitors for about 175.00, ( WHY??)  I took it home and guess what , it made NO difference whatsoever.  So I brought it back.. Here is where the problems really began  Martin, ( you are a total DICK) was so rude I thought I was getting punked.    I hope to all that is holy you go out of business soon.    My amp is still not fixed.  I am out 175.00.  And I do not want to go back there to face this very very rude individual.  He was even rude to my wife, who by the way is the sweetest person I know. (I have to say that).  I am sorry our paths crossed at all!!   By the way, even if you are not an audiophile, but simply a decent human being I still advise you stay away...far away."
0,I retract my last positive review. I had a reciever repaired here.The equipment they installed failed 5 days after the product guarantee. They wouldl not even give me a break in the diagnostic fee of 20.00 to have it looked at again. They told me it would be about another 150.00 to fix it again.  I would stay far away from these guys.
0,"I took a turntable in to.have them adjust the tonearm settings.  They told me it would take a week for an estimate.  A week later I was told it would be another week.  A week later they said they would take three more days. When I stated the constant delays were unacceptable he got extremely angry and told me in a rude tone to pick up my turntable since they had someone die. I started to explain that I was not aware of their situation, but before I could he hung up on me. It turned out that a tech had died and they were short handed.  I would have understood if they had explained and not been totally rude.  In fact I had a tragedy involving my son the same day.  I went in to talk to them to explain That I was not aware of their situation and was only concerned by the constant delays.  The manager said that I had been abusive and had used foul language with the tech which was a total lie.  He said based that on what the tech had told him. I will never use this company again. Their customer service is lacking."
0,"My Hi-Fi Dynaco tube CD player right channel had no sound output. Went to Dyna-Tronics, paid $25 for a diagnostic/estimate. Later, was told it would be $150 to repair. I picked up the CDP and was informed that everything was fully functional but the volume output was really low. I had no idea what they were talking about until I got home.\n\nI called Dyna-tronics and told them that the CDP wasn't fixed.  Originally, 20% of power was used to listen to music. After Dyna-tronics, 90% power was needed just to hear any sound from the CDP. Dyna-tronics asked if both channels were working properly? Yes, I said. Shockingly, they said, \""so, what's the problem? You identified that one channel was not working, is it working now? Then we fixed the problem. Also, we informed you that the output level was really low when you picked it up.\""\n\nI tried to reason with Dyna-tronics \""expert\"" to no avail. I told them if there was a volume issue I would have informed them. Although they fixed the channel issue, now the volume output is a problem. I was told that they did all they could do and there is nothing else they could do for me, that they fixed the channel issue and the volume problem was like that when I brought it in.\n\nTrying to trouble shoot the problem myself, I replaced the old tubes with new ones but noticed that the old tubes weren't lighting up. The new tubes had the same light and volume issue.  I took the tubes out, using no tubes, the volume issue was the same!  No tube and low volume! WTH?\n\nMy face-to-face encounter with an \""expert\"" actually exacerbate the problem.  The \""expert\"" used his informational advantage to make me feel stupid, rushed and ignoble.  I am no expert, but I know how to use my audio equipment and if there was a volume issue I would have mentioned it at the diagnostic stage.\n\nI would not recommend taking your valued audio equipment to Dyna-tronics. Their \""mightier-than-thou\"" attitude is unwarranted.  If they can't stand by their work, listen to reason, have empathy for customer's feelings, and talk down to customers, then they should close their doors and make this world a better place. Hopefully, my bad experience will save music lovers from being belittled and save some money."
0,"I have been here on multiple occasions and each time the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Their selection in 38s-40s seems pretty limited. \n\nI've been twice now when I was looking for a particular color / style. When asked if I needed any assistance, the answer to \""yes, I'm looking for x type of jacket in x color\"" should not be to say, \""hold on a few minutes while I\"" do something and then to leave your customer waiting 10+ min for an answer.\n\nSave yourself the hassle and go check out, pretty much anywhere else. I hear they sell jackets and suits at the thrift stores. At least there I'm expecting to be ignored and have to fend for myself when trying to find something."
0,Worst service and pizza!!!  Just ordered Chicken BBQ and I got something totally not Chicken BBQ.  So I called them to let them know we got the wrong pizza and they keep hanging up on me.  I didn't even get to tell them.  I just said I got the wrong pizza and they keep telling me to hold then hangs up.  My favorite pizza is Pizza Hut but not this location for sure.  If I can give -star I would.
0,"you couldn't pay me to set foot in this shady place... I tried it a couple of times in 2011 and 2012 and I was surprised that a place like this was still in business, especially given its prime location.  \n\nService was horrible, we were treated like trespassers by the thug behind the bar.\n\nconsider yourself warned."
0,"Well, Armadillo Grill, I'm not a fan.\n\nWe came here on Wednesday night for an NBA playoff game after reading the reviews touting the great food and the plethora of TVs. I was disappointed with the food and really disappointed with the service. I won't be back. \n\nOur server clearly did not want to be there; she seemed annoyed that we were sat in her section. She didn't know the menu very well, and kept having to (unapologetically) leave the table to run our questions by the other staff.\n\nMy boyfriend had the stroganoff and I had a veggie burger. Both plates came out within 10 minutes, which always makes me a little nervous. His was sub par; he ate about 35% of it. The veggie burger was near the quality that I've come to expect from most restaurant vegetarian options. The bread was decent, and the patty was an unaltered Boca burger. Everything was below average, except for the music, which was about average.\n\nThey played it at a decent volume (thank you), and was probably someone's itunes playlist of hits from the 90s. I'm okay with that.\n\nThey do have a decent amount of TVs (though nothing to swoon about in my opinion), however they are small and outdated. Most of the ones near us were staticy. I ended up watching the game from a TV that was half way across the room, the only one in our section of the restaurant with a decent picture."
0,Probably an ok place to grab a drink and watch some sports but wouldn't recommend you eat there. I ordered the chicken/brie sandwich - sounded lovely on the menu but it was boiled chicken - so rubbery it was tough to cut through. My husband ordered the steak tacos. They were so greasy he couldn't pick them up. We both had bad stomach ache for hours after eating there.
0,"I was here with friends for drinks and dinner last Thursday evening, and I have to say that nothing about this restaurant was acceptable for any of us.\n\nFirst, we didn't have reservations and were greeted with slightly rude service by the host.  However, I think she noticed that we were a little taken aback by the attitude, and quickly changed her mood.\n\nIn the downstairs bar, we ordered drinks while we waited for a table to open up for us.  The bartender made a mistake while preparing my friend's Bloody Mary, accidentally dumping an enormous amount of tabasco in her drink.  However instead of simply making a new one, he served it to her anyway (admitting his mistake while setting it down in front of her) and told her to let him know if she didn't like it and wanted a new one.  Of course she tried it, couldn't drink it and had to ask for a new one.\n\nAfter we got to our table upstairs and ordered our appetizers and meals, things got worse.  It took well over half an hour to get our appetizers, and when we did they were cold.  We were not sure that our oysters were supposed to be as cold as they were, but the fact that they had congealed melted cheese seemed to indicate that they should haver at least been warm.\n\nAfter we finally got our salads (about 45 minutes after ordering), we were rushed through them before getting our meals just a couple minutes later.  None of us enjoyed our meals, as we found them either burnt or bland.\n\nEven though we made a few complaints about our meal to the server, when our check came we found that we had been charged for everything and were only offered a very pallid apology for the obvious problems with our meal.\n\nthis was not an inexpensive meal, either, so we will likely not be back!"
0,"Really nice ambience, super nice. So nice that we wanted to stay and have a drink and something to nibble on in the downstairs bar. Unfortunately the server wasn't anywhere as nice as the ambience, she essentially kicked us out because we sat at table that was reserved (although there was no reserved sign) and didn't offer to help us find a seat in a full bar. So much for hospitality. They probably do have great offerings here in the food and drink category, but lots of other (nicer) places do too. So that's where we ended up going."
0,"this place looks really nice.  The ambiance was great, but the food blechk!  I ordered the lamb and it was basically just fat.  My Beau ordered the schnitzel and it was salty.  Our waitress was rude, and our bill was 100!  (2 entrees a bottle of wine and 1 appetizer)  When we got home my beau was up all night throwing up.  It was horrible!  In their defense after calling several times, they reimburssed our bill.  That was the first time I've ever called and complained anywhere.  I used to be a server so I know how it is sometimes, but this was just terrible!"
0,"Worst experience ever!  I am a fan of Richardson's so I thought we should check this place out.  Stopped in on a Friday night around 8pm without reservations just to see how long the wait would be.  Great host at the door greeted us and was really friendly.  He said there was over an hour wait upstairs but we could try our chances downstairs where it was all open seating.  We headed downstairs, grabbed a couple glasses of wine and waited for seats to open up.  We waited quite a long time for a table and multiple groups were able to grab seats before us, so we saw a couple ladies paying their  tab and asked if we could get their seats when they were ready to leave.  We ended up talking to them for a while before they left.  When we went to sit down, a very unfriendly brunette bartender said this other couple had been waiting longer and were next on \""the list\"".  The other couple was already sitting!  She gave them our seats  at the bar and someone else who had just walked in grabbed their chairs.  I'll never be back.  If there's a list, tell the door guy and offer people to put their names on it when they arrive.  And if that couple needed to sit at the bar so bad, I would have been fine with the table.  Customer service is obviously lost on this place (except the sweet door host.  Worst experience I've had in a long time.  Contrary to my efforts to calmly explain to the bartender, she did nothing to resolve the issue."
0,"I heard good things about this place, and was looking forward to what the \""basement\"" atmosphere would feel like, lowbrow, a little seedy, etc. Sadly, too many middle-aged men wearing flip flops out on a Friday night. Flip flops? UGH..in Winter? Also, our waiter SUCKED! He acted like he had a hard night and was unwilling to suggest a beer, so I am sure he spit in my draft...Anyhoo, does not matter as I will not return."
0,"BEWARE...if you want a reservation for less than four people, you are out of luck! Apparently there is one table in the dungeon that is reserved for parties less than four but it was reserved for he night. However, we were invited to sit in the bar...yipeee!!! I think it's good for them that they are busy, but I think they should seriously evaluate how they treat new customers. This place was highly recommended, but impossibly unaccessible."
0,"Just returned from the Rockerij, we had a house salad that was mixed greens (Costco style) with 2 small pieces of tomato and croutons for $8.00!  Sorry folks this is not a salad this is a plate of lettuce.  $8.00!!  \n\n We ordered Prime Rib and once again we were disappointed, seriously the meat was tough and that \""melt in your mouth anticipation\""  just didn't happen.   We walked out vowing never to return again.  If you are commancing high prices then provide superior quality.  As for service, it is a reflection of the 'lack of flavor, quality and true concern for patrons', everyone is too busy to concern themselves with the details.  \n\nWe dine out often, returning to places that once valued client, quality and service.  We will not retun to Rokerji,  Bummer, once upon a time the client, service and quality meats reined supreme.\n\nSharon G."
0,"Let me preface this by saying this used to be my favorite restaurant in PHX... This experience has changed that...  I made a reservation for 11 5 days before the dinner at 730 pm on a Sat..  after arriving promptly at 730 we were forced to wait 20 minutesonly to be sat at 2 separate booths...  Completetly defeating the purpose of a group dining experience..  Now the bad part...  For dinner I ordered off the special menu a wild boar bacon wrapped bone in beef tenderloin cooked rare..  I received a baconless well done hunk of meat...  I pointed this out to the waitress she took the meal hoping to have it prepared correctly..  a few minutes later the manager approached the table and informed me they were out of the bacon ( one would think they would know that before the meal was prepared and attempted to slide this past the diner). I was offered a replacement meal , but declined and decided to go with the soup.... This prompted the manager to inform me it was a spicy dish to which I accepted and said it was fine, he proceeded to inform me of the heat of the dish 2 more times both times I assured him this was fine leading him to question my order again at which time I was in disbelief and asked if there is some reason he doesn't want me to  have the dish..   this was enough to finally agree to let me place the order the soup came and was excellent and spicy.   I managed to persevere through the heat and eat the whole bowl ( I enjoy spicy food).  This ruined the whole experience for me ..  luckily everyone else's meals were enjoyable its just disappointing being treated like that at a place I thought so highly of and do everythingin my power to get people I care about to do it....  A sad day"
0,"Okay food, terrible, slow and arrogant service.  You guys need to change your attitude.  The server could have cared less about her service, ignored, us and the food took forever! Not even an acknolwedgement from the staff that the food was taking too long. Also, we were sat down about 15 to 30 min after our seating time and there was not enough space for us to sit to wait for our table as there are only 4 chairs - 2 back to back so I had to sit on the edge as there were several of us. After asking to get a drink a waitress shoved a menu in my face and said she would take my order and never came around. We also had to chase our check down as well."
0,"Used to be one of our favorites, though the last two times in have disappointed. Recent outing included drinks downstairs and staff was unfriendly and uninterested in helping guests.  Dinner upstairs was a poor experience. Our entrees for our party came out about 10 minutes apart and to make matters worse two entrees were incorrect. One entree was replaced and the second was replaced using the previous plate with a portion of the meal replaced.  Has Rokerij lost it's touch?"
0,"What a disappointment. We began our late night (9:30) dinning experience here really happy with high expectations as the ambiance was wonderful and the recommendations were good. However, we left bitter and disappointed. My sister and I enjoyed two lovely \""small plates\"" one was beef skewers and the other a shrimp bruschetta type dish. It was all down hill after that. Shortly after ordering our main courses we noticed a bug crawling on the top of our booth...yeah, it was a COCKROACH!!! I grabbed it in my napkin and crumpled it up and left in a side station area. We both were grossed out but were not going to make a huge fuss and have it ruin our meal. We're both flexible and understanding and didn't complain. But seeing that in a restaurant is really inexcusable and disgusting-and definitely dampers your appetite for their food. Where are his friends? Are they in the kitchen?! YUCK!!! We then waited 45 minutes for our food: an enchilada plate and a relleno plate. When they set down the steaming hot plates the food was cooked to nuclear levels because there  was a one inch crust around the plate and the beans were so dried out it was comical. Now mind you, these are $16 and $18 dollar plates of food. That is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such. We promptly sent the food back and the manager came out and apologized which was appreciated. He stated that \""it was inexcusable the way the food came out (which our server didn't monitor) and that his cook is obviously more interested in cleaning and getting out of here, then preparing the food.\"" They offered to remake the food but it was literally too late around 10:45 and we didn't want to wait. They then took the food off but left the other stuff on. The bill came out to around 42 dollars. Which seemed unreasonable after only having a beer, a cocktail, two appetizers and a totally ruined dinning experience. We didn't mention the cockroach or the fact that it was my 30th birthday to the manager but it boils down to this: after that kind of experience he could of saved our business by comping the meal. The fact that we had TWO ruined entrees and walked out of their still hungry AND paying 40 dollars is bullshit. There are too many other quality options in this town with exceptional service. I wont ever go back to Rokerij."
0,It was abnormally warm inside and the food was sub par at best.  Drinks were also below average.  Not worth the price or time.  I had high expectations for this place and it definitely did not live up.
0,"So I have been wanting to come to this joint for EVA! How-EVA, our experience was not fabulous. It was more like DRAB-ulous. Things started out great when we snagged a cozy little table in the corner about 9pm on a Friday night. The liquor wall looked too tempting to pass up, so I ordered a Gibson with some Tito's vodka (my fav!)- well the cocktail onions were soggy and mushy upon first bite and it pretty much ruined the drink. The server did not offer to bring me something different, he just apologized and looked for the jar of onions and said they are all like that. Hmmmm. There were a MILLION specials. It took like 5 minutes literally to read the entire list. It was baffling. The prices are NOT cheap. We were already thinking we should give this place a shot during $5 plate happy hour. Anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters. Well, they came out with Chirozo on them- and I barely eat seafood, but definitely not pork! All the server said was \""Well it listed the chorizo on the menu\""- Hmmmmmm. Again, we just kept them. Then my boyfriend tried one and it was full of sand! At this point, we had already ordered the mushroom toast points, but after the oyster debacle, we had pretty much decided to go elsewhere and especially when the next appetizer came, it just was overloaded with brie and canned looking mushrooms, totally overcooked and unappetizing. We politely told the server that we were just going to call it a night (there was NO WAY we were going to spend 35-40 bucks on the entree lottery)- he then offered to \""do anything\"" to make our experience better and we thanked him and just explained why we were leaving and we would be back to try the happy hour another time (truth). Anyway then he took like 15 minutes at least trying to get the manager to take the oysters off (I would rather have paid for them) and then he FINALLY brought us our bill with the two drinks AND the uneaten mushroom appetizer. I am a foodie and have been in the business since I was 15 and I NEVER EVER want anything for free or removed from my check, however, there are certain circumstances- and I must say I can not remember having a completely horrible experience like this one on a long time- where I feel  that as a server, let alone a manager- I would comp the entire tab and offer to have the guest back on some sort of gift certificate or comp.  Again, I NEVER EVER look for anything free in a restaurant, but if you had been sitting in my shoes last night, you would agree this experience warranted some above and beyond customer service to retain guests in the future. Well that didn't happen, perhaps they have been around so long they just figure oh well who cares, we are well known so whatever. Well, whatever is I will NEVER attend that restaurant or any of their other concepts, plus now I have written a poor review, and all my FB friends know about it too. I'm sure in my life moving forward Rokerij will also come up in conversation with some of my foodie friends and they too will know I think this place is overrated. We left the waiter a very nice tip and thanked them by never attending their establishment again. Such a shame. Customer service is dead these days... SIgh....Hope it was worth the $30 bucks guys."
0,If you choose to go with the mexican side of the menu its disgusting. Everything is slop on a plate. No one should come here and pay these prices.
0,DO NOT EVER BUY a gift card from this restaurant.  We got seriously scammed on our gift card and management has done nothing about it.  They don't care that their customers are  being ripped off because they already got their money.  I had to file a complaint with the Attorney General's office against Richardson's/Rokerij.
0,"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST SERVICE IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I gave this place 1 star because the food is truly amazing. Too bad the manager has absolutely no clue what he is doing. Probably gets tipped on the side by \""regular\"" patrons and believes that's where his priorities should be at. First of all I made reservations for my mother's 60th birthday because the food here the first time was great. But did I mention the first time I was here our server made a mistake on every single food item we ordered?? At least he had the decency to get our desserts to make it up. An hour or two before the reservations we had called to see if we could add two more people. They told us fine and moved us up to 9pm for the private dining area. Well we showed up exactly at 9 and our room was not ready. Ok no big deal. A little annoying cuz what's the point of making reservations but we were ok. But after 20-30 min of waiting, I started to get pissed. I told the manager and he actually had the nerve to blame it on me!!!! That I called and added two people last minute!! Isn't it his job to make sure that this doesn't happen?!!! If he couldn't accommodate 8 people then say so and we could have went somewhere else. Also the whole time, he was even apologetic and instead of offering maybe a round of drinks for the wait or anything, he just stood around doing nothing!!! So we left and went to Capital Grille instead. We were very happy to celebrate and spend tons of money where we didn't have to wait and the manager and staff knew what they were doing!!! I will never go here again and if u want to go just expect to wait at least am hour even w reservations!!!!!"
0,"If I could give a zero I could.  Waited 45 minutes for a 7:30 reservation.\nWere told \""We are overbooked\"".  Downhill from there.  There was no place to wait so we stood in the middle of the restaurant jostled by waiters and customers.  Our waiter was clueless and disappeared during our ordering and our meals.  The entrees arrived before the appetizer and the before meal bread came as we were finishing dinner. My chicken enchiladas had no discernible chicken and was just a large mush pile. None of us five liked our meals.  The only good thing was the roasted beet side dish.  Maybe this qualified for one star.\nThis used to be our favorite restaurant in the area.  No longer.  The staff\nTreated us like we were in a post office.  The hype is killing them.  The kitchen and especially the employees need attitude and training lessons.\nThe owner needs a wake up call."
0,Keep in mind i did NOT eat here. So this post is not about food quality. its about the service \nit was like i wasnt even there when i waited for 30 minutes before the bartender asked if i would like something to drink\nofcourse as soon as a girl came up to the bar the bartender would run over like a little puppy hoping to his ear scratched
0,What happened to this place? Food and service used to be on point but we just went there for my bday and the service and food was not what it used to be. Won't be going\nback...I'd spend your money elsewhere.
0,"Went here with a friend the other night. Decided to sit in the dining room because I haven't seen it before. Someone brought us waters but no one greeted us for at least 5 minutes, so we decided to move down to the bar downstairs. It was only a couple minutes before happy hour ended and the bartender threw in some food and drinks for us which we were delighted by. But the rest of the visit was less than pleasing. Both of the bartenders were detached and not warm, or welcoming. I honestly felt like we were a burden (although there were only three other people at the bar) it felt like we were getting the cold shoulder. The guy bartender did not smile once. Let alone make eye contact.\nFOOD: the oysters were more disappointing. They were not shucked whatsoever and they were too large, and did not taste fresh. I let them know and they were taken from me but without apology or any action taken to remedy the situation besides taking half of the order off of the bill. \nNeedless to say we decided not to order anything else, the uncomfortable visit went on long enough. \nI'm extremely disheartened by this and when before I would recommend this place to friends, I will not be returning and I will not subject others to this."
0,"Overpriced, overrated, HORRIBLE SERVICE!  \n\nWhen asked for a spoon with which to eat my pasta, they actially gave me an iced tea spoon!\n\nNo bartender, I sat for 15 minutes without a greeting, anything. The grey-haired manager stomped aroumd the restaurant avoiding all contact with customers.  What's the point/benefit on that?\n\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AT THIS AMATEURISH OVERPRICED DUMP!  INSTEAD, GO TO MEATBALLZ IN THE SAME CENTER,ON CAMELBACK. MUCH BETTER FOOD, REASONABLE PRICES AND NO ICED TEA SPOONS!"
0,"35 minutes. That's how long my four-year-old son and I waited from the time we sat down until we received our lunch. Granted, my son is more patient than most children his age, but after about 20 minutes, he started to ask about where his food was. This occurred on Good Friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm.\n\nI guess I should have been alerted to this situation from the moment I walked in. No one greeted us, and it took about three minutes before we were even acknowledged. We wanted to sit outside, but after 60 seconds of debating with a colleague, the gentleman told us there were no outside seats - although we clearly saw two empty tables. Then, the shirts on the employees said, \""Unique like a Brooklyn accent.\"" I really should question a company that doesn't use proper grammar. (It should read, \""Unique, like a Brooklyn accent.\"")\n\nThe person who seated us also took our order moments after we sat down. I asked for apple juice for my son and was told they were out, so we switched to iced tea for him and water with lemon for me. We shortly received our drinks - sans lemon. \n\nAfter we were there about 10 minutes, a large party of 10 was seated near us. Half were small children my son's age and they received lemons with their beverages, so my thought that the restaurant was perhaps out of those too was erased. Unfortunately, our waiter never checked on us, and I actually had to flag him down as my son was whining for food to get a water refill and ask - again - for a lemon. It was then that he told me he'd check on our food.\n\nFINALLY, 35 minutes in, our food arrived. I think we were so hungry at that point that dirt would have sufficed. My son doesn't usually like mac and cheese that is penne with cheese sauce, but he ate nearly all of it. My eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best I've had. Neither of our items was baked, so I'm still not sure what the holdup was. And, by the way, the table of 10 received their food before we did and came and left in the hour we were there. While I'm complaining, my son's ice cream was so frozen I almost needed a knife to cut it for him.\n\nI would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed. Although the place was full, I counted seven employees, including a manager. Other tables were receiving much better service, so I'd have to say the problem was more with our server (who never shared his name). My son and I eat out about once a week, and I always leave 20% for a tip, but this time I left $1 on a $16 bill. At first, I felt badly about it, but then I remembered, \""Oh yeah, it's not like I'm ever coming back here.\""\n\n*** On 4/5/10, Alana, a representative from NYPD Pizza sent me an e-mail when she came across my review and offered her sincere apologies, a follow-up call from customer service, and a coupon for a free pizza / meal. I was very appreciative of the response, and as I told her, I've been to other NYPD Pizza locations with much better results; I think this episode was the result of a new or poorly trained server."
0,"Their delivery service was disappointing.  I was told 45min to an hour for delivery. At about 45 minutes the driver shows up with the wrong pizza.  He calls in and they tell him that it's in the oven, so he tells me he'll be right back. 45 minutes later he shows up with a cold pizza. This ruined the dinner experience.  I couldn't tell you if their pizza is good because I am not a fan of room temperature pizza. As a consolation the bum driver gave me some coupons (thanks!)."
0,"WOW!  I have never been to a place with service this horrible.  I may have caught them on a bad night, but I'm not giving them a second chance to find out!\n\nI came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..\n\nAs we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.\n\nWe stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.\n\nWhat a joke...\n\n**EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something"
0,"Overpriced, Terrible service!  I've been a long time customer of this chain, but I won't be going back! \n\nFor a long time I was happy to pay the high price for a great pie, but on a recent trip the poor service left a sour taste which has prompted me to visit the MANY other great pizza joints in the neighborhood.  \n\nThe manager was short, snarky and seemed to be put out to have me come pick my pizza up for take out.  When I called from a friend's phone and told him I didn't have my phone but that I was a previous customer and gave him my number, he said he would just drop the pizza at my house and charge my credit card if I didn't show up.   When I did show up and had a beer with friends while waiting he had the audacity to make a comment that if our intoxication became a problem he would have to ask us to leave."
0,"Mediocre pizza, HORRIBLE service.  We told the waiter that we were in a hurry and it still took 45 minutes to get the food.  We had two minutes to eat it and it was boring.  Then I got to argue with the waiter, so that was fun.  Go to the Parlor.  It's got better pizza and WAY better service."
0,"I ordered a pizza for delivery and requested it be delivered to my work office (right up the road) by noon. This was at 10am. By 12:07 I called to check on the order. I was assured that it had already left the building and was on its way. At 12:30 I called and was told the same thing \""Oh yes, she just left. It should be there any minute.\"" 12:50 and my pizza finally arrived. The woman who brought it had a piece of paper with my name on it and nothing else. She was on the phone, on hold, to find out if I had paid by card or if it was cash. I informed her that I ordered the pizza over two hours ago online and paid by card. She ignored me and we stood there for 5 minutes before she would hand over my small, now cold pizza. I signed the blank piece of paper. Now with 10 min left in my lunch break, I opened the box to find a cold and soggy pizza. The crust was wet with, I don't know what and the bottom was almost completely soggy. \nThis is probably the worst experience I have had. One thing after another, not to mention the website crashed on me three times when I ordered, should've know it would be a problem.\nNeedless to say... I won't be eating here again and neither will my friends."
0,last ditch Christmas eve take home pizza...ok...I ordered it on line and went and picked it up..they kept me waiting anyway...I asked for extra crisp...might as well have asked for extra raw...just to much dough..ingredients just laid on top of mushy dough...flavors..so so...would never go there again thanks....
0,"Oh NYPD Pizza. You seriously disappointed me. \n\nMy husband and I stopped in on Saturday around 1pm. We were seated quickly since the restaurant wasn't busy but it took us 15 minutes for a waiter to come by. FIFTEEN minutes. A different waiter dropped off two waters when we sat down, but other than that - no one even acknowledged us. We had to stop another waitress and ask who are waiter was - and she seemed super confused. \n\nFinally Connor rolls around. Doesn't apologize for the wait - just seems nonchalant about taking our order. \n\nWe split the chopped salad and had a few slices of pizza. The pizza was fine but don't bother with the chopped salad - not worth $10 at all. I think we counted a grand total of 4 tiny pieces of sun dried tomatoes and 8 quarter pieces of cucumber. \n\nWe were never checked on during our dining experience until my husband was taking the last bite of pizza crust, Connor asked us how was the food. Really? Water was never refilled and extra napkins never appeared. \n\nWe won't be coming back."
0,"What has happened to this place??  New management?  I came on here to see if there are any other disappointed customers recently.  My office has ordered from here numerous times for years. We know it takes over an hour for delivery so that is why we call in shortly after they open.  Last time we ordered it took 2.5 hrs for our food. They gave us a 50% discount. We were never gonna order again.  However, I am pregnant and just miss this place!  Today after an hour and a half went by I called to check on order.  \""It was next out for delivery.\""  The girl didn't seem to happy I was checking up on it.  It took  2 hrs this time.  The worse part is it seemed they threw on some cheese and did a quick run to heat back up.  It was awful.  Looks like Streets Of New York it is for now on.  :("
0,"I'm seriously shocked that there are not more neg reviews on here about this place because I hear people bitching all the time. \n\nFirst of all, do not expect to make a quick 'in-and-out' experience. You walk in and put your name on the List.. yes, list with a capital L. What is interesting is they ask you what your question/comment/concern is but when you finally get called five hours later, they ask you to explain your question/comment/concern all over again.\n\nLet's just say you have a Blackberry Pearl 8130 and the roller ball does not work anymore. Hypothetically, of course. So the highly skilled guy behind the counter looks at it for 2 seconds and says \""Oh, looks like it needs to be replaced...\"" I'm pretty sure I already said that. \""Unfortunately, we don't have any of these in stock..\""\n\nWha? Come again? You don't have any more of one of your most popular phones in stock, in any of the 542 colors it comes in? Boy oh Boy.\n\n\""Here, you can call this number and request they send you out a new one.\"" Great, the same number that told me I had to go into the store to get it replaced.\n\nOh brother what a bummer."
0,"This location is the sole reason that after 13 years, we are no longer AirTouch/Verizon customers, and will never, ever be again. I went in to upgrade my phones one afternoon only to be accosted by an angry, pimply faced little elf of an employee. He was disrespectful, got in my face, and talked down to me the entire time when all I had wanted was two new phones. When I got sick of his attitude I demanded a manager and he said there wasn't one. As if. He then called security, which is when I REALLY got mad! I began yelling at the top of my lungs when \""magically\"" a manager appeared out of the back room to investigate the commotion. The manager sent the kid on a \""walk\"" and apologized profusely, saying they've had problems with him before. My question was: WHY THE HELL DOES HE STILL WORK THERE?!?! He asked what he could do to make us happy and I asked for the regional manager's phone number. He provided the regional manager's cellular number, which I promptly called. After explaining what had happened, both managers agreed to cancel our two accounts with no early cancellation fees. Woot."
0,This location of Verizon gave me the customer service experience equivalent  of a car wreck.
0,"i wish i had got his name, but they have an employee in there, white guy, shaved head, he was trying to be kinda smart with me and act like he was above me, kinda like he was competing, now i wore my tank top in there, i am 26 but i look like im 20 and im not trying to act tough, i never do. Anyway i tried to be nice at first, and when explaining my problems (there are about 5 different problems i am having with my brand new stratosphere 2) he would tell me \""well there's nothing we can do about that\"", and im like \""well what about all these other problems\"" he would reply \""what other problems\"" 2 TIMES after ive explained all my problems he says\""what other problems\"" i said f*** it dude you are an idiot im going to talk to someone else... so i talk to someone else here are the problems im having with the stratosphere 2 in my first two days (mind you i haven't really used my phone these two days because these problems are constant and f***ing annoying):\n1. i cant send or receive calls/texts (this happens on and off)\n2. if my text is somewhat long people either dont get it or they get a couple words out of the few sentences, just a couple f***ing words sometimes half of a word\n3. the calls that do go through, well 75% of the time no one can hear me, i can hear them, they cannot hear me\n4.the phone reads my sd card but it wont play my music (the sd card works fine in my stratosphere 1)\n5. i cant use my apps, they randomly just exit and im back to the front screen, if i try again it happens again\n\nOF COURSE when i go in to show them the phone starts acting normal, so i cant get a replacement on this f***ing phone that i cant even use, have to keep re trying my calls, miss texts, people dont get my texts or they get a couple words from it AND i cant use my apps, so pretty much nothing on this f***ing phone works, but i cant get a new one....."
0,Most inefficient place I've been at.  Told it would be 30min and turned out to be an hour.  All I needed to do was replace a carrier clip.  Everyone was pissed off in the store.  You can't get simple service without waiting.  The only positive was the guy who checked us in finally got a clue and got me a new clip before my name was called.  The want personalized service but there only getting pissed off customers once they start to help them out.  Oh yea employees there park in the prime parking in front of the store.  I noticed this while we were waiting.   If you have a lot of spare time on your hands then this is the place for u. I will never go back to this store.
0,they are LUCKY to get even this 1 star ...if possible i would of given them -5.....EXTREMELY RUDE....I will never walk into this location again.....AVOID at all costs this location!!!!
0,"My husband and I came into this store on Saturday to upgrade our phones and to add him to my plan. We were put in the queue for a sales associate, and were then called over by a woman with blonde curly hair who basically refused to help us at all.\n\nHere's what happened:\nUnbeknownst to me my maiden name was still on my account, so when asked for my ID it didn't match up. \n\nMe -So how do I change my name on my account?  \n\nSale associate - Do you have anything on you with your old name on it?\n\nMe - No, that's my old name, everything I have on me now has my new name.\nSo how do I go about changing my name on my account?\n\nSales associate - If you don't have anything with your old name on it, I can't help you.\n\nMe - People get married all of the time and change their name, you're telling me I can't change my name on my account?\n\nSales associate - Not at the store level\n\nMe- Fine, I guess I'll just figure it out myself.....\n\nI then walked out of the store and called their customer number to ask them how to change my name on my account since, the Sales Associate in the store wouldn't tell me how. I was told I just need to bring my marriage license into a STORE, and they could change it there. Um, I was just told in the store that I couldn't change my name there, but I guess that was a lie.\n\nThe woman I dealt with clearly had no desire to help me. It's fine if you don't know the answer to something, but at least make the effort to find it out! I don't understand people that work in customer service, and totally lack it at the same time, isn't this your job?\n\nCongrats for earning my first 1 star review!\n\nIf you need to go to a Verizon store, drive the 6 miles to the other one on 44th and Thomas where they actually will help you."
0,"The store manager is lazy, rude and unhelpful. Same with the assistant manager Charlie. I feel really bad for the reps who have to work under such poor management.  I got no help from anyone when it was clearly a problem caused by someone at that store.  The manager refused to take me off speakerphone even when it was obvious that the echo in his tiny, depressing office was making it impossible to communicate. GO TO THE ARCADIA STORE AT THOMAS AND 44TH. MUCH BETTER!! BOYCOTT THE CAMELBACK STORE!"
0,"I went to this store 4/10/2014 and was Daniel took very good care of me upgrading my phone.\nI went back 4/12/2014 with my wife to return a item that was defective and upgrade my wife's phone.

When I mentioned my wife having to walk that far several of the young wise mouths said so what. \nOne female and one guy felt the need to mouth off over the bathroom issue, even with a handicapped person.\nOf course I got pissed with their additudes and expressed my displeasure with Verizon and their wise mouths.\nI told them now my wife refuses to buy from that store and they said they don't really care. They then told me to leave, that they would not do the refund.\nI've been a customer since 1995 when it was Alltel, and then when Verison took over I stayed with Verison. When I mention this they said they really could care less.\nOf course being 62 and handicapped myself, I then told the female and one guy for both of them to F-OFF.\nThe customer service has really gone down since they are the most popular wireless company in Arizona.\nIf I can do anything to assist in taking them down a few levels I will.\nIf Verizon continues to hire and employee people like this with absolutely no customer service professionalism, Verizon will fall like a rock.\nIf I had not gotten my new phone 4/10/14 and now being stuck with a 2 year contract I would have jumped ship and gone with Sprint.\nVerizon is going to have to do a lot of butt kissing to keep me with them when the 2 years is up."
0,"Terrible service! Worst location I've ever been. I had to go to this location in the past, never liked the service. This time I went in and they immediately approached me at the door, first time ever btw, and asked me to leave immediately because I had my dog with me. I had brought the dog with me before. They said it was company policy, I went to another store and guess what....it's not!!!!! Horrible place!!! Considering on dropping them entirely!"
0,"I was toying with the idea of upgrading my iPhone and in the process switching from AT&T to Verizon so that I could bundle the new phone with my iPad. A coworker went to this Verizon store over the weekend and was telling me that she got all these great deals and discounts, along with them buying back her current device and then giving another discount for bundling her iphone with a tablet, etc.  \nI went in 2 days later hoping for the same great deal only to be totally confused by the associates explanation of what my options were, deceived about the difference in the pricing options, not being able to bundle iPhone with iPad for some reason, no discounts/credits, nothing. Not even any incentive to come over from AT&T. Would end up costing me a lot more than what I'm paying for with AT&T. Also their service was slow and they weren't very customer service focused. This guy just wanted me to sign off on whatever and be done. I recommend checking out ALL of your options thoroughly before deciding on switching to Verizon, and definitely before going to this particular branch."
0,"Let me start of by saying I LOVE food, great service, I like to share the enormous portions served in restaurants, drink water with lemon and I do not drink alcoholic beverages.  I know, I scream cheapskate, but I think I deserve a decent 2.5 star experience, at least for the food.  Most places meet or exceed my expectations.  Guiseppes did not. \n\nAnd there comes a time when my youthful, ethnic appearance, water with lemon, request to share, and sober living is met with that \""I am not going to make money off of you\"" vibe from the owner.  It hasn't happened in a very long time, but Guiseppes proved their still is bad service reserved for their unwanted patrons.\n\nI was very excited to eat here seeing it on Diners Driveins and Dives on Food Network, my favorite food network show, and seeing all of the New Times best of awards.  Got there at 8:30pm Friday night, there were people waiting outside, thought it was a good sign.  Now I thought being in a strip mall, next to the water N ice store, the service would be warm and welcoming and the place would be chock full of non-dbags.  I am always cool waiting a bit for good food but being stared down by rich, overweight women with their husbands in flip flops, cargo shorts and Affliction tees and teenage platinum blondes with their smug smiling boyfriends in their flip flops, plaid shorts, and Affliction tees is never my cup of tea.\n\nFast forward 30 minutes of this ish we get seated, another 10 minutes menus, another 10 minutes a water and a watered down gross iced tea which they CHARGED us for even though she took it back and gave him water, and by 9:30pm we get our 15dollar saltysaltysalty bolognese ragu with overcooked spaghetti (we didn't get the homemade pasta) to share, 4dollar baby 1/2 inch thin toastettes, and 2dollar marinara bowl for dipping.   (FYI this is an Italian Restaurant that not only makes you pay for an ounce of bread, they also CHARGE for extra virgin olive oil)\n\nSo go to Guiseppes if you like:\n\n_\""EH\"" Italian Food\n_Cold and dry humor from the owner\n_Slow waitresses\n_Being stared at by stuffy people in such an unlikely, un-stuffy atmosphere\n_Your hopes let down =) Enjoy!"
0,What a joke. We recently moved to this area of Phoenix and thought we would try it one night after seeing the sign that it was on the food network walking out of Sprout's. They charge $3 for bread and it is four small slices of stale french bread. The two pasta dishes had no real sauce or flavor and the prices are ridiculous. \n\nIt was $32 for two pasta dishes and bread. I am so angry right now that I didn't go with my gut feeling and just go to Mamma Mia's. Mamma Mia is similar in price but offers twice the portion and you get the bread for free like a normal Italian Diner. I think this might be the angriest I have ever been after eating dinner out.
0,"Everybody who thinks about coming here should go to the real Giuseppe's, in Scottsdale.\n\nI grew up eating at this location pretty much my whole life. So many great memories of the spot but unfortunately the change in ownership left this place with shoddy food. \n\nEveryone who rates this place above a two, please do yourselves a favor and try the location in Scottsdale (13610 N Scottsdale Rd). The difference is stark."
0,It's gross.  Don't waste your money please!  Hope this helps you!
0,"Mediocre, unsatisfying and barely average!\n\nI joined a friend recently on a Friday night and the entire meal was barely passable. The calamari was uninspired and bland, just sauteed with a thin red sauce and a few frozen peas. Hardly inspiring. The 4 bruschetta were good, with interesting touches like honey and chicken liver, but another tasted like it had plain old strawberry jam on top of mascarpone cheese? \nThe fettucini carbonara was exceptionally bland and lacked the classic ingredients in abundance like it should including peas. Did they end up in the calamari by mistake ?  \n\nThe house recommended fresh tagliatelle with bolognese sauce was sad and uninspired and poorly prepared and presented. Really, as a Chef, I found the dish lacking any depth, including the unseasoned meat sauce (6 different meats in the sauce according to the owner, but still lacking any depth, flavor or significant interest). The sauce was mixed into the noodles already and looked very amateurish and very cafeteria-like. A real disappointment overall.   \n\nThe prices are actually a bit expensive for a strip mall and poor quality. Plastic cups for water, paper napkins for dinner service and piccolo pours of a limited wine selection only added to the lack of value. \n\nWill definitely not return. A disappointing experience that needs attention and correction."
0,"This place was a huge disappointment. After hearing how it had been recognized on the Food Network, I went there with a friend on a Sunday evening and found the food to be mediocre and overpriced. The waiter also tried desperately to get us to purchase wine and sides. I finally relented to an order of garlic bread, and was served plain, stale bread. For this stale bread, we got charged $3. I will not be going back. If you want Italian, Red Devil is a better deal with a nicer atmosphere and better wait staff.. Oh yeah, the bread is good and complimentary."
0,The food here is decent but certainly not worth dealing with the very condescending owner. I'd much rather take my money to a place that appreciates their customers.
0,"I have never written a review before but felt i had to.  This place sucks!  Went here with 3 other friends for dinner.   My osso buco was below average, flavorless, and dry.   We had garlic bread which was 5 pieces of cold, stale french bread drizzled with olive oil and dried oregano.  R u kidding me??  My guests were disappointed with their dishes as well and the dinner was not deserving of such high prices.  Some of it came out cold!   Dinner for 4 of us was WAY overpriced.  Only thing good was desert.  Service was just OK, but he didnt take much time to check on us.  The owner thinks he's a 5 star chef.  Gimme a break dude.  Plastic water cups with these prices??  Go to North, or any other place for that matter.  Sign out front is super tacky.  Guy Fieri must have been stoned when he reviewed this place, or else the quality has sunk.  I believe it was years ago anyways."
0,"I was visiting family and we decided to go out to eat and found this place 5 minutes from my sisters house.  We stood at the front for 15 minutes with no acknowledment from ANY employee (we did show up kind of late so if it was because they were closing soon all they had to do was say so instead of ignoring potential future customers, the restaurant was not packed and there were servers standing inside talking to one another). I also let them know on their Facebook book page and my comment was later deleted. An apology would have been nice along with a \""we hope you would consider giving us a try again\"" instead of just, again, ignoring potential future customers. I'm from Arizona but am not currently living there because my husband is in the air force and is stationed in Idaho. I will not recommend this restaurant to any of our friends or service men heading that way because of their sheer lack of consideration of their patrons. I do not want to lead them to a bad experience when there are plenty of great places to eat in phoenix that do not need the help of a \""as seen on food network\"" sign to attract business. (We ended up at Tomaso's in Phoenix with great customer service and delicious food!)"
0,"\""They don't need your help. You probably waited 5 min and have now wasted more time out of your life. Armed service people?!?\nYea so they can ask for a military discount for not being able to make a real life choice about direction. Take orders as a server , then talk to yelp bout educated disappointments of yours.\"" -CatchM T.\nFirst of all this was my experience at this restaurant and I do not need any \""compliments\"" from anyone telling me that it wasn't. Since you would like to know, I've never been a server because I do not want to be one but I'm sure it's so much more harder than being a \""armed service people\"" (as you like to call them). I do however know a thing or two about customer service  (my review says the servers were standing around talking to one another meaning they could have easily taken the 10 seconds to walk over and say they were no longer taking anymore customers or whatever the reason was). The one thing people in customer service know is the customers pay your bills! Without them you're broke and out of business! That is why It doesn't matter if it's a $2 check or if business is doing so well that you don't need or care for any new customers, you should always treat the last customer just as good, if not better, than the first. I'm also sure people could care less but I can also talk to yelp A bout any educated disappointments I would like."
0,The food has no taste.  I went here for my birthday because we saw it on TV.  I have no idea how anyone can give this place a good rating.  If you like tasty food please go somewhere else.  Not even my 3 year old son liked it.
0,"Doesn't matter how good the may be, if you get bad service, the whole evening is ruined. \n\nThis was a return visit, so we knew about the limited seating. The wait was a half an hour, not something I have patience for but since we were with friends, we stuck it out. \n\nAfter we were finally seated, it was 45 minutes before we were served our entrees and then we got one by itself and the rest of the table had to wait for theirs. It would be understandable if the whole restaurant was slow, but two other tables who came in after us were served before we were. \n\nOur server kept saying \""I'm sorry for the wait\"" as her mantra.  I'm sorry, too, for a very unpleasant experience."
0,"Avoid. Expensive wine list and our waiter pulled a wine scam on me.  The wine list here is ridiculously expensive. I ordered the least expensive bottle of Chianti for $32 ( what they call \""house\"",  and this is not a fancy place) and I got attitude for it!  Our waiter asked: \""Wasn't I sure I wanted the next step up at $38?\"" I did not want to pay more. Even after I accepted the tasting, the wandering owner of the place shot our waiter a look like \""dig Mr. Cheapskate over there...\"" The waiter poured three half glasses from our bottle. Then the waiter took the bottle away. ( Bad sign, in retrospect) When I asked for the rest of the bottle, he said we finished it! I know wine bottles and there were  more than three half glasses in that bottle. I asked if he was sure and he said yes. Rather than create a scene with my party - a buzz kill for sure to argue over this -  I ordered three more glasses  - at an additional $24. The waiter opened a new bottle, poured, and guess what, there was about a half bottle left!  I was not happy! Not happy about the brazen attitude for ordering a $32 bottle or the very short first bottle. I think I was scammed.  Every order should be respected. The food was good, I admit, and reasonably priced but it must act as a lure to soak you on the wine. They do carry out and this would be the only way to enjoy this place, in my opinion.Better yet, try someplace else."
0,"I went to Guiseppe's February 19th with another person.  It was a disappointing dinner.  Water was served in plastic cups and the napkins were paper.  Both dishes we ordered were tasteless -- adding cheese on top did not help.  The dish I ordered was a mushroom \""stew\"" over ravioli dough.  The second time I found myself chewing something very gritty, I called the waitress over and told her the food either had sand or broken glass in it. I gave her a piece of the grit I had taken out of my mouth and, after a long examination by the owner & staff, the owner said he thought it was crystallized sugar.  I think it was dirty mushrooms.  Regardless, I then replaced that dish with pasta fagioli, a little greasy with  90% broth.  Not good. The avocado/tomato salad was delicious.  However, I thought an owner who wanted return business would have comped my meal or, at the least, have offered free coffee or dessert.  Nope!  I will not be back."
0,"Well I held out on writing a review based off my 1st experience,  which was two weeks ago.  I called in a order to carry out.  I ordered shrimp fettuccine Alfredo with fig and marscopone purchtuo burchettas. When I got home it was terrible.  The pasta is home made so it's super thick.  Four small shrimp and hardly no Alfredo sauce, I mean dry. That fake bruccetta is hard and dry.  So I called a spoke to Cindy and explained that I lived far from the location.  It practically took me an hour to get there and I couldn't come back.  So she put the owner in the phone and we worked out a deal that I would get a $27.00 credit the next time I came in. \n\nFast forward to today which was a couple of weeks later. When I arrived Cindy wasn't there but the owner Richard was.  So I explained who I was and he remembered. So he said I can give you a $17.00 credit because you ate the meal didn't you?  I didn't even touch that dry mess. So being pressured and embarrassed of what the phone conversation was and what he was saying to my face and the place was packed and I didn't want to argue.  I just ordered their signature dish, the Osso buco to- go again. So the waiter rang me up and I ended up paying them about $15.00 additional dollars.  I was pissed off. But I figured well maybe it will be worth it.\n\nI get home and make nice salads for me and my husband to accompany the meal still with high hopes because it looks good and the meat is falling off the bone. So we eat it with disappointment.  The sauce is tasteless I mean no flavor at all the bread was dry.\n\nI will never return. I will go to Olive garden which I far better than this place. Or just wait to go back to New York and eat authentic Italian at Carmine's or Rao's in Vegas. Or for great bruccettas go to Postionos.\n\nI don't know why this place is crowded.  The food is bland and it's so tiny.  I have been to several DDD destinations this one is a BIG miss."
0,"We are new neighbors just up the hill in Paradise Valley, and we SO wanted this to be our \""go to\"" dinner place for nights when we were too busy to cook and to take visiting families and friends.   Full disclosure:  we tried four times, each time it was around 8:00 pm. Two of the four we were treated pretty poorly by a female hostess. There were still patrons eating in the restaurant, but she told us they were getting the main dining room set up for a big event the next day (both times) and sat us in the bar. Last night, there was a basketball game on in the bar...I would not mind eating in a pub atmosphere if we were paying pub prices. So, when we told her that the noise was too much and asked to be reseated in the restaurant she refused. I don't think was too much to ask, for just the two of us. And it's interesting the other two times we went, the male hosts gave us the choice, and sat us in the restaurant.  Food has been inconsistent, but not all that bad.  Pasta on two visits was all small pieces (spaghetti one night and fettuccine another) like we were getting the dregs. I'd be more tolerant of that, but for the price of the food, we expect a more pleasant dining experience.   Too bad.  They need to make some changes."
0,"My husband and I found it one Open kitchen. We read the reviews and decided to try it out. We waited 5 minutes before anyone greeted us at the door. The hostess asked us if we wanted the formal dining area or lounge. We chose the lounge. She asked if we wanted a wine list. We said yes. Bread was brought over and that wS the last we saw of anyone for 20 minutes. Finally, I said lets go. My husband went to find the hostess and I guess a manager came and asked if we have been helped. I said no, and he brought someone over. The waiter didn't seem to thrilled to serve us. He had trouble remembering the specials. Not impressed with the service, staff, or food. Won't be going back."

0,"I spend too much of my waking hours at this mixed office/retail space and I pay $75/month for garage parking in a city where parking is usually free so naturally I can't be completely objective about this review.  Generally, it's Outdated, with too many empty suites, and expensive parking.\n\nTake a look at the restaurants that somehow survive or haven't.... Houston's moved across the street, McCormick & Schmicks remains empty, and so does the space that housed a chain steakhouse that anchored one end."

0,"We came in here to have a few drinks before going across the street for dinner. As soon as we sat down at the bar, the bartender (who couldn't speak English very well) comes over. I immediately ask her to relay the happy hour specials. $3.99 house wines, and $2 drafts. My companion has a budlight draft, I choose a house pino grigio. We ended up staying for two rounds. The bartender disapears and we ask the \""manager\"" for the check. After he brings it over we notice that my wine was $10 a glass. After explaining to the \""manager\"" that we came in here for the happy hour. He says he will go ask the \""owner\"" in back. He comes back, shrugs his shoulders and says that there is nothing he can do. Meanwhile the bartender (who can settle this) is still nowhere to be found. I explain to him that I live very close by and usually come here to watch football on sundays, but sadly I will not be returning. He says \""Oh.... let me ask the owner again\"" and walks back. At that point, I had enough. It wasn't about the money. I stood up, left money on the bar and walked out. This place is a joke."

0,Went for a late night meal since Los Cerritos was closed. First time eating at the this location. The following day was filled with throwing up bial and not keeping anything down. Pins and needles in the hands and feet. Nausea and light headed. 90% sure I have food poisoning from this steak egg and cheese burrito with potatoes and beans. Never again.

0,Don't rent unit 242. This is privately owned and not one of the thirty units that currently are for rent from the management company. The landlord will not pay for any maintenance while you are renting from him and he will keep your security deposit regardless of the condition of the apt. I paid two hundred dollars to have the place professionally cleaned. I also filled all the holes in the walls with spackle. He claimed he had to have the walls retextured and was keeping my deposit. The hot water in the unit takes about 15 minutes to get from the community boiler which is located in the front of the complex and never exceeds the temperature of 107 degrees. I moved because the maintenance done by the HOA is very slow and the pool is often green before it can be blue. As witnessed by the review before this. I incurred over 300.00 in plumbing expenses in the two years I was there and the owner refused to pay for any of it. Someone climbed the balcony to the second floor and stole my bike. Your parking space is no where near the unit.
0,Terrible Nasty Trashy Place
0,Worst place I have ever lived. No water half the time. No A/C the other time. The staff is here to make sure they get paid only and do not care about your problems.  I can't wait to move.
0,"This place SUCKS.....joke is on you if you stay here. Only reason we did is because we hosted a customer seminar here the next morning. However, if you like staying in your great-great-great-great grandmothers old time shack you would enjoy it.\n\nWe arrived late (around 9 pm) and the valet guys were pretty good. I don't know if you can self park the car anywhere close. Valet asked my name and spoke into his headset, but after I walked the ten feet to the front desk the clerk had no clue who I was or what I was doing there (basically no clue at all). She couldn't tell me where our event would be (I like to check out the room the night before) or if anything had arrived for us (we shipped some things).\n\nI headed up to the room and it reeked of fresh paint. I was going to call down, but decided I would stop on my way to the fitness center. The itself was AWFUL - could have really used a good cleaning and some new wall paper.....it just looked old and beat-up. Don't ever get suckered into staying in room 827.\n\nHeaded down to front desk and asked if the room was just painted, answer was \""I don't think so\"", and instead of asking if they put me in a new room that was it. Service = Horrible.\n\nThe \""newly remodeled\"" fitness center was weak -- very, very small, limited free weights, tread mills/ellipticals, and old weight machines. It would be a disaster if they had a house full of people who wanted to work out. Might be a nice spot if you were over 100 years old!\n\nHeaded back up to the room and was unimpressed with the shower and bathroom. I would say it was on par with a Super 8.\n\nAlthough breakfast was included in our package, I headed down early to our event. I will say the food for that was great, service was top notch and the coffee cake was so unbelievably good...I also liked the free shoe shine.\n\nNo way would I ever stay at this location or any Ritz for that matter.\n\nTotal - $231.80 (room was 208 for the Schwab rate - including $18 breakfast)"
0,"You, sir, are not a Ritz-Carlton. When I first walked in, it impressed. It had tasteful, old school decor and helpful people at every turn. The problems started when one of the people in our party had his card declined at check-in (not for the room cost because those were already covered, but for the incidentals). I am told that this decline was not his fault and I would certainly believe him as this is not the type of man who runs up his credit cards. Either way, the hotel staff should have asked another one of us for our cards, but for some reason they just stubbornly kept trying to run the same card for 5 minutes. This was while the rest of us waited, twiddling our thumbs. Oh, yes and we were already running late so this was very annoying. Finally, a manager came over and said that they would figure it out later. Well, within 10 minutes when we were finally in our room, here comes a call on the room phone telling us to come down as soon as possible and put a card on file. Ummm, okay. And why couldn't they just ask when we were just down there???? The room did not impress and was in fact so terribly run down that even the marble in the bathroom had rusted in spots and the pipes under the sink were corroded and leaking. Really, supposed \""Ritz-Carlton\""? But here it is, people. Probably the most rude thing that I have ever experienced from a hotel W down to La Quinta: I went to the front desk to ask for a razor and shaving cream. The woman at the desk very helpfully and condescendingly directed me to the tiny gift shop closet where she said they sell it. So, here I was expecting to pay $12 for some crappy bic and a tiny bottle of foam. But no, I guess they were out of them because none was to be found. When I came out of the shop-closet she asked if I found it. I said no, there wasn't any in there. She replied oh, well I will see if room service can bring one to your room. Now, that's odd. When I went to my room, housekeeping was just outside the door. I asked if they might have a shaving kit and the maid rolled her eyes, dug around in her cart and handed me a \""ritz carlton\"" official box with a razor and tube of cream inside. For...real... What terrible, money-grubbing, uncouth service! So, yeah. Perhaps consider staying here if you like to be treated like trailer trash who is not nearly good enough for their moldy, falling apart hotel. But, then again I think there is a W nearby. Paris prices for Arkansas accommodations."
0,We had a ROACH on our wall crawling. We called to have some one spray it took the maintenance 15 mins to get there. We go and spam to the manager he took another 30 mins to come talk to us then told us well I don't know what to tell you the damage is already done. It's dead we can't kill it. Then proceeds to insinuate that maybe we brought it with us or maybe a hitch hiker brought it in. Maybe it was just that we were youbg and blavk he fekt he coukd be so disrespectful. I'm so disgusted with how the  Ritz handled the problem MILAN KOPRIVICA has to be THE WORST manager ever.
0,"Surreal experience at the Ritz this week. My friend is a guest there for the week. We were having breakfast and a server recognized my friend from past visits. I was introduced by first name only to the server. This afternoon I get a \""no caller ID\"" call on my cell and its this server asking me out. I was stunned to say the least. This is supposed to be highly inappropriate for their employees to do. The only way she could have gotten my contact info is to have looked up my friend in their database and seen that I am listed as their contact. My friend met with the hotel management today and they were more accusatory than helpful. We had Thanksgiving brunch scheduled but that is cancelled since the server is working it.and my friend is checking out early. The mgmt told my friend they would contact me and they haven't.\n\nThank you Ritz-C for allowing one of your employees to be a stalker and not giving a shit.\n\nDo yourself a favor folks and stay elsewhere. Like the Biltmore Hotel, Royal Palms, or the Phoenician. They are very close and certainly care more about their guests and reputation than this glorified Motel 6."

0,"Steve is a great guy but the gyros and fries fall short of OK let alone great.  First off the gyros always sliced so thin that it quickly burns and curls on spit when cut. That Would put you out of business in Chicago. Next the toppings are weak and need to be improved. The pita is ok but not worthy of my mouth or money. Now the fries, come on guys these fries are greasy and no flavor Steve turn the temp on the fryer to 350 and they will fry properly.  Stop giving us greasy fries they suck buddy.  Gyros needs to be flavorful and juicy you know that, but many places here have no idea how to make that happen.  I wish I could have a gyros like central gyros or costas gyros back home. Your sauce is good but that's just not enough to earn more stars.  I will submit this to the AZ papers as well maybe just selling the business would be best.  The gyros here should be free.  Come Steve better gyros for all is needed.  I mean dry and burnt just doesn't work man. I will be watching this place and informing others if things improve.  Peace."
0,"Not impressed. My coworker and I were waiting for a movie across the street and decided to try and beat the heat by getting some ice cream. I have allergies to soy so I have to be very careful about what I eat as it is in *everything* these days. There were two gentlemen in the store one dark haired and kinda sullen looking,  the other heavy set. I failed to get their names as I was quickly put out by our experience and just wanted to leave. \nThe heavy set guy was busy with a customer so we asked the dark haired one if there was nutritional information available and politely explained I had allergies and had to be aware of everything I eat. He looked at us blankly and kind of put out sounding responded \""I have it in a book.\"" There was a pause as he just stood there staring like we were some sort of circus oddity. Finally, my coworker politely asked if we could see the book. Without saying anything and with a slight roll of his eyes he turned, grabbed the book and shoved it in my face kinda rudely. I took it from him and turned away from him because it was clear he had some sort of problem. I remarked to my coworker \""Friendly... Love that\"" because he clearly was not.\nPerhaps he despised his low paying job. Perhaps he thought we looked too low class to be in his presence. Perhaps he was having a bad day. Perhaps he was just a jerk. Whatever the case, his unfriendliness and and our unwelcome  were palpable. I flipped absentely through the book but quickly decided I really had a problem giving money to a store who had employees that seemed to think openly treating customers with disrespect was okay . Handing the book back to the employee in question, I smiled and said thank you as we left. As if this wasn't enough, as we were leaving I noted that he never took his eyes off of us and even kind of elbowed his co worker and started making some sort of comment while staring us down through the window of the store as we left. They chuckled amongst themselves if full view of us as I watched. They seemed not to care that I could see their every move. \nWhen I called back after we left and asked to speak to a manager, at first I was put on hold while whoever answered said they would go get the manager. A couple seconds later, the same person came back and said, \""Oh I'm sorry. She's not here.\"" He then informed me he had no idea when she would be back in. \nCall me crazy, but I find it hard to believe in a store of that size one could be unaware their manager was no longer in the store and further could not give me any sort of estimation of when she was expected except to say she was \""usually\"" around in the morning. \nAt any rate, I have scarcely been treated so rudely in a customer service environment ever. So, to the manager, whoever you may be, I would suggest you inform your employee he should endeavor to adjust his attitude towards paying customers if he intends to continue working with the public. Honestly, I really don't care what his problem was. Not my issue. I couldn't care any less what he thought of me or my coworker. However, I steadfastly refuse to give my hard earned money to a store which allows this kind of blatantly unacceptable behavior from one of its employees. Next time, I'll just find a Ben and Jerry's or simply endure the heat without aid."
0,"OMG! what the heck happened to this place? It hasn't even been more than a year since I was there last, and it has totally gone down the drain. the ladies restroom was worse than a truck stop restroom. I've driven coast to coast 4 times, and from CA to AZ a plethora of times and have never been in a bathroom as sick as theres was. Worse part about it was the managers rude reaction. I pointed out the fact that the toilet paper was all wet, making it impossible for anyone to use it and all he did was pile up rolls on the top of the toilet. He didn't even bother asking anyone to clean up the paper droppings; being that the toilet paper was coming off in chunks there must have been at least 20 pieces of toilet paper all over the floor. \n\nI guess that is why the place was dead at midnight on a Friday. The over priced drinks, the horrible toilet paper and the bartender tossing ice all over the bar each time he poured a drink might also have something to do with it. \n\nI'm just saddened that with the influx of new businesses going in across the street, improving the area, this place is going straight downhill. The manager Sunny was a smart A-S when I brought the restroom issue to his attention as well. Guess I shouldn't have expected anything more, especially when the first thing you walk through when you arrive at this bar is a cigarette cloud; as you have to go out front to smoke. \n\nThis used to be my favorite spot, but alas the times are a changing!"
0,"I really hate to do this, because I have been a fan of the Merc Bar for years, but its a must.  My fiance & I were looking for a place to entertain our wedding party the weekend before our wedding and it was clear to us that the Merc Bar would be the perfect place.  We love the atmpsphere.  It usually has a nice & mature crowd.  The service is usually good.  It was perfect.  \n\nUnfortunately, it was the management and not the lounge that ruined our perspective of the venue.  The manager (Tommy) was slow/nearly impossible to reach and even harder to get info out of.....i.e. Whats your process for group reservations. \n\nHe seemed annoyed that I conntact him and unwilling to make time for us.  After several incomplete emails he finally called me, at my request, but it became clear, after 5 mins on the phone, that he did not want our business.  It was also apparent that he lacked basic customer service skills.\n\nSince, the goal of the evening is relax & enjoy our time with our friends, not to worry about bad service, we took our covo with Tommy as a hint that the Merc Bar would not be a good fit.  We need a place with a more mature management staff.....so, we're going with the Montelucia.  Its a nice upscale resort, with an awesome spa, a very nice lounge & live music on Saturday night, a great pool & nice rooms.   Truly perfect."
0,"hours posted are wrong. arrived here at 4:45 today, opened door and was greeted by a woman telling me they didn't open until 5:30. well as of now posted hours here are from 4. I get that hours change and not all media gets updated, but their doors were open and their hours reported as such. No offer to be seated and offered a drink anyway or even an incentive to return during new business hours. just a simple we are closed until 5:30 and an escort out.  I repeat, hours posted on this site as of writing this review reflect my attempted patronage. lock your door or update online info or be courteous. there were only 2 of us, and not even a question if there would be more which there wasn't. never been here before. probably will not try again thanks to this experience"
0,"Waitress good, bartender slow... Could have a few more drinks but.... Could not order since bar backed up. Need more staff on the floor. Oh and this little gem! (manager did make right but I pointed it out), drinks were not consistent in volume. \n\nMoscow Mule in copper cup was 30-40% bigger than in a glass. Because we were having those we ended up with multiples in glass since they ran out of copper mugs. We did the water test (pour from glass to copper mug) and was 30-40% LESS! Pointed this our to the manager (Adam) he said he was aware but disputed the 30-40% claim, said maybe closer to 20%! WOW, don't admit that! . I told him to head over to the table and we will show you. My issue is this, HE KNEW IT! The price is the same, but you are getting less. I told him that the house wins every time in this situation. Less Drinks, Same Price! Did, I mention HE KNEW THIS! With a $300+ tab, he comped 3 Drinks ($36). He attempted to right a wrong, but only after I made a big deal about it. Thanks for the 3% comp on my 30-4-% less drink! Great decor, waitress was great, but based on the inconsitance of the amount you are paying for...WILL NOT BE BACK"
0,"Don't let this place fool you. To keep the story short the server, Erica, said there was no merlot. Okay. Ordered a couple Malbecs ($8 each) instead. When we got the bill she charged the order as both Merlots ($10 each).  She never told us she had it on stock. It was more like...surprise! Let's charge them more bc either the server is thinking a) I don't know what they ordered or b) I'm gonna charge more so I can get a bigger tip. For that we gave her $3 for lying to us!! Btw def didn't taste like a merlot.  Checked my credit card charges for 2 separate receipts few days later. The server gave herself more than 20% tip when I clearly put zero on one and $3 on another receipt for 3 drinks -- purposely!!! She doesn't deserve it! \n\nCalled the manager a few days later and short story was the manager, Adam was trying to sound professional but totally sounded annoyed. Yes it's only a few dollars but the whole principle behind their service was shady to say the least. Adam said he would call back a couple days later. Nope!! One week went by and no one called me back. So guess what? I called back. Spoke with another manager, Francisco. He told me that Adam said it was an INCONVENIENCE for him to reverse the charges and that it will cost them!!!! Hahahahahaha really??!!?? You have to be kidding me! What kind of service is this!?? They're worried about a few dollars rather than their reputation??? Wow!! That really says a lot about them. He told me the only way to get credit back is to come back for a free drink. How about NO!! Why would I go back to a place that is shady? Anyway he said Adam will call me back. We will see about that. Maybe they will when they see this. \n\nAlso I agree with the other reviews from Rick and Rich. Going cheap on the Moscow mule by serving it in a smaller glass. Classic."
0,"Beautiful place, nice ambiance. Ok drinks. Music could be better. The waitress was dressed very provocatively (large breasts falling out of the top of her dress- showing her panties each time she bent over- which was often)- it appeared that many ladies on dates felt uncomfortable, arms crossed immediately with the men looking at the ground... Probably more uncomfortable for the guys really- because one wrong glance or blink and that date is over! \n\nIf this is the vibe Merc Bar is going for then... well done I guess.  I will say, it is awkward when a girls large boobs are coming out of her top and she keeps bending down with her chest in your date's face... kudos to her for being an attractive young lady, but it's a bit much when it makes the guests uncomfortable. \n\nAlso,  as one woman left her table to use the restroom, I watched the waitress flirt and stroke her husband's arm up and down as she gave him the check... I have a feeling if the wife saw that.... well, I'm happy she didn't, because you just don't know how people are gonna react to that disrespectful, intrusive behavior. It knocked the place down a couple notches- not quite Hooters vibe or strip club lounge- Maybe Champagne room? I really did wonder if I got up to use the restroom, would this girl come over to feel my guy up too? I didn't like that one bit. It wasn't a good feeling to have out with your significant other- and unfortunately, this is the memory I so strongly took away. Then again, it was also interesting watching the guy that somehow ended up on a date with a transexual squirm in the corner as she insisted on playing with his hair and trying to kiss on his neck... That must have been an internet date, lol!\n\nAlso, regarding the service, each time we would ask questions about the drinks the waitress would have to go ask the bartender. It's a specialty cocktail lounge- we aren't liquor micro-biologists asking for a chemical analysis of their concoctions- just regular basic questions. It would have been nice if she would have had some level of knowledge and training- given the niche and price points. \\ \n\nAll in all- I remember when this place was hot, back in the day- when I don't think I was even old enough to drink. It's still a nice place, but there are so many more options in this town now. Urbanity in Phoenix is progressing- gotta keep up with the times Merc Bar. When my barista knowns more about the soymilk in my Latte than this chick knows about a fresh squeezed lemon in a cocktail we have an issue. \n\nAs for the drinks... They were okay. I wasn't blown away by the choices. We ended up going to Sidebar afterwards- I love their muddled blueberrry whiskey sour- house made. Delicious! The drinks were better at Sidebar and the vibe was a little more modern less stripclub/2001 Scottsdale nightclub.\n\nSorry Merc."
0,"Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my \""plastic money\"" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???  \n\nThe customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying. \n\nNeedless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores..."
0,"This store has set hideous customer service standards! I was lied to about their return policy by an employee and screwed over! They gave me the run around when I asked to speak to a manager...she was conveniently never present and was the \""only one who could help me.\"" When giving me the final verdict on my issue, she cowardly had her employees do it for her on the phone (of course not face to face) and could not even call me herself. I highly recommend taking your business to a different pet boutique where quality service matters!"
0,"Just because you have the word Plantation, implying old Southern American charm, in your name doesn't mean you can't provide modern services like clean restrooms? Perhaps you could sweep the floor. And wipe down the counter. Oh, I know, maybe the pigeon poo could be scraped off the tables. I know. I know. I'm asking so much. And you'd think with a sort of Southern American name, you'd have that Blanche Deveroe, drawl and all, southern service, friendly and warm, like a peach cobbler on an autumn afternoon. Sadly, no. If I were to go again, I shall bring my Dustbuster, Lysol and my Miss Manner Guide to Etiquette book (yes, I do have one, quit laughing Kristin and Stevey P.) Rants aside, the coffee was passable. Although the coffee station was messier than the Circle K near the airport. It looked as a group of overly caffenited monkeys had just used it. And the croissant. Was like a pastry boomerang. And yes, when I threw it, sadly, it came back to me!  I have better Pillsbury products in my fridge. Coffee Plantation. Ya'll don't come back now, ya hear!!"

0,"While this CPK is largely like the others, it does have one thing to distinguish it: really terrible service. \n\nI was here for lunch the other day and noticed they have lunch specials where you get a soup or salad and one of a selected number of small pizzas. I ordered one but asked if I could substitute the soup offered for another kind of soup that was on the menu. I told the waitress that I had noted that the soup I wished to substitute cost $0.50 more and that I would gladly pay the additional charge.\n\nShe said she could not do that. No substitutions.\n\nSo, I asked \""why?\"" esp. as I was willing to pay the difference.\n\nHer reply (it's a classic): I might tell other people.\n\nHuh? What? I might tell other people I got what I wanted? That CPK allowed substitutions? That they, too, could get what they want at CPK?And does she really think I have long ranging discussions about my lunch soup choices?\n\nI tried to argue my point, but, quickly, realized that there is no arguing with that sort of unassailable logic.\n\nYep, I might tell other people."
0,Are you serious!!! Stop putting sugar in the gravy!!!! Cali can't do pizza!!!! Nasty!!
0,I can't actually rate the food because we left before it got that far. \n\nDrinks and service were horriable - not to mention the fact that it was like 100 degrees in there. Ohh and they  seem to have worked very hard in the design to  fit the absolute max amount of people per square foot with zero regard for comfort. There are tables jammed into every possible space.
0,"I used their catering services for a corporate training we were holding in our office. It was supposed to be delivered at noon. At 11:55, I received a call letting me know they were running a \""few minutes\"" behind. Fast forward 35 minutes later, I am sitting on hold with them for 10 minutes trying to find out where our food is. The gal on the phone was rude and acted like I was out of line by asking where it might be.\n\nI guess I just assumed a chain as large as CPK would have their act together when it comes to these things. Instead they didn't offer an apology or ANYTHING. We definitely won't be using them for corporate catering again, or anything else for that matter."
0,"TERRIBLE!!!!   The new \""hand-tossed\"" christ sucks!!!!  We will never order pizza from here again!  The mac and cheese was good though"
0,"The food is delicious here, but the experience always varies. Whenever I get a good waitress, the experience is excellent along with the food. The problem is that having a good waitress isn't something I can count on. The most recent experience I had was with a waitress named Courtney. She was very direct and wasn't pleasant at all. I ordered a soup with the edges of the bowl near the soup being dirty. I gave the soup back and she didn't apologize. Then she returns with a a new soup but in a much smaller bowl (it was still a little dirty). It was disappointing. The rest of my lunch was very uncomfortable and unenjoyable afterwards. \n\nI'm tired of coming here and having bad experiences like this. I will not be coming anymore because I can easily go to other restaurants and get the full package of excellent service and great food ALL the time. This service is too inconsistent. California Pizza Kitchen really needs to reconsider who they hire for these jobs because it degrades the experience and enjoyment of a well-known restaurant that should be held to high standards."
0,"The food was great, although my only complaint against this location is our server named Courtney was extremely rude and only showed any friendliness towards my friend and I because the manager was in the building. First time at a California Pizza Kitchen but the worst service I've had in my life from a waiter/waitress."
0,"I would not recommend taking your pet to this hospital. My dog went in for ACL repair and died. Dr. Ferrera called after the surgery to tell me my dog was fine and everything was great. I could pick her up in a few hours.\nAn hour and a half later he called back to say my dog had stopped breathing and he brought her back but she now had brain damage and would never be the same if in fact she pulled through.\nAfter seeing my dog it was clear I would have to put her down. I was told they would call me when they had her ashes back in about a week.\nTwo weeks later and with no call I went in only to be treated with absolutely no compassion what so ever. The girl at the front desk acted like see had never seen me before even though I have been going there for 12 years. She then went to the back and brought out a little black container which she plopped on the counter and said, \""here you go have a nice day.\""\nI will never step foot in that place again."
0,"I took my Bassett hound in on Wednesday 11/7/12 she has something wrong with her left eye looked greyish. They did no testing and gave her drops for possibly being bitten, by Saturday morning the eye was almost completely grey and I took her back the doctor came in didn't even look into her eyes and said it has to be Valley Fever and needed to do blood work but started treatment on Saturday and would call when the results came in. She acted like I was wasting her time by asking questions about Valley Fever. I just moved to Arizona and had never heard of it. So we did blood work and more medicine and off we go. By Tuesday afternoon I get the call saying quit giving her the pills for Valley Fever and take her to the Eye dr for animals it must be glaucoma and they can't help. So, after $300.00 with them and another $300.00 for the eye dr YES she does have glaucoma and is blind in the eye  I believe they possibly could have saved her sight if she had been diagnosis properly"
0,"I took my sixteen year old  Scottie in because he had stopped eating and drinking and was very, very ill.  I had called the night before to tell them that if he lived through the night, I would be bringing him in.  He was in total distress and clinging to life.  \nI was put in a room, where I was told to wait for an unknown time.  My dog was gasping for air.  I asked that he be viewed as the emergency,  that he was.  I was told again to sit down and wait.  I waited for a few more minutes and then walked out!  I went straight to Orangewood Pet Hospital where I was immediately taken care of and where blood work done. It was obvious that my dog needed to be put to sleep.  The experience was as good as any experience of that nature could be.  I am disgusted with the clinical, uncaring atmosphere of Squaw Peak Animal Hospital."
0,"DO NOT GO TO THIS CLINIC! My dog died as a result of negligence by both Dr. Ferrara and Dr. Clinton. I filed a claim with the veterinary board in September and after a lengthy process they finally made their decision yesterday. The findings were \""medical incompetence, failure to communicate professionally and a minor records violation\"" against Dr. Ferrara, who was my vet but I saw Dr. Clinton on several occassions when he was not available. The board also decided to file a claim against Dr. Clinton based on both of their testimonies. My dog was diagnosed as diabetic Memorial Day weekend and was dead right after Labor Day. I went in almost every week to get his blood tested and it wasn't until I finally took him to another vet that I found out how many basic things these two vets didn't check which could have been easily solved. He was so sick that as a result we had to put him to sleep. \n\nThe board won't decide their sanctions until the next meeting late January - and I understand he does have 30 days to appeal but I don't think he would be successful after the unanimous votes of the board."

Dr Clinton refused to see her patient because it was \""too close to closing time\"".  Dr. Clinton never made a referral, told me to go to the ER or made any indication that she believed me let alone cared.  She downplayed the severity of the situation and after the 25th seizure I rushed her to Phoenix Emergency and got her competent care and treatment.  I told Dr. Clinton the following that my puppy was in the hospital and she made every excuse imaginable why she did't see the patient, make any referral, send her to the ER and why she never even looked at the patient chart.  Dr. Clinton promised to follow up with me two days later and she NEVER called me to ask how her patient was doing let alone take responsibility for some of the bills that she promised to pay due to her incompetence!  I also left message for Dr. Ferarra to call me with my phone number and he NEVER called me back either! If you are looking for vets that actually care about their patients, this is not the place for you or your beloved pet!"

0,"\""Hey, Kerstin! Why are you eating a grilled cheese for dinner? Didn't you just eat out?\""\n\n\""Yeah, but we ate at Miracle Mile.\""\n\n'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.\n\nI got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager \""saved\"" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. \""Why don't you like caraway?\"" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, \""I really don't like the taste.\"" When she asked me \""Why?\"" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the \""sauce\"" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that \""real\"" texture. Foul, foul, foul. \n\nHence, the grilled cheese."

0,"Dear Miracle Mile,\n\nThis is the last time you will ever sucker another $15 bucks from me for bland, over-salted cafeteria food. I hate to be the rabid cur of dissent in this love fest, but I can no longer fake it and go with the flow. I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.\n\nUnless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so? Because every NY staple I've tried from your fetid excuse for a deli has sucked so effing hard it just about pulls grey matter out through my ears. \n\nStale and mealy defrosted cheesecake that was as unappetizing to look at as to consume. Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.\n\nAnd then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich. If it weren't for the spicy mustard at each table, I'd hardly have tasted anything at all! Bravo! You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix! \n\nAlthough I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. \""Next? Bread?\"" Unappetizing slop of meat, slid down the line to the next guy. \""Fries?\"" Heap of fried garbage, liberally applied, slid down the line. That is, unless you're asking for something outside of the crap-sandwich-and-fries box. At that point your request will be wordlessly acquiesced to with a scowl and a slop. \""Drink?\"" No! Please! NO! Just get me out of this slovenly pit of cafeteria hell. What do you want, I'll pay anything! Anything!\n\nWait a tic. That's your whole ploy all along, isn't it Miracle Mile? Brainwash the masses with mediocre food and overcharge for everything to make it seem like it's a privilege to be dining upon such slop.\n\nWell I'm on to you. I've given you plenty of chances, Mile. Your Reuben was the only sandwich that didn't make me want to violently upend tacky cafeteria tables on the way to my car. \n\nWishing you the bland, inoffensive dreams of an automaton,\nErica"

Alas, that was not to be.\n\nAlthough I came inside in the mood for pastrami, watching the staff throw together - and I mean that quite literally, I've never seen anybody, anywhere make a sandwich as quickly or carelessly - I lost my nerve and ordered the meat loaf special, thinking that was probably a better way to go in a place like this.\n\nUnfortunately the meat loaf was dreadful as were the mashed potatoes.  Absolutely devoid of any flavor and covered in a gloppy gravy.  Seriously awful.\n\nI see that one reviewer described it as hospital food.  That's being charitable because some hospitals actually have edible food.  It's more like what I imagine prison food to be like. \n\nIt's also not particularly cheap.

0,"Before I jump into this review, let me just preface it by saying that I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Jersey Mike's and Yogurtland excluded). And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants. \n\nRight off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once. \n\nI ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta. \n\nWhen the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. And if you happen to be looking for dinner at the Biltmore, I would suggest you stop ANYWHERE else."
0,"I know alot of people seem to like this place,but you wont see me going there again.We had some friends in from Boston,and they wanted to eat somewhere that wasnt very fancy,so we picked Cheesecake factory.You should know that our groupd consisted of our 2 friends,my husband,my 4 yr old son and my 2 yr old son,and myslef who was 9 months preggers at the time.\n               When we got there,it was extremely crowded,we gave them our name and they said 10 minutes tops.Well 40 minutes later we were finally seated.The waitress was nice but stuffed us in to a very small booth.She was slow bringing our drinks and our apps,and only refilled our drinks once.\n           All of this could have been forgiven if the food was good.My husband and friend Tim ordered the steak both medium rare,what they got was a piece of meat smaller than the palm of my hand fully cooked.I ordered the Philly Cheese sandwhich,it had no flavor and tasted like it just came out of the microwave.Ive bought better at Wal-Mart.I ordered two kids chicken finger dinners for my boys but they only brought out 1 and when I told the waitress,she insisted that I only said one and that maybe the boys should share because the kitchen was really busy.\n                    I will never go to this restaurant again,bad service,horrible food,and not a good value at all."
0,"The last time will be the last time. \nYesterday at CF, waiter was passable. He did not offer to bring a glass with the beer, and did not do so until asked. \nFood and drinks were good. \nHowever, at end of meal a waitress from another table dropped/spilled a tray of drinks on the left side of my husband who is in a wheelchair with electric wheels. Husband's left side including wheels and batteries were drenched. Waitress did not initially apologize but stated, \""It's just a spill.\"" We asked several times for a wet cloth to wipe off sticky soda from husband, shirt, wheelchair and wheels. We moved to the next table to finish meal and to get out of the large puddle. \nThe manager came over after several minutes and offered to pay for dry cleaning; then the waitress said she was sorry. No comp, no apology until we cleaned up ourselves. \n\nEven worse; two years ago a waiter dropped a tray of drinks on my son at the same place,and another customer who was sitting at a table next to us was also drenched. \nThis was weird deja vu.  \n\nMaybe CF has a policy that waitstaff have to carry as many drinks as possible, and they don't know their limit until they exceed it. Ha. \nOverall, food was good and service was sub par. Attitude was LOUSY! \nThe customer who is paying about $25.00 per person ought to be treated as a guest and with courtesy. \n\nBetter luck when seated at the bar, on past visits. No spillage."
0,"Normally I would never pick to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, ever, but a co-worker picked it for a work function, so off we went. \n\nThere were about 10 of us in our group, and before we ordered we apologized to our waitress for needing separate checks. I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first. \n\nI have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue. \n\nThe other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side. \n\nWell, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless. \n\nAs for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much. I hope for the rest of my life I never step foot in one again. I know I won't be missing much."
0,This location is a hot mess.  I love the Cheese Cake Factory but this locaton is not up to the standards that I accustomed to from this company.  Choose another location The waitress smelled like a pack of cigarettes.  So standing over me taking my order made my stomach turn.  Then my rice was undercooked.  When I told them it was undercooked they wanted to question me and say are you sure.  Im Asian I eat rice almost everyday.  There were Nat's flying around the food.  I won't be back to this location.
0,"$7 per slice for a Cheesecake? Okay that's understandable for being at the most expensive commercial real estate on 24st & Camelback in Phoenix. \n\nWhat is not excusable is the Moroccan Chicken. The only reason I got in my car a blew $30 on a meal on take out, is because of a video showing how delicious it was. What I got from this location was nothing short of horrible. It looked nothing like what I saw in the video, and on top of that the chicken was so dry I had to chase it down with water just to swallow it. It did not matter that they were generous, giving 3 breasts with the meal, because I could not finish even one. Since I hate wasting food I gave it to my 3 cats, but they would not even eat it, and they love chicken!\n\nI would not have even written this review because I hate bashing businesses, but this place refused to answer my email complaint about the bad meal. At least answer and acknowledge you read it. Next time I'll just go down the road to Chili's. At least they try.."
0,"I recently moved to Phoenix from Las Vegas. I live across from Cheesecake Factory on Camelback Rd. I was hungry one night and stopped in for a quick bite on December 4th. I've always enjoyed their pineapple Mojitos  and the menu variety . I sat at a small table in the bar area. It was literally 5 mins before I was even acknowledged (I timed it)! Then menus were haphazardly dropped on the table. I wasn't offered water and warm bread came out 5 mins later. Meanwhile, the servers were congregating, laughing and joking in the back station, which was clearly visible from my table. I finally ordered a chicken Marsala and that took another 20 mins (I also timed that), to which I jokingly replied to my server (a young, bald AfricanAmerican server with large diamond earrings) \""I thought that you forgot about me?\"" His curt reply was \""It's gotta cook!\""....I probably won't go back to Cheesecake Factory based on this last visit, even though it is across from where I live, even if I am craving a pineapple Mojito. I am discovering that there are many other options in close proximity to me.....You NEVER know who your customers are! I've been in the restaurant business for over 30 years in New York, Paris and Las Vegas and have moved to PHX, to live and open a restaurant here....Oh, yeah, and I happen to be one of the Top Chefs in America:-)\n\nHerb"
0,"Tonight my fianc\u00e9 and I took my parents to Cheesecake Factory to catch up over a slice of cheesecake and a cup of coffee (it was 5:30PM) We got our coffees right away, but had to ask for water twice. After about 30 minutes we had asked for our check and a box from our waitress. 20-25 minutes went by and we asked again, she said \""I'll be right back.\"" Another 20 minutes goes by and we tracked down the manager. He apologized and said he would have the check right out to us. At 7:30, an hour and a half AFTER we asked for our check the first time, we had to walk up to the front, wait in line, and ask the manager AGAIN for our check. He apologized and brought it right out. Instead of offering to comp the meal, or ANYTHING, he took the coffee off. Really? Oh thank you for saving me $2.95. I waited an hour and a half to pay you guys. Needless to say, we left a $0 tip. Never going back to this Cheesecake Factory again. Also, we never got our boxes for our leftover cheesecake."
0,This place is not there anymore.
0,My mom drove me all the way over there yesterday and it wasn't there.  We should have checked Yelp first.  I looked on their website and it looks like there aren't any in Arizona anymore. My mom was very disappointed.
0,"Time for another riveting review for all my fellow Arizonians!\n\nLet's start by saying I have had dental issues for many years and in that time have seen MANY dentists!\n\nWhen the time finally came to have some serious dental work done  I chose Artistic Dental as I have seen his work on 2 people and was impressed with their results.\n\nBoth of these people had many teeth extracted and partials and or full plates done.\n\nI do realize it is a lab that makes them not the office\n\nI am very nervous going to dentists simply because I know the pain they are capable of inflicting, \n\nWhen I met Dr Daugherty I found him to be friendly and comforting.  The staff was wonderful and did everything they could to relieve my anxiety!\n\nWe came up with a game plan and part of that was to remove some teeth.\n\nLet's talk prices for a moment.. \n\nKeep in mind the office is in the Biltmore area...need I say more?  \n\nLocation and cost does not guarantee better work.\n\nThey are more expensive than any dentist I have seen but....they say you get what you pay for and my smile is very important to me.\n\nI decided to let him do my top teeth and if the results were positive I would let him do the bottoms.\n\nIt was several weeks before I was to start the work and I had a terrible toothache so I went in and  told Dr Dougherty which tooth was hurting and requested he pull it and that would make one less to be pulled in a few weeks.\n\nWhen he was done I looked in the mirror and was horrified to find he pulled the WRONG tooth!\n\nBecause of this I was embarrassed to smile in fear my big gap would be seen since the tooth was toward the front.\n\nAlthough the Doctor apologized I had lost my faith in him and was now petrified to have the remaining work done...\n\nWhen the time came I put on my \""big girl pants\"" and went back for the other extractions .  I made it clear how nervous I was and Dr Dougherty assured me he would be gentle and I wouldn't feel any real pain......HE WAS WRONG !\n\nSo  what would have happened if he told me the truth?  I now felt lied to ... So let's add things up to this point:\n\nHe pulled the wrong tooth\n\nHe lied to me\n\nHis prices are exsorborant \n\nMoving on... When I paid for the top work I had given them the full amount to cover top and bottom from the estimates they gave me... Although the estimates seemed to keep changing! \n\nThe top teeth, although beautiful simply did not fit right... Even after the alignment ... and the only way to fix it would be to drive the 28 miles each way to his office and leave iit with him and make the same drive back to get them with no guarantees .\n\nI decided to just deal with them and find a new dentist.  \n\nAfter my experience I put the dentist off for over a year and found a wonderful new dentist close to my house\n\nWhen I told this new dentist of my anxiety he was HONEST with me and said there may be some pain for a very short time during injections but they would do their best to distract me.\n\nWhat do ya know... Honesty... And it didn't kill either of us in fact I trusted him completely after that \n\nAt Artistic dental AFTER insurance I would be responsible for appox $1800.00!!!!!!\n\nMy new dentist did the same work for $725.00 after insurance!!  Saving me $1075.00!!!\n\nI called Artisic dental and told them I would like the $800.00 approximate  money they were holding sent back to me so I could get the work done.\n\nI also requested a refund of the \""alignment\"" since it didn't correct the problem. I was told they would speak with Dr and call back\n\nI got a call back and surprise surprise it seems they had a bookkeeping error almost 2 years ago and never billed something therefore they only owe me appox $300.00\n\nEXCUSE ME....WHAT? !\n\nI asked her why they are just finding this error now and why they have had my money for almost 2 years and never bothered to call and ask if I wanted it or if I was ever going to come in again.\n\nI told her that was unacceptable and their error from long ago just won't cut it nor should I be held responsible \n\nI had mentioned to her it would cost me $ 725.00. to have work done and I agreed to accept that and put this experience in the past .. Until.... Yesterday.\n\nI was with my friend who had her work done at Artistic Dental and she also told me of her \"" BILLING ERRORS\"" she had with their office and that is why she has not been back.\n\nIf you are looking to whiten your teeth or do cosmetic work I am sure Artistic will work for you.... But I would think twice about letting them do any serious work. \n\nMy last words of advise are.... Check their billing!!! Make sure they are billing your insurance only once and that you are getting the credits!\n\n\nOn that note I will say...\n\nLive each day as though it were your last and.... ENJOY!"
0,Thank you for all the emails you sent me on my review! I was surprised at how many responses I recieved from people searching for the right dentist..\nI shared my new dentist information and even got some movie tickets from my dentist for the referrals!\nI find it funny how since I wrote this review how many people have reviewed with 5 stars... They must have a lot of friends and family! \nI hope everyone reads my review and picks the right dentist for your needs!\nHappy Holidays
0,"Most definitely the dirtiest Chili's I've ever experienced, inside and outside. The patio had cigarette butts, a dirty ash tray filled with water from the misters, bits of trash strewn about. Inside tables were left dirty, the bathroom was filthy too.\n\nMy food was cold and dried out like it had been made for someone earlier and then left under the warming lights.\n\nBecause I was in polite company and we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't sent it back.\n\nI am quite shocked that I didn't get sick after eating there.\n\nBoth the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit."
0,This place is gross. They did an okay job but the whole place smelled horrible and looked really dirty! \n\nI don't know why the reviews are so high except for these people must have never gone to a clean nail salon!

0,"RUDE AND HASTY. I always base whether or not to get a full set/manicure by the way they care for my feet.  I was greeted and promised \""10 more minutes.\"" I sat and soaked for 15 min before a man who looked like he just built a house (dirty white shirt and dirty nails) start my pedicure.  Long story short, the shape of my nails were crooked,  he forgot to put lotion on my feet and talked sh*t about me in Vietnamese the WHOLE TIME about me being too picky while the entire staff made bets on whether or not if I was going to leave a tip.\nI paid and left the man a tip anyway. \n\nI've never been so appalled,  humiliated and dissatisfied with a service. \nI asked for the manager and there was no manager avail."
0,"This place is horrible.  The sandwhich/paninis can be summarized as follows.  They take some french bread, put maybe a slice of meat or two on it, but no more, and toast it.  They have absolutely no meat on them.  You will leave hungry, along with lunch taking a bite out of your pocket book.  Pricey and bad service.  I have eaten here 3 times, as I used to work in the vicinity, and every time I had absolutely horrible service.  I always have to get up and ask for napkins, refills, silverware, whatever it may be.  Also, there pastry selection is always inconsistent.  I have also had several of their muffins.  They are ok, but not anything special.\n\nI would not recommend this place and certainly will not go back."
0,"OVERPRICED AND OVERRATED!!!!\n\nI cannot believe how much money I spent here for two sandwiches and two sodas.  $25.46\n\nThe mozzerlla panini had tasteless tomatoes, the thinnest slice of procutto that had a large peice of fat in it causing me to nearly gag.  Plesto sauce was okay.\n\nThe roast beef sandwhich was a huge dissappointement.  Two thick slices of overdone beef, two thick slices of cheese and a tasteless tomatoe with the top hard vine connector still attached (who wants to eat that?).  When I say thick, I mean, 1/6 thick but did not cover from side to side of the bread.  \n\nThese sandwhiches were $9.50 each!!!!\n\nWe got one with pasta salad (corkscrew pasta and a dressing, no veggies or color) and a green salad (lettuce and dressing, nothing else).\n\nWe also got two diet cokes.  In a can!!!!  For $2.25 each!!  They did'nt offer a glass, ice and straw which in my oppinion might account for the upcharge, but no, nothing, niet.\n\nThis place might be okay if you are in the area, at the building working or visiting someone, but we drove from Ahwatukee.  So not worth it.  Do not drive to this place.  Do not go out of your way for this place."
0,"So let me preface this one star with the fact that we never did eat here. The reason is because despite the fact that the website says they close at 9:30 on Saturday, they actually were closed by 8:00 when we went there....TWICE! Note to Au Petit Four, this is 2011 and either update your website or inform people if you close early because it is slow. We drove from Southern Scottsdale to Arcadia and it was a waste of time. Also, waste of groupon money!"
0,"Review 2/5/12\nWe were searching for a place to end the night with dessert.  We found Au Petit Four on Yelp and their were .4 miles from where we were.  COOL!  And we had their desserts before at the Esplanda location, so we know the the stuff is good.  Parking was almost impossible.  It is hard to find a space but we have a promise of good desserts so we grab the kids and walked.  \n\nThey have only been in the new location for 6 weeks.  It was pretty nice.  So we all walked to the dessert case.  Everything looked good.  We settled on:\n\n1 Coffee, 3 Bottled waters, 1 Lemonade, 1 mango cake, 2 creme brulees, 1 white chocolate cake, and 1 large chocolate chip cookie.  There wasn't a pricing for any of the things we ordered, so when he came to tell us our bill was $48.50.  We were shocked.  WHAT?  No detailed bill?  The kids were tired and we just wanted to leave.  \n\n10 items for $48.50 = Average $4.85 per item since we don't know the prices (non alcohol drinks and dessert)!  REALLY?????  I feel a little ripped off."

Thank you and have a nice week end.\""\n\nPart of their review on 3/9/12 states: \""Also,  if 50 dollars is to expensive for you after having 2 sodas especially the delicious lemonades who are from france so they are more expensive then a can of coke, 2 meals and 2 desserts then mcdonalds is better for you..price wise of course.\"" \n\nAfter review their review, I was shock to see how they think about their customers.  How 2 faced can you get.  Nice in the private message and then blast a customer on a public review.  If I would have had 2 drinks, 2 meals, and 2 desserts for $50, that is a great deal.  We had 5 non-alcoholic drinks, 4 desserts, and a cookie for $48.50.  You know, we should have taken the kids to McDonalds for dessert.  \n\nTo read the rest of Frenchie B.'s review:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/au-petit-four-scottsdale#hrid:b6f4KzsK5ApkWZxLumt-SA"
0,"After reading Judy F. 's update, I will no longer go to this establishment.  I was a BIG supporter of this cafe when it was at the Esplanade, however reading Judy B. or Frenchie B's comments, private and a review, I will never send anyone there.  And I've sent many, saying the desserts are wonderful.  The desserts may be wonderful, however, that type of attitude is not needed from those who are related to the owners or who are the owners.   Very disappointing.  Desserts are worth more than Mc D's yes however the attitude is not worth my time, therefore, I will have my caramel sundae for a $1or support another local cafe.   All yelpers try to help locals, however, this cafe doesn't seem to care and approach the reviews very defensively."

0,"worst brunch I ever had!\n\nI was hoping for a nice Sunday brunch but was very disappointed. The waitress told us that it is a fourty minutes wait for any order. She suggested pastry even though the cafe was less than one third full (12 people including us).  So we selected two crossants, a quiche and two cups of coffee. Pastries arrived quickly but no coffee.  Crossants were cold and soft, not as good as crossan from Paradise cafe but twice the price. \n\nHalfway done my croissant I realized I had no napkin. Asked her about coffee she said that it is brewing and need to wait four more minutes.  My husband noticed that the lady behind me complained coffee was too cold and it was then microwaved. He was puzzled as the waitress told us they serve freshly brewed coffee.\n\n I finished my croossant and had some quiches. finally our coffee came. They were luke warm too, not as hot as from McDonalds. At this point, twenty minutes later after we sat down,  the waitress  told us if we order now she will be able to serve quickly. We were not happy.  We asked her if there was anything we could have done differently to have a proper meal and she said no. \n\nThe worse thing is it destroyed our whole day being treated this way. \n\nWill not go there ever again!"
0,"These people are horrible and rude. The macaroon and tiramisu that I got from them were so stale, they smelled like the fridge they were kept in.

0,"Last week I went on yelp to find a good alterations place to fix two pairs of pants and a shirt of mine. Creations & Alterations had some good reviews and it was down the street from my apartment. I dropped off my clothes thinking it wouldn't take more than 2-3 days. I dropped it off on a Tuesday and they told me it'd be ready the NEXT week Thursday!! At the time I didn't care and just wanted it done. I came in the next week Friday morning before I drove out to California, intending to wear my newly fixed jeans, and they said it wasn't ready. They hadn't even started on it. They asked if I could spare an hour for them to fix it, which just added insult to injury being informed that they sat on my clothes for a week and a half when everything could have been taken care of in an hour. I asked for my clothes back and will NEVER come back again. 0 stars."
0,"Pros: Easy to find, reasonable prices, close to my home, always has available parking\n\nCons: I used to come here because it was the closest to my home. I just had to stop. They messed up my clothes 30% of the time, but I still kept coming. However, they absolutely destroyed a pair of pants I brought in one time. When I tried to bring it to their attention, they argued that it was the way I washed the pants. I had not even worn the pants or washed them."

0,"In all seriousness, I have heard good things about this place from several people, I kind of walked in and was trying to think what the hell was the theme here, seriously if PETA ever went in here they would close this place down, with stuffed animals on the walls they would have a field day. I would say from start to finish I was thoroughly not impressed. I will honestly say that I will probably never go back to this location. It wasn't even that the food was just blah, but the fact that the staff seemed to ignore me, maybe I was under dressed for this establishment. I guess my money truly is no good here, because I honestly did not feel the staff gave two fucks about me the whole time I was there. Garbage. I grabbed a card on the way out from I believe was the hostess. Torri McFarland...you and your staff from the top down got work to do this place sucks!!!"
0,"Bad food and terrible service.  Went here during restaurant week with a large group of friends and everyone was disappointed.

0,"I'm a little disappointed, it seems like I've eaten here before and it wasn't so bad.   The caesar salad dressing tasted mostly of mayo.  They cooked my medium steak pretty well, but turned out they had switched my friend's steak and mine and his was supposed to be medium rare.  I feel a steak restaurant should know how to cook a steak.  The mashed potatoes were lumpy.  They tasted ok, and did not feel pasty but could've used some kind of flavor.  The green beans were actually pretty good.  The salmon was cooked well but the citrus based sauce was a bit too sweet.  The sauce that came on the steaks was better, but didn't have much flavor.  The steaks themselves could've used a bit of salt and pepper.\n\nThe creme brulee was pretty tasty as always but I wasn't a fan of the flourless espresso chocolate cake.  \n\nAll in all, I don't think the experience and food is as put together as their competitors.  The waitress also seemed a bit joyless which didn't help the experience.  With so many better options, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  Maybe for lunch?"

My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \""corporate recipe\"", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \""signature\"" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. We might as well set $500 on fire."
0,"This restaurant is for the rich kids that had never eaten any other fine food in the world other than steaks : ) Pricy steak (cow that is not even organically raised). Salmon that is farm raise(Atlantic). The steak that is almost tasteless. Veggies that are plain but buttery. The server was kind of racist (only asked what my white friend wants to drink, didn't ask me, and then brings me water). The only good thing about this place is the interior itself. The dinner alone was 83 dollars(split amount 3 people). If you have friends that want to get you there please steer them away because both of your stomach and wallet will leave unsatisfied."
0,"I have gone to Capital Grille over the years in other locations and have always had a nice experience but the Biltmore location gets a \""D\"" in my book!!!!\nThe bar area and bartender were friendly and attentive :) so that part was great! The dining experience was TERRIBLE!!!!  The waiter was not only very rude, he constantly forgot simple things and was totally unattentive... so after 5 things and 2 hrs into dinner we requested the manager who was just the same and sarcastic on top of everything else! For a $300.00 meal that was average at best. Thank goodness the company I was with was wonderful!!!! Too many other choices to be treated the way we were :( I was so disappointed that I wrote corporate headquarters! To be continued when I hear back from them!!!!"
0,"This place has slipped significantly in the past 6 months.  No meat in the rolled tacos, smaller and smaller burritos, same or higher prices.  I would like to direct anyone close by to Armando's on 48th St and Thomas.  Cheaper, better tasting and larger portions.  This Filiberto's has become run-of-the-mill and cheap.  Other good reasons to stay away:  adjacent to a bus stop and a telemarketing joint.  Enough said."
0,"I love pita, hummus, Mediterranean food and was anxious to try this place. What a huge disappointment. Dressing was over spiced, just burned. Pita was bland. \n\nGlad to see stable something in Town & Country."
0,"The food was pretty decent, but the waitresses were inattentive. No ambiance. Good green tea. They tried to commit our order to memory, which was a colossal failure. Both orders were slightly wrong."
0,"I'd give this place 0 stars if possible. Went there for pickup and the waitress was EXTREMELY rude!! Acted like I was wasting her time, didn't say hello or goodbye, just kind of left us standing there awkwardly after she handed us the reciept. The food was very overpriced for what you get (got the felafel dinner) and the felafel was very dry. Don't go here!"
0,Worst service I've ever experienced. Called my order in 20min ahead and had to wait another 30min after I got there till my fries and pita were ready and there was no one else in the restaurant not a single person. It happened once and I thought it was a fluke but this is now the second time. Staff is incompetent and rude. The cooks just seemed to be hanging out and flirting with the server. I ordered pesto fries and they were out of pesto which they should have told me when I placed my order by phone instead of making me drive there to find out. Terrible I will never go there again which is sad because they're pesto fries are great but their service is so terrible I can't imagine going back and dealing with them. Service is everything and cypress grill is a prime example of losing business over service alone. I'm telling everyone I know and they have already stopped going because they are experiencing the same lack of professionalism and service.
0,"They need to change the oil, fries both regular and greek came out brown and well done. Everything was bland. Greek salad tasted like nothing.  Calamari fried in old oil as well. Gyro sandwich was bland too. Beer selection limited. I'm not sure how this place is still running? Service was outstanding but we will never go back."
0,Mediocre food. The staff also has no idea what the hours are. Yelp and their website says they are open until 10pm but I was just turned away at 8:45 because they just closed. Avoid.
0,"Tried to go, they were closed an hour early with employees outside drinking. Not impressed."
0,"Stayed at the Biltmore and went here because of an American Express dining certificate.  The experience: a dirty soup spoon, sending back the soup, taking a bite of scallop that made me sick, and terminating the dining experience as a result ... If I could give \""negative stars,\"" I would.  This is a nasty, as in dirty-ass nasty, restaurant pretending to be fine dining."
0,"This comment is directed to the gentleman that works in your Phoenix Colonnade location in the Furniture section. (The really short 80's looking guy)..\n\nWhy in the world would be so condescending to customers and butt in on their conversation? Why did you feel the need to critisize their description of a chair they were looking at?\n\nBecause of your rude and flippant behavior, and obvious lack of customer service skills you lost an extremely large sale and any future business my wife and I would ever give you. That unfortunately includes the clothing side. we refuse to give business to people that treat customers so disrespectfully !"
0,"I used to be a huge fan of this place until last night. I went in to find a nice dress to wear. After wandering the store looking for the plus size section (I proudly wear a size 18) and not finding anything, I asked the clerk where it was. Apparently they no longer carry anything over a size 16.\nTalk about being disappointed. I was so upset I almost cried. \nShame on you...... You should also put a sign up now so that girls like me don't waste our time wondering through your store anymore..."
0,"Smaller sizes...not much for the plus or large crowd.  Also, the staff is almost incredulously rude everytime I'm in here!  I know people love it here, but it's like a very expensive Goodwill.  The clothes and accessories are way overpriced for what you're getting!  Save yourself some money and go down to the Goodwill at 16th St and Indian School.\n\nAlso, if you have clothes to sell, don't get your hopes up.  Gawd knows I've tried to figure out what they are looking for...when they did take a couple of my smaller size 12 sundresses to consign, they ended up giving them away to a thrift store for dogs (I shit you not) and didn't even bother to call me.  I guess that's not their policy...if you consign here and they don't sell your stuff in whatever time frame they think they should, don't expect to ever get it back."
0,"It's one of that consignment stores that refuses clothes one originally bought from them because the labels aren't designer enough. \n\nI would never shop here again, since if I pay $40 for a skirt, wear it twice, and decide it doesn't work for me, they'll snootily refuse it as inferior to what they stock, obviously, in tones of \""how dare I sully their store with this trash?\"" They even accused me of lying about ever having an account with them, when I'd said I wasn't sure and it was from years ago. \n\nIn fairness, I would swear the place has changed management or employees. It used to be possible to buy high-end office clothes here and the staff were nice. Now it's a trophy-wife clothes, staffed by the rudest, snootiest women I've ever encountered in a clothing store. I should probably be grateful I now don't have store credit I'd have to use there."
0,New location needs better ventilation. Awkward layout reeks of musty clothes.  Odor persists into breezeway. \n\nOrganization not clear. I sincerely hope this is a temporary location.
0,"Not good. And it's not been for a couple of years. There are advantages: good location, rarely busy, good for larger groups. But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.  When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard, the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it.  Only 2 beers on tap. Garbage."
0,"Absolutely terrible, and dangerous!!  Manicurist cut my cuticle and then cut Herself somehow. Didn't see a thing wrong with it. No apology. She didn't put on a glove!! She simply said \""it happens\"". Unbelievable! I do not want a bloodborne disease from a salon and if you don't either stay far far away from this place. She was so casual about it!! Also, I left with polish all over my skin and a French manicure that would have been dine better at a $10 Korean nail salon."
0,"I went to this salon for a 50 minute full custom facial. What I got was 25 minutes of steam in my face in a loud salon. My appointment was at 1:00 and, at 1:05 I met Dunia, who would be doing my facial. What happened in the next 25 minutes was this: a quick cleansing of my face, some gritty stuff applied and steam in my face for about 15 minutes, a bright light in my face without my eyes covered and a rough rinse off of my face, some really strong (she said it was antiseptic to \""kill bacteria\"") stuff applied to my face, followed by sunscreen ... that was it. Oh - and all of this WITH THE DOOR OPEN ... and let me just say it was not quiet in this place (aka: NOT relaxing). I walked out of the salon at 1:30 wishing I hadn't wasted my time and money for something I could have done myself at home."
0,"I bought a travel zoo voucher for my daughter, me, and mother-in-law to get a mani/pedi. I even took my daughter out of school early for our special day, since they don't have later times for nail services. That morning, they called to tell me that they couldn't take all of us, and we would have to re-schedule. This was not an option for me, so it ended up just being my daughter and mom-in-law getting service. \n\nThought I would give them another chance. Next time, the appt was for me, my daughter, and my own mom. I took my daughter out of school early again. This time, when we arrived, they said that there was an error in scheduling and we would need to re-schedule. Really? Again, this was not an option for me. So my mom and daughter just got pedicures (even though we had paid for a manicure too). No attempt to offer a discount or anything.\n\nTheir front desk staff is less than incompetent. Make sure you have a plan B, before you go. WIll never go back."
0,Business CLOSED... no call cancelling appointment.  Very poor form - purchased a three pack of facial/pedi's and doubt I will see any refund :(
0,"This business closed in early November with no notice.  Voicemail said that clients that had purchased packages would be contacted for refunds by the end of November, but I haven't been contacted about my unfulfilled pedicure package.\n\nHowever, I have located the owner of Salon 3121, Michelle Davis and she is now doing business at:\n\nNails by Michelle D\n3240 East Camelback Road Studio #4\nPhoenix, Arizona 85018\n\nIf you are awaiting a refund from Salon 3121, you can try contacting Michelle and see if she'll make good on your prior purchase.  Not sure if she's selling any new packages, but I'd be careful about advanced purchases.  Good luck."
0,"Trendy spot?  Maybe, if it was 1982.  This place is in need of a serious update, but it looks like most of the customers need one too.  How does it survive in this competitive town?  \n\nI expect it to be shut down when I come back to town.  Good spot for something new."
0,"Zen 32 is terrible. In every aspect. The sushi is fishy, it's too crowded, and the servers are rude/clueless/slow. \n\n'nuff said."
0,"Zen 32 was my sushi standout in Phoenix, AZ until today. \n\nAfter moving to NYC, I went back home and visited my old hang outs. Some things have changed. \n\nThough Kona Grill at the Fashion Square in Scottsdale was always my fav, I considered Zen 32 to be the best sushi place in Phoenix -- great dim ambiance, a big outdoor patio with misters for Happy hour, and cute canoes on the ceilings. \n\nHowever, today there were not one, but two flies in my Saki-Rita drink. The waitress apologized, but left the charge on the bill, plus the charge for the replacement drink. After much aggravation, the manager removed the charge. \n\nThe floating flies were not the worst part. I was left wondering what eles is floating around the kitchen. There was also a 1/2 inch piece of who knows what in my spicy tuna roll -- maybe it was a scale? A piece of plastic? Hard to tell. \n\nConclusion, go to Zen 32 for the ambiance. Not the food or drinks. Perhaps bring friends you dislike and watch them eat?"
0,"UGH. I ate here for my last night after spending my whole summer in Phoenix/Scottsdale and it was perhaps the worst decision (and my least favorite place I ate at over the entire summer)! I was thoroughly bummed with my dining experience after hearing constantly how Zen 32 was supposedly \""the hip\"" place. I was completely unimpressed with the hostesses and the service (which was slow, rude, and totally unhelpful), the food was disappointing (not fresh, not tasty, not innovative), and the ambiance was definitely not what it was built up to be. We ordered a variety of entrees and sushi rolls, both of which were completely inauthentic Japanese and nothing special in terms of preparation or ingredients. I would have rather eaten at PF Changs or Roys, where I would be spared the pretentiousness. Also, the place is crowded. Not in a good, social lounge scene way. In a nasty, don't have enough room to eat/breathe way. For some reason word of mouth has gotten out that Zen 32 is THE sushi place, but spare yourself the tasteless reality. Seriously, it's not that chic. Unless you're really dying for sushi at midnight, you're better off next door at Delux."
0,"Went to Zen for lunch today with a friend....waited at the hostess station for a server to seat us....no one came....finally the chef said we could sit anywhere...we sat down...waited ten minutes for a server to come to our table to just even bring us water and menus...never happened...we got up and left without ever seeing anyone. They only had about 10 customers on the patio and NO ONE inside but us....this was sad....we saw servers walking in and out and a few even made eye contact with us, but none approached us. Very sad....plus the place smelled like bad fish....this place has gone way down hill...sad! Worse service ever!!!!!"
0,"Ok, I am not one that knows her sushi well, but when I order a roll that said that is comes with crab, cream cheese, cucumber, and avocado, why am I getting a roll with just whitefish?\n\nI have been here twice and each time I have had the worst service!  This time around was the most interesting.  Twice, bussers came to our table and just tried to take our chairs.  Did they ask? NO.  Did they notice that my friend's purse was on one of them?  NO.  Did they ever come back when we said that we actually needed one more chair? NO.  \n\nAlso, when it was time to pay the bill...all of us (6 people total) decided to make the server's job easier by writing on the back of the check on how much each of us was going to pay.  My one friend wrote $40 and I wrote $15 (I didn't eat much and I didn't get anything to drink)  This was with tip included.  Server comes back and charges my friend $15 and me $21.98.  (HUH!)  Then she told us that she couldn't add the tip with it.  Couldn't she have told us that first?  Especially when a sharp person could see that we were giving her way more than what the bill stated.\n\nThe food both times I was there was bleh.  Even the temperature of the food wasn't right.  I kept on thinking to myself this is how one gets food poisoned.  (I did not)  They turned off the heaters outside when there were still a bunch of people enjoying happy hour.  (It wasn't very warm out there!)  \n\nNext time...we are going to meet somewhere in Tempe for sushi happy hour."
0,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I'm Chinese and I know my rice.\n\nSo after a meeting next door @ Hava Jave (review for that place to follow) a friend and I wandered over to Zen32 for a 10pm snack.\n\nBoy was that a mistake.  I normally eat up at Celsius in Desert Ridge so I thought I'd get the same food down here to compare.  \n\nA couple of the rolls we ordered:\n\nViva Vegas Roll\nCaterpillar Roll\n\nThe service was just fine but honestly, even if I had Angelina Jolie serving the food naked, the food would still be crap and the rating would still be an UNO star.\n\nThe rice seemed like it was day-old rice.  It was clumpy and honestly, I don't know how a sushi chef  takes CLUMPY rice and puts it into a roll...  so anyway, due to the clumpiness of the rice, the Vegas roll was loosly rolled so it fell apart when I tried to pick it up.\n\nThe Caterpillar roll tasted super bland which is VERY hard to do because it includes so many different ingredients like eel, faux crab, avocado, cucumber, and eel sauce.  Not only did it taste bland, it was also poorly rolled.  \n\nAgain, the service was nice but you might want to bring your own sushi if you're going to eat here..."
0,"I should have went to the Safeway next door for sushi.\n\nThis was the first time I went to sushi joint, looked at the menu and decided that the best sounding thing was the steak. I opted for the grilled salmon and wasabi mash. While I am a huge sushi fan, the price of the rolls were a wee bit more expensive than some GOOD sushi places I went to. My friend opted for a bento box that had a crab nigiri (which was simply a half a stick of imitation Krab on top of rice). So sad. \n\nMy plate arrived and looked like a garden threw up on my plate. The steamed veggies were scattered around my plate like the salad shooter malfunctioned. The grilled salmon was just okay, served on top of wasabi mash that was also just okay. \n\nThe server was also very clueless. She brought over a bowl of miso soup and sat the soup between my friend and I. I wasn't sure who it belonged to so I asked for straws so we could share. =) She didn't think it was too funny. She said she wasn't sure whose meal it came with so she just left in the middle so we can figure it out. (THANKS!)\n\nBy the way, the waitresses were wearing traditional Chinese dresses. Shouldn't they be in a kimono or something? Who is the smart white guy that owns this place?!\n\nI walked away from Zen 32 and I won't be back."
0,"I would never return to this place. Food is mediocre at best. The interior is sooo small.  The patio is about your only option.\n\nPlease go else where for your sushi and Japanese needs.  The cloth napkins alone is a total turnoff.  It leaves lint all over your pants! So cheap!!!\n\nIf you want to get a cheap eat, by all means, go there, but don't expect a top notch experience being that it's near the Biltmore."
0,"I don't think there's much to Zen 32 besides looking trendy.\n\nSomething seemed strange about the place when I walked in, and after reading other reviews it's been pointed out--the waitresses are wearing Chinese attire with Mandarin collars. I won't hold the lack of authenticity against them. Also, the music is soft and the seating kind of cramped, making for an awkward dining experience.\n\nI'll get the good thing out of the way--the reverse happy hour. The hot ginger sake was overpowering, but for $1 there's no way I can complain. Also, they had a few basic rolls for $3, and that's not too bad. \n\nEverything else sucks! The specialty rolls are all stuffed with krab, so what hope do you have of ever getting quality sushi? My tootsie roll was garbage, I couldn't taste anything beside the krab inside. The caterpillar roll looked nice, but I could only taste krab and eel sauce. Even the rainbow roll looked promising, and THAT was drenched in sriracha. \n\nI also had some of this teriyaki chicken entree, and it was rough and a bit dry. The edamame had way too much salt, and I began noticing a pattern to this place. Take crap and season it as much as you can.\n\nI'd like to give this place a second chance for a cheap date or something, but I'm still a little angry at this place (and their sketchy waitress!), for being the first to make me tired of sushi. A friend bought me this meal and I still regret it. It's that bad."

0,"Blah, worst coffee ever. Had this place 2 weeks ago and I will never come back. Their drip coffee tasted watered down, overpriced and it was by far the shittiest coffee I have ever had. I would much rather get my coffee from AM/PM then ever walk into this place again. Horrible."
0,"Yep Yelpers - I'm not ever going back here again. \n\nI asked the girl at the counter if they had Iced Toddy. Nope...no big deal. I asked instead for iced coffee with two shots of espresso in it.

I came home and made everyone in the house try the most bitter coffee concoction I've ever come across.) Okay so then she sent me over to the bar to the hot coffee. Melted my ice and my plastic cup. Not exactly what I meant when I asked if they had iced coffee... \n\nHow much did this crud cost me?? A whooping $2.75. Oh, but wait! It's actually $3.00, an extra 25 cents for running it on my card, which she tells me AS SHE SWIPES MY CARD. I had cash on me. And I really would have preferred to be offered a choice to use it ahead of time. \n\nAlso, their seating consists mostly of a long bar against the wall opposite of the coffee counter. You wouldn't be able to camp out here with a laptop, homework, or even a book. There just isn't any room. There's a few tables, but if a group walked in you'd have a major guilt trip. \n\nAll in all, you'd go to Hava Java for a run and go coffee.

I liked that, so I tried it.\n\nInside & out, the place looks very old.  I would guess 1940s.  It's medium in size, & there were about 25 trays of food out.  There were only about 5 other customers in the place on a weekday at 12:30, which was my first warning sign.  The second was the egg flower soup.  It was gooey & blah (1940's style, I wondered?).\n\nThe food table was against the wall, so you have to reach far for the items that are in the back.  The ranch dressing was runny, & the macaroni salad blah.  The unfriendly Chinese lady brought me some \""hot tea\"", which was lukewarm.  Back at the food table, the rest of the food was greasy, not very warm, or both.

0,Read a review from the newspaper so I tried it. Not impressed. The atmosphere is about as dismal as the food. They need to make it a place people want to come in and eat instead of get out of there as soon as possible. Gross!
0,"This restaurant is one of the filthiest I've ever visited in the entire world (and I travel frequently to third-world countries on business). During my lunchtime visit the dining room tables were strewn with uncollected plates and uneaten food, the steam table buffet had food scraps hanging all over it, and the carpeting was full of stains from ground-in food particles. If that wasn't bad enough the buffet food was terrible, too.  It all appeared to come from frozen, restaurant supply entrees--very oily stuff with poor smell, taste and appearance.  During the 30 minutes I was there, someone at another table complained about an unidentified object in her noodles, while another customer complained that the buffet was essentially empty.  This place isn't even worth the 5.99 +tax for lunch, even if it does include beverage.  YUCKERS to the core!"
0,I'd hate to waste a star on this place!\n\nI lived right outside of The French Quarter in New Orleans for 8 months. I remember the best of Cajun food and this place was far from what I remember. I'm not big on seafood but everyone at our table ordered a seafood dish and all were not happy with their entree.\n\nWhat did I order? I ordered a simple Chicken Po'boy sandwich. How can a Cajun restaurant get this wrong? This place did. The chicken was placed on bread that was hard. I expected the chicken to be smothered in BBQ sauce. Wrong! The sauce was on the side. The lettuce on the side of dish that was to be used in the sandwich was a bit on the brown side. The fries were cold. Yuck!\n\nWaitress was great. She was the best part of this dining experience. Never again.
0,"If you've ever been to New Orleans and have therefore been spoiled by actual cajun food, this place is a guaranteed disappointment. My $12 shrimp po'boy had maybe 10 shrimp on it, something that is supposed to be a staple of cajun cuisine. The couple of small pickles, half of a tomato slice and soggy lettuce given as dressings for the sandwich were an embarrassment. I'm not sure what flavor the chips were, because there was no flavor. I think I could have had better at Long John Silver's, and I hate Long John Silver's."
0,"nothing to rave about this place.\nservice was poor and the food was bad.\nI know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure."
0,Rude customer service on the phone-like you are doing me a favor even answering my questions regarding bringing my vacuum in for repair=I am going somewhere else.
0,"I went in to have cateract eye surgery in both of my eyes which began in Nov. 2012.  The two surgeries were done 2 weeks apart.  I was sold for an additional $7000.- above Medicare and Blue Cross charges to have  lens implants that would not require me to wear glasses after the surgeries.  One of the lens's that was implanted in my eye was not centered and 3 weeks later, it had to be removed and replaced with a different lens.  Both eyes had laser surgeries.  My left eye also had retina work after the initial implant (supposedly my retina was torn in 3 places.  Also in my left eye, I had to have cornea surgery on my eyelids.  Finally after 7 months of office visits and surgeries, I decided to get a second opinion from an outside opthamoligist.  He explained to me that the LensX ($7000.-) should NOT have been used for me due to my stigmatisms.  I asked why Dr Perkins recommended it to me, and was told that it was all about additional money.  To date, my vision has become alot worse prior to going in to Barnet Dulaney Perkins.   NOW, I have eye glasses for both reading and distance.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY- THEY ARE A TOTAL BUNCH OF CROOKS AND NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL."
0,"Don't go here!  I tried to get some necessary surgery done but to no avail after having the staff \""forget\"" to schedule a physical and do the necessary insurance paperwork, and having them overcharge $1000 because they could not add. \nTo start they insisted I had to have another expensive eye exam even though the optometrist who referred me did the exact same exam two weeks before.  Cost $305!!!    I called many times only to be left on hold sometimes for 30 plus minutes.  My husband is disabled and I had to schedule care for both of us after the surgery and during the appointments prior to the surgery.  I waited months and MONTHS to be scheduled in and then had the staff tell me a few days before the surgery as they \""forgot\"" to do the insurance paperwork and they could not do the surgery unless I paid for the whole thing up front.  Much to my chagrin I re-scheduled some weeks later but two days before they called again as they \""forgot' to have me get a physical.  I couldn't get care for my husband on that short of notice. \nI got the bill yesterday.  They charged me almost $700 just for a 20 minute consult and an un-necessary eye exam. They also charged $90 for two digital photos of my face which took 60 seconds by an assistant. I have to start over as I neither trust the Doctor or the staff.  You decide if it is worth it for a careless service.   I've never had a good visit!!!!"
0,"After having the President Mark Rosenberg call and apologize to me for a whole series of mishaps wholly Baret Dulaney's fault, nothing he promised came true: He said they'd fast lane me through the process;  it took months and months.   He said they'd make sure no more charges were involved: I got the bills and my insurance was re-charged for extra visits and some of the same exams.  He said they'd make sure I was satisfied; the surgeon called and cancelled for the forth time.  Four different excuses for the cancellations over a period of nine months because they couldn't get their act together. Now I wonder if you want a company that has employees who forget to schedule physicals, forget to do the insurance paperwork and a surgeon (Dr. Berdos) who cancels the appointments after you have waited months and months to get on his schedule?  Does this seem right or fair to you?"
0,"What a waster of time and money!  My regular ophthalmologist recommended I see the same doctor who performed my previous cataract surgery (which was here) for a followup procedure.  Step 1:  Repeat the same exam I had just received from my ophthalmologist at a cost of about $200.  Step 2: Go in for an evaluation with the Surgeon ... wait in 3 different waiting rooms for over 2 hours, then leave, since I myself had appointments. Leave having accomplished nothing as I never saw the doctor!  At no point did they indicate to me it would be over an hour delay and offer to reschedule or give me any indication of actually how long the wait would be. Feels more like a surgery factory than health CARE.  I have no intention of coming back to this facility."
0,"Just had the worst customer service from the management at the  Chilis on Camelback and 20th st. As a long time former employee of the company, I'm even more appalled! Sad day :("
0,"Most definitely the dirtiest Chili's I've ever experienced, inside and outside. The patio had cigarette butts, a dirty ash tray filled with water from the misters, bits of trash strewn about. Inside tables were left dirty, the bathroom was filthy too. \n\nMy food was cold and dried out like it had been made for someone earlier and then left under the warming lights.\n\nBecause I was in polite company and we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't sent it back.\n\nI am quite shocked that I didn't get sick after eating there. \n\nBoth the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit."

0,"I feel horrble to have to say this to my fellow yelpers, but working with Checker Pool and Pump Supply was a horrible experience.  The whole thing.  From the intial phone call I made to the office to the final installation of the new motor.  Just awful.\n\nFirst the phone call to the office was less than desired. The fellow who answered the phone wasn't terribly helpful and told me that he couldn't schedule anything, but he would send my call to one of his \""technicians.\""  Okay.\n\nA couple hours later a technician called. He was abrubt and abrassive in his tone, asking me to describe what was wrong and then interrupting me when he figured out that he knew better than I did what the description was.\n\nHe came and diagnosed the problem while I was at my office in Chandler. He very tersely told me, \""either I come in an hour or on Monday.\""  I had just come back home to 114 degree weather, so I thought it better he come quickly than wait 5 days.  So he came.\n\nThen he called from the car and told me he had taken my motor as it needed to be repaired. I wasn't given a choice.  He just took it.  So now I can't have someone else come out and give me another price quote.  Of course, this fellow still hadn't told me what was wrong or what the price would be - he just took my motor and called me from the car.\n\nWhen he returned on Tuesday (not on Monday as he promised because he said I didn't answer the phone soon enough for him and he couldn't leave the motor without any money from me) he installed a new motor without telling me. He told me on the phone that if he couldn't repair the motor someone would call and quote me the price for a new motor.  I guess not, and what choice did I had - he still had my old motor.  So we were forced to accept the new motor since it was already installed without a price or a pre-installation discussion.\n\nHe then told us that a pipe was cracked and that the suction for the pool pump was compromised, but he didn't fix it.  Why not offer to fix it?  And after he left, he left our pump clock on for just 2 hours.  Really?  In the summer?  And he didn't tell us the fill valve was also broken.  A cheap 20.00 part that I am sure he had on the truck would have fixed that.\n\nThe new motor was 289.00 which I am told is very fair, but then they charged 16.50 for shop labor (for what) and nearly 100.00 for the miscellaneous parts needed to install the motor, and 95.00 for his labor.  The price should have been about 385.00 in my opinion.  If he had repaired the plumbing and the fill valve so we didn't have to have someone else come by, I might have thought 580 was fair?  But now we have to have more work done on the pool by another company.\n\nThis particular technician was so horrible I am afraid to call this company ever again. He was rude to me and to my husband and"
0,"There was a time, when service at this company was excellent. I have used this company for over 10 years. I went down a couple week ago because my pool sweep wasn't working. The person at the counter, was pathetic when it came to providing service. My wife went back to pick the pool sweep, the guy that waited on her was eating his lunch at the front counter. She said she would never go back there again, because the service was so poor. My pool sweep was under warranty they told me, there was nothing wrong with the sweep, it just need to be cleaned. They charged me 20.00 to clean it. When I put it in the pool it still had the same problem. I took it to Leslie Pool Supply they took it a part while I was there replaced a couple parts put it back together and didn't charge me, because it was still under warranty.  It works now. I have spent my last dollar with Checker.. guess who my new pool company is!"
0,"Can I give these company a worse score?  Less than 2 years later, the pump I purchased is broken. My regular pool guy (who was out of town in August of 2011 when I wrote the 1st review) took the pump apart and found out that it was never grounded.  Buyer BEWARE!! I am not the only person this happened to. No apologies. No warranty. Nothing."
0,"About a month ago I had Checker replace the sand in my sand filter.  Immediately when he turned on the pump there were bubbles coming out of the return.  I said \""why are there bubbles coming out of the return.  I've never had bubbles coming out of the return?\""  Mike just basically blew me off.   Bled it to get the air out and still have bubbles.  Had their tech guy out and he was just plain rude.  I told him to humor me and check the O ring on the filter lid because I never had bubbles coming of the return and the only thing that has changed is they changed the sand.  The guy didn't want to do it and didn't do it and preceded to tell me how he gets paid.  Bottom line, he just wouldn't get paid enough to check the O ring and heaven forbid he had to replace it.  I've never dealt with a company that won't do something you have asked."
0,"There are a few guys that work here. One guy, who seems to be in charge, is just a total prick. One time I was in there, he got into a yelling match with a female customer - apparently what he remembered was different than what she had recalled of their phone conversation earlier that day. Ultimately, he looked her in the eye, put his hand up, waved goodbye like a two year old, and told her to leave the store. Today I was in there and he saw a couple coming in, he said \""F&$@ no, I'm taking my break.\"" The guy that helped me today questioned everything I was saying. \""Well, did you measure it? I mean, take a ruler to it and measure it?\"" Yes, I told you it was a 9\"" cover I needed. He reassured me that I was wrong, and actually had me questioning myself. Imagine that - 2 Master's degrees, and I can't use a tape measure properly. The younger guy that works there is a really, really nice. So if you go in and have to wait in line to talk to him when the others are eating or talking shit about customers, it'd be worth the wait. He's knowledgeable and polite. While the other guys seem to know what they're talking about, they certainly have a lot to learn from their junior counterpart. I live about 2 blocks away from this place, but will make the trip to Leslie (and likely spend more money) just so I don't have to deal with these guys again. No point in giving my money to people who definitely don't appreciate it."

0,"This review is not about my stay at the Biltmore but about not staying here. I purchased a gift certificate at a baseball related charity function in Oct. When I went to redeem my gift certificate (which I wanted use during the baseball Spring training months) I was told the dates I had chosen were unavailable. OK, I understand as on my certificate it did say subject to availability, so I choose a couple of other dates. After a couple of phone calls I was finally told that all Spring training dates were blackout. My problem with all of this is that it took many phone messages and emails to finally have someone tell me this. The Director of Sales and Marketing contact person who was on my gift certificate NEVER returned an email or phone call and when asked if there were any other options none were offered. I would also like to add that I have a 2 night stay certificate and was looking to stay 2 additional nights at full price. Bottom line really bad bad customer service."

0,"First let me say i love Embassy Suites and hilton Hotels but my gripe is about the Hilton Honors Program. I booked several stays through Orbitz so i can book my flight and Hotel together and on those stays Hilton accpets my Honors number but when i review my account to see how many points i had i noticed on those 2 stays there were ZERO points. Come to find out that booking through another site Hilton won't honor those stays. This is crazy as most people don't ever reall book direct to a hotel when traveling on buisness. I had been a Marriott Rewards member for over 10 years and will be switching back because of this, Embassy Suites are nice and cost much more and for me to not get the points is a deal breaker for my dollars. Wish this policy would change and when i called she simply said sorry company policy and if you want the points you have to book seperately. Extremely dissappointed i must say!"
0,"I stayed at this hotel and it was nice. However, I left my sunglasses behind (they were a special gift from my younger sister) and I called on the same day to see if they had them. They said that they would call back with an update. But they never did. Just a note do not leave anything behind because you will not get it back or even a simple phone call."
0,"I travel a good deal.  This is the worst hotel experience, by far.\n\nThis is an older Embassy Suites but I thought that its location in the tony Biltmore area of Phoenix would assure that it's well-kept.  Incorrect assumption.  This is the filthiest hotel I've ever seen.\n\nI should have known I was in for utter disappointment when I arrived for my stay around 12:45 am.  I am dead tired and fumbling with two bags when I happen upon a security guard standing in front of the hotel taking a smoke.  Instead of holding the door for me, he watched me balance my bags and purse with an amused grin, as I struggled with the the hotel door.  Thanks for nothing.  I get to the front desk and the check-in process is fairly smooth.  I'm booked into a room that is on a far end of the hotel.  I hike over there and proceed to get ready for bed when more problems ensue. The bathroom wall has what appears to be a streak of blood running down it.  I was too grossed out to investigate further.  There is also a bent wire hanger on the picture frame over the toilet.  The wallpaper is peeling and the ceiling is showing signs of a bad leak from upstairs.  Really?  I am appalled at this point but since it's after 1 am, I reason that I can just get a little shut-eye and change rooms first thing in the morning.  My plans quickly changed when I turned down the bed covers to find lint and make-up on them.  I can't do this.  I call the front desk and request an immediate room change.  The lady I spoke too was extremely apologetic and offered to move me right away.  She said she'd send up a security guard to help with my bags and get me into a better room/area of the hotel.  You know where this is going, right?  Yes, approximately 10 minutes later the grinning smoker appears at the door.  He hands me a key for a room on the opposite side of the hotel and makes the assessment that I have a pretty good handle on my bags so he'll just point me in the direction of where I should go.  The new room looks exactly like the first one, albeit a little cleaner.  The bathroom looked acceptable and the bed covers were free of foreign substances.  It was past my bedtime, I needed sleep.\n\nWith a little rest and fresh eyes, the hotel didn't get any better for me.  I'm sure in its heyday this was THE place to stay.  Sadly, it is just neglected and doesn't warrant the nightly room charges (it's not cheap).  The common areas are filthy.  I promise that I'm not a germaphobe.  I really didn't want to touch anything in this hotel.  The elevator buttons and door handles were dirty.  I had to carry napkins with me so I wouldn't have to touch them.  The carpet in the lobby and elevators looked like a ton of toddlers had had their way with a box of Ritz crackers.  And, no, I didn't catch them on an off day.  It looked like this for my entire three-day stay.  I failed to mention the ceiling fan in my new and improved \""clean\"" room.  The dust hanging off of it was so thick.  It clearly hadn't been touched in ages.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel lobby also has an off-putting stench, probably due to the fountains/ponds inside?  I don't know but it's unpleasant.\n\nIf the filth wasn't bad enough, on the last day of my stay I was jarred from sleep at 4 am by a blaring fire alarm.  I pulled the curtain back and saw other guests milling about.  Apparently, there is no intercom system to let guests know what they should do.  When I saw another guest return to her room, I took the gamble that I'd burn in this cess pool and went back to bed.  It was a short-lived nap.  A few hours later, the alarm is blaring again!  I'm deliriously tired and in the process of the pulling on a pair of jeans to exit when housekeeping opens the door.  Really?  The alarm is going off,  it's still early in the a.m. and you're coming in the room to clean?  What in the hell?  What do you clean, anyway?  At this point, I knew it was time to part ways.  I quickly packed and made my exit.  Unbelievable and unforgivable.  Never again."
0,"Bed bugs! 2 of us in 2 different rooms, both fairly badly bitten.

I travel most of the year as my job requires. By far one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. I would post photos of the bites on my FACE, but being humiliated at work for a week was bad enough."
0,"Been coming here for several years, however the last visit I will ever make was this last trip in Oct. First room they tried to give us was so smelly due to cigarette smoke we couldn't even step in, second room was just \""ok\"" until that night we heard a loud \""gurgling\"" sound when all the plumbing backed up with filthy black \""goop\"" all over the sinks and tub. UGH!!!!  Really?? A/C does not work if you want it cooler, stay elsewhere. Also rooms have a terrible OLD musty smell. Popcorn ceilings are all buckling up and in need of repair.  Rooms were not cleaned properly, don't even think maids have a vacuum. Carpet in lobby and hallways FILTHY!!  Just all around dirty. The breakfast was ok, if you want to wait in line for 30 mins. Fish ponds were even dingy.  Sorry, this hotel it is dire need of HELP.    Maybe you guys need to call \""Anthony\"" from \""Hotel Impossible\"" as you do need ALL the help u can get! :(("
0,"Seven day stay between Christmas and New Year.   I cannot believe this is an Embassy Suite, it did not impress me one bit.  Dirty beyond belief.   I found dirt on the ceiling, dirt on the floor and DIRT IN THE SILVERWARE DISPENSER CONTAINERS @ BREAKFAST AREA.  \nI was with a group and the arrangements were made by someone else, but I certainly would not have stayed for seven nights if my wife had not insisted I shut up about it.  Management will be hearing from me and hopefully no one gets sick eating here cause this place does not pass the basic cleanliness test for any health department.  \n\n I have stayed in some of the creepiest hotels in America cause I am a cheapskate when I travel alone.  This matches some of the worst places I have ever stayed in for being dirty and in disrepair.  Towel rack off the wall, interior door off the hinge,  Mold/dirt on ceiling in room and in the big atrium.  (just look up when you are in the Atrium  and you cannot miss the big black marks on the ceiling around the air ducts.)  \n\nCarpets are filthy.  Seven days here and I did not see one vacuum being used.  The maids all had a small broom and dust pan for cleaning.   I have never reviewed a hotel room until this moment and now I will never stay in another hotel with out reading reviews.  \n\nPool was filthy and lots of missing tile, cracks and leaves in water.  I did swim one time, but couldn't bring myself to try it again.  Birds in the atrium while food was being served.  A dog was led through the atrium during breakfast.  How do they get away with this.\n\nFriendly staff and they jumped right on fixing the broken stuff, I give them credit for that.  but dirty silverware was the final straw for me.  \n\nI had two relatives who live in the valley and both said the same thing regarding this hotel after they stayed here in the last 16 months.  Wish they had said something to me earlier.  Hey Hilton, are you listening to this?"
0,"The Wrigley Mansion is one of a few historical venues in a city that does not value its past and history. That said, you would think that fact would guarantee a top quality meal and fine dining experience at Geordie's Restaurant. Regrettably, Geordie's turned out to be no better than any other overly-hyped but underwhelming restaurant one would find at a 4- or 5-star resort.\n\nI have lived in the Valley for nearly 10 years, and last night was the first time I had ever visited the Wrigley Mansion. I always felt somewhat guilty for never have visited, but I can say with near 100% certainty that my first visit is also my last. The service and wait staff performed well, but the food was the equivalent of one might get at Applebee's, and certainly not worth what I paid.\n\nI started off with the carpaccio, which was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. I have had some mediocre carpaccio before, but never this poorly prepared. I suspect a bad cut of beef. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries that arrived with excessive garlic. The fries themselves were overcooked and tasted like Jack In The Box fries. Generous amounts of catsup were required to make them somewhat edible. For the entr\u00e9e I tried the server-recommended lamb chop, which I requested to be prepared medium. When it arrived, it was clearly not medium. The meat was tough and lacked any flavor, and the au jus was entirely too salty.\n\nThe beverage service was quite prompt, however I think the bartender should go back to mixology school. The Manhattan I ordered had too much vermouth and hardly any bitters, while the lemon drop was neither sweet or bitter.\n\nThe purpose of the evening was to celebrate a friends birthday, so our dinner party had a whole room to ourselves. Given the size of the party, the wait staff did do an excellent job of making sure we were well served. Our glasses were never empty and the food did arrive promptly. Unfortunately, that alone could not make up for the poor food quality and exorbitant price."
0,"Wrigley For Halloween? - Save your money!\n \nWe decided to come here for Halloween and spend the pricey admittance fee because we had heard favorably about it from friends that had gone in prior years.  Bar style food was included,  free give-a-ways, lots of halloween like entertainment.    So we forked over the $50 a piece and thought this would be a lot of fun.  More like a ton of disappointment.\n\n$50 bought us entry into the mansion and nothing else.  Oh, did I mention we had to pay for parking too? It was collected as you drove into the property.  That wasn't mentioned anywhere.  Drinks were small, WEAK and overpriced. ($7.00)  Not very decorated at all for Halloween.   They were serving food... appetizers were $10 a piece.  \n\nWe overheard complaints from other party goers on how Wrigley had \""cheaped out this year\"". I had talked to a couple that had gone for the last 4 years and they also confirmed that this was not the Wrigley they had gone too also and they were also disappointed.\n\nSo my review.... I'll never go again.   Total waste of time and money."
0,Beautiful view is all they got going for them. We took our family from New York here. The view was fabulous and the story ends pretty much there if you want to hear good reviews. The food was horrible!!! We all got something different so four people can't be wrong. The server was the worst I have ever seen. Ok so if you know you are busy why don't you update your guests instead of ignoring them knowing that you are busy and won't be able to get to them as much as you would like. Our food took two hours to get to us. I was told it was because of the huge party upstairs. Hmmm well what about the two tables that walked in 45 minutes after us. And got their food 30 mintues before us. Yes that's because their server didn't suck and forget to ring in the food. Then the manager came over and said we will comp you a bottle of wine perfect thank you. But when we tell you how long the food has taken. He argued and said it has been only a hour. And I said yes it has that's when your server remembered to type in the order so that is the time you have on the ticket that gets printed to the kitchen. The table next to us was also pissed and yelling at the server. Get it together!! Your food sucks and so does your service. Well our server any way. Go for bar and views nothing else.
0,"My friends and I went to the Wrigley Mansion for a luch and tour special yesterday.   We ordered our food and the first course was really good.  It was a spinach & bleu cheese salad.   The second course was Croque Madame.   It looked wonderful, but on my first taste I almost hurled!  I am not a picky eater at all, but the ham was completely rancid.  I spit it into my napkin and my 4 friends were shocked because I never send food back and I'm the opposite of  a drama queen.  That's why they were so shocked.  The waiter asked if I wanted anything else and I politely declined.   I'd lost my appetite, of course.  My friends fish was almost raw, too.    So we decided to take the tour and have coffee & dessert afterwards.  The mansion was beautiful and the guide, Ashley,  was fabulous.  I was sad to see every single room was set up as a dining room.  There were no beds or dressers anywhere.  But the art, (They have a Renoir) , the chandeliers, the view and the grounds were stunning.  We went back to eat our creme brulee's and our old watered down ice teas, waters and crumbs were still sitting there.  The waiter didn't freshen up anything while we were on the hour tour.  And there were only 2 other tables of 2 there!    So we got our desserts and coffee.   It was good so far.   Then I asked for a coffee refill and I put in my cream & sugar and took a sip and the coffee was cold!!  I was so surprised that it was so cold that I spit it in my creme brulee' cup.  Again, I'm not a drama queen.  This was just so bad.  We told the waiter the coffee was cold & he was so surprised.  DUH!  He was nice but so inept.   We'll never go back, especially to eat!   I was the worst dining experience  that I've had.   They should at least give everybody a pack of Juicy Fruit for the road.  Anyway, it was such a disappointment, and I've wanted to go there since high school."
0,"I hate giving this place only one star, because I love the location and the history.

Perhaps they are catering to an older crowd that has dietary restrictions on flavor and spice, but their menu is dated - makes me think they haven't revamped it in 15-30 years. Their oso bucco portion was tiny and slimy maybe only 3oz and the risotto was bland. Had some cold shrimp spring roll? appetizer that tasted like they scraped it off the bottom of an aquarium. We went on a Saturday night expecting it to be packed, should have known the food was terrible. Please redo your menu!"
0,"I usually won't give a one-star review, but in extreme cases. I was horrifically disappointed with the food and the service. We were there on New Year's Eve, which should be a night in which they are on their A-game, but I guess they don't find that important. I ordered a steak, cooked medium. When I got the steak, it was cooked well done. It is very sad when a restaurant can't cook a steak. Then the service was disappointing as we hardly saw our waitress. I surely hope there is a new chef since I was there, because I think he worked at McDonald's before there."
0,"Had a deal, it was not worth it, it was  a ripoff.  First there are too many steep concrete\nsteps to walk up, with only one sided railing, cannot walk up with 2 people, and, then there are more concrete steps to restaurant.  Restaurant is not visible, it is all the way\na top, and, it is high.  This place is as old as it was built, plus the deal the food is rationed you are not getting good portions, there is no desert or drinks included, and there is an 18% gratuity plus.  This place is not accessible for the disabled or the\nhandicapped, it is really dangerous."
0,"Great location.  Great views.  Interesting Facility.  VERY marginal food.\nWe went there for my wife's birthday as someone bought us a gift certificate.  \nOur server was great.  He was a great blend of courteous, professional, conversational. \nBut the food was poor at best.  My wife's salad included old, rotted lettuce. The entrees were really second rate.  \nWe will not be going back!"
0,"I suddenly knew this was a mistake as soon as we started to scale the steep difficult steps and the handrail covered with a large amount of bird POOP. My stomach turned and I couldn't imagine why they don't have somebody to clean the handrail.\n\nWe were a few minutes early for our reservation so we walked around a bit. It is an interesting OLD House with narrow hallways and a small room with an old fashioned operators switchboard. It does have beautiful views. The house has a beautiful entrance door and interesting intricate ceilings but over all it really isn't so grand with old worn carpet and common tiles. I thought I'd see a bunch of marble or granite but I didn't.\n\nWe thought this was an interesting Choice for restaurant week because we wanted to see this place. Also this was one of the few places that gave you three courses without dessert. Also the $10 non member fee was waived for restaurant week.\n\nI can't say the food was completely awful but I wouldn't come back for it either even for free so I think that qualifies for the one star rating.\n\nWe asked about cocktails and our waiter said they were the last page of the wine menu but they weren't and only lasted the liquors. He returned and my husband asked for the cocktail menu we saw outside and the waiter brings us the cocktail menu. I decided on a drink but the waiter didn't return for a long period of time so we decided to just order dinner and skip the cocktails.\n\nOur waiter said the Sous Vide Chicken was stuffed with something green and he didn't know what it was but to him it was very salty. He also said the Carpaccio wasn't very good. So we decided to go with the other two starters.\n\nThe starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again. A not so great crab cake sitting on creamy peas with two refrigerated cold roasted tomatoes. The other was a few slices of eggplant with a little cheese.\n\nThe middle plates were not so seasoned escargots with a forgettable salad. The highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese. The other middle plate was not hot and not cold but unhealthy room temperature tomato soup with a over whipped cream laced with truffle aroma. (Aroma means perfume) (and over whipped means turned to butter). We both thought the tomato soup was the best of what we tried here. It tasted like good tomatoes that would be great on a pizza.\n\nFor dinner we tried the duck and the bronzini. Both were cooked just OK but neither seemed to have good seasoning or flavor however both of our vegetables were salted too heavy. I'd say so heavy I could tell what kind of salt they used and it wasn't good salt. The one thing that I could honestly say WAS terrible was the artichoke , anise sabayon. I tasted it and nearly barffed. I am without words to describe how it tasted but the texture was like hummus. Both plates had what they called polenta towers. They looked (see photo) happy to see us and I thought mine might squirt something when I went to eat it. But I was baffled when I tasted it because it wasn't like polenta. It was like corn muffin mix that was mixed with a farina kind of cereal. It was bready and lacked much of the corn taste and really tasted like cream of wheat cereal.\n\nI can almost say forgettable but I can't because I will never forget the bird poop or the polenta tower.\n\n1.5 stars almost 2 stars but with price factored in I feel one star\n\nSLIGHT UPDATE 9-11-13\nI read that they got a new chef since my review so hopefully they are better now."
0,"We wanted to make Thanksgiving special.  The Wrigley mansion is a beautiful house overlooking the city.  My date and I were seated at table 40/1 in the formal dining room.   The food on the buffet was excellent.  The buffet offered options of turkey, ham, prime rib, and lamb.   There was also an area where you can order omelets or pancakes.   Tons of food with very good quality.    On the other hand; the service was unbelievably poor.    We had to virtually send up a solar flare in the sky to get the server to stop and give us refills on water or champagne.    Our server Steve didn't have that many tables either and it was not crowded at the 3:30 PM seating in the formal dining room.    I did notice our server had a different level of attentiveness for our table in comparison to his others.   It was blantently obvious at one point he passed by our table and we both had dirty plates and I motioned for assistance he responded I'll be there in a sec; but a sec was minutes later.  Instead he utilized his time to fill up water glasses at adjacent tables marginally empty and chat with guest who had already eaten.   Perhaps his lackluster performance as a server hinged on the fact that gratuity was already included.  If this is the case he didn't earn one dime of it.  $189.45 for two people is a reasonable price for a Thanksgiving brunch if service is at least average.  This was not the case here and I admonish management for not monitoring poor performance of their servers.  The mansion is immaculate and I may come back for a random  tour and lunch; but for holiday buffet I will err on the side of caution because you never know what server you're going to get here.  Overall this is 5 star venue with 0 star servers."
0,"I hate saying negative things about people or businesses because you never know what's going on in their life to cause them to be rude to you, however Lori's Grooming has permanently scarred my dog. I used to bring my cocker spaniel here frequently it was close to my house and she would always get her in last minute. My dog was 5 when I started taking her to Lori so she had been to the groomer hundreds of times and never had an issue. After about the 6th or 7th time at Loris she would start to shake uncontrollably when we would even get close to the front door. Sometimes she would even poop and pee herself obviously completely terrified. This reaction was new she had never acted like this with any groomers and still, tho not as bad, has this reaction when we go to the groomers.\n\nI feel Lori had either been extremely aggressive to my dog or just treated her terribly, bad enough to cause her to react this way. Tho Lori was never a very pleasant woman I would have never expected her to harm my dog. Be weary of this groomer. Unfortunately there is no way to prove she did anything to my dog, if there were I would have her in jail, but you know your animal and she obviously was terrified of Lori. If you pet is like your child please watch that she is not being harmed.\n\nI give one star because she would always get her in last minute."
0,Worst experience ever. I have been sitting in the front of the restaraunt for 20 minutes waiting for our order.
0,"Wlaked into this place and the guy comes out right away, and asks what I need. I tell him, and right about then his cellphone rings. He spends the next 5 minutes on a personal call, without acknowledging me once (\""be right with you\"", \""sorry about this\"", etc). All I did was walk into his store and try to do business with him, so I can certainly see how a personal call should take precedence. This place must have all the work they can handle-- try someplace where they value your business."
0,"Very unprofessional and rude. Acted like he was doing me a favor to replace a water heater. Had enough and got someone else to do the job. As a small business owner, I know if I treated my clients like this, I would have no clients."
0,"My usual handyman was sick so he recommended Steve at A-Accent Plumbing to install a new sprayer head for my kitchen faucet. I had already purchased the part so it was (I thought) a simple matter of attaching it. The plumber arrived very promptly - the same day I called. He was finished in 30 minutes, charged me $98 for an hour's labor & left. I thought it was a lot but hey!  He came & fixed my problem quickly. Fast-forward 2 weeks. The sprayer head fell off in my hand. My handyman came to see what was wrong and told me it wasn't installed correctly & he would speak to Steve about the issue. Steve, however, was completely \""unresponsive\"" (handyman's words). No fix, no refund, no nothing. I will NEVER use this company again & will encourage anyone who asks to go elsewhere for their plumbing needs. This is the first negative review I have ever written."
0,"This KFC SUCKS! 2night the drive thru clerk asked,\""Like to try our grilled wings?\"" I said \""yes.\"" She said, \""sorry- we don't have any.\"" WTF?"
0,"I very rarely eat fast food, but I was craving some crunchy chicken goodness, with a biscuit and slaw. The only think awesome about the place? SPORKS (why haven't they ever become mainstream, the world may never know)! They were OUT of biscuits and dropped my change onto the pavement without offering to make it right. They may be right down the street from me... but I will be sure to stick to local mom and pop shops going forward."
0,"Avoid this location. My wife and I both ordered a meal that came with a cookie for desert. We got home and realized they didn't give us the Cooke. We returned since we were really feeling like desert and they said the were out and substituting a biscuit or side since they were out of cookies. We question how a biscuit is like a desert since we wanted something sweet and asked if instead of two cookies we could split a slice of pie. The manager quickly informed us that two cookies is $.99 and a pie is $1.99. I asked if she could just make the substitution since we had to drive all the way back and since it was their mistake to begin with and she refused. I just left because we didn't feel like more food, we wanted dessert. How is it that if you make a mistake and run out of desert and then just leave it out of the meal althogether you feel you don't have to substitute with something similar. What a waste of a trip. The one bright side was the person who helped us was very friendly. His name was William.  He should be promoted as I could tell he wanted to take care of us."
0,"I took my baby here based on reviews.  Well, it just goes to show that Yelp doesn't always work.  I gave my girl some med's. and she was having side effects ( loss of appetitite, diarrhea, lethargy), also she was bowled over by a larger puppy at the dog park and seemed sore.  The amazingly pompous Dr. Bishop ignored all of my concerns.  Instead (yet again, he's the SIXTH vet who's done this) he started hammering on about her cough and how it means she's in heart failure.  Is she on med's.?  No, but she had an echo cardiogram less than a year ago and she doesn't need med's.  I again voiced the concerns I came in about.  He said he knows nothing about the med's. I gave my dog (Really?  Corticosteroids, and a vet knows nothing about THAT?).   He didn't care about her symptoms and dismissed them other than \""feed her rice and beef or chicken for now\"".  Then went on about how he NEEDS to run a battery of tests on her and take numerous X-ray's of her.  I said \""No\"", he will not do that, I only allow trusted specialists, i.e. a heart specialist to do that, since reg. vet's tend to be wrong (SIX of them in my experience so far).  He got snippy and said he'd send me to a specialist he knows. Yeah, right.  Again, he wanted to run tests on her to see if she could handle his (extremely outdated) treatments WHEN (not IF) HIS specialist finds problems with her heart.  I told him she already had blood tests, etc. four months ago.  NO, they must have them done again.  Money grubber, anyone?  Then, he said she has blood in her eye and pointed to the WHITE film over it as proof.  I said nothing but I had her eyes examined only FOUR days before going to him, and the WHITE FILM IS A CATARACT. In addition, he never really noticed her, or looked her over, and was very unfriendly and cold toward her.  Even to the point that even though this frail, frightened, blind and tiny girl almost fell off his table while right next to him, he didn't bat an eye.  Couldn't be bothered with holding her or catching her.  Luckily his much nicer tech. did.  I can only imagine the office got friends and family to write good reviews.  He is now in my top three list of the worse vets I ever encountered.  Hey, if a vet doesn't even listen to why you're actually there, and doesn't know about the side effects of a common drug, what good can you say?  Also, tip to pet parents, he's also the third vet I've encountered who has a question on the form you fill out, that basically asks how much money you're willing to spend on your pet.  Wanna bet that's the first thing they look at?  Every vet I've encountered who has this question ended up being a rip off.  From now on I'll run out of the office as soon as I see that question."
0,"I flagged the \""doctors\"" reply.  It is filled with lies, as it would be.  I have nothing to gain by making false statements.  He has $$$$$  to lose if people heed my warning and avoid his practice.  I have proof from THREE other vets that his diagnosis was WRONG.  If my dog had blood in her eye, it would be there the next day, too.  I took her to a chiropractic  vet in AZ the next day.  After adjusting her, he looked in her eye with an instrument.  NO BLOOD.  \nPlus, Bishop  did not bother to look at my dog, or check her over in any way.  NOTHING.  NADA.   He just announced very DIRE supposed concerns that required IMMEDIATE and EXPENSIVE procedures in HIS OFFICE, without any initial exam, or even listening to me about her history. All of this based on the fact that she was coughing.  He completely ignored my every word.  It is true she was knocked by a bigger (not huge, about 10 lb.) dog.  Yet he ignored that, until his rebuttal now.  He did not look at her little back or legs, etc., to see if they were sore or bruised,.  After I took her to the chiropractor in AZ (who sadly isn't on Yelp, as he is expensive but SUPERB and worth every penny) she was much better.  I also was concerned about the Flovent she was on and the Dr. in CA (who also checked her eye WITH AN INSTRUMENT unlike Bishop) said she was having a reaction to it.  In Fact, Bishop said he knows NOTHING about Flovent and then ignored my concern about it.  So it's odd he brings it up now.  He just kept yelling how she's obviously in heart failure.    It nauseates me that some vets do this to loving pet parents, esp. when their baby is getting older and they get more concerned.  But as I said, as a rescuer, I'm a pro at this by now, and know when I'm being given a grotesque sales pitch.   I give good reviews when they're warranted.  I have NO reason not to. BTW, I'd been to the office of the \""specialist\"" he was going to refer me to (read my review on the Vet. Specialists in Gilbert).  NO THANKS.  And the other \""specialist\""  was at another office I'd been to.  They wanted to put my dog UNDER (yes, anesthesia) to take a STICKER out of her leg.  What?  \""Well, because poking with a needle, to pop it out hurts\"".  Oh, so when you give a shot to a dog, you put them under for that, too?  Obviously birds of a feather stick together."
0,"I live in the central phoenix area and this was the best reviewed office around so i decided to give them a shot. My 5mo old puppy had a bit of nasal discharge this morning and after reading up about it online, i decided to seek a professional opinion. This clinic opens at 7am, I called around 7:15 am and got through to their messaging service. The friendly operator said someone will get back with me shortly. An our and a half later, still no call so I brought my puppy in. The front desk and staff were very friendly and let me use a room to wait in due to the condition of my pup. The vet came to see me after 45 minutes of waiting and was surprisingly uninformational, took the pups temperature took a look at him and said \""well it could be anything really\"".\nI honestly got more information from reading webmd than from going to see Dr. Halver. He prescribed my pup $66 antibiotics and $45 nasal drops on top of a $57 exam fee. I would say comparatively this place is very expensive and I did not feel important to the doctor there. Will not be visiting this clinic again."
0,"It's upsetting booking an apt and being told one price for an exam and then being told in person that it's actually double. Because I have a lizard. They knew I had a lizard when I booked my apt but failed to communicate the correct price.  Then Melissa had the nerve to tell me in a snotty tone that I was free to pursue \""MORE AFFORDABLE\"" treatment for my pet and then call me \""rude\"" for sitting in their office and calling the vets near by to see if they had any openings left for today.  And \""wasting their time\""..... I think it's the other way around. When actually it was a wast of my time because I was lied to on the phone and cancelled my other appointment that I was no longer able to get back. Horrible customer service.  I will not be recommending or coming back."
0,Worst wait staff and management i have ever experienced in my life!!! Kinda feels like a retirement home.
0,The food was really bad.   And my son didn't touch his Cuz it was that yucky.   The waitress wasn't that friendly and didn't bother asking us if we wanted to try something else.  Since we barely ate any of it.   Good customer service is offering something else or at least a deduction for uneaten meals.   Will not go back.
0,"But the rating goes mainly for the staff. Been with the office close to 10 years, due to past good experiences even fired my specialists and relyed on Dr James and wife Dr Jacqueline Doris for my care.\nMissing test results from labwork dated 10-15-12 are however a bone of contentment with the staff, especially the office manager, who takes quieries through my electronic chart access as an insult(?). Is asking for the test results- all test results- not my patient right? should I not have been advised on later appointments what the results are?\nIf i had some ungodly illness, shouldn't I be informed to keep the rest of the world uninfected??"
0,"I love Dr. Shealey, she is awesome.  However, the \""referral coordinator\"" Dawn and \""aide\"" Mary are completely rude and condescending.  They do NOT want to help they just want to get you off the phone.  I had and appointment with the Dr. and asked for a referral to bariatrics, because I knew the program required an official referral from my PCP (my patient coordinator had even checked my benefits.  In the mail, Dawn sent me a letterhead stating \""your insurance does not require a referral.\""  I called them explaining that although upfront it does not generally require a referral, for this program, and according to the procedure code, it does.  She became very condescending and told me she'd been doing this 15 years and they \""don't do that\"" (give the referral I needed, even though Dr. Shealey had said it was a good idea and agreed to....) and continued to transfer me back to Mary who was also very rude and just said \""WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?  MAKE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT AND TALK TO HER!\""  They are just horrible!!!!!!!  Pray you never have to talk to anyone but the Drs. there...."
0,I was looking for a new doctor and came across Arcadia Family Clinic. I called to make my appointment on a Monday. They verified my insurance while I was on the phone and I was excited to hear there was an open appointment the next day! When I went for my appointment I had my insurance card and ID ready as they had asked the day before. When I was called up to the desk ( 10 min after arriving) I was told immediately that they don't take my insurance! I told the woman at the desk that they had just verified it the day before. She looked in a folder and said sorry we don't take this. I don't understand how I can sit on a phone call for 7 minutes the day before and be told to come in only to be turned away immediately! I wasted my time at this clinic and they weren't even apologetic about the situation. I hope the next doctor I try is at least compassionate!
0,"dr bowey, yells at me on my first visit with her, because my previous doctor was available that day. However when I made my appointment a month prior I was advised that 'my' doctor will have moved to a different location and not available at Arcadia anymore. I don't want to run around for possible bloodwork and requested to be placed with a Doctor available in my prefered timeslot. \nThen Dr Bowey writes me a script, but I just found out from the pharmacy that all request for refills are denied as ' unknown patient'- funny since I've been with that location almost 15 years. \nAfter-hour care was nice enough to write me a script, but for the wrong dosage...\n\nSo now i've been without bloodpressure meds for 3 (!) days and counting.\n\nThe answering machine states that Dr Bowey doesn't do refills without an appointment, but the lady made very clear that she will not see me as a patient- so what am I to do??\n\nToo bad I can't give less than 1 star for this specific doctor"

0,"Service-Brand disconnect @Biltmore. Others have commented on the beauty and layout of this store, it's true: very nice. But recent experience not so great. \n\nWent in to buy a beautiful Chan Luu scarf in orange I saw a week ago. Couldn't stop thinking about it: a good sign I should buy it. It was gone. Seeing my disappointment, the sales woman offered to get it from another store. Perfect. She took me back to the \""behind the wall\"" scruffy service area (wow, Saks, might need a paint job back there if you intend customers to see it), and proceeded to take my address info and credit card. At the end of the transaction, I asked her if she was sure she ordered the orange scarf. She assured me yes, although could not show me on the order that it was indeed the orange one. \""Well, it has to be the one they call 'melon.' There really was no other option.\"" Hmmm. Then, I noticed a $15 \""ground\"" charge. This was a shock. \""I'm paying $15 in shipping?\"" I asked. \""Yes, unless you use your Saks card, you pay shipping.\"" A) You've got to be kidding me, I would have gone down to Scottsdale Fashion Mall myself. B) You assess this charge without even letting a customer know that would be the case? C) $15 to ship a wispy scarf?  Not your best, Saks. Definitely a brand disconnect from a customer experience view."
0,Personally if I am shopping somewhere as high end as Saks Fifth Avenue where they cater to a higher end clientele I think I deserve good customer service. I came by here today to return a shirt that I had bought recently and received major attitude by the gentleman who helped me. He treated me as though I was an inconvenience to him. I then proceeded to go upstairs to purchase some jeans and the sales guy was rude and made me feel the same way! Horrible and seriously unacceptable and I don't plan on shopping here in the future and you shouldn't either.

0,"I am writing this review to help LV buyers to think before spending thousand of dollars for a Louis Vutton bags. Sure, Its a classy & beautiful bag, but is it worth it? Ever since I was a little girl I have always admired LV bags until this incident. Before you buy this bag, make sure 100% that this is the bag you really want.. \nI received a beautiful LV bag for christmas. I was excited and used it to go to the store for about 15min. I decided that I do not want such an expensive bag.  I repacked everything and gently put it in the box. The bag was purchased on Dec 23. After christmas I went to the store to return it. I was greeted by 2 sa, then she looked at my receipts. Then another sa inspected the bag. He asked if I used the bag? I was honest, I said I did but for only 15min. He replied \"" unfortunately because you used it all sales are final\"". At that, the other sa put my receipts down and walked away without a word. I was shocked, I could not believe it! The reciepts stated that I have 14 days to return. What can we do? I dont want this to happen to anyone. I have totally lost my desire to own any of this bags.Lesson learned, I will never ever walk in to the LV store again.

0,"I purchased a pair similar to these. After about two years of gentile use, the thong on the left sandal fell apart. Since Dillards won't accept returns items this old and because it appears to be an obvious defect, I wrote to Cole Haan for a replacement. All they could offer me was a 30% discount off of my next purchase. Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I really thought Cole Haan quality was superior and that stye would stand behind their products if something went wrong. Turns out I was wrong. Others need to consider this before paying a premium to purchase Cole Haan products."
0,"The summary is that I could have been better served and diagnosed by a blind monkey than I was by Dr. Lawrence Kramer and his staff.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I'm not normally one to be negative.  But I have never left a place of business feeling more disgusted, useless, and violated than I did today.  \n\nMy experience: I made an appointment at 11:15.  Showed up at 11:15.  Didn't get in until 12:00.  Then, my appointment with Dr. Lawrence Kramer was shorter than the time the nurse took to measure and weigh me. Dr. Lawrence Kramer cares only about getting you out as soon as you come in to make more $$$$ by seeing more patients.  \n\nAnd patient beware: he'll try to get you to buy more stuff in the short amount of time he'll spend with you.  First he tried to force a chest exam on me...then it was a flu shot.  And I'm supposed to trust this guy?  He doesn't even try to diagnose the problem, and then wants more $$$ by prescribing stuff that is totally unrealated to the reason why I'm there.  \n\nAfter my experience with Dr. Lawrence Kramer, I went outside and ran into one of the workers in the building.  I told her about my experience, and she asked about the doctor.  I said, 'I went to see Dr. Lawrence Kramer.'   She said, 'Go figure.  That doctor is the worst.  He only cares about the signing off on tickets.'\n\nEnough said.  Take your kids, your health problems, and your medical insurance far away from Dr. Kramer at the Biltmore Medical Center on Highland.  Hopefully the lull in his practice forces him to reevaluate how he treats his patients."
0,"I rarely give 1 star reviews, but in this case I had no choice. I needed an appointment on fairly short notice so when I found Dr. Kramer had an opening for the next day I jumped on it. I made my appointment online via Zoc Doc. I was also able to fill out all my paperwork online avoiding a long wait at the office. Arrive at 3:30 for my 3:45 appointment. The office was filled with screaming children. The receptionist needed my ID and insurance card. I had to fill out a quick consent form which was fine. \n\n45 minutes later I'm summoned back to Dr. Kramer office. I waited another 10 minutes in there before his PA arrived. She then proceeds to ask  me every single question that I already answered online which should have eliminated this long ass process. Finally Dr. Kramer arrives at 5:00. More questions, more examining. His conclusion was that I did not have a bacterial infection. I did however have a viral infection. He prescribed a Z pack. 4 days later and I feel exactly the same. I called his office yesterday and told them what is going on. I was then told that what he prescribed won't work because I did not have a bacterial infection and viral infections go away on it's on in about 6 weeks, but the Dr. needs to see you again. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????? I asked the lady what he was going to do different on my next visit that he didn't do on the first visit. No answer.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning to Dr. Kramer. If you simply want to give your money away I suggest an organization like PAWS (pets are worth saving) because Dr. Kramer ripped me off and had the nerve to try to do it a second time."

I hope nobody else has been duped.  Beware!  I feel cheated and very appalled that this happened.  This story isn't over, so let's see how much worse it can get..."
0,"It's been about 3 weeks since this incident happen, I wish I could say it improved, but it didn't, it got much worse.  After we finally got in touch with Mr. Olson, he apologized and tried to blame it on the supplier saying they mismarked the ring, even though the last time we had spoken with somoeone it was because of a \""bad employee\"".   They agreed to replace the ring from the supplier, yet last Friday,  they informed my husband they just got the materials and the ring would be done shortly ( they made the ring, big mistake).  The ring was such poor quality , that I actually laughed when I saw it.  Their were scorch marks around the crooked channel set diamonds.  The wave actually covered part of the diamond. I was livid!  I took the ring to another jeweler, because Mr. Olson had agreed to allow an outside appraisal event hough they did their own (that was a joke).  The other jeweler I took the ring to was appalled by the quality of the ring.  She said the scorch marks on the ring  were from them trying to solder the diamonds in.  She also saw bubbles in the platinum along with the crooked channel setting.  I took the ring back to Mr. Olson right after speaking with the other jeweler, and he didn't understand why I was so upset.  He finally admitted to seeing the wave in the ring and heard him discuss it with his jeweler about the quality.  He tried to tell me that they were rushed and then the reason they couldn't order another ring was because it was an \""Estate ring\"" (this was new)......Finally he offered me a refund \""Because I obviously can't make you happy\"", well no you can't if you provide poor service and poor quality materials.  Its extremely upsetting that we no longer have our rings that we made our vows with...That's something we can never get back.  \nFortunately, we went to Molina's this afternoon and purchased our new beautiful and symmetrical wedding bands.  Their service and quality were amazing and comforting.  I wish we would have purchased our bands here from the beginning (lesson learned). By the way, has I was talking with Mr. Olson, he had opened up a folder with our names on it,  he had a printed copy of my yelp review and stapled it to the folder...so  guess this is another one he can add!!!!"
0,"Groupon rip-off. Small salad, three extremely small plates of mediocre pasta desserts that cloyed the palate. All for an advertised value of $90. Will NEVER return."
0,Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.
0,"The only thing less fresh than their 1980's decor was the food on their buffet.\n\nWalk in and you will be greeted by an eccentric person in a leisure suit, you can either go in the glass doors with acrylic handles or in to the mirrored room with zebra booth and old conference table chairs. No this is not a gentlemen's club it is a a restaurant that just lacks windows. \n\nFor Mother's day they had a buffet only setup, and what mom does not love cold food that has been sitting out for an undetermined  amount of time. The croutons in the Cesar salad were soggy as were the crustinni under the bruchetta. The pasta was cool. Even worse the butter soaked farm raised salmon cubes were just luke warm. The vegetables were mush and again just luke warm. The mozzarella in the caprese on the buffet was not made in house as it was firm and flavorless. \n\n\nThe real amusing part was on the dessert section. There was a plate of items straight from Costco, lemon bites, cookies and cinnamon twists just as you would by at Costo, on a plate and picked over.  \n\nThis is one relic that is better left in the past, horribly dated decor, sub par food at high prices means this place should be avoided."
0,NASTY! Gordon Ramsay would have ripped this place apart. I'm imagining that's why there were only 6 people in this fairly large awkward restaurant on  a Friday night.  Completely outdated overpriced food. $26 for the grossest chicken Francese I have ever eaten. What a ripoff! Also their house wine is $10 a glass ( barefoot brand) will never return.
0,"I went there for Mother's Day, and after reading many of the reviews here, it was exactly as I expected it to be. Coming here was not my idea. It is sub-par, old school (cough-cough) Italian out of the 60's. Most places would have given a Mimosa with brunch or even a rose to mom. Not here. There was a large display of some stuff they called food, but it was gross. Believe me, folks, this is not Italian but some semblance of what they called Italian. I am ashamed for them. \n\nAs others suggested, the pasta was mush; there were breakfast buns on the dessert table, grizzled lamb, and butter knives for cutting meat, which could not cut through the ham! Someone mentioned the desserts were probably bought at Costo. I felt the same. This was all for the price of around $40 per person. Ugh! \n\nDid I mention the over-priced, watered down drinks? No real Italian would ever put cheddar cheese on an antipasto. Did I mention our food plates were piling up on our table, but no one came to take them away? Service was lacking for a place that didn't have to worry about serving food for the day. \n\nEvery item at the buffet table should have had a serving utensil but many had none. I was very uncomfortable having to pick with my hands. It was all poor quality food and poorly prepared. Not for foodies and especially not for real Italians!"
0,"Our reservation was set for 7:30pm on a Saturday, we arrived to a nearly empty establishment with outdated d\u00e9cor and senior citizen to match. That should've been red flag number one. We waited at the entrance for a few moments before we were greeted by whom I guess was the owner. He said he had been expecting us, sat us at our table and disappeared for the remainder of the evening.  Our waiter was odd; he seemed to be in a rush and irritated even though the place was empty. For starters we ordered the pasta trio sampler and the Oyster Rockefeller.  The only thing memorable about the sampler was the gnocchi which was as good as most yelpers mentioned. The Rockefeller may have been the worse I've ever had; the oysters were so tiny I could barely discern them in the heavily creamed spinach. I'm not sure how something so creamy can be so utterly bland and flat. For the entr\u00e9e I had the Salmon which again was drowned in a weird sauce that covered the entire plate. The salmon was moist but the sauce was putrid. It tasted at least 3 days old. The sides were cold oven roasted potatoes which again were covered in that odd sauce. For the finale, I tried the Cr\u00e8me Brulee, again that was a mistake. It was ice cold and had chunks of pineapples in it which is not normal nor was it ever mentioned. The top of the brulee was not properly browned and didn't crack when my spoon hit it. I look forward to cracking my Cr\u00e8me Brulee, darn! Needless to say I will never be back here again."
0,"Ive been having my car serviced here for 6 years.  The last time they failed to tighten any of the lug nuts on one of the wheels after a tire rotation.  i drove away and nearly crashed.  I had to call them to tell them to come out and tighten the wheel as it was barely on the car.  I never received an apology, an admission of guilt...when I called them the next day, they said they could perhaps give me a free oil change.  Really?!? My days with them are over.  They are careless and do not take ownership of their mistakes.  Zero customer service!"
0,"If I could give a negative star I would. Shoddy work, inept & rude. \nMy husband took his car for an alignment adjustment. When the technician pulled his car out of the bay he backed it in to another customer's truck, leaving our car with a nice dent in the rear quarter panel! Although apologetic, it was several days & multiple phone calls before they even agreed to pay for repairs. \nLet me pause here to tell you how terribly we were treated from here on out. From the rude cashier in the office, to the silent corporate office. They all made it abundantly clear that we were a bother.\nUpon delivering the 3 requested repair quotes, the cashier gal told my husband to go get a quote from a particular 4th repair shop, in Mesa, across town. When I returned with the quote (from said repair shop 20 miles from my house), I asked why their corporate office didn't tell us this in the 1st place? She said that it was her idea because she knew someone at this other shop. What? The repair quotes averaged about $2000 & 4 days for the repair. \nAbout 3 weeks later and many unreturned calls to their office, my husband finally hears from corporate. They will send a check (in a barely reasonable amount), and will not cover a rental car nor time or gas for running around collecting quotes, nor hassle. Wow! So, clearly customer service is NOT a priority for them.\nHere's the kicker: we had to take it to another shop to have the alignment fixed because they didn't do the initial work properly."
0,"Im not sure what the hell people are smoking before they come here to give this place anything more than a 0 star... I literally hated this place. I usually go to the one in Tempe, which is very nice.. Okay so this place blows... the staff is running around like animals not tending the guest and its just chaotic... so we start and the lane isnt work, its not starting the balls dont come back when we throw them and the gates are randomly coming down before we throw the ball, or before the ball hits the pins? WTF? The food is expensive... as expected since the others are.. but seriously we paid for unlimited bowling for 2 hours and stayed for like one hour. Also all the balls... well unless you have little kids thumbs, or giant hands, they wont fit the balls.. which in my opinion is like the # 1 thing when bowling... having a ball that fits... oh well. The lanes are oiled to hell and you feel like youll slip every time you go down to bowl.. thats awesome.. pay 15.00 to fit my fingers into smaller holes, break my neck while bowling, have the ball get blocked by a gate, and not get served? wow.. i know ill never go back to this one at least."
0,"Okay, I have lived in Phoenix and in LA. I have always thought LA was more expensive until my experience at Maroney's Cleaners. Holy Crap Ohla!!! I paid $7.65 for a pair of lined pants to get cleaned by them. Now, I have paid anywhere from $1.50 to $5.50 but are you kidding me $7.65. Then to top it off...I was a bit disappointed in the actual dry cleaning service because my pants were not perfect!!! So, after I was done throwing a temper-tantrum in the tahoe I then proceeded to call and text everyone I know (okay just kidding) about my frustrations. The drive up service is convenient however the price is NOT WORTH IT!!!"
0,Soooo expensive.  They come up with arbitrary charges that end up costing an arm and a leg.  They also ripped the seam on one of my shirts in the process of cleaning it.  Would NOT recommend.  There is a $2.25 dry cleaner right down the street on Indian School that I've started going to instead.
0,"Overpriced!\n\nThey don't clean your clothes any better than any other cleaners, but you pay for the convenience of the drive-up service.\n\nUnless there's some reason that you can't get out of your car, I'd advise driving past this place and taking the time to walk in somewhere else."
0,"Not impressed. Dropped a tablecloth for a work event off here and was told would take two weeks because of the size.  Seems a bit long but this is the first time I've left a non-clothing item anywhere so, ok. \nCalled day before expected date of completion to confirm and was told it would be ready at 5pm and I said I'd be by the next am. \nI roll in and it's not done!  Pointing fingers and asking who I spoke to?  Didn't think to ask unless I was told it wasn't going to be ready.  Woman was apologetic. Writing this review in the parking lot while they press it. It was just going to be washed in cold water, hung to dry and pressed. No cost taken off the $30."
0,So I dropped off tow shirts a few days ago for dry cleaning.\nI ask the guy how much and he said 6.95 and I have to pay when I pick em up.\nPicked up the shirts today and the total was $13.90\nThe 1st and last time I went to Maroney's.\nThose guys should be in the money laundry business IMHO.
0,"I went to Jerry's last night for dinner.  We always eat there and usually like the atmosphere.  This time there were protesters there with anti-Nazi signs.  They told me that a man was present signing books and speaking to a group of people.  His name is David Irving and he was invited to speak by the group about his beliefs that the Holocaust didn't happen.  And that Hitler never knew about the Jews being slaughtered.  This is sick and made me lose my appetite.  Why would a restaurant like Jerry's support a local Neo-Nazi group?  Apparently, they hold the monthly meetings of the group there as well.  I do not plan to return to this location for any meal in case I run across this type of hatred again.\n4.9.12 Since that time, I have been following the story of David Irving.  He has not returned to this restaurant again but went to a hotel near the airport maybe a year later.  It was guarded by the Phx police red squad.  At least the protesters wacked this mole back into his hole for now."
0,"just ew.\n\ndirty bathrooms.\nplastic-y vegetables.\nwatery gravy.\nbland mashed potatoes.\niceberg lettuce and pink tomato \""salad.\""\n\nthis is the taco bell of diners...the food is cheap for a reason. do yourself a favor and skip it. when denny's food looks fresh in comparison, you know you're in the wrong place.\n\n*sigh*\n\nlola"
0,"Ok.... This was an awful experience!!! A friend and I decided to check thus spot out because we pass it frequently, it was late, we were hungry and it was open. It's was fairly slow with 7 tables or so occupied, however, there was only one waitress. We noticed the food coming out pretty fast which was cool, however, the waitress was AWFUL.... so rude and unprofessional. We ordered a milk shake because they are suppose to be known for great milkshakes but was we was served was a watery mess. We explained we didn't want it and she told us we still would pay for them. After contesting, she grabbed the milkshakes, said something in spanish and walked off. Seconds later, she slams the cups in the sink and began yelling. Luckily, we already had our food!!! From that moment on she had the worst attitude and tossed the bill in the table and walked away!!!! The food was good but the service is the WORST!!!! Yikes!!!!!"
0,"First time trying the place. Had my doubts and my doubts were right. Cute place, cute menu but god awful food. Started off with potato crunchers (jalapeno like poppers) $4.99 those were good but the food didn't make up for the poppers. Ordered the honey fried chicken (8.99) which comes with: carrots, side salad (horrible), cornbread (inedible) and french fries (good). Husband had chix fried steak. BLECH!!! that's all I can say. I really liked the carrots and though they were the bet part of the meal. Let's just say don't waste your time."
0,"I'm reluctant to write a negative review as I understand how hard it is to run a business, but the service I received today was abysmal. I have a group of friends that eat their regularly so I've seen this place go up and down with quality. \n\nThe big issue is there's no attention to detail when the orders go back to the kitchen. They actually seem to have a tendency to do the exact opposite of what's requested. Don't get me wrong, when it's good it's good, but I've seen more food sent back to the kitchen at this restaurant than anywhere else. It's got to the point at times that I've seen the waiting staff actually argue with the cook.\n\nWhen I arrived tonight my hopes were high, as the manager was actually here for the first time in months. She was aware that our group had complaints and actually came to talk to us about issues the kitchen of been having. After what seemed to be a constructive talk we placed our orders with the waitress with confidence. Well, needless to say my food was incorrect again. Not only was it wrong, it almost seemed intentionally incorrect. When I express my dismay the manager went and brought the cook out which made me very uncomfortable. \n\nAt this point I was ready to cancel the order altogether, but they said they take the food back to correct it. What the manager brought to the table the second time was worse than the first. I wish I could say I couldn't believe it, but I've gotten quite used to this level of incompetence from this restaurant. I sent it back and told them to cancel the order altogether.\n\nThe only bright spot about this restaurant is the waiters and waitresses do seem to work hard, it's just the kitchen throws them under the bus with their incompetence and the management under staffs them so they always have too many tables.\n\nI guess the only thing left for me to do is try and convince the 15 top that comes to eat there on a weekly basis that we need to start going to another restaurant, but my friends are a little stuck in their ways.\n\nUgh!!!"
0,"Had to just walk out of here. They had a big party in the back room, and couldn't be bothered to help anyone else. \n\nWe sat for 10 minutes before the server came to take our order. She didn't say hi, didn't say there would be a delay. \n\nWaited 20 more before asking how much longer. She didn't know. The only cook wasn't talking to her. We got up and left. This was Saturday at dinner time. Lame!"
0,weve eaten here on many occassions but the last three times the sevice has been very bad along with the food. We order breakfast which is varly easy to prepare. The food takes over 40minutes to make and comes out cold and part of my omilet vegitables were raw. There was so many things wrong with the food that we will not go back again and I don't have the time to list them. It's perty sad when I at 65years of age can cook better then the cooks at JERRY'S . Do your self a faver don't go there or at lest till they get someone that COOK!!!!
0,"The service is APPALLING. We stood at the door for 5 minutes with waitresses walking past constantly and saying nothing. Finally when a waitress did acknowledge us, she waved to the dining room and just said \""where ever\"" and walked away. Not even a hello, or sorry to keep you waiting. THEN, we sat at our table for 5 minutes without anyone saying hello, while again waitresses walked past many times. Finally a lady got our drinks, and even though we were ready to order, told us she'd be right back. 10 minutes passed. Another server who literally just started (we saw her walk in and put her bag down) came over and asked if we were ready. Yeah. 10 minutes ago. No one apologized. No one cared. We were just an inconvenience. The food is good but the service is ALWAYS awful and it's just NOT worth it. Hire more servers!! Maybe then people will want to come back. - Sincerely, I'm usually a 30% tipper and today it's 5%."
0,"Gross. Gross. Gross. Pass this place. Service is awful and the food was just as bad. Greasy, low quality slop."
0,"My bf was visting from Colorado Springs and we were in the mood for seafood, yeah in Phoenix, but we decided to try this place anyway. What were we thinking? There was nothing wrong with service, the food was terrible. It's definitely not what you expect when you look the price, really pricey. We shared oysters for the appetizer. I ordered a clam chowder. It was fine, not outstanding but edible. My bf ordered a ceasar salad, the plate was warm, the romaine was wilted. He is not a picky person but he did not hesitate to send it back. I ordered the scallops which were ok, a little on the rubbery side and it came with brown risotto. It was all too dry, I had to get an extra glass of water to wash it all down. It sat like a lump in my stomach, leaving no room for desert. My bf chose the mussels in an herb de provance soup. It was a bunch mussles that looked like they were swimming in yellow water. The taste? None, it was tasteless and watered down, no butter, no white wine, nothing to make it taste good. The herbs did nothing for the dish.\nWould I go back to give it a second chance, nah, not for the price. The most unsatisfying place I have ever eaten."
0,"We have tried twice to eat here, and twice it has been closed. Yet every time I drive by it, the parking lot is packed. What restaurant doesn't serve dinner on Saturdays?"
0,"Mediocre food.  Mediocre service. Sometimes you can, indeed, judge a book by its cover, and this place proves it.  I was going to write a long, detailed discussion of everything that sucked about my lunch there today, but I'll let the fact that this is my first one-star review (and I've reviewed some real dives) speak for itself."
0,"So we finally ate here. The decor has not been updated since about 1967, and we were surrounded by overweight senior citizens reeking of cigarette smoke. The food was reminiscent of middle school cafeteria fare. \n\nThe waitresses were very friendly, and the prices were not bad. We were obviously not the target demographic, though. Won't be back. Too bad, because we can walk there..."
0,"Let me preface this review by saying two things: 1. if there was an option for negative stars, I'd give it and 2. I just ate there about 20 minutes ago and am still feeling pissed off. My husband and I were in the mood for a good breakfast this morning, so we got to thinking...Matt's? Matt's is always awesome, but we didn't feel like waiting out in the rain for over an hour. The Original Pancake House? It's a close second so we opted for that and headed out. Once we got there, we realized 350 other people had the same idea as us and the wait would be about an hour. Not feeling like waiting, we hopped back in the car and jumped on our phones to check out what Yelp thought would be good nearby. Linda's was one of the places that popped up along our drive and we had both passed it a few times, always talking about wanting to try it. We looked at the reviews and there were lots of good ones raving about the food (Really? Guy who said it was Matt's with pie? Really? I don't know where the hell you get off, but I'm holding you partially responsible for totally jacking up my Sunday breakfast). We got inside and the place is a real shithole. I don't mind, because I typically love eating at shady looking places and drinking in dive bars. It's like a real \""slice of life\"" type of thing and I find the experience usually excels where the decor is lacking. Everything was blue and mauve...I haven't seen this much mauve since the late 80's. And again, that would usually be fine, except in this case, it doesn't look like anyone has cleaned the place since then either. Everywhere I looked, things were grimy and just not...clean. We sat at the counter (first mistake) and both ordered the JJ's Special (second mistake). Sitting at the counter was like having a backstage pass to a Michael Bolton show...or some other really shitty person you would never want to see backstage. We could see the entire operation and hear the cook bitching the whole time. That's right, I said cook. Singular. One person working in the kitchen. She came out a few times to yell at our server, called Linda (I sincerely hope it was not the owner Linda). She looked like the grandma from Napolean Dynamite. For those of you that get the reference, enough said. We could hear the dinging of microwave ovens and the grumbling of Napolean Dynamite's grandma in the weeds with tickets that she couldn't read due to Linda's supposedly shitty handwriting. We waited over a half hour for our food. Granted, we didn't have to wait to sit but seriously, a half hour for eggs, bacon and pancakes. When the food came out I was already over it. I took one look at the plate and knew this was not going to be good. My \""over-easy\"" egg had totally runny whites and looked more like a sunny-side-up gone wrong. My bacon looked like it came from Fry's and the pancakes were the only edible thing on my plate. I don't know if they were edible because everything else was so totally shitty or if it was because I am 9 months pregnant and would have eaten shit cakes at that point. Nevertheless, the ambiance combined with the service and the food made for the absolute worst $28 I've ever spent on breakfast. $28 dollars!! For me and my husband to have pancakes, eggs, bacon and coffee. That did NOT include toast or potatoes and half the plate was inedible. It makes my blood boil just thinking of it and as I sit here writing, I am still starving. We should have just gone to the brass rail. Better service, better food quality (I am not joking) and it would have been $5.50 a person for the same meal. You fooled me once Linda. Shame on me. You won't be fooling me again!"
0,"They don't seem to care about our business. They botched our delivery because they thought they didn't have the stones, even though they did.  They were rude, unhelpful, and about an hour and a half late.  They didn't think any of this was a problem.\n\nWe'll try one other local place. We have about $10k in landscaping lined up, but if the local guys are all this indifferent to small orders, I won't trust them with the large ones. Marvel certainly isn't getting a second chance."
0,Not happy with Marvel....have to agree that they don't care about their customers.  I ordered 10 tons of rocks and scheduled a 7am delivery time.  It is now 11:30am and they still aren't here.  I lost half a day of work and have been paying workers who have been standing around all morning because the materials aren't here.  Very frustrated with this place and will never use them again!
0,The employees here need some serious training. They have no concept of customer service. They also have supply chain issues (always out of product and never know when it is coming in). I have tried Marvel a few times and each time the experience got worse. Will never go back now.
0,"Nice people, but when you take in 3 pairs of $150 jeans to have them shortened and they say yes we can keep the original hem apparently they think that means to cut off the original hem and stitch the alteration as close to they originally looked as possible. Everywhere else in the world that's called matching the stitch (which is usually cheaper) but not keeping the hem. Two totally different things and matching stitching isn't worth $10 per alteration. One last thing, they didn't even match the thread color and width well. Original is a faded yellow and they used a shiny bright yellow. Looks totally sloppy.\n\nThey refused a refund and said they would fix it at the same price with the actual hem... If we went through a box of a ton of alterations scraps and matched it. Total scam artists. Too bad cash was paid or they would be getting a challenge from my credit card. \n\nI found them by yelp and hopefully other people consider this review before giving these dishonest business people any money."
0,"Took in one pair of pants to have a small hole in the groin area fixed. They took an extra two days then stated, was way over priced, and the pants look awful. Actually had to take them some where else in order to get them to being wearable again, will never go back."
0,"Booo! \n\nI can't stand Sprint. Not to go all \""Consumer Reports\"" on Yelp, but my report is that Sprint is an unethical, slimey, seething parasite to our society.\n\nThey \""fine print\"" you to death, so that before you know it your once manageable phone bill now has ballooned beyond your most pessimistic expectations. \n\nThey change phone plans, so that you can't switch up or down for anytime minutes without taking a serious hit. \n\nOn top of that, they make you renew your contract for two years every time you need to adjust your plan. \n\nNightmarish - that's the word I was reaching for."
0,"I realize that most people who need a phone usually don't check reviews on Yelp, but for those that do, stay away from this location. These people are trained to tell bald face lies in order to make sales. The reason I say trained is because I've seen a pattern with the employees. I was told in March of 2011 that I should buy a 4G Samsung 1 because 4G would be coming out any day. A year and 1/2 later I dropped the phone and cracked the scree and still on contract I told them I did not want an upgraded Samsung III if they weren't coming out of 4G anytime soon, the the next employee sounded like he was giving me the same sale pitch the first one did, that 4G was coming out, giving me that nudge to spend more money than I wanted to.\n\nAlso I was sold a Sprint MIFI and I was told you could go anywhere at anytime and connect to the internet. After about 6 visits to this location for tech support, we end up resetting the thing each time, but if I'm in the field, and since that's required every single time I use it, I might as well just use my phone for internet and save 10-15 minutes. I paid $100 of this Piece of cr..p thing and $37 per month and they flat out refuse to let me out of the contract.\n\nI was being sarcastic when the manager after several tech support visits between my phones and MIFI asked me my name and I told him he should know it by now, and his response was that I should be thankful that at least someone was helping me.\n\nIt's damn near a monopoly, but not quite. There's still Verizon and T-Mobile, and god forbid running a business with Cricket, which is a small step down from Sprint."
0,"Don't bother scheduling your appointment in advance online(they never received my reservation even though I had a confirmation number.). Also make sure you give your name at \""check-in\"" to at least three different people to make sure you get on the list.  Worst customer service."
0,"How this store stays open, I have no idea. I went in to buy the iphone 6 16gb 5 weeks. The 16gb was actually in the store. I let the salse rep ANGEL talk me into the 64gb only because she said it was going to arrive in 3-4 DAYS! Well, she is a liar, this store is filled with a bunch of liars. I then tried to cancel my order and to make a long story short, they lied to me over the phone just to get me to come back in the store. This would not be such a big deal if ANGEL had been honest with me. The fact that ANGEL lied to get a sales is sleazy! Hey, SPRINT, you guys need to close this store. \n\nSeriously, do anything you can to not come into this specific store. I've used sprint for over 10 years and never had an issue until now."
0,"Went in to this place because I was told by Best Buy and other Sprint reps that I needed to go to an actual store for an upgrade. For whatever reason I couldn't do it at Best Buy, that's another issue for later. I go in to the store hoping just for an answer as to WTF is going on with my acct. Well, I got no answers. Instead I got the run around and what I could do which would end up costing me a lot more money. Yeah, no thanks. The Sprint service sucks too much for me to want to pay more. But these guys treated me like I had no idea what I was talking about. I hate when people act like I don't know what I'm saying. Anyways. WORST customer service because I have NO answers. Don't waste your time here... or with Sprint for that matter."
0,"Apparently the management of this store has no clue what customer service is all about. What's more is even though I was in the store requesting an exchange on day 14 they count the day I received the phone, even though late that Saturday evening and despite the fact there was a holiday during this period, as day one.\n\nTwo weeks ago today I decided to leave Verizon with whom I have been reasonably satisfied except for cost, and explore other options. I have had a cellphone for 28 years and have, at one time or another, been with all of the major carriers. Two Saturdays ago I went to T-Mobile, AT&T and finally Sprint. On my way to this store I read the Yelp! reviews and thought to myself \""they can't really be THAT bad, can they?\"" I've since discovered they are WORSE.\n\nInitially I was very satisfied with the sales process. I actually went online the day before and reserved phones, chose my plan, etc. I was a bit miffed that online I was told I qualified for three lines with no deposit but in store and after \""further review\"" that I could only get two lines with a $50 deposit for each. I couldn't understand why as Verizon required no deposit from me two years ago and if anything my credit has improved somewhat sice but whatever. (When I received a letter from Sprint a week later it stated the phone number I provided could not be verified in public records. Are you kidding me? Guess I should have used my landline number. Oh well live and learn.) Because of this SNAFU the sales associate had to basically redo everything in the system so my time spent online was for naught but you can't fault an employee for crappy systems.\n\nNext day when I unboxed the phone and after charging it (even though I was told they are shipped to the store fully charged) and giving it a test drive I noticed a faint crackling static noise while streaming videos on YouTube. Initially I dismissed this as possibly being a fault with the video or possibly bad data connection but several days later while messing with ringtone options the same crackling static noise was there. As this was an HTC One M8 Harman Kardon edition and the main selling point was the superior audio quality I assumed getting a quick like-for-like exchange wouldn't be an issue. Wow was I wrong.\n\nAfter a lengthy back and forth with two different associates, one of whom the same person who sold me the phone, I was told that because it was now, by their strictest application of their policy, outside the14 day return policy, my only option was a refurbished phone through the insurance company. Really? One day and as I mentioned  earlier one of those days was a holiday during which no business could be transacted. Also this came after I was told by a member of their tech department there was nothing wrong with the phone and it was only after I demonstrated using the ringtones that they begrudgingly admitted there was indeed an issue. When I asked if I could appeal to a manager they informed me they were both managers and that nothing more could be done. When pressed a bit more , however, the assistant store manager was summoned. At last, I thought, someone who is empowered to make a customer happy. Wrong, again.\n\nHe introduced himself as Chuck and initially was upbeat and positive. Progress perhaps. I introduced myself as Charlie, plead my case, and he proceeded to tap away at the computer terminal. Good sign. Then he asked to see my phone again. He then proceeded to tell me had the phone been in like new condition perhaps he could have given me some leeway but since there was a gouge on the back of the phone that walking out of the store with a replacement was not an option. I wish I could take and post a picture of this\""gouge\"" which is actually a minute abrasion of the plastic backing which you'd need a micrometer to measure. At this point in time and knowing he was fishing for any excuse not to help me I became exasperated. At the very same time Chuck became a first class prick. Very unprofessional.\n\nI intend to send an email to corporate but I'm sure it will only resort in positive feedback to the employees at this store for towing the company line. \""No waivers, no favors.\"" So now I don't even have the option of cancellation without massive contract break fees. Be on notice, Sprint and the employees of the Town and Country store, on Monday there will be a call made to the AZ Attorney General's office as well as the Better Business Bureau about your lousy intractable business practices."
0,My vehicle was damaged during the detail....the manager Keith promised to fix the damage-- a lie...the detail was $350   damage $490--  do not risk having my experience at this company.    Dishonest  for responsibility and overpriced for the quality of detail!
0,"Ive had aprox. 5 alignments done there over the past few years and always had good work done.  Joel is always very nice, however Ken  (the older gentleman) is usually in a bad mood and probably needs to retire. Last time I was there he was very short and rude. I don't know if he was having a really bad day or what, but I wont be going back."
0,"Food poisoning for two, please...\n\nI am really confused by all the 4-star and 5-star reviews for this place. The 4-star average Yelp rating was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.\n\nSo I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.\n\nThe first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...\n\n3 Cheese Plate\nChef's Pate\nCalamari\nCrispy Duck Breast\nCreme Brulee\n\nThe food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.\n\nThe fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... \n\nBy shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.\n\nAfter going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.O\n\nSo by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.\n\nWe drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. \n\nOnce inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.\n\nSometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged. The official diagnosis was acute food poisoning. We were never able to identify the specific meal at Sophie's which poisoned us, as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each.\n\nHowever - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was Sophie's, they remarked \""oh, that place!\"". We learned that the ER at John C. Lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by Sophie's. The hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against Sophie's with the AZ Department of Health Services. They told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases, then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak.\n\nThis all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place. I can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet, or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere, too weak to write a review.\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night. After this experience, we lost all desire to dine in Phoenix ever again. Thanks, Sophie's, for ruining our trip.\n\nFor the record, we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned. I highly recommend CIBO. Great food, without food poisoning."
0,"The place was pretty deserted...I discovered  why. The inside has a slightly funky odor, like spoiled cheese and cheap wine. The owner was a sour faced jerk who demanded to know what I wanted. I'm assuming he was the owner because he had a European accent and his clothes were better than mine. And he had an aura of arrogance and authority.\n\nThat's all it took for me to turn around and walk out the door. If all French bistros are like this one, then I'm steering clear of them in general. Sophie's really sucks."
0,"RUN!!! Not only am I being charged 4X what I was told... he hit a nerve and I cannot feel part of my face. I was told.. oooh no big deal, it will come back in 6 weeks. It has now been 4 months and I still do not have full feeling restored. I was sent to collections without even getting my last bill in the mail. Please save your FACE and yourself major aggravation."
0,"It's 2005 and I was referred to my normal dentist to Reed for some extra teeth that were under my gum line.  Nothing really affected me but Reed suggested that he remove 3 wisdom teeth and 2 extra teeth below my gum line on my right lower side of my jaw.  So a total of 5 teeth.\n\nLittle did I know he was going to CUT AWAY my gum line and expose the roots of my existing teeth that were FINE. \n\nHe claimed it would be fine and the gums would grow back, they never did. The exposed sections of the roots caused infection in my gums and I lost a molar and am probably going to lose another one this year.  \n\nI haven't been able to chew solid food on the right side of my mouth for the past 9 years.  ridiculous. \n\nI'm currently looking for an oral surgeon to hopefully rectify this HACK JOB that Reed left me with nearly 9 years ago.  Every day of my life I regret going to Reed and after showing the results to my regular dentist, he stopped referring patients to Reed.\n\nEven the desk attendants were pushy about the surgery saying I should have them all removed in one session vs having them done in two sessions.  Clearly this office is money hungry and they don't care about the patient's well being post surgery."
0,"As if dentist/oral surgeon visits weren't bad enough, this place is AWFUL. \n\nI had to go here to have the rest of my wisdom tooth extractions because they were heavily impacted and needed surgery, which my regular (and awesome) dentist, Dr. Steen, could not perform.\n\nFirst, imagine what you'd like a surgical center's office staff to be like. Sure, clinical, because they do the same thing every day. But how about professional? Professional would be nice. It was awful from the get-go. The front office lady looked very un-washed and her makeup looked a few days old. No \""Hello\"" \""How are you\"" or \""How may I assist you\"", she just looked at us when we walked in and waited for us to say something. Then, \""Sign in\"". \n\nThere were some problems with payment and she not only was unbudging, she was straight up snooty about it. She actually asked if I wanted to remove the anesthesia to bring the cost down.\n\nUM, I'M GETTING ORAL SURGERY HERE, LADY. SOME DOCTOR IS GOING TO BE DRILLING INTO MY FACE AND SPATTERING BLOOD EVERYWHERE. I THINK I'LL KEEP THE ANESTHESIA. \n\nDo I look like the guy from A Million Little Pieces?\n\nThe doctor himself was very arrogant and Tom Cruise-esque in Cocktail, rolled up sleeves and all. He had the audacity to call my other doctor (Dr. Steen, great guy, very gentle) names because my recovery time was longer. \""Yeah, I'm really good at this, so it'll take ten minutes, tops. And you'll barely have any residual pain.\"" Look where I am now, Dr. Day! At the same pain levels as when I was with Dr. Steen. Ass. \n\nDr. Day's little nurse techs strapped me down in the chair and started talking about another tech rather disparagingly, as if I wasn't there. Helloooo, I'm about 6 inches from your face and am not yet sedated. Could you hold off on the shop talk until I'm off in dreamy dream land? Kthx.\n\nI would suggest you ask for a different referral if your dentist's office tries to send you here. Dr. Day and his staff are competent at best, but so rude and unprofessional, I'd rather go to Mexico than have anything else here."
0,"I just deleted a huge diatribe that I started writing here in favor of keeping this short & to the point: \n1 -- Dr. Day comes off as cold, arrogant and I didn't get the slightest sense that he wanted to do anything more for me than submit my insurance claim and get money.  \n2 -- His staff is short, rude, and seemingly bothered by patients as opposed to wanting to help them.  \n\nI will never return to this office and I will never recommend Dr. Day or his staff to anyone.\n\nIf you need oral surgery, call Perfect Teeth (see my review) and ask for a caring professional like Dr. Salb."
0,"we ordered three entrees for delivery. it took about forty five minutes and then the delivery guy proceeded to argue with my boyfriend over how much he should tip him. after finally handing over the greasy box with our food in it, we were disgusted to see some form of batter and seeds that should have been my sesame chicken. it was ominously labeled \""HCl.\"" the food was disgusting and I can't believe how rude the delivery guy was. we paid 35 dollars for nothing but disappointment. buyer beware. we certainly won't be back here."
0,Stay away.  It is dreadful.  Starting with the greasy apps and on to the Thai Chicken made with frozen French fries.   when I asked the manager he said because fresh potatoes take to long to cook.  \nReally??
0,the chicken wings gave me food poisoning.  will avoid in the future.
0,"The pizza has really never been any good but at one time it was a pizza and wings combo at a decent price. At this point, it's just overpriced greasy food. Bummer."
0,"Delivery was quick. However the pizza was like cardboard with burned cheese, and bland. I ordered a 2 liter soda pop online, and was told by the delivery driver that they were out and would give me a credit for next time i ordered from them. That was unacceptable, as i am never ordering from them again. The delivery driver did not understand my frustration with that and was rude and condescending when i complained."
0,"One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had.\n\nSo, I called on a Tuesday to see if I could get some pants hemmed for a wedding rehearsal dinner. The dinner was out of town, and my flight left Wednesday night, so I knew I was asking for a really quick turnaround and I apologized for that at the start of the conversation. \n\nMe - \""I kinda need these pants ready by tomorrow, is that even possible?\""\nMean PCT lady - \""Well, It's possible, I guess\""\nMe - \""Ok cool, well I'm not trying to be a jerk, but since I'm leaving tomorrow night, I need a yes or no answer... if it's no, that's totally understandable\""\nPCT devil woman - \""...I said it was possible, thats the same as yes, right?\""\nMe - \""Well, not really, possible implies that there is a chance...\""\nPCT satan - (cuts me off) \""Ok well thank you, but I can only tell you it's possible, so maybe you should try somewhere else.\"" (hangs up on me).\n\nI call Brother's Tailors and Clothing, they were sooo awesome and friendly and they hemmed my pants that day! I was still kinda mad about how rude the PCT lady was, so I called back to ask for her manager. After a long conversation of me trying to explain how rude she was (she didn't get it) she ended the call with the statement that pretty much sums there lousy business: \""Well, we've been in business for over 50 years and if you don't like the way we do business you can go somewhere else.\""\n\nMEANEST LADY EVER!!!!!"
0,"This place is absolutely the worst.  If it were possible to give a lesser rating, I would.  My sister was getting married and she worked a deal with the owner for reduced alteration price for all the girls in the wedding party.  First of all, I was charged more than the agreed-to price.  I didn't want to make a big deal of it, so I just let it pass.  When I went to pick it up two weeks later, it was way too tight in the bust area.  At first, the tailor (I think her name was Stormy) refused to take the blame for the mistake.   Her response:  \""Something must have changed since you were here last.\""  Was she implying that I had somehow gained a bust size in two weeks?!?  When I came back a couple weeks later (I don't live in Phoenix but was travelling there often for wedding preparations), the dress was still too tight.  The zipper zipped all the way up, but it was still so tight that I couldn't even take a full breath.  Yet the same woman was there trying to convince me that it was fine.  I think she just wanted to get me the hell out of her shop.  I insisted she redo it again and when I went back a week later (2 days before the wedding), it finally fit, but there was still more trouble.  For one thing, Stormy nearlly gave me the wrong dress.  Second, and more seriously, she freaking lost one of the straps belonging to my dress!!!  When I asked her about it, her reply was \""I guess I can look for it.\""  She still hadn't found it a couple minutes later and probably would have left it at that if I hadn't pushed the issue.  Her solution was to tell me to take one of the straps off one of the other bridesmaids dresses.  Can you believe that?!?  The nerve of that woman.  COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY UNPROFESSIONAL!  She grudgingly agreed to make me a replacement strap. \n\nI should mention that during this entire ordeal I never once received an appology.  Stormy kept putting the blame on everything but her less-than-adequate sewing skills.  If I hadn't already paid the full amount, I would have refused to do so.\n\nI know I'm not an isolated incident because another girl in the party had the same problems only worse.  I had to come back 3 times but she came back 5 times.  She also didn't receive any kind of appology for the trouble.\n\nI can't and won't recommend this place, even to the truly desperate.  There's plenty of other tailors in Phoenix, do yourself a favor and try one of those."
0,"This place is old, furniture is ugly, rooms are dark and smelly. Add to that the manager was really rude... this was the worst part of the phoenix trip for me."
0,What a joke!  It is not your average Embassy Suites.  They should really make this a Motel 6.   This place is really old and dated.  Luckily I only had an one night stay that was paid by my company.  The free breakfast is not worth it.   The AC is super loud so bring your ear plugs.
0,"I arrived here on a Friday night. I booked a suite (not jr suite). I checked in and asked if the jr suite was big enough for me, husband, pack n play and a rollaway they said 'oh not really,' so I kept my suite. I walked into the suite and realized we basically booked a conference room with a room. We left got a meal and went back to the front desk to ask for a jr suite. The girl was so rude!\n\nThe first girl (who was training) wasn't sure of anything let alone the size and cost difference. So she told me to ask the manager girl. She acted like I was inconveniencing her! What the heck is your problem! I asked her if they had any other rooms and she said uh maybe. She then told me it was the same price and said 'anything else you want'. Hah! I was not pleased. \n\nThe room was fine. Only complaint is that it took about 5 minutes for the water to warm up in the shower. And why don't you have silverware in a kitchenette? Strange. \n\nIt is in a semi strange neighborhood. Not very nice. The free breakfast is always a plus. Probably won't be back. But decent."
0,We just returned from Embassy Suites 24th/Thomas . What a mess. Our room ( Suite # 331 ) was west facing and never cooled down below 80 degrees for two days despite the a/c unit running full blast for 48 hours.  Maintenance department was absolutely no help. Offered us two fans. This was the two most miserable day I have ever spent.  The west wall heated up around 1-2 pm and radiated extreme heat until well into the evening ( after midnite ). Avoid this Hotel except in in the winter.
0,"When someone makes a reservation for Embassy Suites you have a mental picture as to what to expect. Throw that out with regards to this property! Hilton should be embarrassed to put the Embassy Suites brand on this property, this is a overpriced Super 8 or Motel 6 at best and in the same part of town that you would expect to find the aforementioned. \n\nThe saying that you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig but all you have is a pig with a dress and lipstick is an accurate discription.     \n\nThe managers reception, really! Goldfish crackers, peanuts, and pretzels! Not impressed.     \n\nThe air conditioning in my room would make a huge noise everytime it would kick on waking me every hour.     \n\nI have stayed at many hotels in my life and this one will leave a lasting impression and not a good one."
0,You will freeze to death!  The heating didn't work.  We complained. They said it would get fixed. Still no heat in our room after two nights. Third night we demanded another room. The ssme issue in the new room.  No heat.  The nights get cold in the winter here. Don't stay in this hotel unless you are looking for freezing cold rooms! Terrible. The water is not hot either.  The interior is outdated.
0,All of can say is they are rude !! I had to pull teeth to have someone to help us...and then when she rang us up she didn't say a word and No thank you for shopping nothing... I love the store But hate the service
0,"wow. horrible experience here.  \""Tina\"" the bartender, rude, confrontational, a little bit scary.  sad, since we've been coming here for karaoke a lot recently, and its always been great,  until tonight.  we will be reversing the charges on our card and never returning."
0,"The employees at the Lincoln and Scottsdale store are rude and dishonest.  I took  photos of a kitchen table to the store to inquire regarding the store's interest in consignment..  I was told that the store would take the item. After loading the table into my  truck and delivering it to the store, an older employee (possibly the store manager) said that he was NOT interested in the table.  I showed him my photos and pointed out the individual who had told me to deliver the table.  He basically said \""too bad\"" and good bye.  I will never again attempt to utilize the \""services\"" of My Sister's Attic."
0,"I don't get it. I see all the buses and billboards, so they MUST do something right. I've given this locations a hand full of times, and no one has ever acknowledged my existence. It seems like a lot of super dated pieces... thrift store finds at boutique prices. I've not ever enjoyed my experience there, and don't know that I'll subject myself to this location again."
0,"at first I wanted to like this company. but then their quality really sucked. What I was expecting was their expertise but what I got was a console panel that pops inward. When I made the dude aware of it he walked straight out of the office with this annoyed expression whether to demonstrate how mad he was at the tech or by complaint. Either ways I was left without a word thinking wtf I'm I supposed to follow our what. Obviously I was because how would he be able to see what I'm talking about. Anyways he talks to the tech and then tells me that its made that way and if I want they can screw it in. Again wtf would you want a panel pooping inward ask the time. Give him a call to make an appointment he says. Fine. 2 days later I can't open the door from the inside. Fukk I thought the tech probably messed up in there too because I had speakers installed. Opened it up and sure enough the connector was broke and a poor attempt to fix it by filling holes and a zip tie. I feel that this is something you should mention to the owner if your going to drill into the plastic visible or not. I doubt anyone gets upgraded stereos because they don't give a shi! About their car. So drilling holes, at least give me a call. So instead of getting a professional installation I got some half as$ workmanship. I don't have the time to do an installation myself and that's why I took it to these guys, unfortunately. So why didn't I take it back for them to repair? Do you continually annoy your food server when they already give you bad vibes? I dont want spit in my food and didn't want more broken things in places I can't see. I don't want to have QC their work afterwards. So I did the repair myself. I've uploaded a picture of the broken piece.\n\nAnyways people might have been satisfied and maybe I was just unlucky but I'm not going back. I'm happy my door gave me signs of trouble before I dropped off my civic for a new stereo speakers and tinting. I pay experts to be good at their job otherwise I'd just hire a bum to take my money and break my $hit."
0,"This is update to review submitted in 2011.  Unfortunately apartment management and maintenance have deteriorated with changes to onsite staff.  Pool area is never cleaned, dumpsters have trash everywhere and are disgusting, all plants are dying because they're never watered, and most distressing, downstairs neighbor keeps two pit bull dogs on patio 24 hours a day and they poop and piss on concrete which draws flies and smells horrible.  Attempts to resolve this last issue were unsuccessful.  Probably will be moving out soon.  Very disappointing."
0,"Great cupcakes and cookies.  Unfortunately - worst customer service in the world.  It's a shame.  Twice now,  they have goofed up my cupcake order.  No apologies for the mistakes both times.  On one occasion, they completely forgot about the order.  I was told I would just have to buy items out of the case - which I did.  No problem.  However, there were not enough cupcakes to fill the order and I was charged the full order price.  When I pointed out that they had overcharged me by $9, the manager rolled her eyes at me.  Started slamming things around and told me sharply I would have to WAIT for the refund.   So you forget my order, don't apologize, overcharge for the replacement order, then have a hissyfit when I ask for the correct price. Wow. Unbelievable."
0,I dont get how this place has so many great reviews. Customer service was terrible.  I stopped in to discuss a cake for my housewarming.  I arrived about 45 minutes before closing time but felt like i had completely inconvenienced the woman by stepping through the door.  She seemed completely uninterested in listening to my ideas.  I had the distinct feeling that she just wanted me to leave and quit bothering her.  trying to salvation an unpleasant experience i bought a couple of cupcakes to take home.  They certainly didnt make up for rest of it.  Absolutely nothing special.
0,"Monkeys could do a better job.  The staff do not think about what they are doing or what is important to the car, only follow a checklist"
0,DANGER DO NOT GO TO THIS JIFFY LUBE!!!!!! This place is crazy and very scary. I was surrounded by really weird employees running around in a state of chaos. The manager is yelling at this kid with a bad attitude who's  rolling his eyes at the manager and scowling. I did not get my car vacuumed out which I thought was part of the service. Stay away from this creepy out of control business. I'll be calling Jiffylube. I deserve better.
0,"A group of us went there for the cafe and let the kids looks at the books.  I am just going to review the cafe.  We were all reviewing the menu, I have not been there in a LONG time.  She was very annoyed that we did not know what we wanted.  CHILL!  I ordered a medium green tea latte.  She was very rude and loud, DO YOU HAVE A BORDER'S CARD?  She prepared my drink.  It was so hot, I had to wait 5 full mins before drinking it.  When I picked the cup also thought it was very light.  The cup was only 3/4 filled? WTF?  The drink was good but the service and quantity in the cup was a totally disappointment."
0,"I hate to give a 1-star review, but Manuel's earned it. Having lived in Albuquerque for six years, I know how a chile relleno should look when it arrives at the table. Manuel's batter was heavy on the egg and what we found on the plate was, unfortunately, an omelet with green chile. Disgusting."
0,"Not sure what all the hype is about for this place.....Very average.... The food seemed similar to Del Taco, but on a real plate. The Fajitas was a joke....This place looks run down & old, which scares me a little bit to eat here. Canyon Cafe/Sam's Mexican Cafe at Arizona Center downtown....NOW we're talkin'!  ...Waaaaay better!"
0,"I grew up with Manuel's. We used to go every Sunday after church growing up and that was back when it was still on 32nd St. Since I got older, the price has gone way up and the quality of the food seemed to go way down. Salsa isn't spicy anymore. Used to be that the plate was super hot when it was brought out to us, not anymore. One of the last times my family and I went there for dinner they charged us a 16% gratuity! 16% is way too high for any gratuity but we were only 4 people!"
0,"Eight of us went to Manuel's today for lunch, and I can say that the service was the WORST I have ever seen in any restaurant.  \n\nSix of us got our meals at the same time, while the other two (who ordered the daily special) got theirs  EIGHT MINUTES AFTER the rest of us.  \n\nWe didn't see the server again until he brought our bill.  We had asked him for separate tickets...and only got one.  We never got a single refill on the iced teas that four of us paid $2.50 each for...ten bucks would buy a LOT of tea bags.\n\nAn 84-year-old woman in our party asked for her water in a styrofoam cup with a straw, which the server said he would bring her but he never did.\n\nThe food was unimpressive...greasy and fried.  I would go to Taco Bell before I went back to Manuel's, which is overpriced.  I wouldn't have minded the mediocre food, but the service sucks like an Electrolux."
0,WORST FOOD EVER. Don't waste a cent at this place. Staff was good and chips and salsa weren't bad but the entree was terrible. First you couldn't even tell what you were eating. Second the price was way to high for the quality of food. Third the food made me and my girlfriend sick all night and the next morning. Also you can eat at much better mexican food places for the same price. Blanco at the Biltmore for example.
0,Just one word of advice. \nMake sure your trunk is EMPTY and contains ZERO valuables before you drive your car into Lindstrom's. \nLocking it won't be enough.\nI'm just sayin.
0,"First time here and they locked the keys in the car.  Instead of calling a locksmith they spent 30 minutes trying to open the door. I finally tell them to not touch the car and to call someone.

0,"Gucci store at the Scottsdale Fashion Square. I just wanted to inform those out there that last week on 6/24/13 I walked into the Gucci store a gentleman was standing by the door about 10:30 am to 11:00 am and I didn't get not one Hello, smile or acknowledgement what so ever. Gucci needs to go back to basics \""Customer Service\"" goes a long way"
0,"Please Please Please Be More Customer Friendly.\n\nUnfortunately, this store cannot compare with those in nearby Las Vegas in service or variety. The sale associates (except for a nice, pretty brunette female) do not acknowledge you and they give off a vibe that you are bothering them. Rarely do they have my size shoe (Gucci men's 9) and they have about 1/3 of the typical Gucci inventory. If you ask about something they don't have, the associate doesn't offer alternatives or offers to have it shipped in for inspection. (LV does that without batting an eye). Security guards are stoic. They stare at you (I get it, it's their job) and if you say hello, they ignore you...they just stare. Makes me feel uncomfortable because I really want to be able to shop there. It is a shame because I would rather shop there vs lugging packages back from California or Vegas."
0,"If I could give them zero stars I would. Worst customer service experience of my life. They completely defrauded me. I got the wrong sized belt so I wanted to exchange it with one that was slightly bigger. Keep in mind that the item had been purchased the day before and had never been worn. The lady went to the back for like ten minutes - and when she came out she said she couldn't exchange my item because someone had put a hole in my belt to make it even smaller (which doesn't make sense because the belt was too small to begin with). Clearly, she went in the back and put a hole in it herself. Maybe this is how the corporate Gucci office tries to eliminate exchanges and returns."
0,"Soo.. Lets start from the very beginning. We had a very good friend pass away who loved Gucci (why I don't know) but he did. So for all of this we wanted to purchase bracelet for his girlfriend and several other people to remember him by. We started our search online and found what we wanted. Great! A cute little silver bracelet with a heart on it, it was a great gift and a great bracelet for each one of us to wear on our wrist to remember him by. We decided to go in to the store to see if they had any in stock. After circling the store several times FINALLY we got someone to help us who treated us like minions. Thanks. Turns out she looked in a few drawers and said she didn't have what we were looking for and to order it online. The next day (Wednesday) we went online and tried ordering - Not Easy - we were not able to add items to our cart - Again Annoying. After all of this we decided to call to order, we wanted to do rush delivery so we could get them on time so we had to get basically everyone they had in random sizes. Not a huge deal but it took about an hour on the phone with them for this process. They had to complete 3 separate orders and although we were paying $35 per order for next day delivery she couldn't guarantee it would arrive by Friday. What? We are paying for next day shipping and you don't know if it will be here 2 days later?  As I mentioned we did rush delivery and had them sent to the office because we knew that we would not be at home when fed ex came and had to sign. After I stressed the importance of this they sent some boxes to the office and some to the billing address, what is their problem! That being said we missed some of them so had to go to fed ex at 6pm on Friday when we needed them by 5pm and then we get them and may I mention they cancelled 4 bracelets last minute and refunded us - Not Ok. Now let's get to the real bad part. Over half of them came TARNISHED with spots all over them. Who goes to a luxury brand and wants defected bracelets - Amateur hour. Again we get back on the phone with customer service who hangs up on is when we tell her what's going on, call back and explains the story to someone else to tells us to chill out. WTF! At this point we don't want the merchandise, they are defective #1 and #2 they have been absolutely awful to us. Game over, don't want to deal with this any more. Next day, go in to store again to see what they can do, maybe clean them or return. They say NO you didn't buy from here so we can't help you with anything. I give Gucci the big FU and will absolutely never do business with you again."
0,"I used to like their food\nHonestly.\n\nIt was my one year anniversary.\nMe and me man went here to celebrate\n\nI had a lobster tail\nAnd a filet\n\nOn the way home, I got violently ill\nLike, within ten minutes of leaving this place.\nAnd no, I only had a few glasses of champagne :)\n\nI ended up going home, and laying on the floor for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etc\n\nAfter about an hour, I couldn't take it anymore\nI called 911\n\nThe paramedics showed up, I was naked and crying on the floor.\n\nIt was a VERY romantic anniversary, let me tell you.\n\nAfter a long night at Scottsdale Osborn hospital, it was determined that the lobster tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill.\n\nI'll never eat here again.\nSimply because I've never been so sick.\n\nIt's a shame though, because on the way down, the lobster tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious.\n\nHOWEVER\nI contacted Ruths Chris and they refunded my dinner amount, paid my hospital copay, and were SOOO nice and accomodating to my every demand.  Bravo.\n\nAlthough, Boo for almost killing me.\n\nEh, I'm torn."
0,"Do NOT go to this restaurant if you can't use stairs. The dining room has about a dozen stairs (for everyone) and does NOT have an elevator or wheel chair lift. The restaurant manager wanted to send our group OUTSIDE, and re-enter the dining room via the back door. In addition, the restaurant staff has no training on ADA compliance."
0,"Awful, awful customer service - so bad in fact that we were too thoroughly disgusted to stay for the meal. We came here on a Sunday afternoon, which was my first and last time.  I've been to other Houston's locations in California - and have had decent times there.  In fact, I love the thai steak salad.\n\n However, this time some 20 year old idiot host walked us to our table (and before we even sat down) and told us \""My mom taught me good manners, so I've always taken my hat off at the dinner table.\""  \n\nHuh?  First of all, I was dressed nicely in a button up shirt, and was wearing my favorite football team hat who had just won the championship the day before.  Secondly, I hadn't even sat down at the table yet, asswipe.  Thirdly, while I understand this isn't Applebees, this also isn't Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, douche bag.  And don't talk to me like I'm 7 years old.\n\nNo sooner had the idiot host left before we walked into the kitchen to get the manager  to bitch him out about his insulting employee.  The manager was pretty much dismissive.  Well, guess what - I'm pretty much dismissive about this poor excuse for a restaurant. \n\n1 STAR - not going back!!"
0,"I need to tell you about the worst hostess experience I've EVER had anywhere.  Ann was unable and unwilling to even pretend to try and accomodate our simple seating request to have our 2 parties sit near each other, even though I'd made my reservation 2 weeks in advance withthat specific request.  Her attitude was unacceptable."
0,found a cockroach in the bathroom....I just left.
0,"I have to say, wow how bad can you get.  Yes the building is pretty, but everything else is of the poorest quality.  The staff is inattentive, the food greatly over priced and poorer than fast food quality.  We ordered a \""Classic\"" California roll and were very surprised that is was not in fact a California roll (enough lemon flavored mayo to choke a horse).  Our entr\u00e9e which consisted of two salads took over half an hour to arrive, and seriously could have gotten larger fresher salads for half the price at Wendy's.  I ordered the Chicken Club salad, the mixed greens were wilted, the chicken sparse and mostly batter, two small cubes of avocado, and the bacon was leathery not crunchy.  My wifes salad had rotisserie chicken that was hastily pulled from the chicken and included connective tissue, fat and congealed blood.  While waiting for and eating our meal we observed two tables beside us have at least three employees stop by to chat for more than ten minutes at a time.  After our meal we sat and waited for 15 minutes for our server to come by with our check and then another 10 before we could flag down what looked like a manager to take our money.  It took another 10 minutes to get our change.  It was nice however to have the tip amounts printed on the receipt so that we knew what not to give.  I really liked Houston's the few times I was there, Hillstone I will not be returning to."
0,"Well... \n\nMy mom was still in town when I gave it another chance. She doesn't live in the states and she was so looking forward to having the salad! Can't say no to mom, right? \n\nSo mom picked up the salad to go and again... TINY. $15 for a side salad. (Please see picture of it next to a piece of paper and you'll see what I mean fellow Houston old timers.) \n\nThe great news was that we were able to ADD our own mixed greens to the salad to make it enough for one person + a bite for another person here and there. \n\nBut really? Who wants to add their own greens to a salad? Defeats one of the main reason for restaurants is that you don't have to do anything except eat and enjoy. \n\nJust not with Hillstone's Grilled Chicken Salad..."
0,"We may not have a lot of bragging rights here in Phoenix, but being able to sit on a patio in November and have a few cocktails is such a luxury, especially when you bring along out-of-town visitors.  My friend from Denver won't see a patio for months, so I was thrilled to introduce her to Hillstone.  Maybe it was the fact that we were just having cocktails and not ordering food that set the weird tone of the evening - or maybe the wait-staff at Hillstone just sucks.\n\nI'd been to Hillstone twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  I've always found them (Hillstone/Houston's) overpriced, but a nice night out.  The atmosphere is really nice, the food is not exactly innovative, but it's consistent.  I'm not going to get into a Houston's/Hillstone comparison here - the food is about the same as always, but the new location is very pretty.\n\nMy friends and I found a table on the patio and settled in for some drinks and girl-talk.  The fireplace was awesome and there are heaters placed here and there for us thin-blooded Zonies.  The waitress came along shortly to take our orders, and our Denver buddy got the first RULE of the evening.  She ordered a cocktail and asked for a double (Hey, we had some major catching up to do - we wanted a little alcohol to get us started.)  She was immediately informed by our sneery server that Hillstone does not serve doubles.  It's just not that sort of a place - they don't want to be known as a drinking establishment.  To break the awkward silence, I joked that maybe the server could bring my friend two drinks instead of a double, that got me nothing but an icy stare.  I ordered a diet coke and a shot of tequila.  I'm not a big drinker, but do like a little buzz now and then, so I get it quickly and then sip on my soda.  RULE#2 - I was told I could not drink my tequila all at once.  Hillstone does not allow \""shots\"", so I must sip my shot of Hornitas.  OK, I'm 53 years old and this person is actually instructing me how to drink my beverage?  Really?\n\nWhile we did enjoy our mandated cocktails and tried hard to follow the RULES at Hillstone, I'm afraid the tone of our much-anticipated evening just never really recovered.  It's a fun place, especially at night when the Cougars are out and on the hunt - great for people watching and relaxing, but I think the drink ordering moment proved so uncomfortable for our server that she left us high-and-dry for the rest of the evening.  We wondered if we were not Hillstone worthy as we searched for someone to bring us a coffee with Baileys.  We eventually flagged her down and got our beverages, but...it wasn't really fun to be there anymore.      \n\nHillstone staff please understand that your place of employment being kind of cool and pretty does not earn you the right to be jerks to your customers.  I won't be back.  Oh, and on a side note, Hillstone, the kitty litter floor on your patio is just weird.  I had to empty the sand out of my shoes several times.  \n\nI wish Hillstone would get it.  Such potential - such a disappointment."
0,"I have always enjoyed dining at Hillstone and Houstons prior to that for many years until this last weekend.  I am on a very strict diet because of numerous allergy issues, and can only eat fish and vegetables.  I ordered a fish sandwich and asked that it not have the thousand island dressing on the bun, as I am allergic to tomatoes.  I was told that the chef would not prepare it that way.  I was very disappointed and skipped dinner.  In our society with so many issues with allergies, I think Hillstone should make accommodations for its guests. I will not be eating at Hillstone again!"
0,"IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!!\nMy husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).\nThis is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. \n\nWe deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. \n\nWe were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. \nTo ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family."
0,"A friend from out of town wanted to try Hillstone since she loved Houston's. From the start I was unimpressed. After the hostess ignored us we seated ourselves at the bar and waited at least five minutes for one of the bar tenders to acknowledge our existence.  After placing our initial drink/appetizer order the service dropped off. On four occasions I waited an agonizingly long time for the bar tender to refill my empty iced tea glass. The appetizers we ordered were nothing special. The house salad and kale were edible but nothing to write home about and the soup of the day was something more like baked beans only not as good\n\nWe proceeded to place entree orders and my friend ordered her second vodka and grapefruit. More than 10 minutes later my friend still had yet to receive her drink and the bartender who took our orders had disappeared. We asked another bartender and he took my friend's drink order. After another five minutes he came back and told us she was cut off. Really, cut off after one drink? What I find absurd is that we were totally benign customers yet my friend was cut off after one lousy drink while the middle aged woman sitting next to us had exposed ass-crack and was served repeatedly during our 40 minute experience.\n\nThis place is run by corporate ass-hats and populated by pretentious yuppies. If you want to eat at a nice place go somewhere other than this corporate cesspool. I will never again grace the likes of this rubbish heap with my presence."
0,"Awful has a new name.  Hillstone.  Just awful; service food...the whole thing.  Food was cold and poor quality.  Service, they just didn't care.  A tab of $187 one would assume you would get mediocre service but nope. I recommend taking your money elsewhere."
0,"This has always been one of our go too restaurants.  On our last visit as we were enjoying the last bit of a bottle of wine.  Servers picked up 1/2 full water glasses, and swarmed our table, they wanted us out.  we were a party of 4 had enjoyed our dinner and we were just finishing up.  This was just flat out rude and very disappointing.  Since when should you feel rushed to finish your bottle of wine.  Not sure we will go back.  I expect great service.  There are plenty of great restaurants here in Scottsdale."
0,"It pains me to write this review as Hillstone, formerly Houston's, has been one of my favorite places to eat for the past 20 years. The food and service have always been delicious and dependable. However, my last visit left me and my boyfriend with such a sour taste in our mouths, I am unsure we will return. \n\nWe arrived on a busy Thursday evening, hoping to sit in the bar area. We enjoy the lively scene and people watching. We figured we'd have to wait a bit, which we have done on countless occasions. There was one seat available so I sat and we were greeted by \""Al.\"" Seemed like a nice enough guy, very friendly and quickly served us our first round of cocktails. We asked \""Al\"" to keep an eye out for us as we were wanting to have dinner at the bar, he said, \""We'll get you seated, no problem.\"" After my boyfriend ordered his second cocktail, we noticed \""Al\"" greeting two of his regular customers that had just walked into the bar area. He walked out from behind the bar and greeted them with handshakes. There was a small high top they sat down at, too small for dinner, but would do for drinks. As he walked back behind the bar to retrieve their bottle of wine, I saw him hold up two fingers to the other bartender. Within 5 minutes we noticed them sitting down at the other side of the bar where two people had just got up. After watching this all go down right in front of us, my boyfriend asked \""Al\"" for our bill. He had a surprised look on his face that we were leaving, since we told him we intended to have dinner. I told him we saw what transpired with his other preferred guests. He quickly apologized and offered to buy us our drinks. When my boyfriend declined and said we would take our business elsewhere, he came out from behind the bar and continued to apologize and offered to buy us dinner. We declined and left money on the bar for our drinks. How could we enjoy a meal after he made it clear the business of his regular customers was more important that ours? \n\nFortunately, we did end up having a lovely dinner down the road at Mastro's City Hall. The bar area was very full and we ordered a couple of drinks and waited for a spot to open up at the bar to eat. Our bartender \""Christian\"" looked out for us and we were seated after about 25 minutes. We enjoyed an amazing steak dinner and were treated with first class service by \""Christian.\"" We will be back to City Hall, not so sure about Hillstone. Truly a shame."
0,"So I decide to take my daughter here because she loves Houston's. I know they are owned by the same company but have different menu items. When we walk in I ask if there are any choices for kids and the hostess says yes a kids burger and a grilled cheese. Waitress comes over, not genuinely friendly, more like fake friendly. I ask about the kids burger since that's pretty much the only suitable option. She tells me that there's no difference btwn kids and regular burgers. Both $16. Ok I'll pass and order her a California roll. It was 5pc and very different tasting and still had imitation crab but still cost $13. I've never seen a Cali roll cast more than $8. And that's regular price, not $4 happy hour. \nI order the French dip which apparently is prime rib but mine was more fat then meat. Disgusting...had to return it. The only good part of the lunch was our appetizer, spinach dip. It's always a win. The mgr was mediocre and took off the Cali roll but acted like he just graduated with a hotel restaurant management degree and was not sure how to treat a customer. Honestly, he should've comped me and bought us dessert but knocking off an overpriced piece of sushi was better than nothing. Next time I'll go to the Henry. 100% better than this place"
0,I was terribly upset with this restaurant. Their prices are absurd for the casual dining experience which made their disinterest in pleasing their customers even more inexcusable. They serve a Caesar salad which is served as a whole leaf. I do not enjoy cutting it up at the table with lettuce sliding off the plate and messing the table area. I requested as I ordered it that it be cut before serving it. They refused saying it doesn't look as good. When I said that i didn't mind if the presentation was compromised and I would enjoy it more cut up. They again said no. They were too busy. Additionally they took some old standbys off the menu. High prices and no regard for customer satisfaction is a bad combination.
0,"how can I get my iPod fixed?  these little snots won't wait on me.  I have to go online to make an appointment, even though I went to the store. They only take appointments for two days ahead, but you have to go on line to do it--- WTF?  You have to make it online? \nAnd why are they dressed like little Steven Jobs clones?"
0,"For a long time when my mate and I walked past the store he would mention he would like an IPOD. So being the perfect mate I bought him one for his birthday. He opens it and said, why did you buy this I would never use it. I will spare you the rest of the conversation. So I go back to the store with the product in hand. I tell them I want to return this, I tell them why. They seem totally dumbfounded and find it very hard to accept that I indeed did not want the product. SO they ask a million question all assuming I did something to the product and rendered it unusable. Any fool can see it never came out of the box. So I repeat why I am returning it. Finally they say ok and tell me there is a restocking fee. I say OK as I had read the receipt. He said wait a minute. So I wait and he returns with what I assume is the manager. He starts his bull crap and literally yells at me about the fee and said I am going to have to pay it. I respond that yes I know of the fee as I told Him, point at the other employee. I have no problem with that, never did, never said I did. They finally took it and credited my card minus the fee all while they snarled at me. I guess I will never find out if I like Apple products as nothing on Gods green earth will ever induce me to buy from such imbecilic company."
0,"Not happy at all. My son bought his second Ipod a year ago. The first broke, and when we took it to the apple store, they said \""tough luck.\"" So, I told my son to make sure to take really good care of the new one. He did. For no reason, it stopped working. We sent it to be repaired and got it back saying \""water damage.\"" No way. So we went to the store and told them about it. The floor guy said to wait and he'd have a \""genius\"" look at it. He came back and said \""no water damage. Make an appt for tonight and they'll fix it.\"" Went back, saw a \""genius\"" and told him the story. Without looking at it, he said must be water damage. We said impossible. He said well, this square hole will be red if it's water damage...yup, water damage. I took the flashlight from his hand and looked. It was white. I know red from white, and this was white. Oh, he said, I meant that there's a little red line. No red line. Oh, I meant that there's a red corner. No red corner. He shows it to someone who glances and says yup, red. This is nuts. Talk about spitting in your face and saying it's raining. They insist it's red and there's water damage and won't look into why this well taken care of ipod won't work. Son not allowed to buy another one. MP3 next."
0,"Oh, how I dislike this store.  What does a girl have to do to get someone to find her a macbook battery?  Seriously.  How many people do I have to ask.  And, then, finally someone goes to look, only to come back saying that they don't have any.  The mac store has no macbook batteries?"
0,"THE RULES:\n\n1. To buy or be helped with anything, you must check in with an \""orange shirt\"" - this person has the clipboard and will write your name down with the reason for your visit. \n\n2a. If you have questions or want to buy something, you must then wait for a \""blue shirt\"" to come help you - expect at least a 5 minute wait\n\n2b. If you've made an appointment for the \""genius\"" bar, you must wait in back for your name to be YELLED out by a \""genius\"" in a black shirt - expect at least a 15 minute wait (If you haven't made an appointment for the \""genius\"" bar, you'll probably just get laughed at)\n\n3. If you want to purchase an item, a \""blue shirt\"" will check you out with their hand-held device, when available. (There is only one \""register,\"" a computer pos system located at the \""genius\"" bar, but it's use is \""not encouraged.\"") If you bring cash or want a bag, expect a longer check out because those are kept somewhere else, of course. Receipts can be emailed to you, printed out, or both.\n\n\nI wish I would've known these things before my last visit - I would've gone elsewhere or just gone online. Can't tell you how much I hated the experience. I guess the setup is good if you're someone who needs a lot of assistance, but for someone with a simple purchase or quick question, the hassles and hoops of this store isn't worth the inconvenience."
0,"The concept of the store is great, but horribly inefficient.  There are 6-10 employees there and not a single one of them could take MY MONEY!

0,"I've visited this location numerous times. While I understand you need an appointment to get any help at an apple store, this place is always mayhem. The staff member that assigins you an apple member is most likely told to lie to you in order to keep you waiting as long as possible - before you completely lose your patience.\nI got to the store at 10am on the dot expecting to simply buy an iPhone 4 and get on my way. The place wasn't busy at all, and I had no questions. Just charge my card $395 for the phone and mobile me, take my info and i'm gone, right? Not so fast.\nI walked out at 10:45. They said they would help me right away, and I stood waiting 25 minutes until I could be helped. Three times I was told \""someone will be right with you\"". The last guy that helped me was nice ,but that didn't makeup for the experience.\nIt's sad apple is such a profitable business with such awful, understaffed customer service. If there was another option out there that was comparable, it would be a no brainer to switch."

0,"The \""help\"" I received at this Apple store was laughable. I arrived for an intro class with a fully functional machine, took the \""class\"" which was pretty lame (most of what you learn can be done at home with simple exploration) and then wanted to get some quesstions answered about getting old e-mail from my previous machine. Our instructor told us to snag a guy on the floor to answer our questions (three of them). The advanced class is no longer offered, so much of what we had hoped to learn about using i-cloud and transmission from other devices, we will have to figure out on our own. We found a guy, but he was hostile and rude. He eventually walked away from us after giving us the incorrect information about e-mail retrieval and password resetting, leaving us with a machine that no longer functioned properly. We sought out the guy with the clipboard and he said there were no appointments available at the genius bar for 4 hours and that was at another store across town. We had traveled 50 minutes to get to this store from our home. We pointed out to him that is was HIS employee who screwed up the device. They REALLY didn't care about serving their customers. When a young woman arrived without an appointment, the clip board guy told her to wait a minute and they would see what they could do to help!! My husband and I are in our 60's and use computers and smart phones every day, but there seems to be an arrogance in this store if you are not the young, hip, techie person. My husband spent an hour or so on the phone with Apple tech support and got things straightened out. THEY were very helpful. This store does not have the \""Nordstrom\"" customer service ethic and  is not a place to go for help. Their focus is to demo, sell their devices and act like customer service is beneath them. Their \""coolness\"" is a turn-off and they act like they are doing you a great favor if they answer a question. It seems to us that Apple is selling more devices than they have the manpower to support in their stores. I will avoid these stores like the plague. All of this makes me wonder why I bought an Apple product in the first place."
0,Worst customer service! But they don't care! I even spoke to a manager and he would not exchange my defective device.  What happen to taking care of your customer?
0,I pre ordered the iPhone 6 and showed up after receiving an email stating I could stop by to pick it up any time that day. It was 7:30 and the line was out the door. I was told to come back tomorrow and that there's no way I was getting that phone prior to 9pm close. I've already paid for the phone and I showed them the email I'd received but to no avail. So I called the store on my way home explaining what'd happened and the kid looked up my name and said they shouldn't have had me wait in line and that I could come get it whenever. It turned my Friday night into a cluster and I'm disappointed in the way apple does business.  Seriously considering galaxy whatever and ditching the iPhone for good.
0,"I really wish I was able to give this store negative stars because the deserve it.  Every time I go to an Apple Store I feel like a head of cattle.  They honestly don't care about their customers even a little bit, it's all about good marketing to sell their products then when they malfunction they do everything they can to keep from fixing it because that would cost them money.  I have Apple plus, insurance that I paid for in the case that my phone needed fixed or replaced.  That was the case when I went here and not only did the jerk who was supposed to be helping me fail to do so he also made my phone worse.  Then he blamed me for the phone not working after his solution didn't work.  I truly loath Apple just based on its stores.  I wish I could leave them but I have so much sunk cost between the Mac book, TV, iPad, iPhone that I'm not better off leaving."
0,"This is by far the worst Apple Store I have ever been too. The customer service is AWFUL, I have never dealt with such unprofessional people. After being told my computer was broken, I waited 45 minutes even though I told them the exact computer I wanted to buy. I was willing to pay $2,000 upfront to get the computer I needed. When it came time to purchase it, I let them know I needed it ASAP since I had to make it to class. At this point, they told me it would be ANOTHER 30 minutes for me to even get the computer!!!! Not to mention, I dealt with a total witch while trying to explain I had been at the store already for 45 minutes waiting to get this computer. I will probably never return to this store, as I don't appreciate having eyes rolled at me and employees tell me I'm being unreasonable."
0,"This location is terrible. They did nothing but screw up multiple cars of mine. Now it's two years later, and the compressor they broke and replaced is broken again. \n\nDO NOT GO THERE!"
0,"Avoid this corrupt company... terrible! \nI sent my wife in for an oil change and to get the brakes looked at because they were squeeking.\nThey did the oil change and told her that the rotors would have to be ground down or replaced and the rear brakes needed to be cleaned, the bill would be about $400.00\nI said no, bought $18.00 brake pads from another company, and did the repair myself in about an hour\nWhen I looked at the rotors, they were LIKE GLASS, in immaculate condition, absolutely did not require any grinding/replacement...  (the vehicle is only a few years old, with low mileage) \nThey completely tried to take advantage of my wife, fabricated a completely false story about the vehicle to try to make a quick buck... they should be shut down... \nYou've been warned!!"
0,This place is aweful! I got my brakes done and just 4 months later they were toast. Called to have them fix and they refuse. They took my 400 and now won't honor fixing their crappy job.\nMy advice- avoid this place at all costs.
0,"So, this is a long story, but I'll do my best. Brought the girlfriend's Passat in to have the service light checked, a/c checked, and it was making a strange noise. Wheel bearings, ac leak fixed, oil changed and tires rotated. Pickup car, service light still on, and makes a different funny noise. Call up, they have us bring it back, apologizing for the light, and thinking they just need to balance the tires. I thought that was automatically done after a rotation, but hey, I'm no mechanic! Offered a free oil change on her truck as compensation, and since she had brought it in anyway for its own a/c issue, she was happy with that. \n\nThis ordeal lasted over a week, dealing with multiple employees and manager. The first guy that worked on the Passat apparently quit that day, the next guy had to leave because his wife had a baby, etc. \n\nEduardo told her that all her hoses needed replaced and several other things, before he gave her a diagnosis of the problem we brought it in for in the first place. At this point, we just want to pick it up. So we do, and now the airbag light is blinking. Manager (Seth) refused to speak to us and then we were hung up on. \n\nPretty ridiculous. Not sure if this is because we are women or what, but us being female shouldn't have anything to do with the fact they don't seem capable of fixing a problem without causing a new one. Francisco was the only person there worth talking to. He was great, but sadly there were too many other things wrong."
0,"If I could give this pharmacy zero stars I would have. \nMy husband went in to use their shipping services and the lady with short hair was completely rude.  She stated, \""that you are raping us of our shipping supplies\"". The term \""rape\"" was used. WOW! He was using USPS shipping material and shipping it from their store. USPS offers these flat rate shipping boxes as a means to ship priority. Meaning we are paying for the services. \nI would hope management of this pharmacy get extra help. With employees like these they may go out of business. \nI would NOT recommend their service to anyone. Do NOT come here if you are looking for customer service. \nI am appalled with her behavior and the pharmacy's service."
0,"Worst customers service. In general, the stores never have stock on hand that is on sale. You'd think they would have stock on hand and more, esp if it is on sale but no and even the first day of ads, they don't have items.The shelf space is very limited.Again, if you advertise something on sale, have it on hand for the customers...\nDon't waste your time with this store chain..Not worth it\"""

0,I must put my 2 cents worth in about Vincents.  I personally will never go to Vincents again.  We went one new year's eve for a friend's husband birthday.  He is French and they are from Florida--so I was trying to make it a special occassion.   I remember very little about the meal because the service was HORRIBLE.  Red wine came after salads had been served.  A white wine sat on our table unopened until we were able to flag someone down--the serving of the meal was uneven at best and then servers got switched mid meal.  For a dinner that cost more than $500--I certainly expected more.  When I called to complain--their offer to me was a glass of champagne and a dessert--to make up for an evening that was suppose to be special on several accounts and turned out to be a disaster.
0,"This place had a lot of hype...one of the best rated restaurants in town. We were extremely disappointed. The service was terrible, we sat for about 15 minutes before we even had a menu and were asked if we wanted a drink. When we did finally get the menus we were extremely disappointed with what was supposed to be an extensive wine list. The wine list turned out to be rather weak with a small selection from each region - even France wasn't well represented. \n\nAfter another 15 minutes of waiting without any contact from the non existent server we walked out...and walked down the road to Chelseas...which was solid."
0,"Apparently I was in the 'formal' Vincent's on Camelback' as opposed to Vincent's Market Bistro so I can't speak to the Bisto.  As for Vincent on Camelback we were very disappointed.  The menu and the staff were really over the top pretentious and the food was just ok.  The choices were extremely limited and very expensive.  For two meals with no drinks or dessert, the bill was over $120.  We got the (small) rack of lamb and some kind of tough wild boar dish with sauce that had a very odd flavor to it.  And not 'odd good.'  It came with a side of parsnip 'potatoes' that made me wish that they would have used real potatoes instead.  I get it. But what has the potato ever done to Vincent to deserve this?  One more thing. . . I forgot.  We ordered a bowl of lobster bisque. I told the waiter that there was no lobster in it. He said that's the way the chef makes it.  Huh?  Please.  Next time maybe I'll have chicken soup with no chicken in it.\n\nAvoid this restaurant.  I can't help but think that the people who left good reviews have had their brains fried by the 120 degree sun in Phoenix."
0,"Oh my! Restaurant week 2011 .  This meal was a disaster! Terrible service...totally non existent  service. No beverages offered and we had to ask for them . There was a 25 minute wait for a reserved table, whilst 10 empty tables needed to be cleared. Food incredibly lacking in flavor . Lobster was NOT served....it was langoustine.  Steaks mediochre to be kind.  Excessively salty salad...could not eat it. Pecan pie smothered in caramel sauce. Honestly good pie ruined!  ONE WAITER HUMMED LOUDLY FOR THE ENTIRE EVENING. He wasn't part of the entertainment. Will never waste money there again. So many great restaurants in town.....THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM."
0,"Unmitigated Disaster - We will never be back again, and I would have to recommend (after this experience) for no one to go there either.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were not so kindly greeted by a white haired woman at the front desk. Our reservation was for 7PM, and we got there at 6:55PM. The disgruntled lady tells us to sit in the lobby until it's closer to 7PM... Since when did showing up a few minutes early become a nuisance? Moving forward, we headed towards the lobby to find eight people also waiting to be seated. A little unusual for a Tuesday night, but no big deal - until twenty minutes passed until we were finally seated. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but a simple \""I'm sorry for the wait\"" would have gone a long way.\n\nThere were two dining areas and we were placed in the larger room. Several tables were available, so I didn't understand the long wait. Anyway, there's an old-fashioned quality to this place... not good or bad. The chairs were uncomfortable and the carpet looked unkempt, but we were there for the food. \n\nWe sampled the Duck Tamales.  Unfortunately, there was nothing special about this dish. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either.  That was the highlight of the evening\n\nWhile waiting for the main dishes to arrive, it got extremely cold in the restaurant. We hear the staff complaining about the temperature, and then we see another couple complaining to the host about how cold it was on their side of the room. \n\nFinally, dinner arrives... I ordered the wild boar cooked to medium rare. It tasted medium-well to well done. The waiter stated that this dish comes with five large medallions, but looking at the dish, there were thinly shaved bits of meat. This dish reminded me of the over-cooked roast beef that my dad used to make when we were kids (which I hated, by the way). \n\nMy wife ordered the braised short ribs which tasted like something that came out of a microwave. She tells me, \""For the price of this meal, I'd rather eat a microwaveable meal.\"" I tried a piece of the short ribs thinking it couldn't be that bad... WRONG. The short ribs were chewy, stringy, and although it was covered in sauce, it was DRY. We hardly put a dent in our meal. \n\nWhile waiting for our missing waiter, we noticed that the restaurant was starting to get really warm - similar to a gym. We both started laughing at how horrible everything had been. We were finally able to flag down the waiter for our check. He never once asked us how our meal was - even after seeing our plates were more than half full. \n\nAnyway, the moral of the story is: Don't waste your money here. Or perhaps call in advance to make sure Vincent is working. While waiting for our car, the valet guy said, \""Vincent is on vacation. His food is phenomenal, but when he's not here, we hear customer complaints.\"" Maybe this guy is right, and Vincent's food is out-of-this-world; however, based on the service alone, I will not even bother coming back. No second chances for this place - no thanks!"
0,"Ok...First off I have to say I don't usually judge a place off the reviews and like to give it a shot. Well this was a bad idea... especially on an anniversary dinner celebration. Please be advised that the bad reviews are indeed true. We have eaten the food through their catering and it is delicious, so this makes me think all the energy is expelled here alone? Like the other reviews had said this is a creepy outdated awkward place that doesn't have any background music playing at all. So yes the tables are very close together with no music so imagine how uncomfortable that will be. We immediately ordered martinis to try and ease the mood. My dirty martini was garnished with tiny olives on a sandwich pick for an upscale price. The server also spilled most of my wife's martini during her trip to the table saying how it was \""overfilled.\"" We received a basket of bread that was burnt and unappealing which ended our idea of a maybe hopeful outcome. We were both confused because the dinner menu was nothing like we had eaten through catering. The server informed us that we had probably meant to dine at the \""bistro,\"" and was happy to transfer us over next door. Feeling questionable that it would be any better we paid our tab and agreed to go take a table they were holding for us. \n\nWe then walked over to the bistro side of the restaurant only to be disappointed once again.  Packed in like a meat house and sat there for 15 minutes without being asked if we'd like a drink we decided to walk out. They have again an awkward system of seat yourself and apparently serve yourself as well? We were so confused by all the groups of people lining outside to get in this place. We were more than willing to give up our table to the next unfortunate guest. \n\nThe parking lot is also a joke like a previous person had reviewed. It is only valet and gets backed up by the cars coming in and the one attendant trying to run the place. Some lady thought I was a valet driver and proceeded to yell at me because I was standing around not helping her. \n\nWe are in our late 20's and knew we were in \""Snotsdale\"" all the way."

0,"We mistakenly chose to host an 65th wedding anniversary family celebration at Vincent's.   At the end of the meal, as we were trying to collect our uneaten desserts, Vincent became enraged by the delay to his waiters' ability to clear the table.  (We later surmised that the threat of overtime pay prompted this entirely inappropriate, frightening response.)  The alternative and civil approach would have been to help the guests while simultaneously clearing.  \nThe honorees, ages 87 and 88, had been loyal and frequent customers for over 30 years.  They were deeply shaken and frightened by Vincent's threatening loss of self control (which escalated to threats and his grabbing of my 87 year old mother's arm).  No member of my family will ever step foot near this establishment again.   Unfortunately, Vincent's inappropriate behavior trumped any value associated with food."
0,"I am amazed....the foregoing reviews cannot possibly be speaking of the restaurant we visited during restaurant week.  We had 7.30 pm reservations and arrived on time to find probably 12 guests standing around waiting for their tables....we joined them. My husband became bored and walked around the small place, counting 10 tables waiting to be cleared.  20 minutes later, no one had offered us a drink, no cocktail serving person was to be seen, but at last we were seated! 15 more minutes passed slowly by. No acknowledgement of our presence...no welcoming smiles,hellos,eye contact.....ah at last water was poured into our glasses.Yes, there is some liquid refreshment available in this arid place.....WATER! Still no acknowledgement. The water bearer was silent and did not look up from his task......hello here's the waiter asking us for our order......er,\""may we see the menu first?\"".\nDo you serve drinks in this restaurant?  May we order something to drink? Yes we had to ask.\n  Let's speak briefly about the food.  SALAD.......a salty undressed mess, Brie and figs......NO FIGS. Tomato leek tartlet....very good.  Filet steaks....tasteless. Lobster and pasta.....it wasn't lobster it was langoustine.....no flavor.  Salmon....ok. As for the desserts great pecan pie, ruined by pouring caramel sauce over it.  We all know that pecan pie is sweet enough, don't we?\n After all this, the final straw was the very annoying waiter, who hummed incessantly as he served.  In all fairness he was totally unaware of his habit, as was everyone else who worked there....otherwise surely he would have been told to STOP. No we will not be returning.  So many great restaurants in the camelback corridor....why would we?"
0,"Drea, thanks for posting your experience! I completely understand, as I had a very similar experience! I went this morning to use a $10 certificate that I had purchased for $4 through a daily deal.  I usually love discovering new places this way because it gives you a chance to spend less money at a new place and decide if you like it or not. And I've made the assumption that owners are happy to see customers with a coupon because it means the marketing they chose worked and new people are coming in.  You would THINK they would want to make a good first impression. But not the Coffee Lady! I came in and ordered an egg salad sandwich. She went to her fridge to get some egg salad and said \""The tuna and chicken are a lot more filling if you want that, but we are famous for our egg salad.\""  I wasn't sure if she wanted me to change my order, or if she was just making conversation, but it seemed like an odd statement to me and I started doubting my order, but I didn't say anything.  The next thing I heard was \""Ah, this is kind of skimpy, let me add another egg.\""  And when I looked over, I could see that the container she had pulled out with egg salad was nearly empty, which clearly meant she was using yesterday's leftovers (as it was 8 in the morning when I came in), and I was a bit disappointed that the egg salad isn't made fresh daily. She literally peeled and added an egg right into what was left. I was just surprised at how nonchalant she was. Then I ordered a latte, since I knew I had to use up my $10. The latte was good (nothing out of the ordinary) and she was very friendly to me while making my drink. But then it came time to pay...and when I pulled out my coupon she said \""Oh, one of THOSE....great, I have to start my day off with one of those, huh?\"" WOW! Talk about poor customer service. If you don't want to get new customers into your store at a discount, then why did you agree to the deal???  Her attitude was a total turn off...So then she added up my two items and said \""OK, you're just under $10 but you do have to pay tax, which is $.84 and that doesn't include a tip either, if you care.\""  (and this was as I was putting a cash tip in her jar, which she did NOT deserve, and I kicked myself for doing that, though CLEARLY she is hurting if she's that upset that I'm using a coupon, and VOICING that it doesn't include the tip). Then she had the gull to inquire if I lived nearby because she wanted me as a return customer. UNBELIEVABLE. I will NEVER go to this place again. Even if they HAD the best egg salad sandwiches or coffee in town, which they DON'T (and wouldn't you know, I ended up with an egg shell in my sandwich), I wouldn't go back.  \nI do not like to be negative and truly do have better things to do with my time, but I don't appreciate being treated badly or differently for trying a new place on a budget."
0,"My experience was nearly the exact same as the one Dana M described.  Absolutely terrible!  Except she went so far as to say that she had hoped people who used them would bring someone with them.  I was by myself....... and in restrospect, glad for it!  Wouldn't want to subject anyone to such unpleasantness.  OH, and dont' order the berry smoothie.  Mine went down the garbage disposal as it was undrinkable."
0,"I am shocked over these reviews. I'm going to have to assume its family or something. I was an unfortunate victim of this group of GPs for years. Because of the long list of the things I needed to see Dr. Lyndo for (no longer there) I felt like I couldn't go anywhere else.  I honestly felt trapped.\n\nThis is the wonderful help i've gotten.\nDr Daveys sat outside the examining room talking on the phone about his upcoming vacation for well over 15 minutes while I listened. It had only been an hour wait getting in to examination room.\n\nThe receptionist are the biggest bunch of rude obnoxious.......they have just about done everything but give me the finger. \n\nI can't tell you how many times my insurance company didn't ante up so they will call you up to the front of the waiting area and in front of EVERYONE ask about it and ask quite rudely. Then tell me they \""tried\"" to call  so I deserve being called up to the front of the class. So embarrassing, especially when your sick. They even called me up when my husband (who had a different insurance plan) had not paid. AND told me I couldn't see the DR because of it! Thats after I had waited fifteen minutes already. I have no idea what I was supposed to do. Go beat up his insurance company?\n\nThen there was the time I was prescribed medication that sent me to the ER. Wait no hold on there was the TWO times that medication was prescribed to me that sent me to the ER.\n\nAnd the time they told my son he had loose joints when in fact he had scoliosis. Where you get loose joints from curvature of the spine is anyone's guess. \n\nAnd then when Dr. Bauer accused me of being a smoker, when I told her I wasn't. She told me I was lying....because you know thats what I do. Lie to GP's....Its a bit of a sinful delight for me. I always hope it gets me improved care......oh wait. \n\nThe long waits where always enjoyable. If I got out of there in less than a hour it would have seemed nothing short of a miracle. You better plan on a lonnnnnng wait. They are making vacation plans after all. \n\nI could go on for days. This place is awful. **AWFUL***  Please, go somewhere, anywhere else.  The homeless guy on the corner would probably give you better care. He'd be cheaper thats for sure!"
0,"This place is getting seriously demoted. \n\nFor the second time, I have been turned away from my absolute fave cardio class because it has filled up to capacity 45 minutes before it starts. What? Really? Does this mean I have to speed up my after-work rush just to ensure I can write my name down on their sign-in sheet? That's bogus. \n\nWhat a fiasco. The last time the class filled up, I went up to see for myself. So many regulars, who said they signed up, were without spots. That's when one went down to get the sign-in sheet and an employee. Good for her. \n\nTotal chaos. When I asked the front desk what I needed to reserve my spot, chick-a-boo behind the counter had no clue. Then the guy who pulled out a binder really wasn't any better. I wanted to know the process. Don't just tell me to sign-up and pay a $1. I want to know how the system works, man! I said, \""Good to know for future reference,\"" then I left. It's also good to know that you MUST reserve a spot IN PERSON so they can take your dollar. I don't trust them. They'd probably lose my information and I'd get screwed over, again. \n\nI don't use the machines there because they're shitty. I go for the one or two cardio classes that I absolutely love - because of the instructors. Everything else creeps me out, even the female locker room. \n\nPlus, the one time I asked the front counter staff about a personal trainer, she had NO IDEA their names. I tried to describe the one I saw upstairs working out with a client. He was doing moves I used to do, ones that really focus on stability and strength. I thought, \""He looks like he knows his stuff, and I have free sessions here I still haven't used. Oh, why not?\"" Well, chick-a-boo had no clue. \""Go look over there at the board. They have their photos up.\"" That didn't help me, because I didn't really see the trainer on the board. Maybe he was new or he cut his hair. I don't know... How f'n annoying. It reminds me of when I first joined and asked for a trainer to give me a call. Nobody did. Suckas.\n\nI hate this place. I hate going here, but I can't resist because of the cardio classes I love so much. ARRRRGH. It just sucks squirrel nuts that I have to show up AT LEAST an hour before class just to get a spot!"
0,"some equipment just goes missing, too. my boyfriend says the scale in the mens locker room has been missing for 2 months, randomly. one day i noticed someone using the gym's jump ropes and decided the next day i would do that because it looked nice and intense. next day = all jump ropes gone! no reason... they never came back either so i just bought my own and bring it there. \n\ni asked the front desk about it, they said \""oh, we need a code to get in to the equipment rooms.\"" and i was like \""well, can you get it or ask someone to open it?\"" and the response was \""well, i dont really know which trainers are here right now, so i dont know.\"" and i was like \""nevermind\"" -- no point in pressuring an obviously unmotivated employee.\n\nalthough the skinny hispanic guy that looks like he thinks hip hop is super cool thats there in pre-6am hours is fabulous. he remembers your name, inquires as to why you are late, asks why your workout was so short today if you leave too early, etc. great guy. he's young, i dont know his name, but someone should notice that he's a great employee. hes the type of person that, at first glance, you would think he would be an idiot or lazy - but definitely not."

0,"If Kurt Cobain had been here in the summer time, he would have sang \""Smells Like Athlete's Foot.\"" Thank goodness, he lived in the Northwest.\n\nThis 24-Hour Fitness, especially the men's locker room, is disgusting. I took a shower once after a good workout and I had to count the years from my last tetanus shot. Filthy, shaky, rusty partitions in the shower. \n\nThe rest of the gym has an \""I love the 80's\"" vibe. It's one pastel short of a Richard Simmons' color scheme. There were gym rats who perspire so much at stationary bikes that sweat drips from the machine and forms a pool on the floor. If you have an over-active sweat glands, please have the courtesy to wipe. \n\nWorst of all, on my fourth (and last) visit, a petty thief broke my locker and stole all my cash. I reported the incident, filled up a form, and got valuable advice: \""Don't use combination lock, it's easy to break.\"" \n\nUmmm...really? When some gym members have bolt cutters instead of fitness gloves, it's time to move on to a different gym."
0,"Too bad there's not an option for no stars. The only thing more atrocious than the fungal smell and lack of working equipment at this gym is the customer service. Today I cancelled my entire family's membership because I've had enough. After touring three other local gyms - I'm willing to pay the extra money to switch to one that gives a crap about its customers. Having had my membership for 11 years it's a sad move, especially since I pay peanuts - but it's just NOT worth the headache of working out here. When the manager accused me of lying about my child's age, I went back home and brought back her birth certificate to prove I wasn't lying, and still I remained a customer. When the manager bitched at me about not answering the overhead page when it CLEARLY states on the app (in permanent marker) that they MUST call me on my cellular because I am hard of hearing and I run plugged into my iPhone, I stayed a member. Now they're saying I haven't paid up my account even though I have a RECEIPT in my possession from last week, when I paid in person. If this is how they treat loyalty, I'd hate to see how they piss on everyone else. Take my advice - pay the extra few bucks and switch to Gold's, LA, or ANYWHERE else."
0,This place is dump. The air filter above the pool has an inch of dust on it. The tow lights in the steam room do not even work. On e light fixture has been almost pulled off the wall. The Jacuzzi water is disgusting. \nThis company does not care at all several of us have told them several times to get it fixed. They just blow us off. Don't join this place!!! I would rather see them go out of business so  a good company would buy it.
0,"Old equipment that is usually broken. There is ALWAYS at least one broken machine, usually cardio. The place is very dirty and smelly. The AC never seems to be working. The front desk staff are usually to busy being on their cell phones or talking to other staff to acknowledge you.  I'm considering driving to 43 ave and bell. That is a nice one!"
0,"Location is the ONLY reason I go to this gym and I've been going to this location and others for the past five years.  This past fall, I had gone to the gym after a few months hiatus.  I was on the treadmill for 30 minutes then went back to my locker.  It was broken into.  My purse and phone were taken but not my car keys or Smart Water.  I guess the robber must have seen what I drove (hint: it's probably an inside job )  There were only 2 staff members on site, both young men-no women on staff (hint: hint: it's probably an inside job then) A police officer did come and I reported the robbery which was the 3rd in two weeks!  The next day, I spoke with the manager.  The same speech he's probably have told others, you can tell the bottom line is the only thing he cares about.  I lost everything plus a $100 bill which was my b-day money and I've spent over a few grand for membership.  I did receive a refund for 3 months but still REALLY!  'Well you shouldn't leave stuff in the locker.  These people go to gym to gym.  We have signs that tell you not to leave items in the lockers\""...ummm it was locked and I've been going here for over four years and have never had an issue until now. If you are having robberies, you NEED to tell people not just a sign!  Plus one of the staff told me they were having major issues this past fall...umm that's not someone from the outside that's a staff member doing the robberies!  I found out last week there were MORE robberies!  So if you are looking for a gym, move on and go somewhere else.  It's not the cleanest gym but I like the sauna and that's about it! And then I get a call that they found my purse and calendar in a locker.  The manager never followed up with me and when I got my items they were sfuffed in a drawer and the staff member didn't even seem to care.  I think it's time for a new staff and management!"
0,"Place is dated. There are always multiple machines broken and when machines break, they are not repaired for quite a long period of time.  Maintenance is clearly not a priority. I inquired as to why maintenance was not a priority but received no response.   Do not join unless you get tour with manager  and discuss maintenance with manager and get comfortable the situation will change.  You do get access at other clubs around country, so I am able to go to other 24 hour fitness facilities and have found other facilities much more acceptable."
0,"Carpet is torn up, locker rooms are in a sever need of a remodel from 1986. Equipment is old and there are always 5-7 machines broke. Seriously, this should be the crown jewel for Phoenix area 24 hour fitness gyms. Especially for the area. What a let down."
0,What a cluster and a fiasco to get I to a class...people have old passes and different passes which mess up the number of people for the class. 3 of is tried to go to cycle class and didn't get a bike even with a pass and our name on the list. This is the worst location in the valley. I drove 10 mikes to get here...thanks for nothing you guys! I'm sticking to scottsdale. Just wish they had more options for cycle...
0,Terrible service.   I signed up for a three day pass online then finally got a chance to try the gym.   They told me that the pass expired and offered a one day pass.   The whole point was to try the gym at the times I go to see how crowded etc before I joined.   I'd rather take my business somewhere else if you can't allow someone to try your gym twice one time in the am and one time after work to see how busy and the accessibility to the equipment.
0,"I was  a member here at this location ,..For about 5 months.  I Paid 400 for a personal trainor . I used just one session. Used only one.  And they refused to give me any money back. I did not like the customer service from the front desk people a lot of the time too.   I am now going to L.A. Fitness and it's much better.,,.,Better trainers and much cleaner and friendlier and more proffessional staffing.  I\nHated losing that four hundred dollars.   This life I guess ,... Lesson learned."
0,Worst possible gym ever. Staff is extremely unprofessional. and equiptment is dirty all the time. Trash is never taken out and sweat is never wiped up. Its a money scam dont expect to walk in without being harrassed for days via phone to join. Its a 24 hour fitness that isnt open 24hours. Nobody who works there is genuine. I say save your money and go to LA fitness or even a youfit. Nothing here is special its over priced mediocre.
0,"I defy anyone to find a civil, knowledgeable human being who works in this place. I'd rather be stuck in Newark Airport than shop here."
0,"I think the service at Lowe's is consistently so much better then Home Depot, but this Home Depot is the closest home improvement store to where I live.  I went in today asking if they had free standing fans.  The women pointed at one type of box fan on an end cap.  I asked her if there were any others and her response was, \""No, it is August, what do you expect?  You should have bought one in June.\""\nYou know what i expect?  I expect a store to stock the things they sell, and not give me attitude when they don't have what I need, but I guess that is to much to ask of Home Depot."
0,"Total lack of staffing you can walk all over this store and not find an employee. Its dirty, disorganized, and most the time you are left to having to use self checkout, the have virtually no carts or trollys. To top that off you get accosted by illegal immigrants as drive in to the parking lot and while leaving."
0,"I would much rather write a positive review than a negative one, but my experience here was beyond unacceptable, so I felt I had the responsibility to report. \nI recently rented a lawn mower from this store. The employe I dealt with told me the $75 deposit would be refunded with cash upon return. \nI returned to find a different employe who informed me that the policy was actually refunding my card at days end. \nI explained that I was told differently, he offered neither apology nor explanation, just told me to check back tomorrow. \nNo refund the next day. No refund the day after. In the meantime, I had a returned check at my bank due to funds not being there (thanks HD) and incurred a $35 fee. So I returned, was given the run around and demanded a manager. This guy was worse than his employees! Told me \""if you can't afford the deposit, maybe you should rent elsewhere!\"" He then promised to refund my card that day and I left. Well well well, imagine my surprise when checking my account the next morning, I discovered not a credit, but another $75 charge! And with this, another $35 back fee! \nNeedless to say, I angrily returned to speak with the HD manager, and he rudely informed me it was out of his hands and I had to call corporate headquarters. Thanks to the fraud department at my bank, I finally got my money back, but it took 4 weeks, and $70 in bank fees. The initial cost of rental was great, but due to misinformed employees and a careless manager, the experience cost me $70 extra, countless hours of my life, and a world of frustration. I have nothing positive to say about this place, and highly encourage anyone renting equipment to go anywhere else for higher quality products and customer service that would surely dwarf that of Home Depot"
0,"The customer service including that of the manager Jeff at this Home Depot is the worst I've every received.  I was contacted to pick up a door that I had ordered.  After waiting for an hour, the staff including the manager running the store finally figured out that the someone had set the door up front in customer service (where the rep who called me said it would be) dahhh.  When I commented on how ignorant everyone was the manager started threatening me and I thought I was going to have to call the police.  I have written a letter to corporate about this store and manager.  If you must shop at Home Depot make sure it isn't this one unless you are experienced in Martial Arts.  It truly is the ghetto and the staff reflect it."
0,"This review is just about the paint department, only.  The workers in that department there are phenomenal but the lack of staffing in the paint department is ridiculous.  You can count on them to do their best,  but it is hard to deal with.  I used to be in there a lot.  All of the workers bust their guts trying to get the orders out and correct.  They are exceptionally helpful and try their best.  Apparently, the management (or corporate) doesn't care, or doesn't want to retrain and hire more workers to cover the paint department, or doesn't want to pay, or doesn't care if they have workers comp claims or whatever.  That is a tough department with high volume.  If you go for paint, try for Friday nights or some other off time, due to the backlog.  Whenever possible,  I have moved my purchases over to another specialty paint store only due to the lack of staffing at Home Depot on Thomas Road."
0,"This store is swarmed with staff. Are they helpful? Nope. They ignore you even as you struggle to get large, awkward pieces of lumber onto your cart. I passed 10 associates and not one of them greeted me or asked if I needed help finding anything even as I was making my way up and down the same building material aisle obviously looking for something. I had my lumber cart full, but I decided to not purchase anything and left it for those lazy idiots to put back on the shelves. No customer service whatsoever. From now on, I will drive three times the distance to go to Lowes. I worked at Home Depot as a teenager and I remember managers would chew our asses if we didn't greet every customer and asked if they needed assistance. I guess standards for hiring have gone way downhill. I wasted an hour of my day."
0,"Deplorable customer service. Placed a 2K order for delivery and my order was missing 22!! Rolls of industrial tape. Brilliant delivery driver broke a pallet of cinder blocks THEN placed the pallet on a slope leaving it teetering precariously.  Really!?! Called to check on the tape, first guy did not call back, neither did second or third employee contacted. When I asked in exasperation if they could locate other stores where I would pick up the tape myself, they said they can't do it that way between stores explaining my only option was to get a refund and buy the tape again. What? Really, you can't call another store to verify home depot was already paid and hold the items for me to pick up at customer service? Oh, sorry, that would make sense.....\n\n\nI have bought blocks there before and once counted 9 employees waltz right by me while struggling to get the bricks off the high shelf only to be chastized for attemping to utilize their rolling ladder. Mind you, I am a small non-bodybuilder type lady. \n\nHopefully they will call me back today to resolve this problem, but as of now, even a 1 star review if far too generous. Its a shame; they lost any chance of my next order which would have been about another 3K in a week. Their loss is Lowe's gain."
0,One star for the massive headache I got after I ate the food... MSG?  Not sure.
0,this restaurant is not wheelchair accessible. I have no idea how the food is because there are 2 steps and no ramp.
0,Freaking out a little. Just got finished eating there. Hairs in the food and I saw a cockroach crawl across the kitchen floor. At least if I get sick tonight I will know why!
0,"Decided to try this place out on a Sunday night around 6:30. The restaurant was kind of busy but the two servers working should have been able to handle it. We stood at the host stand about 5 minutes before the cook told us to sit anywhere and handed us menus. \n\nIt took over 30 minutes for a server to come over and give us water. We put our order in because we were obviously ready( drinks, an appetizer, and entr\u00e9e's). The sever never came back while we were waiting for the food. However, all the food came out at a reasonable time for being down a cook (about 40 minutes). At this time we asked about our drink and the other server who brought the food said they were in process. \n\nHalf way through the food we finally got the drinks. So what about an hour and a half though the total time sitting down. \n\nNow the food. \n\nWe got the heaven rolls of something and they didn't have much flavor. It came with a peanut sauce and the tofu in the rolls were breaded in peanuts. So just too much peanuts not even other complimentary flavors. \n\nBoyfriend got the western burger with vegetables. The burger looked store bought and the sauce tasted store bought. The vegetables were steamed but did not have any flavor or seasoning on it at all. \n\nI got the steak and potatoes. Steak was store bought and the potatoes were simple like morning potatoes with peppers and onions. Anyone could make it. \n\nI've been a vegetarian for over six years and this is the worst place I have ever been. I literally made a yelp account to give this place a bad review. Now that I actually have an account I will review more places. Usually I amforgiving when it comes to local places but I will never eat here again."
0,"I arrived on time for my appointment and had to sit in the waiting room for over  a half hour with a blaring kids  movie playing on the waiting room television.  The waiting room was not very clean and the furniture was worn and outdated.  While I was waiting, people were being rushed out the door who had just had their Lasik procedure done.  The staff were walking them out telling them their aftercare plan in front of the whole waiting room.  When the \""sales girl\"" finally called me back into a room she did not apologize for the wait.  She only said, \""this is surgery day.  We are busy.  We tried calling to reschedule you (I received no such call). Then she made me look into a machine while she looked at my eyes for about ten seconds.  She then led me to her sales office to talk pricing. She gave a very lengthy sales pitch and did a poor job pretending to listen to my concerns. I am nervous about having this procedure done and she made me more nervous.  She made it seemed like I needed to have the procedure done ASAP before my eyes got worse.  Then she made a morbid comparison to Lasik being equivalent to cutting her finger off.  Then she pushed a finger down and modeled to me what her hand would like missing a finger.  She would not offer specifics on pricing and kept throwing out numbers and percentages.  She made me feel rushed and like I had to decide today if I was going to go with them for the procedure. She discouraged me from using another form of payment other than their financing and kept throwing percentage rates around as to why she was right.  I asked for documentation stating the pricing and discounts available to me and she declined to produce any such document stating, \""This is not like buying a car.  I am not giving you any written pricing.  Anyway, the pricing changes all the time.  These are your eyes we are talking about and you only have two (like I didn't know that).\""  She created a huge sense of urgency with getting the procedure done and kept repeating, \""You only have two eyes.\""  She kept telling me what \""most people\"" do, which is pay the day of the consultation and get the procedure done the following week.  She also told me she needed a $100 deposit before I left today if I decided to go with them.  I told her that her sales pitch was making me feel uncomfortable and rushed as I am in the early stages of exploring this procedure.  She became offended, defensive, and moody claiming it was not a sales pitch and that \""I only have two eyes.\"" She would not even continue the consultation and have my eyes tested to see if I was even a \""candidate\"" for Lasik without my committing to pay.  I then said that I felt their company was not a good fit for me and she led me out.  I do not recommend this company based on my consultation experience.  I would not trust them with the actual procedure because they seem very concerned with getting people in and out of there as fast as they can to make $$$! If you do get the procedure done at this place, you should not pay more than around $1500 per eye because that's the final price I was verbally quoted at my consultation.  But, like the \""sales lady\"" said...prices are always changing! This company needs to train their sales people on how to effectively communicate with clients, build trust, and be empathetic!! Oh, and give clients documents on pricing!"
0,"I had my LASIK consultation today.  I waited in the waiting room for about 30 minutes prior to being taken back by the \""Director of the Center\"".  She took me in a room and did a quick \""test\"" on my eyes and then brought me to another room, sat me down and asked if I had any questions about the procedure.  I said I had numerous questions, but would prefer to speak to the surgeon (No need asking them twice, since I really only cared about what the surgeon had to say).  She said asking her my questions/concerns was \""one in the same\"".  I think not.  That was the first red flag.  The second one came after she said I would not be meeting the surgeon at all prior to the day of surgery.  Who in their right mind agrees to an elective surgery without meeting the surgeon prior to the day of surgery?  I have never heard of such a thing!  I'm assuming after you pay in full you are then allowed to meet the surgeon.  The third and final red flag came after she said she would schedule me an appointment with the surgeon at another time and then revoked that offer, saying \""We just don't do that here.\""   I got up and left.  This place is obviously a LASIK factory mill and I'm not willing to put my eyes at risk to save a few bucks. Beware."
0,"Alex Optical at Christown/Spectrum has done a few of our glasses. This last time we asked them to do 4 pair of glasses - all but one had to be redone.  They even wanted to charge us for their mistakes.  They finally agreed to fix them for no fee, but why should I have to even ask.\n\nI will use Paris Optical, a little more expensive, but they guarantee their work and give you a free pair of lens within the year after ordering the glasses.  I scratch my glasses and this allows me to get all new lenses (same perscription) within the next year."
0,"This place was gross. The pizza was bland and had no flavor, the salads were the same, but drenched in dressing and soggy. The tables had residue on them, and I didn't want to eat on them. I definitely won't be going back."
0,Walked in on Saturday and walked out.
0,"If you have any other choice, do NOT use this company and that lady, they will lie on the paper and I end up lost my case, they stated on the court paper that they did serve the paper to my ex and even said they talked to her, but my ex had 7x24 camera and it did show they even showed up on that day/time on theri paper, in order to collect the money, they will LIE!!!!"
0,I HATE this complex! The management staff is very rude and treat residents like crap. Do yourself and find another place in the area. This place is a ripoff and overall pain. There's plenty of nice condos in the area just check padmapper or zillow. Save yourself and stay away!!!!!
0,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the food, as the overwhelming smell of sewage forced me to leave before I could order. We instead went next door to \""On the Grill\"""
0,"I been to this place twice as well as once at another location.  At this particular location the food is pretty good for lunch but the staff does not seem to be in any hurry.  When I go to the trouble to dive over to this place during a 1 hour lunch break, I really don't like waiting 15 minutes for what is more or less fast food.  The last time I was there I was kept waiting so long that I finally asked for a refund and left.  You'd think that if your chicken combo (first item on the list) is going to take more than 20 minutes to prepare that they might inform me of it, but instead they just left me standing there.  That won't happen again."
0,"I go to this location fairly regularly and have never had a problem. Store is clean, employees are friendly, food is consistent. What more could I ask for? \n\nUntil tonight. I get my order to go, the crispy shrimp plate. The girl working the register was really nice, and I was in and out quickly.\n\nI finally get home and open my container. THE END of my good, reliable Ono experience. My shrimp are blackish/greenish/brownish...plainly, not something I am even going to take a bite of. (Gross!!!)\n\nThe store was about to close and I wasn't going to be able to drive back in time, so I called the store feeling like I should give them a heads up. I don't know if these things could make a person sick or not. (I do know I won't be the one finding out.) \n\nThe girl that answers tells me, \""Yeah, that's how they've been turning out.\""  Well, gee, that's great. Thanks for selling me something you KNOW is sub-par and far from edible. \n\nI guess I'll be going to Pete's the next time I want some fried shrimp, and that's a shame. I really like Ono's mac salad and the katsu sauce with the shrimp.\n\nTo anyone else thinking about eating here -\n\nMaybe you should check your order before you leave. I'm sure this was a fluke and hopefully will be fixed soon, but I know how much I hate wasting money. And being hungry."
0,"This location was a joke...me and my girlfriend went here while we were waiting for her cars oil to be changed at the brake Masters down the street. You stand in line like at a cafeteria and the people behind the counter dishing out your not so fresh food can barely speak English, the tray I picked up was sticky and dirty and had some type of half dried syrup on it and it was disgusting.  They served us and did not even give us silverware, or chopsticks to eat with, and the general decor of this restaurant looks like a ghetto Chinese buffet in crack central.  The floors and restaurant in general were D.I.R.T.Y. like Christina Aguilara dirty back in the day before she was a mom!!!! The food tasted like it had been sitting in a pan for 3 hours, and I would NEVER go to this place again, I was surprised I didn't find a finger or a needle or a cockroach in my plate of mushroom chicken with vegetables."
0,"Gross, plain and simple!  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset.  What a waste of money!"
0,"I've never experienced this before, but I'm just going to let you be the judge:\n\nI am starting to watch/count my calorie load, especially when I am eating out.\n\nAmerican Chinese is famous for huge calorie loads in the sauces and fried treatments, so I thought I would split the middle and order a brown steamed rice with broccoli and beef.\n\nWell, I asked the young lady behind the counter for the calorie count chart and she quickly said she would have to ask someone. No problem and expected...but what happened next was not:\n\nShe walked to the back of the galley-style kitchen past the viewing, walkin freezer to find her manager. Outside of the freezer is the prep area with a large gray garbage can. She stood there, asking her question, HOLDING THE GARBAGE CAN. Then she and the manager walked back to me.  The manager came with the paper and placed it on the prep line. And she grabbed a bowl to serve me. WAAAAAAIT! \""Uh, excise me. Is that a garbage can?\"" I asked. She looked back and asked where. \""There...in front of the freezer...the big gray thing with the black garbage bag stretched around the rim.\"" \""Yes\"". I asked her if she realized that she stood there and grabbed the rim and talked to her manager. \""No,\"" she replied. \""My dear, I watched you and you not only grabbed the garbage can you just came and grabbed my bowl to serve me.\"" She put the bowl down and walked away, washed her hands and apologized.\n\nNeedless to say, I won't be coming back."
0,"My service was so aweful, I really thought I was being punked. I walked in to Panda Express and instead of being greeted, I was told that \""this is all that they've got\"" and they don't make anything else because they were closing soon. Excuuuuse me? Four-fifths of the food pans were all gone. A whole baseball team walked in after me and they were rudely discouraged from ordering, because all they had was out so they left. I insisted on speaking to a manager. I let him him know that his line expediter was expediting customers right out the door. He apologized and had his cook make my plate. At this point, the damage was already done."
0,Lately the quality of service at Panda has definitely deminished. I've have been a customer for a long time. When I ask for my plate to be made the way I like it I've been argued with by the employees. Most of the meat is made with alot of vegetables. Therefore when they serve you with the small entree that they give you for meat it seems to always be filled with more vegetables then meat. When I request for them to try not to give me so much vegetables I'm told that I will have a smaller portion of food not more meat. I simply don't understand why you would rather argue with your customer then to satisfy them. Obviously this company has become so big that the quantity of food left in there trays is more important then the quality of service they are giving.
0,Bean and cheese burrito was awful. The beans tasted like the canned beans you buy at the supermarket. \nOverpriced food.  Try Filiberto's instead. Some of them have daily specials running monday thru friday.
0,They serve Pepsi.  Got horribly sick about 30 minutes after I finished my meal.
0,"Just an egg and cheese breakfast burrito, came with random grills scraps.  Just nasty.  Egg tasted like it was cooked with engine oil."
0,"Thought I should update my last experience concerning the volunteering situation at Ballet AZ.  I waited a couple of years and went back and offered my services.  Must have been my instincts because i delayed sending them the paperwork.  Just as well because I was told soon after they \""rescinding\"" their offer to have me do volunteer work with them???  This happened awhile back now, but last I heard the same people are handling that area so doubt if things have changed any.  \n\nYou be the judge"
0,"One of the few places in the area that will deliver.  I thought I would give it a shot.  I ordered a #2 12inch and a large coke.  With a 10% off coupon I had, the total was around $13.50 with tip everything came out to $16.00.  I begin thinking to myself, \""With a Subway and Dilly's Deli next to this place, they better step it up.\""  They said it would take 45 minutes... no problem.  The sandwich came early... great!\n\nThe hot sandwich I ordered was cold and the bottom bread was totally soggy.  My biggest peeve in this world is soggy bread.  The quality of ham is disgusting.  It's slimy and tastes like ham flavoring.  I am not a ham snob by any means, but this is not edible.   For a sandwich that costs this much, they need to use better product.  I was starving when I ordered it.  I ate a few bites and now it's going in the trash.  \n\nI predict that this place won't make it through the summer.  In the summer this place will have to rely on all the local business employees.  People like me who would order food everyday from the same place (if it's good) are the people they will have to rely on.  I know people in my office will never call this place again because they were grossed out by my sandwich and baffled by how much I spent on it.  \n\nI get a limited time to eat lunch...I don't have time to call and complain, have them remake it and try to eat it again.  I'll pretend I just drank a $16.00 soda."
1,"I had to find something to do with my time as I anxiously waited for little Leela wonder puppy to reach the 12 weeks of age required before I could bring her home from the breeder. And since I had already purchased basically every product she could ever need or want, I decided to search for the perfect vet. I researched and interviewed quite a few places before settling on Animal Care Hospital. The fact that it is so close to me was definitely a factor, but I was impressed with this office regardless of location. I wanted to make sure the vet I chose would be a good fit for my Yorkshire Terrier, so I had plenty of questions to ask and Dr. Bishop graciously answered them all. \n\nAnimal Care Hospital has three practicing DVM's on staff, as well as 4 certified veterinary technicians. All 3 vets are members of the AVMA, AAHA, AzVMA and other organizations. Dr. Bishop is the Hospital Director who started the practice in 1973, Dr. Halver has been there since 1981 and Dr. Temple has been here since 2006. They use isofluorane gas anesthesia, which is the safest anesthesia, especially for toy breeds. They also have extensive monitoring equipment is in place during surgery, including EKG, pulse oximeters, respiratory rate, CO2 monitors and equipment to maintain core body temperature. Since almost every dog will be put under at least once to be fixed, it is good to know that they monitor vitals so closely. \n\nFor routine appointments, they schedule a full 30 minutes. Many of the vet offices I spoke to scheduled as few as 10 minutes, or maybe 15, not enough time in my opinion to really get acquainted with me or my dog, or to ask any questions or share concerns. This may seem silly, but the amount of time the vet spends with each animal can make a big difference in their health. \n\nThe vet I saw , Dr. Temple, was flexible. When I asked to deviate from the standard puppy vaccination plan and follow the veterinary protocol recommended by my breeder (a yorkie lover with 20 years experience breeding show and pet yorkies), she was accommodating and even excused herself to go print some info to re-familiarize herself with this particular protocol and permanently place it in Leela's file."
1,"I recently got my little baby pug Penny from a private breeder, so I wanted to take her to a vet and get her checked out. Animal Care Hospital was close to my house, so I figured I would give it a try. \n\nThey were able to see me SAME DAY, which was an awesome treat. I was afraid I would have to wait several days for my new puppy exam and the medical guarantee from the breeder was only good for one week.\n\nAnyways, the vets office was conveniently located, the office is clean, the staff is friendly and everyone was in love with Penny. (it's hard not to be.. I know I am a proud mommy, but she really is adorable!)\n\nI sat down and filled out my paperwork and they took me back right away. The vet, Dr. Temple, was extremely friendly and thorough and answered all my questions. I signed up for the \""puppy package\"" that basically takes you through all of the shots they need for the first few months, wellness exams, fecal test and a microchip and also includes a start up of heartworm preventer.\n\nPenny had her second set of shots the day prior when I purchased her from the breeder, but for some reason Dr. Temple gave her another set. She told me there was nothing to worry about but they didn't charge me, so I think she may have made a mistake. Penny was fine and she told me that it would not cause any problems, but I'm glad that she didn't make a mistake on something life threatening. (This is the only reason I am not giving ACHS five stars.)\n\nWe went back three weeks later for our third set of shots and got in immediately. They were quick, friendly and efficient again and able to provide me with some suggestions on how to curb Miss Penny's biting habits.\n\nThe only issues I have encountered were with the billing. I think that the puppy package confuses the billing girls a little, because both times I went in they had to make adjustments. Not a big deal, they took care of everything and refunded the incorrect amount immediately, I just hope it doesn't keep happening.\n\nOh, another really cool feature is that your pet gets a login and you can keep track of service records through the vet. They have some cool features on the website where you can fill out forms for someone babysitting your pet and you can post pictures and put in information about the diet. I know I lose papers all the time, so its great to have all of Penny's records online where I can easily access them.\n\nThey have awesome hours... so I can get in after work, and the location is convenient for me. They also sell different types of food and hygiene supplies there, so you can pick up stuff for your animal should you need to.\n\nI would definitely recommend this Vet's office to anyone. Knowledgeable and Friendly staff!"
1,"I love Animal Care Hospital. We have two cats and a dog, and they've provided excellent care for all three. One of our cats has been boarded there a few times and I appreciate that I can trust them to take good care of him. \n\nThe dog has gone there after spending the night at the emergency vet and the difference is stark--Animal Care Hospital always makes sure to ease our fears about whatever is going on with our animals and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Well, except for the time the dog got his teeth cleaned and one broken tooth pulled, that cost more than our rent. But still, they did a great job and they made sure that the dog, who is considered senior at age 7, was screened for any complications and I like that they use anesthesia that is considered more safe. (Sorry, I don't really know much about it but they have info in their office about it.)\n\nI do have a pretty strong preference for Dr. Temple vs. Dr. Halver, although they're both wonderful. I think find Dr. Temple to be more engaged and she's extremely willing to answer every single question I have, whereas Dr. Halver isn't always as thorough with my questions. Then again, I ask a ton of questions and he's always provided excellent care, so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to friends.\n\nDr. Temple is also a relaxed person, and she's willing to explore all the possibilities and be up front about how much things are going to cost and what's necessary and what can wait until the cheaper treatment option is given a chance to work. \n\nMy only negative is that I have to agree with a previous review about them pushing the expensive Valley Fever test, that's happened to us too and I really don't think it was necessary since the dog didn't have many, if any, symptoms of having it. They didn't use extreme scare tactics but there was some guilt-tripping going on, but for all I know they're just hyper-aware of the perils of dogs getting Valley Fever. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nOne huge bonus for me is that Joyce, who is almost always the one to answer the phones and make our appointments, is incredibly competent and always puts me in a good mood. She seriously makes my day whenever we go in because she does her job well and treats everyone with such respect, and she's as good with animals as she is with people."
1,I love my pets doctors and staff this animal care hospital is wonderful caring employees kind loving with my pets . I told some of the best girls ever at the Starbucks next door they mentioned my name and the hospital gave them their exam for free with my referral I was shocked when I heard that pleasantly surprised and with that news I will be giving more referrals .  I use this hospital for all my pets and my sons dog too they really are caring when my cat Roenick got hurt and attacked by a dog they were great and very kind and loving with me too as a pet owner . So yes I will say that my pets vet/doctors/ staff are amazing and affordable \nThank you all at animal care hospital you are wonderful
1,"This is my second year being a member of the Phoenix Film Society and my second year attending the Phoenix Fim Festival.  I go with a flex pass so each year I see 4 films.\nThis year, I almost didn't attend because I had a ski accident and was told by the doctor to stay home and rest with my leg elevated before my surgery.\nWell, I got bored and decided to do double headers on the last 2 nights before the festival ended.\nI was able to call ahead and reserve my tkts ahead of time which was a big time saver.  On my way to the theater, a volunteer saw me walking with crutches and walked with me, held the door open for me and even sat with me through the movie to make sure I would be okay.\nIn betwn the movie, a volunteer got a chair for me to sit on so I didn't have to walk far while they cleaned the theater in btwn the movies.\nThe second night was the same.  The volunteers were so nice.  One even adjusted my crutches for me because they were not fitted correctly.  In addition, I sat next to a couple who really empathized with my situation~ the husband had just got done with surgery and rehab.  They told me they would bring me his wheelchair and walker for me to use during recovery and sure enough, the hubby brought it by the other day!\nHere I am glowing about the volunteers at the festival and haven't talked about the festival itself.\n. . . this festival is a year long planning event completely run by volunteers . . . for this to happen, the festival itself has to have a lot of heart,  And any event that has a lot of heart, has to be good.  \nI love movies, I love the Phoenix Film Society, and I love the Phoenix Film Festival.  \nI ask that anyone who has attended the festival and had a bad experience to become a volunteer or a member and once you get to know the directors (volunteers) and what it takes to pull a festival of this scale together, then you can better appreciate the existence of this wonderful festival."

1,Fantastic service from Toma and good eats! Love this place! We will definitely be back.
1,"I love to go to lunch at off times when  they are not so busy. This was the case on Friday.  I had a fantastic coupon and the waiter that rang me up said he would even make me a fresh pot of coffee. I did not even have to ask.  The salad was wonderful! I really liked how fresh every thing was. Soup a bit so so,but they even had tacos and they were really good. It was very nice and clean inside. My waiter brought me lots of fresh coffee, i was very happy."
1,"They really have done a spectacular job with the remodel- they put the luxury back into luxury shopping. The handbag arcade looks so fresh and elegant! I like the cosmetics expansion, and I also dig the mega-mega jewelry section. \n\nIf I could only figure out how to make a few boatloads of cash to purchase some of these wonderfully marketed objects, it would surely be retail heaven."
1,"This store is gorgeous. Clean, nicely laid out, you can see everything, and the people they hire in the departments know their stuff. All employees are friendly and attentive and they treat you like gold. Products are of the highest quality and all the name brands are top-of-the-line. Of course, you get what you pay for."
1,"I absolutely love shopping at Saks 5th Ave in Phoenix!  Kourosh in the ladies shoe department is one of the best client service representatives I have ever had.  He really takes the time to understand the client, make sure you have a shoe that fits your taste, style and ability - I say ability because I once tried on a really high pair of  heels and almost rolled my ankle standing up and Kourosh was right there to catch me, sit me down,  and then insisted on a different style for me :)  \n\nI have always left the store satisfied with my purchases and service. As well the follow up from Kourosh with emails to make sure that I am satisfied has gone well and above my expectations.  I live in Canada and I only buy my Louboutin's and other fine shoes from Kourosh as he truly respects and treats his clients like gold.  One time I showed him a picture of a style of shoes I had seen on line and he searched high and low to find them keeping me in the loop and updated the whole time.\n\nHe makes you feel very welcome, and I highly recommend shopping with him."
1,I went in looking to find nice fragrances for my husband and I.  I was helped immediately with friendly and knowledgeable associates Ramona in Jo Malone and Tina the Chanel brand manager.  They helped me try several men's and women's fragrances in order to find the perfect one.  I also loved that they threw in some samples to try other fragrances for mixing with the Jo Malone or for winter for my husband.  I felt very at ease while shopping and seeing the huge jewelry department only tempts me more!  Also I saw some yummy Marc Jacobs candles while checking out...
1,I'm a LV lover and with the prices so high I am so picky! I've met the nicest most helpful sales associate.  Her name is Carrie.  She's always helpful and is very patient with me.  She's one woman you can call that will go the extra mile in customer service for you!  I love talking and having her help me.  \n\nI purchased my Monogram Pallas in black and she was was very helpful.  It took me almost 3 weeks going back and forth to the store to make my decision.  \n\nMy experience here has been awesome!  I've purchased two bags so far from this location.  I've gotten my wallet hot stamped and it came out great!\n\nThanks for hiring Carrie!  I'd recommend her to everyone heading to this location LV!!!!
1,Best printing service there is! Great customer service and fast turn around time! Would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants high quality printing without emptying your bank account!
1,"I have been sending all of our business printing projects to JC Printing for more than ten years. They provide great prices, excellent service, fast turnaround time and the quality of the finished pieces is perfect. When I need suggestions for maximizing the value of my projects, they are happy to help me get it just right."
1,"I am happy to have found them.   They offer so many services to market my business.  I have always been pleased with the quality.  I rarely give them ample time to get my products shipped to my franchises, but they constantly come through for me."
1,"Cole Haan has always been a trusted brand for me. I have had numerous pairs of dress shoes and years of comfort and style. I was so happy to see the Cole Haan store at the Biltmore. \n\nOkay first let me say that I lived a long time in San Diego so my attire is usually a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops. The Cole Haan store has a more upscale feel to it when you go in. I felt way under dressed as I do a lot of times. Hahahaha. Hey I like comfort. Well you would have never thought I was dressed like a beach bum. \n\nThe sales team was very attentive and helped me find the perfect pair of boots for my girlfriend. Even offered me some water. Nice touch. Found a better deal than the Cole Haans in Macy's. Always a plus. I will be back again."
1,"While I cannot say I have any love for the Biltmore, I do have a lot of affection for Cole Haan no matter where it is located and between the friendly staff, great holiday deals, and top quality shoes I'd be lying if I didn't admit to spending far more time and money at this particular location than I should.  From the Lunargrands to the reflectives and from Wingtips to loafers there is something to be said for any brand that makes shoes that fit with such uniformity and for someone who spends the better part of twelve hours a day on his feet either running or in a professional setting the transferability of CH to Nike is something that cannot and should not be overlooked."
1,"Its a mint to eat here my wife and I used to each here before BC (before children) and its pretty damn wonderful. The wait staff it there for you to wait on YOU. They are excellent, they want you to be happy they want you to have an excellent menu, they want their tip. \n\nIt is the old school-old world eats the steak is so tender you can slice it with a fork the lobster my wife had was massive and excellent. And they will shell it for you, you know how hard it is to get at the meat of these things. \n\nThe wine is excellent and its a wonderful place to visit if you can take out a low interest loan. \n\nOur bill out the door with tip was $310.00 for two people but that was years ago and I know it has not gotten cheaper."
1,"Great selection of steak and seafood. Not a place you go without increasing the limit on that Visa a little. We got the special salad, steak, seafood, 2 sides and dessert. After all was said and done we paid a little less than$200.00 for for an amazing meal and two glasses of wine for two people. It was worth every penny. We both got the Fillet Oskar, crab cakes,  asparagus, mashed potatoes, cheese cake, and the Merlot. It was a cozy 1940's type atmosphere with dim lights and attentive wait staff. It made me feel fancy :)"
1,"Such a great steakhouse! I could not have been more impressed with the experience. \n\nIt started with a knowledgeable bartender that put together a refreshing gin mixed drink and a solid gin martini (I always recommend Hendricks).  \n\nFor dinner, started with the oysters which were very good. For dinner I got the double cut bone in fillet. Talk about an amazing flavor! I really appreciated being able to see an example the cut prior to cooking the meat, very nice touch. \n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake, which was delicious. The server was nice enough to give us a free VIP after dinner cocktail. \n\nI will be going back."
1,"Morton's is the quintessential steak house. While others feel it is a place for the \""good old boys\"", it is none the less, one of the absolute prize steakhouses of the world. Morton's is a chain, and can be found in many countries of the world. I have eaten in many of them ranging from Hong Kong to New York and the food is consistent wherever you choose to go.\n\nDrinks at Morton's are nothing to sneeze at. They are always made with premium brands and are more than adequate for most people. (Their chocolate Godiva martini is to die for!)\n\nA word of warning - all food at Morton's is a la carte, and portions are big. Should you order a tomato as a salad expect to see one of the largest and most succulent tomatoes on your plate, perfectly presented. Morton's has a large assortment of entrees ranging from lobster bisque to shrimp cocktail (not sure if those are shrimp or small lobsters) to tuna tartar, crab cakes and perfect oysters on the half shell. Always remember that portions are huge and you still have the main course coming!\n\nSpeaking of main courses - in a word - unbelievable.\n\nThe portions, once again, are huge, and their meats are all true prime. Your waitperson will wheel a cart of the meats to your table so that you can make your selection. Watch out for that 3 pound lobster - It's alive on the cart and just could nip your finger if you get it too close!\n\nFor a real treat try the porterhouse or the Chicago bone in rib eye. Truly amazing to eat. The prime rib (Friday and Saturday only) are wonderful but if you want it you will need to come early - it's a limited cut of beef at the restaurant - when they run out that's it for the night.\n\nFor lighter fare they also have assorted fish and chicken dishes as well as spectacular lamb chops.\n\nFor sides, try the creamed spinach, the Lyonnaise potatoes, or share a small football sized baked potato.\n\nDesserts are legendary at Morton's. Some like the chocolate souffle must be ordered at the beginning of the meal, but oh are they worth it. The desserts are made with the same care as the entire rest of the meal and are just as fattening! For a change of pace, try their fresh berries - you won't be disappointed and it will help with your waistline. Do plan on bringing a doggie bag (perhaps several doggie bags) home with you.\n\nSanitation is impeccable, and the bathrooms are gorgeous. This is a terrific special occasion place. Valet parking out front.\n\nI rate this a 5 star restaurant. (Expensive but worth every penny)"
1,"Found a great rate on Golf Now - called in and spoke with Brad. He was extremely friendly, courteous, and gave great advice on what course to play. Hole 15 on the Links Course has incredible views and I recommend this course to anyone looking for a great value. One of the oldest courses in Phoenix too!"
1,I am so fortunate to live near this 36 hole course. The Adobe is a more traditional course with forgiving fairways and greens. The Links course encircles the Biltmore homes and will give you a better challenge with awkward lies and elevated tees. The courses can play very slow so you may want to try playing later in the day. You can't beat the rate if you live in the valley and the course is always in great shape for the amount of play. \n\nStaff is extremely friendly and the restaurant offers great food at a reasonable price. I would stay clear of the course on the weekends in the morning. You will play a 5+ hour round.
1,"Came here to buy the lady something sparkly for her finger and was greeted promptly.  The folks behind the counter were super helpful when I needed them, but weren't too up in my grill.  They have some nice stuff that won't cost you a fortune.  Two thumbs up!"
1,Darrell and his staff helped me make the most beautiful custom necklace for my wife  commemorating the birth of our first son.
1,"Great, authentic, entertaining, somewhat scary (Good Fellas, Joe Pesci  scary) Italian joint.  And please rest assured that this reviewer does NOT consider Olive Garden as the standard (I wish we could root those folks out and sign them up to a Yelp for Dummies service)...yes, I'm a freakin' elitist, but what can I say?  I am a foodie, and Italian culture reigned supreme for a millenia.  \n\nThe owner is 100% Italian and runs all over the place making sure all is well.  The wine list is all over the place and mostly phenomenal, very pricey bottles.  We found an excellent Amarone for $60, but you can find some bottles for less.  Wait service was excellent, but totally unpretentious.  This is the real deal folks.\n\nAsk for a pasta sampler plate.  The gnocchi is out of this world.  Escargot was traditionally prepared with butter and garlic, Caprese salad was perfect.  Veal Osobuco with rissoto was out of this world (I usually resist veal as the treatment of the animal is more than I can bare, but man you can hardly go authentic Italian with that attitude!).\n\nHere's the scary part:  There were some mob-looking folks in there, with plastic-surgery wives and fat rings...I could totally picture a scene in the Godfather or Sopranos where someone is dragged down that narrow, long hallway to the bathrooms/back alley by a guitar string wrapped around their neck.  I swear I was peeking around the corner before walking into the bathroom just in case someone had put a hit on my ass!  Luckily I made it out of there alive and very very satisfied.  \n\nSpent $150 for 2 including tip and a nice bottle of wine, and we gourged.  I rarely give a place a 10 unless it's very fine dining, but this place came at it from a different angle and was worth every penny.  Enjoy!"
1,"You will not find a better Italian restaurant in Phoenix than Avanti. Ignore the hype, this place is serious class. The owner meets you at the door and the food is the best Italian around.  I'm Sicilian so I know good Italian food and this is the best Italian restaurant I have found in Az. It is not inexpensive, but you will not be disappointed."
1,This place is awesome!  Service and food is great!!
1,"The first thing that comes to my mind when I walked in was a scene from Scarface. I expected to see Al Pacino sitting waiting for me, but instead I was greeted  by a very nice waiter and then introduced to Angelo. Angelo gave a heartily Italian greeting to my friend and I while he sat us. He alone is a reason to go to this gem of a restaurant.  \n\nWe started off by ordering Escargots De Bygone the garlic butter and brandy wine combination was just right. This was my first time having escargots, and I really enjoyed it. Avanti has set the bar high for others. \n\nFor our main entrees we both ordered a pasta special which included Gnocchi in a white sauce, Penne Pasta in a red sauce, and Two huge Ravioli's with spinach. Each was delicious in it's own way, being savory, and rich without being overpowering. \n\nWe then were treated to a fish, I can't recall the name that was Parmesan crusted with a delicious sauce that was just right. The tenderness of the fish combined with just the right amount of richness from the sauce created a crescendo of flavors that was perfection. \n\nLast but not least we had a desert platter with three delicious deserts, a mango, ice cream sorbet that was amazing, tiramisu which was equally good, and a classic Italian desert I can't recall. It reminded me of lemon bars my mother used to make for my sister and I as a child. \n\nOverall this experience was amazing. I'm still thinking about it and telling my friends. The atmosphere, ambiance, and intimate setting along with outstanding food and service makes this a must see and eat place in my opinion. So many restaurants these days are about group dining, and group experiences, this is a lovely escape from all of that. When you just want an outstanding meal, friends, and good conversation."
1,"This place was amazing.  I went there for lunch today and I can't wait to go back.  I was greeted at the door by Angelo, the owner.  I felt very special and welcomed.  The atmosphere was very intimate.  Kind of reminds you of an East Coast old school Italian restaurant.  \n\nThe trio of pasta was excellent.  My favorite was the gnocchi in Alfredo sauce.  All 3 were fabulous, but the gnocchi was exceptional. \n\nI've already made plans to go back for dinner with my husband.  \n\nI went on Groupon, just to try it out, but I would have gladly paid full price."
1,My new favorite restaurant in AZ. This is the kind of place I have been looking for since I moved here. Real authentic Italian food finally!
1,"I had a turkey sandwich and a fudge sundae.  Mmm mm.  Jerry's is like a good version of Denny's or any of those late night diners.  It was difficult for me to wrap my head around the concept of a 'good' denny's, but their food is actually tastey, their booths are comfortable, it feels like a diner the way it's set up, and they didn't fuck up a sundae.  \n\nOh and I didn't feel sick or gross after eating there AND I saved half my sandwich for later.  Now that's a level of diner food that is deserving of 5 stars!"
1,"Laura the best waitress in the valley is back at Jerry's she is there every night but Sunday and Monday. This place rocks again. The best late night place to go, great food, and with Laura back the best service around, as far as I am concerned every waitress in the world should go and watch her work you could definitely learn a few things. \nIf I were to open my own restaurant this women would be running the show. To the owners and management of Jerry's you better take care of this lady."
1,We have been here for breakfast on many occasions and have never had a bad meal. Recently we tried the all you can eat Friday fish fry and it is wonderful. The clam chowder is excellent.
1,"I don't write many reviews, and I generally don't like letting my favorite secret places out of the bag, but I love linda's on osborn breakfast!  I eat breakfast every weekend, all over the valley, and this is one of my favorite simple spots.  If you want to be at Daily Dose or Breakfast Club (not that the food isn't good there) to people watch and 'be seen', this is not your place.  If you want incredible value and delicious food - jackpot!  As a Texas transplant, this is some of the best chicken fried steak and eggs you will find in AZ (I actually discovered this place after Ranch House Grill burned down). The breakfast potato's are the icing on the cake, best in town hands down, but be careful, they're addictive!  Linda is a very nice, hardworking lady who is always there.  For great homemade food, you will NOT be disappointed!"
1,Friday night all you can eat fish fry....ask for it grilled if you prefer!  Be sure to leave room for the homemade pies.  Chicken pot pie is a must try as well!
1,"Whenever I travel, I obsess about bringing back the perfect regional souvenirs and foodie items for family and friends.  We're living in the Phoenix area for a few months and I wanted to send small and inexpensive Arizona-esque little gifts to my son's preschool class in VA.  The sample sized candies are perfect and they sell them in bulk bags of 30 in the store. The store itself is a hole in the wall, but the gentleman working there couldn't have been nicer.  He gave my kids free lollipops and a student discount on the large order of candy.  And the candy itself is just insanely good."
1,"Case# 25       Food of my childhood\n\nI have been eating these subs since I was a little kid. My mom (R.I.P) used bring me here and it is one of the few childhood memories I hang on to. For those who do not know about this place as the food detective I will share a little background info from my case files to help you out. \n\nMr. Submarine is actually a small chain that really got it's start here in the valley in the early 80's. At one time the locations stretched from the east valley to west phoenix. With increased competition from larger sub chains ( Subway, Cousins, Blimpy, and Quiznos they were forced to limit their growth and use word of mouth advertising to keep customers coming in. This resulted in store closings and now only two locations remain open. When you try and compare a place like this to say a subway which spends big time money to advertise their five dollar foot long special, or their new breakfast sandwich there is no competition. \n\nThis place wins by a mile. Who needs a 5 dollar foot long that is served by some teenager who only cares about his shift ending so he can escape. No, I would rather have the owner there serving me a sandwich that he himself is going to eat for lunch. Don't give me slimy meat and dried out looking cheese. I want soft fresh bread with toppings that enhance the other components of my sandwich not cover it up! OK enough with the ranting, this place is a no frills type of place. No wraps or cookies. They offer the normal meat choices including ham, turkey, tuna and your choice of bread ( white, wheat, and sourdough).\n\nNo annoying jingles or sandwich Nazis (read my subway review), just good food, made and served by someone who cares about what they are selling you.  They are open Monday through Friday 10am to 10pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 8pm.\n\nThey are a little more pricey than Subway but for a great sandwich and great service it is well worth the price.\n\nCase closed"
1,I have been coming to mr. submarine since I was a kid and the location on the west side was still open. I have since moved to California but when I come into town this is a must stop for me. the subs taste the same as they did when I was a kid. I love this place. best submarine place I have ever found!!!
1,"Damn...who's a sexy bitch?\nMy car is. Right after Perry and his team has spent the entire day detailing it.\n\nWhen I bought a black car, I knew I was in for some high maintenance. But it wasn't until a good friend of mine who's a paint/body specialist referred me to Perry and European Detail after some acidic water leaked on my car after someone power washed the top level of my parking garage. \n\nI thought my paint was ruined for sure! I took it to European Detail (at that time, they were located on Indian School) and not only did they get the acid off, they suggested a GLARE product to protect my paint from further episodes...even bird droppings! The product is amazing and my car looked better than it did brand now. It removed all the small swirl marks/scratches. So from that point forward, I frequented European Detail for basic washes.\n\nWhen they moved their location up to the Scottsdale Airpark, I didn't visit as often.  I hit up a few hand wash places here and there in-between my visits to European...but nothing compares (to you!). It wasn't until recently that my car turned 1yr old, and I treated her to a spa day with a full detail. I am a perfectionist to the core, but I think I found my match with these guys. I couldn't find one thing that was missed or annoying. They treated my leather, steamed carpets, engine, you name it. But the difference between European and others is that there was no chemical smell, my seats/floors weren't soaking wet needing to dry (they use the most amazing techniques and products)...I drove away in heaven.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.\n\nI know that Craig Jackson uses European Detail and trusts Perry and his team to keep his cars in top notch shape, that alone speaks a million words. The knowledge of detailing for the team is an art form, not a quick wash/in-out situation.\n\nShockingly, it's only slightly higher in price than what I've paid previously at these corner \""hand-wash\"" places but the results are 1,000 better.\n\nMy vehicle is not only an investment, but I am proud of it. And when I drive away from European Detail I have no doubt I have even more to be proud of because I got the best service and Auto Detail in the Valley. \n\nWhich reminds me, I need to frequent for in-between washes as well - not just details. Thanks for the great service Perry and Team!"
1,"MY JAW HIT THE FLOOR!  These guys are incredible!!  After taking my car to another detailer who left deep swirl marks all over my black Hummer, I was desperately looking for a place who could help me.  OR  I was seriously looking at having to repaint the car.  No other detailer wanted to touch it because they knew how difficult the job would be. Greg and Perry at European first, put me at ease. And then second, gave me my car back not only swirl free, but I felt like i seriously got a new paint job!!! I mean it was better looking than the day I bought it and it looked like i could roll it onto a showroom floor!  As if that wasn't enough, I learned that they hand wash cars by appointment. I live 20 miles away and I will gladly drive that distance to have them wash my car from here on out and for eternity. I will not trust anyone else. I know they handle the Barrett Jackson cars, and I really felt like they treated my car no differently than what they would have done for either Mr. Barrett or Mr. Jackson themselves. \n\nI cant begin to express my gratitude and appreciation for care this business gives to their clients and their cars. I must mention Greg again since I was so impressed at the customer service he provided. Totally professional through and through!!"
1,"stand up guys.  They checked my alignment, basically said I have bad tires and they could align my wheels if I  wanted but wouldn't solve the problem the tires being bad, said there was a deal at costco or they could hook me up with a deal from his friend but advised costco due to their service and if you are traveling there will be a costco and not this local shop to  get serviced for free.\n\nThey didn't charge me anything.   \n\nThey also checked the alignment  manually and not  by computers.  I was  impressed and am impressed  when someone has an old school skill.  Makes the quality of the work better."
1,"Extremely clean Lot and Waiting area.  No wait for my 8:30 AM Appointment which I was 7 minutes late for due to Indian School Construction (Thus avoid EAST BOUND Indian School prior to 16th Street as once you pass 12th Street you are stuck until you route thru the one Right LANE open.  In addition, The City Bus stops a few times which ties the back up further.  I was charged the quoted amount exactly and paid by Credit Card.  In addition, I was informed of a damaged Tire to replace soon.\n."
1,"Great Job Gentlemen! Had them work on both of my vehicles and will gladly go back when ever I need to have work done again. Joel and Ken are very professional, No BS when it came to what needed to be done. Best in Town."
1,"My experience today at Sun Devil auto. Was remarkably wonderful. I started this morning looking for a auto shop to help me with the truck. In my third stop was the Sun Devil auto shop. I am mediately was acknowledged. By the staff. Mr Francisco Torres, ask me what brought me in. I asked if they do a diagnostic in the truck. I also ask him you can do a check on the breaks well I have the truck and the shop. . \n\nI am mediately felt like I made the right choice. The extra care and attention was absolutely high quality coming from the staff member. Mr Francisco into step by step in show me every detail that I needed to know what kind of work the truck need it. I really appreciated that. Mr Francisco is very honest and not making an upsell. I make sure that I was driving safely on the road with a safe vehicle I will definitely keep my interest in the shop for as long as I live here in Arizona. I recommend this shop to all my friends and family honesty is the best policy."
1,Here are some guys who really know their business. Honest and reliable.  My Lexus dealer could not fix the problem - my car still pulled to the right after they did an alignment.  Jacks merely rotated the front tires and the problem was solved.  Why couldn't Lexus do that?  When I asked how much - no charge.  Now you know who the real expert is.  Will need brakes soon and I will go to Jacks for sure.
1,"Amazing!  From start to finish this place was incredible.  Great french host (Mgr?).   Great french waiter, helpful and funny.   The support staff was way above average always, plates cleared and drinks filled in a timely manner. \n\nI REALLY like the fact they don't rush you and try to flip tables, we were there about two hours. \n\nThis is a quaint little stand alone restaurant that also has a small bar and a few tables out on the patio.  I'll be back soon just to visit these areas.   \n\nWe started with a nice bottle of french wine.\n\nFor the appetizer:\n\nBrie en Croute\nCreamy Brie coated with toasted almond slivers and\nwrapped in puff pastry, then baked, served with toasted\nbaguettes and port reduction \n\nThe main courses:\n\nPoitrine de Porc Provencale\nPan roasted pork tenderloin crusted with herbs d'provence\nand served with sweet corn and goat cheese polenta fritters,\nsauteed pea tendrils with grape tomatoes and leek fondue\n\nAnd...\n\nCoquille Saint-Jacques a la Sophie\nPan seared Sea Scallops served over sauteed ricotta gnocchi\nwith a citrus and shaved fennel baby arugula salad\nfinished with tarragon beurre blanc\n\nFor Desert:\n\nRaspberry Brulee\nChambord soaked fresh raspberry\ninfused in vanilla creme brulee\n\n----- I need to get creative and come up with more birthday's, anniversary's, holidays, or some other random reason to splurge on a place like this more often."
1,"This is easily the BEST RESTAURANT i have ever been to\n\nI love french food, and this is the very best I have ever had. Amazing service (the owner is such a nice guy), amazing service and the atmosphere is cozy and romantic (perfect for a date).\n\nI agree with some of the other raters-- this place would get 10 stars if yelp would let me put 10. Try the duck and the beef bourguignon!"
1,"Dottsy Z. and I met here last week to try their new happy hour and we had an amazing time! The weather was perfect, the patio beautiful, and the company was amazing.\n\nTheir happy hour menu featured a nice variety of white and red wines, all for $6, plus we tried the escargot, pate, and frites as well. We spoke to chef, who was very knowledgeable and able to accommodate gluten free items, especially if you call a day or two in advance. \n\nWe topped off the night with a decadent creme brulee and imported cocoa dusted truffles, which capped off the evening on a perfect note."
1,"My husband and I went to Sophie's for a date night and were very happy with the results.  I have the Beef Bourguignon and it was outstanding.  We were told it takes 3 days to make the sauce.  My husband ordered the duck confit, which he enjoyed.  I'm not a fan of the ducky flavor myself.  We also followed the suggestion of ordering the warmed brie app.  De-lish!  The service was great as well.  Little touches like asking if we would like our milk warmed for our post-meal coffee.  So great!  We will for sure be going back for future date nights!"
1,"At 40 years old, I discovered after a consultation with an orthodontist that not only would I need braces , again (I wore them in high school as well), but that to prevent further erosion of some of my teeth and have a proper bite, I would likely need surgery to move my upper jaw forward, and to widen it to correct a crossbite. My orthodontist referred me to two surgeons, one of them being Dr. Reed Day. \n\nI visited Dr Day's office and was very impressed with the professionalism of the staff and the way that I was treated by Dr. Day.  Within a few minutes of interacting with him I knew this was the doctor I wanted for my surgery.  He clearly explained the kind of operation I would need (a Lefort Osteotomy), and while I was there he also diagnosed me has having a deviated septum.  The deviated septum had made it difficult for me to breath through my nose, and likely contributed to the underdevelopment of my upper jaw. Correcting my deviated septum was added to the surgical plan.\n\nAfter my initial consultation with Dr Day, I started my braces treatment, and about a year into wearing braces, I had my jaw surgery on Nov 4, 2013.  I met with Dr. Day two times prior to the date of the surgery to go over preparations for the surgery, what to expect the day of the surgery, and what to expect in the days and weeks after the surgery.  His professionalism and demeanor really put me at ease.  I had no worries going into the surgery.  My friends would ask me if I was nervous, and my response was, no way, I'm excited to get this done, can't wait.  \n\nOn the day of the surgery, Dr. Day came by to talk to me about an hour or so before my scheduled surgery to see how I was doing.  The surgery took no more than 1.5 hours.  Afterwards, as I came out of my sleep, I was a bit disoriented but did not have any pain.  In fact, not once did I take pain medication following the surgery, ever.  I saw Dr. Day immediately following the surgery, and the next morning before I was released from the hospital.  \n\nExactly ONE week after the surgery, I was back in the office, putting in a 7 hour day, and worked pretty much a 40 hour work week.  There was residual swelling as expected, but the swelling reduced as each day went by.  The liquid diet isn't that bad.  I'm now just over three weeks into my recovery and I feel fantastic. My orthodontist is also very pleased with the results and amazed at my recovery.  \n\nNot only has my recovery been amazing, but I can finally breathe easily through my nose, due to the correction of my deviated septum.\n\nI have nothing but positive things to say about Dr. Day and his staff.  I would recommend them to anyone requiring oral surgery.  \n\nLastly, I was a bit surprised to see others in this forum refer to Dr. Day as arrogant.  I didn't detect this trait at all.  I would say that he is highly confident in his abilities, but this is EXACTLY what I want from a surgeon who is going to remove my entire upper jaw and then reattach it.  If you want someone who is highly trained, qualified, and possesses the confidence to do a great job, then I strongly recommend consulting with Dr. Day if you require oral surgery."
1,"I traveled from Michigan, seeking the best team of dentists to remove a failing implant and replace a front tooth that had to be extracted in 2009. I am fortunate in that I can travel for what I have researched and feel is the best dental care possible.\nI have had three procedures completed in Dr. Day's office since September 2012. I've been in his office possibly seven times in the last 15 months. Every time I've been in his office I was always greeted cordially by his staff. My appointment times that were scheduled never were late. Dr. Day's office is on time. Offices I had been to in Michigan sometimes let me sit and wait for over 60 minutes beyond the scheduled appointment time. Dr. Day himself always greets his patients. Once when I was waiting to see him, I could hear his assistant begin to brief him on my case and he quickly replied that he knew my case history clearly. Dr. Day prepares for his patients.   \nHe truly cares about his patients' comfort level while undergoing a procedure. I never was in any pain or discomfort during any of the procedures in Dr. Day's office. \nEvery time I've had a procedure completed, (implant removed, implant placed, gum adjustment) the healing has gone smoothly. I have never left his office and subsequently gotten an infection or had any other complications post-surgery. \nI am a musician and I look forward to getting back to playing my flute, piccolo and oboe.

Dr. Day and his staff are 100% professional, confident and sincere. \nUnfortunately, I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and I can't recommend him to too many friends and family due to the 2,000 miles between his office and my home, but I have let the dozen or so friends I have in Phoenix know he is the oral surgeon to see.  Dr. Day and his colleague Dr. Chal have ended nearly six years of dental misery and for that I am forever grateful. \nSusan S."
1,"I was diagnosed with TMD over 20 years ago and required jaw surgery back in 1993 by another surgeon. It didn't work, and after 20 years of major headaches, neck aches, facial pain, jaw pain and a shifted bite, I am FINALLY on the road to recovery! I have seen 8 Oral Surgeons through the years and Dr Day was the one to properly identify my issues and fix my jaw. I found Dr Day because I got two high recommendations from two other local Oral Surgeons that said my case was so complicated, and Dr Day was the only one who could conduct the type of surgery I needed.  Dr Day was brilliant and he explained everything very thoroughly and has been caring and compassionate every time we meet. Additionally, his staff, including his medical assistants, front desk personnel, surgical nurses, and his financial aid person have been very professional and always treat me with respect. Finding Dr Day and his Team of professionals, have been a major blessing to me and my husband.  I cant thank them enough! Highly Recommend!!!!!"
1,"Dr. Day and his assistant, Danielle, were excellent with my tooth extraction.  He came in, sat down, introduced himself and explained the procedure.  He talked to me during the procedure about what he was doing and how it was going and Danielle held my hand.  They were on time, and the bill was explained to me beforehand.  A terrific office.  As good an experience I can expect from having a tooth pulled.  Thank you."
1,"I'm finding these other two reviews to be very strange considering the experience my fiance and I had here.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say they've made some internal changes for the better, since the other reviews are 3 and 5 years old.\n\nThis place is wonderful.  The staff, the doctor - they are talented and completely comforting and warm individuals.  My fiance is the biggest baby when it comes to anything medical (the poor guy needs Xanax just to have his blood drawn, so when it came time for him to have his wisdom teeth out, no ifs, ands, or buts about it, this is where we were recommended to go.  I called our personal dentist and was informed that Dr. Day is one of the best oral surgeons in the state, which had me sold since my dentist (Dr. Mow) is pretty awesome.\n\nNot only were they able to put my fiance at ease, but surgery was completed within 15 minutes, everything went smoothly, and after we returned home they were completely available for any questions we had.\n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Day and his staff - they're super nice."

1,"By far, the best Gentleman's Club in Phoenix.  The girls here are gorgeous.  It is a little pricier than some of the other places, but the eye candy is the best.  \n\nHave fun other weary travelers!"
1,"Having not been to a strip club in awhile, I had a blast with clients at Phoenix's most famous gentlemen's club.  $10/cover and $10/lap dances with friendly, gorgeous, well mannered entertainers made the night go way too quickly.\n\nHighlights include a pair of Parisian identical blonde twins and a Brazilian angel who looked like she belonged on the cover of Vogue."
1,"We are new to Yelp so I have never left a review, but it has been so helpful to us in the recent past, I feel compelled to start. \n\nI'm new to the neighborhood, so a good Chinese restauraunt is an important find. I was really happy with our experience with China Village the other night. We've been doing a lot of take out lately, and it's been hit and miss ( except with my Yelp leads), but the whole experience was satisfying. We called at 9:30pm and yet the food was  fresh and the gal was very friendly. We just had basic Beef Brocolli, Lemon Chicken, Sweet/Sour Pork & Chicken Fried Rice, but it was very satisfying. And when I asked for hot mustard, they gave us the good stuff in little cups, not packets.  Their dishes have a distinct flavor that is very good, not overwhelming at all, but not just the same old..."
1,"Ok First time here today, Food was awesome staff was way cool and the lady that processed my credit card was hilarious lil old lady haha this is definitely the closest to NY - NJ Chinese i have had in a while im definitely going back to this place when i want food on the go Thanks China Village"
1,"5 stars for customer service. This is our go-to place for Chinese take-out after having tried a bunch of places in our area. The food is consistent, standard Chinese-American, always hot, with fresh veggies. \n\nTonight, though, I was prompted to write a review. I am vegetarian and my husband is a little picky, and as such I made asked for some substitutions to our order. I ordered Mooshoo vegetable with no egg (my preferece) and veggie fried rice with added tofu and no mushrooms (hubbie's preference after finding a rogue mushroom last time). Also ordered a few other items.\n\n5 minutes later, China Village called back to double-check that I also didn't want egg in the fried rice since I had asked for it in the mooshoo. I thanked him for asking, and no, we did not want any egg in the rice. \n\nI went to pick up the order, and the sweet little lady at the counter told me that that also made sure to take the mushrooms out of our soup, since she was worried that we couldn't eat mushrooms and didn't want us to worry about finding them. \n\nThey did not have to pay such close attention to details, and I wouldn't have complained if none of these things had occurred. But because they went the extra mile, my appreciation was far greater than my dissatisfaction would have been. \n\nSupport this place and show them that customer service still means something!"
1,"Not so hidden gem indeed!  Flashback to 1980?  Right.  Fantastic service? Check!  What is better than drinking zombies and letting the sweet sounds of Billy Ocean flow over you?  Killing Zombies or actually being by the ocean.  But alas we are in a parking lot in 115 degree heat in Phoenix Arizona.\n\nChina Village is wonderful, one of the few places I would take an out of towner to.  Always solid food and prices.  Have not been let down yet!  Go China Village!  Woohoo! As good as it gets!      \n\n\n(in phoenix Arizona)"
1,"Place has been here for decades. I've never had a bad meal here, and the wait staff are very very friendly. The food is excellent and they have the best hot and sour soup I've ever had!"
1,"Really enjoyed this place. Great food and friendly staff. Food was great! The sweet and sour pork was crispy and the sauce was delightful! My favorite part of the night was devouring the Ragoons. They had such an amazing flavor to them! \n\nGood price, Good food, Good people!"
1,"of course this place has the best and coolest kitchen stuff. a stop on our Elite Yelp event, we were treated to a miniature cooking demo with some of their products. the chefs were funny and very personable. they cooked up some pies and pizzas for the group. \n\ni do like browsing. it's a bit out of my budget (sorry honey, i know you love kitchen gear). something i didn't know about williams sonoma....they host artisan and technique classes....and even will show you how to use a real chefs knife for free if you are like me and normally use whatever is handy to chop things.\n\na great shop, great products, great service."
1,"This store has the most beautiful kitchen items and is jam-packed with artisan goodies to make our home cooking easier. You immediately start thinking of how you can justify buying something. I'll make spring form-tarts every weekend! I can use these red placemats for at least 3 holidays! I need a better mixer to handle all the produce from our garden! \nAlso, I had no idea that they offer free cooking demonstrations and will teach you how to hold a knife properly or how to chop an onion? On this trip they were demonstrating pizza making 101 using their artisan dough mix, along with fresh toppings, in their pizza maker! They also have a fantastic mini pie maker that utilized some of their pie dough and filling and made mini pies in 7 minutes!! Sure they are highlighting their products, but they also tell you variations of use with your own homemade ingredients as well. \nThe staff was wonderful! Upbeat and friendly, it makes shopping here even more fun!"
1,"Found Framing' Works on Yelp...  Shop was tricky to find but once there all was good.  Alan was great to work with...patient while trying to put the perfect mat and frame together for my husband's Christmas gift.  A few weeks out, I was worried I'd left the project too late to get it back in time, but Alan said it would be done.  It was done quickly and beautifully!  Will definitely go back!"
1,Was referred by a family member a few years ago and they have never disappointed. Allen has always gotten my holiday framing projects done on schedule and at the highest quality. They've even coached me through sizing and canvas issues when I've enlarged photos all of which have turned out great. Take a look for yourself...
1,They met my tight time line for two dresses i needed on the weekend. even called and gave me the time i could pick them up. very efficient and friendly bunch.
1,"beautiful hotel, a lot of family noise by the beautiful pool\nthe room was huge and very nice, the air conditioner system wasn't the best but i would  recommend it, really nice people, entire staff from the driver to the bell boy and a great front desk crew, june 2011, and the continental breakfast was amazing amazing amazing, the best so far"
1,"I am staying here on a business trip right now. I was initially put off by the obviously very old hotel, however they've made up for it by having clean rooms, updated decor, friendly staff and an awesome happy hour and continental breakfast. \n\nThe complimentary breakfast is cooked to order so you may as well be at a restaurant with all that you can order. Happy hour at Squaws Peak Cafe, the only room on the fifth floor, is free bud light and shock top on tap as well as a few select wines, pretzels, fruit and Rice Krispie treats. \n\nThe staff has all been professional, friendly and super helpful. Our business meetings are taking place here and they have been more than accommodating in making sure everything goes off smoothly. They have also arranged dinner reservations and transportation for us at off site locations.\n\nRecommend :)"
1,"An absolute must for all Orthodox Christians or for those fascinated by monastic life. This is the only Greek Orthodox monastery in North America and founded by a living saint, Father Ephraim. I drove from Los Angeles, but people come from all over the world to stay as a pilgrim at this monastery. The 45 or so monks living here run a tight ship keeping the holly grounds in tip top shape. It's immaculate, with lush gardens, fountains, and gazebos. They've turned the place into an oasis in the middle of a hot ,dry cacti ridden desert. \n\nThere are several chapels within the monastery and one major church where most of the magic takes place. Most of the furniture and icons are brought in from Mt. Athos, considered one of the most holly places for Greek Orthodoxies. Sadly, no women are allowed on Mt. Athos. But that's besides the point. Women must wear long skirts and wear a mandili or scarf to cover their hair, basically do not show any skin. Men must wear long sleeve shirts and pants. \n\nYou can visit for the day or stay overnight as a pilgrim. If you are a pilgrim you can stay from 1 -10 days. You must attend all services, which means the big one from 1:45 AM to 4:00 AM every night. The first night I went at 1 AM and was able to kiss Father Ephraim's hand. After the night morning service, there is a breakfast of freshly baked bread (the monks bake like crazy), large and small bitter green olives from the olive orchards grown on the grounds, 2 types of halva, jam, nuts, fresh fruit from their orchards and coffee. This is a typical fasting breakfast (no animal products). After breakfast you go back to bed for another 3 hours of quiet time. Walking back to my room at 5 AM was beautiful. The desert stars and moon are bright, casting shadows on the cacti and the air is cool and fresh. In the day you are pretty much free to roam. Lunch is served at 11:30 AM and there is no talking aloud, except for a monk reading a chosen bible passage in Greek. When they ring the bell, you are allowed to pour water. A typical fasting lunch that I had consisted of braised green beans with calamari, fresh bread, olive, salad, and Greek macaroni. After lunch you can try to get a blessing from Father Ephraim, go to the book store, talk to some monks or other pilgrims. Another mandatory service is Vespers at 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM and afterwards dinner is served. After dinner is the last mandatory service. And then you are ready to go to bed at 7:30. No joke. I fell asleep before quiet hours even - I was feeling extremely peaceful and happy, yet exhausted. \n\nI will be back to the monastery with my dad. I was lucky to stay two nights with profoundly holly people and have an incredible experience."
1,"I visited this monastery with my in-laws recently.  We had heard about it from my bro-in-law and so we decided we'd visit on a Saturday afternoon ... we drove to Florence from Chandler and were surprised to find such an oasis in the desert.  This place really makes you feel like you're somewhere else - the beautiful buildings, the greenery, the peace you feel when you enter the monastery.. we were delighted to have taken the recommendation to visit.\n\nI had very respectable clothing (pants, long sleeve shirt), but they required women's head to be covered and a skirt to be worn, so they were kind enough to lend us elastic skirts that I just put over my pants.. and I found a scarf in the car - presto, ready to go!\n\nThe staff there is very friendly in the gift shop and they have wonderful treats and gourmet items for sale that are made from the gardens there and made by the ladies and gentlemen living a monastic life there... got some wonderful tea and delicious baked goods.\n\nWalking through the site was, again, peaceful and made you feel you were not in Arizona.  We enjoyed ourselves and I would recommend this place for adults (children make a lot of noise and it's very peaceful here) that appreciate these sorts of experiences .. nice day trip."
1,"Sun Valley truly does rock!\nBoth in quality service and products as well as displaying character and integrity in their business practice.\nI wanted to upgrade my factory head unit by adding aftermarket speakers and an amp... Ryan was very helpful and made recommendations based on my budget... Made an appointment and took the car in... The folks at the desk picked up the speakers and amp that was going to be installed, gave me a little more info to be sure where we were going and by the time I turned around my car was back in the bay... \nAfter killing a couple hours (short of the time they told me it would take...) I strolled back in and John approached me and told me there had been some kind of manufacturer's defect that he had never seen before and explained the options I had to address the situation. John said he assumed all responsibility for the problem and would absorb any cost to make things right. \nTo sum it up... the folks at Sun Valley acknowledged there was a problem, (and ultimately they could have rigged it so I would never have known there was a problem) made it a priority, and took care of it in a satisfactory and very timely manner. \nThe name brand components they recommended did indeed fulfill the objective I was looking for at a price about 25% lower than any other estimates I got. \nBottom line... I am very happy with the sound in my car now, and was pleasantly surprised to do business with an honest and conscientious group of people. \nAny future car stereo needs I have will absolutely be directed to this long time Valley company and I recommend them without reservation to anyone needing anything car stereo related."
1,I chose this place based on the great reviews on Yelp and my experience was exactly as expected. I brought my BMW 535 to them for a custom amp install and it looks and sounds great. Highly recommended.
1,"I recently went in to have them install a JL Audio 700/5 amp with a JL Audio 10\"" sub. I was so satisfied with the work that I went in the following day to have speakers installed. The staff was very helpdful and they don't just look to sell you anything. I plan on going back to have a remote start installed. I would recommend this place to anyone!!"
1,"I've been getting my old car fixed up and one of the things I decided to do was replace the blown speakers in the back. I found Sun Valley Stereo on Yelp and all of the great reviews are true. They recommended a pair of Pioneer Speakers that were reasonably priced and told me they could install them in about an hour. Actually, they were done in less than 45 minutes and once again my stereo sounds great.\n\nIf you need me, I'll be the guy with my windows rolled down, cranking the tunes!"
1,"The gang at Sun Valley Stereo is definitely top notch. Ryan gets right to the point and saw what I was interested in, and we worked together to verify that all the parts were in to upgrade my 2004 RX-8 with a Pioneer 4000NEX touchscreen and back-up camera before I drove 90 minutes for the work. When I first left there was some adjustments needed. They took me back in without hesitation and made everything right. The installer was committed to treating my car like it was his own. He took the extra steps to make it all right, and even fixed the hatch door to my 12-volt socket. Now that's going the extra mile! 6-stars!"
1,"Although I have only lived here for a year and a half now, I must say I still enjoy residing at the Verandas. We just got a new property manager, Nate, and he seems to have picked things up where Jen had left off rather smoothly. He has answered my questions promptly since I am currently transitioning to a different apartment within the complex. Nate has also been accommodating to both myself and Bryan, which I greatly appreciate his assistance with. He has an approachable demeanor, is to the point, and seems to be eager to get things done.\n\nI wish Jen the best in her new position within the company and hope for things to continue to go well here since we are also soon to lose one of the maintenance staff, John, who has been awesome. Thus far though, MC in my experience has had great staff; I look forward to the future here and am curious what Nate will bring to the table.  I hope he will continue the great communication and community that has been here at this place!"
1,"TOO bad Barb's is located on the way to my son's school...I get into SOOO much trouble here.  \n\nBarb's has been doing my family's birthday cakes for years and they never disappoint.  Great staff and it seems they can do anything!!  the best carrot cakes and red velvet cupcakes.  \n\nyes,  all goodies are sweet...and YES the icing is thick and sugary..but, this is how pastries,cakes, and cookies should be!!  I give out their seasonal decorated cookies to friends and I always get props for being the the \""best friend ever\""!"
1,"There's not much more to say than has already been said, so I'll be brief.  Barb's is such a great bakery.  Their cupcakes are eye candy and taste even better than they look.  If you're a fan of red velvet, please be sure to try one of theirs - they are wonderful!  When they haven't sold out, Barb's decorated sugar cookies are awesome.  The cookie itself isn't very sweet, but the icing more than makes up for that.  Enjoy!"
1,"I finally had the chance to have a piece of cake from Barb's Bakery and although the five pounds I gained from the cake hate me, my sweet tooth thanks me for finding yet another fabulous Phoenix bakery! Holy moly. If you are a fan of cake and cake that's soft, moist, sweet, creamy and perfect all in one bite, this is your spot. \n\nBarb's is an adorable bakery with a storefront full of everything from cupcakes and pastries to donuts and cookies. But it's her cake that gets her the five stars in my book. My youngest nephew (2 months) just celebrated his baptism and so of course that called for a celebration. I told my sister about Barb's so she grabbed the cake from there and brought it to the party. I could have started and ended with just the cake it was so good. \n\nThe cake was the perfect size for our group and they did a wonderful job of decorating it in honor of the baptism with white and blue frosting, his name, date and blue crosses. It was a three layer chocolate with vanilla frosting cake. I originally asked for a sliver but when I saw how delicious it looked, I opted for a normal size piece instead. Is it bad that I consumed every last crumb in under five minutes? I don't think so at all. I would do it again in a heartbeat! \n\nSo with that, I'm officially adding Barb's Bakery to my list of sweet spots."
1,"Barb's Bakery...they epitomize what the local community feel is all about. It's like stopping by an old friend's house or having your childhood best friend's parents make you breakfast. They are extremely friendly, their prices are great, and their donuts are needed on a cheat day. You can't leave this place without a smile. Cheers to Barb's for doing things the right way."
1,"OH MAN!! I am seriously addicted to their Pink Champaigne Petit Fours (TO DIE FOR!!!), and their frosted sugar cookies are a big hit around the office! I haven't gotten anything here that hasn't been fantastic! One of the best tiramasus I've had in a long time, and their cupcakes rival Sprinkles all day long!\n\nAlong with the delicious treats and beverages comes generally GREAT customer service, the gentlemen that work in the afternoon are super friendly and helpful! I did, unfortunately, have one bad experience with the woman they have working there Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, she was not pleasent or welcoming in any sort of way, and honestly made me feel like I was rather inconveniencing her by being there. I was SO shocked by the whole experience since I've been going in pretty regularly for a couple months now and had never had anything negative to say, until then. I remember thinking, \""Geez, I sure hope that's NOT Barb, and if it is, perhaps she's best suited for strictly baking...in the back...as far away from customers as possible!\"" LOL\n\nSo, I do definitely recommend Barb's for cake and cookie lovers alike, you will DEFINITELY score big points with friends, family and co-workers!! Although, I would encourage all my sweet toothed brethren out there to not go Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, so as to avoid the cracken, she's just awful! Bon Apetit!!"
1,"LOVE their decorated sugar cookies.  They are always colorful and festive for the appropriate season or holiday.  Most importantly, they are yummy!"
1,Best. Cupcakes. Ever.\n\n\nThat is all.  Carry on.
1,"One of my vendors uses this bakery a lot for gifts. I have had several of their sugar cookies and let me say, they are THE BEST sugar cookies I've ever had, ever. They're moist, sweet, and simply melt in your mouth with goodness."
1,"Barb's bakery was wonderful. They emailed me promptly with estimated quotes prior to scheduling our tasting. They asked us what design we were interested in, as well as flavors. We tasted three cakes and fillings, and left feeling comfortable that our cake would be exactly what we wanted. Their pricing is exceptionally reasonable - for $3.50/slice you have so many amazing options to choose from. Our cake was chocolate with a raspberry butter cream filling, and a butter cream frosting. They did decorative scroll work and ribbon on our three-tier cake, and delivered it. It not only looked amazing, it tasted amazing. Everyone raved about it. We would absolutely use them again."
1,Must try - Pink Champagne Cupcake
1,"Pros: Don't miss the frosted sugar cookies or the ooey gooey cake! \n\nCons: Few parking spots, run down neighborhood, and sometimes they run out of the stuff I like before I can get there."
1,"I've been in love with Barb's since I had them create an amazing cake creation for Make-A-Wish Foundation's 20th birthday 13 years ago. Consistently over the years they have never failed to disappoint. The best cupcakes around... adorable and delicious sugar cookies and the pastries... to die for!  I was just there yesterday and bought some petit-fours... for me! And no, I'm not sharing with anyone! Barb's is pure evil yummy goodness..."
1,"By far the best bakery I've been to!! I took some cupcakes and a couple of their cheesecakes to the office, they were gone in an instant!! Everyone loved them! Great staff too!"
1,"If happiness was an art form, it would be Barb's Bakery. The cupcakes are adorable and delicious! Everyone at work demands Barb's for meetings, birthdays, ect. The cupcakes are a regular at every family event. Thanks for being so amazing Barbs! You rock! :-)"
1,"Ordered a carrot birthday cake for my friend last week. Absolutely incredible!!! Everyone who ate it agreed. Now, I must mention that I'm a cake snob. I've eaten cake/cupcakes from Tammie Coe, Kick Ass Kakes, Treehouse, LGO and the list goes on. Barb's Bakery is nothing short of amazing in my humble opinion. This was the best carrot cake I have ever eaten. Super moist, full of carrots and walnuts, perfect amount of sweetness. Cream cheese frosting was perfect. If you need a cake for any reason, I can almost assure you, Barbs will not disappoint."
1,"The best cake, cupcakes and cookies in town. Will use for all future events. Thank you Barbs!"
1,"I ordered an 8\"" round chocolate cake with chocolate mouse and cream cheese frosting for my mother in law's 70th birthday cake. I asked to have \""happy birthday, sue\"" written on it. I had no idea that it would be so beautiful. White with very  pretty roses that had a hint of chocolate coloring on them and a band of chocolate on the bottom and chocolate writing. And it tasted delicious. Exactly what I wanted.. Moist and flavorful. I could not have been happier a"
1,"My fiance and I went to Barbs after being significantly underwhelmed by other bakeries in the valley.  I had been familiar with Barbs from cakes that had been ordered for birthdays at a previous company, and from the Petit Fours I'd pick up on days when I needed an extra special treat. \n\nOur venue had originally sent us to Honeymoon Sweets in Tempe, which we had a terrible experience at.  Our ideas were shut down at every turn as \""out of our budget\"" or \""not possible\"" and we left Honeymoon Sweets feeling deflated and like we'd have to compromise on our cake.   Not happy with the experience, we reached out to our venue to ask about other options.  We were asked what bakery we would like to use, and Barbs Bakery immediately came to mind.\n\nWe scheduled a tasting with Barbs and from the moment we were welcomed into the little shop, what a difference!  We had a great experience!  They prepared four different flavor combinations for us which we had requested, and sat down with a partnership mentality to work with us to design a cake that came within our budget, incorporated our ideas, and made us feel like we would get the cake of our dreams.  Instead of hearing \""no\"" or \""that won't work\"" from the owner David, we heard, \""that's a great idea!  Here's how we can make that work . . .\""\n\nWe absolutely LOVED the cake that was delivered to our venue, and we received rave reviews from guests.  If you are considering a cake from Barb's, do it!!\n\n~ The Bride"
1,"I'll be honest straight of the bat, I'm biased when it comes to this Borders, but this store has regrouped and begun anew! With better discounts than ever before and an in-stock guarantee, there's no way you could leave empty handed! Plus there have been some amazing events lately including free performances by the AZ Opera and Phoenix Symphony! Famous profiles have been booking their signings there too including Giuliana and Bill Rancic, Dr. Charles Stanley, and Mitt Romney."

1,"It isn't well known but each Manuel's is owned by one of the children of the original owner- the best one is on Peoria, that is one that you hear good things about."
1,Great food...been eating here for thirty plus years. Food has the same top quality since I started eating here. Like family here....love the food! Best Mexican food!
1,Food is always good never had bad food. Service is good for the most part its very seldom that it is not good. But everyone has a off day. Wish the prices were not so high.
1,I wasn't sure what to expect but nicely surprised!!! Awesome margaritas and the three enchilada dinner was amazing!   And so reasonably priced!  New favorite Mexican!!!
1,"I've been to a number of car washes in this town, and Lindstrom's is the finest. As a self-professed neat freak and perfectionist, I can assure you that your car will be well-groomed at Lindstrom's.\n\nThey are not in the habit of upselling and pressure tactics - just pressure washing. They are friendly, willing to accommodate my needs, and clean without frills. I have been coming to their car wash for some years, and continually come back (even when I stray, wash my own car or pick one of those gas station car washes on the fly). \n\nLindstrom's seems a little sad these days, and emptied. Not sure if it has to do with the recession, the brutally hot Phoenix summer or the recent raid on their service staff by the Sheriff's office for \""identity theft\"". But, whatever the case, Lindstrom's provides a superior service, and is a local business, and for those two reasons alone, please frequent this establishment. Your car will thank you."
1,"I pulled into Lindstroms after a truck dumped a 5 gallon tub of white paint in the street in front of me during rush hour, coating half of my (dark gray) Honda Element. It was dry upon arrival and all over the right side of my car. They checked it, said they could fix it, told me how they would do it and how long it would take. I enjoyed a shoe shine while I waited in their welcoming facility, and they kept me apprised along the way. The end result was perfect and at a very reasonable price. Check them out, they have earned a new loyal customer (and I live in Peoria!)."
1,Super friendly and a great wash/vacuum for not a ton of money.
1,"I went to Lindstrom's car wash today for the first time, and had a great experience!   Just got the basic wash, but they did an awesome job! Not to mention prices are cheap compared to other car washes I've been to.  \n\nI don't usually \""expect\"" amazing customer service from places such as a car washes, however, I was blown away by Lindstrom! The young lady working at the desk was very talkative and friendly, and I didn't receive any pressure about extra ridiculous add-on's that other car washes most definitely always pitch.  The owner was there in and out checking on customers and his employees, he was super easy going and catering, told me if I had any concerns in the future to contact him and he'd take care of it!  AND listen up ladies... all Wednesday's are ladies night and you get $2 off!  \n\nOverall, super impressed and I will be coming back!  See ya later Danny's car wash!"
1,Went in for a quick wash and to shampoo the carpet and mats and got just that! They did a really old job on both for the $40 Carpet Express. Not a bad deal! The gentlemen there were very polite and checked on me periodically as I waited. It was about 45 minutes but my mats and floors were pretty dirty so I appreciated them doing a thorough job.
1,"Tragedy has truly struck in my life.\n\nI have been to this Loehmann's location once since moving to AZ about a year or two ago and then my car stopped working. Finally I fixed my car this week and couldn't wait to get to Loehmann's. I gleefully made the trip and devoted an entire day to shopping at one of my favorite stores in the world. \n\nAlas, as I drove into the oddly busy parking lot (I feared maybe they were having a mega sale and I was left out!) I looked toward the store only to cast my eyes upon a ripped down sign, darkened shuttered windows and locked doors. This Loehmann's has closed, and they never even told me even though I'm in their insiders club!\n\nI quickly parked my car and ran up to the doors to see if there was any note or trace as to when they closed or why. I'm sure I made a true spectacle of myself as I peered in and cried in agony to myself... almost with tears streaming from my cheeks. There is truly no justice in the world today.\n\nI suppose that they closed because nobody here really knows about Loehmann's like they do in the east and plus they were in a really strange area. It's true that this Loehmann's probably wasn't quite up to par with the ones in NYC (But how could you possibly compare them?) But they still had plenty of terrific things and I bought a ton of stuff when I came here. Looks like now I'll have to book a flight back to NYC just to go shopping at my favorite store again.\n\nLoehmann's, you will be missed terribly here!"
1,"One of the best steak restaurants in the city. I have consistently been treated to top shelf food and service here. I prefer the Indian Bend location, though the Camelback spot is convenient for business dinners.\n\nSorry to hear about Sarah's misadventure, I have not yet tried their seafood -- Ruth's Chris is all about premium aged steaks to me."
1,"This was the first time I had been to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, the food lived up to the expectations I'd heard from others.  The portions were good and the items came at the right time.  I did not feel rushed in any way and our waiter, Jimmy, did an excellent job answering every question we had.  I tried their special house dressing Rimaloud(don't know how to spell it) which was a kind of spicy creamy dressing, which I highly recommend.  My steak was cooked exactly to order and melted in my mouth, one of the best filets I've ever had.  \n\nThe restaurant was very nice, the type of place that you'd visit on special occasions, worth the entire experience."
1,"The FIRST TIME I've ever eaten a steak without ketchup!  No, seriously.  My family has teased me for years, but I like the taste of steak with ketchup, always have.  Didn't need it here!\n\nCelebrated Father's Day a little early with dear hubby. Reservation for 6:00 PM, we were greeted BY NAME by each person who served us. Having never been here before, really didn't know what to expect, but our server was killer polite and helped us understand the steak prep a little better. \n\nI had the harvest salad (the best salad I've ever had, no lie, and it was HUGE!) and DH had the caesar.  He said it was very good. We ordered wine, which complimented the meal spectacularly.  We each had the filet with shrimp combo, and DH had the blue cheese crumble topping on his. I think I died and went to steak heaven!  The topping was crunchy, creamy, and just delicious.  Like I said before, no ketchup anywhere on my plate.  I have never tasted a steak so delicious, so tender, so awesomely cooked with awesomeness.  We also had creamed spinach (meh), garlic green beans (these were delish) and a crab cake (again, delish!).\n\nAll in all, a terrific dinner.  Well over $200, but a terrific dinner nonetheless.  Already planning a return trip for 10th wedding anniversary.  Can you say, \""GIFT CARDS!?!!\"""
1,"Service is excellent. Best Steak in town. It is an expensive splurge, but worth it."
1,"$7 Reverse Happy Hour, yes, please!  Awesome drinks and a great value for your money!!"
1,"I'm partial to steak and Ruth's Chris is the epitome of awesome beefy goodness. Came here for my anniversary with my wife and had an excellent time. The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and surprised me and my wife with a special anniversary dessert and took a photo of the two of us. By the way, the steak was amazing, perfectly cooked, and butter soft. This is one of my favorite steakhouses in all of the land!"
1,"Okay, I love Houston's even though it's a chain. I travel about 90% of the time with my job and Houston's consistently has good food, clean restaurants and great service (I don't understand why all restaurants don't follow their service mantra...where every server takes care of every table...you never have a dirty dish sitting on your table or want for anything for more than 5 minutes.) It is safe to say I'm probably Houston's number one fan! (Just ask my friends who know Houston's is going to be my first suggestion as the place to go eat.) I frequent the 24th St & Camelback location in Phoenix the most. \""T\"" the hostess is absolutely terrific. I ALWAYS feel special when I go in there. All of the food is good. I love the smoked salmon or spinach dip as an appetizer. And the Ahi Tuna salad, the French Dip and the  chopped chicken salad are incredible. I try and make it in to the restaurant on Thursdays for their Chicken Enchilada soup which rocks! Finally, their Sundae is the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, it's difficult to make a choice between that and their key lime pie. I have a few complaints about Houstons, I don't like their tea or lemonade very much. Lemonade is too sour and the tea tastes artificial. I'm also bummed they don't have a blender in their bar for frozen margaritas. Perhaps it's because of the noise, not sure? The ambiance at the place is always relaxing. Portions seem to be getting smaller and prices have gone up (like everything else) so bring your wallet."
1,"Fridays are our date night and I must say I was extremely happy with our choice of restaurant. Houston's at the Esplanade has been a favorite of ours for years, but last night confirmed our feelings once again. After being told that the wait would be 15 minutes, we decided to go out to the patio and order our drinks. Less than 5 minutes later we were seated at our table. Impressive already! Our appetizers were wonderful! I didn't like artichoke until last night! Total Yum! My husband had the usual, the Pork Ribs and loved them.  As for me, I had the Grilled Halibut and couldn't be happier! The freshness and quality of my dish was to die for! I love Houston's!"
1,"i like it, i like it a lot! (you must say it like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber.)\n\nWe stopped in last night for dinner and cocktails.  I left quite satisfied with the experience.\n\nThe atmosphere, service, pricing, and food were all top notch.  \n\nI really LOVED the grilled artichoke...you must try this.\n\nI am excited to check out the new facility that will be opening late this year.  It is right down the street (in the spot that Chevy's was located.)\n\nCheck it out.."
1,"Although it leans on the pricey side of Phoenix cuisine, Houston's is by far one of my favorite places to go out for a nice dinner. Their veggie burger is beyond amazing (I always get the couscous on the side which is also delicious).\n\nOn a recent trip, my boyfriend ordered the ribs on a recommendation. He said they were by far the best ribs he has ever enjoyed."
1,"Love their hamburgers, both regular ones and vege burgers. The staff, particularly at the bar, are great. (Tom and Al). The wine selection is good. Appetizers I love include the spinach artichoke dip and the grilled artichokes. Yum!"
1,One of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  I take all my guests here when they visit town.
1,"Never been a huge Houston's guy. It's too dark, the menu is too limited, and while the food is good it somehow always fails to live up to the hype. Not bad, but not memorable, either.\n\nFrom what I understand, Hillstone is an amped-up Houston's, like a luxury badge on a Marriot hotel. Yawn. \n\nI tell you all this because heading into my first visit to Hillstone tonight I had zero expectations. None. Well, other than expecting to be underwhelmed.\n\nShame on me, because Hillstone hit a home run.\n\nA beautifully appointed, thoughtfully designed, approachably classy  indoor/outdoor dining venue, Hillstone offers the same dressed-down menu of a Houston's, but in a nicer setting with truly elite service.\n\nKaitlyn, our server, was attentive and exactly the right level of chipper. She was pleasing to both my 7-year-old niece as well as my 65-year-old mother. That's no easy feat. The burger was perfect, the beverages were never empty, the table was cleared on time, the check was dropped off and picked up seamlessly and the staff was always around but never a nuisance. \n\nAnd I love the setting. From the bar to the bathrooms everything just works. There are romantic corner booths and more lively center room talbes and the patio is gorgeous, with a perfect view of bustling Camelback Road. \n\nWhether it's a business meeting or a first date, Hillstone will definitely get my repeat business."
1,"I love Hillstone!!!!!! It is amazing!  I worked at Houstons when I was in highschool and you would think that I would be sick of it, but I am not!! I cannot get enough!  The spinach dip is the best ever created in the world!!!  I actually like the change to the salsa they did!  The Grilled Chicken Salad is a dream with the peanut sauce, or the Thai noodle salad-I love the mangos, tomatos, and avocados its delicious, or the caesar salad, or the hickory burger with fries, or the ribs and to top it off the sundae!!!! The chocolate sauce is orgasmic!!  i wish I could have it everyday! The new restaurant is a little confusing because the front door is in the back of the building and its kind of awkward b/c if you dont know that you will walk right in the middle of the dining room and bar area.  However, the restaurant is beautiful and so open and airy!  The patio is perfect and I wish I could have eaten out there but it was sprinkling and cold!  There is something for everyone here and you can go for lunch or dinner!  Head this way!!!"
1,"Most excellent in every way!!!  I like the thai steak salad and the fudge!!\nPlease, I beg you........ get some chocolate cake added to your menu. \nfor the love of us all!!!! P l E a S e...please...p l e a a a s s s e e e e!!!"
1,"Last night we met friends at Hillstone's and we truly enjoyed a great meal and great atmosphere.  \nWe were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening.  We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server, she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.  The croutons crisp and fresh baked.  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye, OMG!! So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I can't wait to go back.  Was always a fan of Houston's in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing."
1,"Two center cut filets, arctic char (split) and cold perrier with lime.  The steaks were cooked perfectly.  The char has been better, but it was still exceptional and the spicy corn and baked potato (with everything but the bacon) was awesome!  Service was prompt and considerate - always love it here!"
1,"I met Monsieur here for lunch today and I was so impressed with the new look.  I've always loved Houston's (now known as Hillstone's) and the food, service and decor have always been impeccable.\n\nThe only drawback with the new location is that you can easily pass it up and the lack of parking but otherwise, it is still a winner with the best filet mignon ever!!"
1,"Over the years I have been to Hillstone/Houston's over 200 times and I can easily say that everything is out of this world. The spinach and artichoke dip, cheeseburger, ribs, fish, french dip, hawaiin steak, the apple cobbler dessert...all amazing....They do everything right here and all for a great price. I never decline an opportunity to go to Hillstone. Did I mention they have a sushi menu? Be sure to get the coconut shrimp roll. It has sauce on the tray that it comes with but be sure to ask for extra!\nI always imagine if they were to have a brunch/brekafast menu, what it would be like. I think I would cry of happiness if they ever did."
1,"i love this restaurant so much. i have yet to have something i didn't like.\n\ni have nothing really special to add to all of the amazing reviews except to order these things:\n\nthai steak noodle salad- mango, avocado, tomatoes, noodles, marinated steak...i meannnnnnnnnnnnn\ncaesar salad - their dressing is my fav and so are the croutons\nbacon, cheddar burger- so juicy, so exquisite\nroast beef sandwich- raw horseradish on the side\nfries- order extra bc people will eat these babies UP! \n\n\nservice is ALWAYS good, it's always clean, it's always pleasant. seriously, you can't have a bad time unless you're just a miserable person."
1,The New York Strip special they have is top two in Phoenix- just have to get lucky when they have it!
1,"I loved it. Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and was impressed just by walking in. The ambiance was great, the little fountains and the patio area was very cool as well. \n       This is a steakhouse, the better the meal the more it's worth, so you will pay accordingly.  I had a filet and I loved every second of it, not only was is a pretty good size it was done beautifully.  The tortilla soup was even fantastic as well.   Drinks are also high quality. I had an awesome mojito.\n \n      I thought the employees were on point, it was a thursday night so I wasn't expecting the A team but they were awesome. Although the place seems kinda snooty the staff was friendly and proficient. \n \n           I've been to expensive steakhouses before, not always do I get one that delivers on all fronts."
1,"Great atmosphere, Awesome service, Great place but it can be pricey $$$. I Love that everything is so fresh! Including drinks I had one or two martinis and every ten min they would change my martini glass so it would never get warm always chill and fresh !"
1,Everything was great.  The Tomato soup was blissful.  Beautiful venue and exception service.  Luv it.
1,"I was in Phoenix for business and found this place based on yelp reviews.  I must say, this place is absolutely delicious!!  For starters, the service was very knowledgeable and friendly.  The chef's were extremely creative which led to my questions that the servers explained in completeness.  Lets get to the food... \n\nI came with 3 co-workers and all of our meals were delicious.  I had the pork ribs and they were fantastic.  I was able to substitute the sides for whatever I wanted without a problem.  Everything came out delicious!  The ribs were fall-off the bone, some of the best ribs I've had.  Extremely tender and not overwhelmed with sauce.  Highly recommend this establishment."
1,"I had a very nice meal here, definitely a place I'd return to. The place is comfortable, looks great, and has a nice ambience to it.\n\nI ordered the Hawaiian ribeye, with a loaded baked potato. The steak was very good, cooked a perfect medium rare, with a not-overwhelmingly sweet glaze. The potato was pretty decent as well. For dessert, I asked to be surprised with whatever they recommended, and was served a tasty ice cream sundae.\n\nIt was very good, on my short list for places to go for a nice night out."
1,Best affordable wine list in the valley. The food is fantastic and the service is even better. Love this place. Think I'll go there for lunch today :)
1,"Always delicious and classy!\n\nPros:\nTeam service\nTriple filtered water in chilled glass\nDaily specials\nMargarita (freshly squeezed)\nThai steak salad\nHawaiian rib eye\nKey lime pie- yum!!!!\n\nMy mom and I had a late lunch here Wednesday. We truly enjoyed the ambiance, food, and service!  With so many restaurants in the biltmore area it can be tough to choose where to go.  Thank goodness we chose Hillstone!"
1,"Best ribs ($30) that I've had in Phoenix thus far, hands down. It's even better than Bobby Q's (much less fat on the Hillstone ones). The french fries and coleslaw that come with it are of equal quality and bursting with flavor.  Loooooove!"
1,I wish they would bring back the Club Sandwich.
1,Great meal!! Crab cakes and asparagus were amazing. Our waitress India was amazing!! Offered suggestions that both me and my boyfriend got. No complaints. Coming back soon.
1,This is my go to spot. Service is consistently immaculate no matter who you get. Tom the bartender pays attention to the customers names and what they drink with everyone I see. You can't go wrong with any of the food. I've tried it all and love it all. I generally get the Thai tuna roll with a kale salad as it's clean and fresh. Atmosphere is beautiful..lots of celebrities stop by here as they generally stay in the Biltmore area.
1,"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I love their Martinis, and I love that when you're halfway done with your Martini they bring over another cold glass to replace your existing warm one.  The service is outstanding.  The ribs are amazing, but for $30 they shouldn't be anything but.  I do agree that Hillstone is on the expensive side, but I believe you're getting what you pay for.  Even their sushi is some of the best in town.  It's certainly my favorite.  Is it expensive?  Yes it is, but it's also amazing.  At $13-$21 a roll, it better be damn good!  The cheeseburger and chicken sandwich are very good as well.  You really can't go wrong here.  If you don't like it....I'm thinking the problem isn't the restaurant."
1,This place is excellent. Great tasting food and atmosphere. They have a real comfortable  patio area and the staff are very friendly and attentive to the customers needs. Had some of the best tasting food in a long time here and dessert was excellent as well. Would highly recommend this as a top place to have dinner to anyone.
1,"Jill, Tom and Al are the very best and provide A+ service consistently. The food is second to none."
1,"When you have impeccable service and phenomenal food, you will always have my attention and adoration. THIS place is my fave spot for every excuse possible to frequent it. It hits the mark every time. I love sitting at the bar or patio area because Hillstone just attracts quite the crowd of movers and shakers because what's the fun in a staring contest. \n\nDefinitely start with the house-smoked salmon. That in itself could be your entire meal with a couple of glasses of wine, but then I would be short changing you a review of their offerings wouldn't I? On a side note, always order the grilled artichokes if they are available. It will seriously ooze goodness all over your mouth. The last thing I think about is salad at a steakhouse, but I will say that the Blue Cheese Wedge Salad,  Chicken Kale Salad or the Yellowtail Sashimi Salad are my fave side dishes to accompany the Hawaiian Rib Eye, or the Prime Rib. \n\nHere's the crazy thing. They have sushi and I haven't even tried that because I am so smitten by the other choices. Says a lot for me to give 5 stars without trying everything.  I actually will have to venture back strictly for that feasting. While their sister restaurant Houston is a fave, Hillstone takes the spotlight. It sits in a class of its own, maybe because every outing has always left me with a dazzling smile. Parking can be nuts but I promise it's worth the walk and you'll appreciate the stroll after gorging on their culinary delights."
1,Place was packed on a Tuesday night so I had high expectations Was not let down The Hawaiian ribeye was cooked to medium rare perfection and I'm a stickler for cooking beef to order. Enough said really
1,"I love Macs. Fuck PCs (even though I own one).\nThe employees are a bit off-center, but when they actually come up to you and think you're hot, they're nice.\nHappened to me the other day.\nTrue story."
1,"I really love this store and the computers, iPods, iPhones, as well as the accessories that I have purchased for them at this location. The staff is extremely personable and helpful when they aren't tied up with others. The only gripe that I have is that sometimes the store, especially on weekends or nights, can be a zoo and all associates are often tied up. Bonus that I only need to hand them my credit card, with no other information, and I'm out the door with my receipt emailed to me."
1,"so we bought a new 24 in LED display online and it arrived. everything great, waited a week or two for the new MacBookPro to arrive before we could fire it up. (mini DVI, duh whats that right? lol)\n\nso boom it fires up for the first time and i see it. a black triangle of burned out LEDs WHOA!!! no fun. panic was released and calm restored. it's 2 weeks old, i'll take it to an Apple store for a replacement.\n\nso Saturday morning i made an appointment at the Genius bar to have them look at it, and hopefully say, \""We'll just replace it for you\""....\n\nwell after an interesting turn of events on the light rail, i showed up late, only 15 minutes. but my reservation was already voided..my fault. no biggie.\n\ni tell the guy at the genius bar check in what the deal is and he says, we can put you back in the queue and one of the genius can look at it.\n\ni said \""is there a way we can just get an exchange, i don't really want to hear that it would need to be shipped off to wherever to be fixed\"" he said sure, but they might have the parts there to fix it, and that the online stock and the in-store stock are different, so he might not be able to exchange but would go check into it....15 minutes later he walked out of the room behind the genius bar with another monitor. i walked over to the exclusive register since they switched over to the mobile point of sales set up. after a couple bar code scans i was walking out the store with a new monitor. a new monitor without burned out LEDs that is. \n\ni was happy.\n\nas far as the maddening POS system they have, i give it 3.5 stars\n\ni get the concept and that it should speed up sales, but when your ignorant to who has one of the hand held devices or don't even know thats how you check out. you can be seriously put off by the whole process. but now that i know. i have no issues with it. who really needs a bag anyways."
1,I love this place. I bought my wife a ipad for christmas from here and the sales person was very nice & helpful. In fact every time I have talked to a sales person at this store they have been very informative & helpful. I plan on buying an new imac soon from here.
1,"So I cracked my iPhone 4 and called Verizon (who I pay an insurance fee to each month) and they told me to try Apple first.  I did and after a short wait the young guy asked me how it broke, how high up it was when it fell (in my hand or off of a building?) and I said it was in my hand.  He clicked around on his device a bit and said \""normally we'd charge you $165 but i'll help you out today\"" and gave me a free brand new iPhone 4.  Plus Grant Hill (Suns player) was in there at the same time. good service!!!"
1,"Went in to get a new charger for my MacBook Pro, and they gave me a new one right away-- no wait, no paperwork. Super friendly staff and extremely quick service despite being very busy! Definitely one of the better Apple stores that I've been to."
1,"I have been using this clinic for over 20 years.   Being active in many different sports and outdoor activities I often have need for a chiropractor.  They are always professional, friendly and go out of their way to see me. Even adjusting me on a weekend at the Dr's home a time or two when I'd badly thrown something out."
1,"Newsflash!!  After 10 years of living in the East Central Phoenix area, I have FINALLY found my \""go-to\"" Greek place.   It's like comfort food, but it's the entire restaurant.  \n\nMy cousin and I stumbled into this place --- the location is a bit difficult to find otherwise.  We were waiting for our nail appointment at Andy's salon a few doors down and decided to grab dinner since we had time to kill.  Little did we know what happy customers we soon would be!   An affordable, local, delicious Greek restaurant which quickly earned a #1 rating in my book!  Can't wait to go back and try more!  \n\nThe woman who took our orders and cooked the food was just so wonderful!  She recommended the Spicy Chicken pita to me, so I took her word  (see my Humble Pie review, where I learned my lesson for not following restaurant recommendations!).  It was a great choice!!   My cousin had the gyro pita, which was melt in your mouth delicious too.  We also shared a spanekopita, which was just so fresh and well made.  It was piping hot food, she cooked to order (hold the onions for me!), and the flavors were perfect. \n\nThe portions were great, the hummus was tasty, the pita so soft and perfectly grilled.  The Olympic Flame has even mastered the use of garlic, which many restaurants seem not to be able to manage.  The only downside to this place is that I guess I won't scare vampires off at night after eating here (see my previous review of Eden's Garlic Grill if you are looking to keep the vampires away), but I will sleep well with a fully belly and leftovers in the fridge for tomorrow!"
1,"I really enjoy having Sunday Brunches here.  The outdoor seating is nice when the weather is right; they have set up some canopies so everyone sitting outside can really enjoy the warm weather.  The service is great and everyone is friendly.  The food is full of flavor and the portions are perfect; when you sit down you are served croissants and jam before ordering you meal.  When you think it is done your server brings out dessert for your table; it is always great, making the meal and experiance complete and satisfying."
1,"What a great place. Another instant top 5 favorite. Loved the food, the staff is wonderful, the whole establishment is quite nice. It is located in a pretty silly place but I love it. The ratatoullie is amazing and don't even get me started on the duck confit. Hands down one of the best meals I have ever had. So good."
1,"We went for restaurant week and had outstanding service, wonderful food, and reasonbale drink prices.  We really enjoyed beef tenderloin, smoked salmon quesadillas, and pecan pie.  My French Maritini with Grey Goose was awesome for $12.50!  It is a formal setting with low lighting for a nice romantic setting."
1,"Vincent's remains my all time favorite. It's been ten years since I have been here but the quality is the same. The spinach salad had warm sauteed mushrooms and bacon with a balsamic reduction all in perfect proportions. The duck confit wasn't on the menu. No problem. Vincent prepared it anyway and is was to die for. The brown sauce was perfection. Then, just when you are ready to cry uncle out comes the souffles and chocolate bombs. Spoon in a little creme anglais and you have gone to gastronomic heaven. A comprehensive wine list that might be weighted a little too much on the high end on the French side but plenty of good California choices in the affordable range. This is a very special restaurant with a world class chef that is a treasure known to all Valley of the Sun natives. Don't miss it."
1,"What a fabulous dinner at Vincent's on Camelback. Thankfully Chef Vincent G. was in the kitchen  when we recently dined and the meal was absolutely superb. We began with an appetizer of foie gras with Schnepf Farm peaches and a balsamic glaze. A small portion, but if you love foie gras as we do then you will not be disappointed. Meltingly lucious. For a salad I chose the Raddichio with Belgian Endive and it was so wonderful. It consisted of a mixture of chopped raddichio, belgian endive, pears, pecans, and a mild blue cheese in a lovely, mild vinaigrette. I plan to try to duplicate this at home as it was so delicious. My husband had his heart set on a lobster salad but it was not on the menu that night. Not to worry though as our waiter, Dino, said he was sure the kitchen could do one. They did not disappoint. It was a lovely salad they created with big chunks of lobster and heirloom tomatoes. My husband said it was perfect. For our entrees I chose the lobster in beurre blanc with basil pasta. That lobster was  a small one (the waiter said it would be a whole lobster split, but a small one)  but I have to say it was as sweet and fresh tasting as ones I've eaten in Cape Cod or Maine. Just incredibly delicious and the basil pasta was a perfect accompaniment. My husband ordered the duck confit and I have to say after tasting his I'd be very hard pressed to decide which entree I liked best. The confit was served with lyonnaise potatoes. Chef Vincent really did some magical things in his kitchen to give a crispness to the layer of duck fat sitting on top of the thigh and drumstick. We are confit fans but unless you have a gallon of duck fat at home it's pretty hard to duplicate in your own kitchen, plus it's doubtful it would taste as good as this one did. For dessert we both chose the Grand Marnier souffles served with a creme anglaise. Those beauties were ethereal and heavenly....like eating a cloud with a sauce that begs to be licked off the spoon. The service by Dino and the other waitstaff was top notch. We managed to greet Chef Vincent as we were leaving and told him how much we appreciated his genius. This chef is a Valley treasure and if you have not had the chance to try his restaurant you are missing out. He was the winner in the past of the James Beard SW  Chef awards and it's not hard to see why. He is French born and French trained and in my humble opinion NO ONE COOKS AS WELL AS THE FRENCH. We will return as soon as we can. This is still my favorite restaurant in the Valley bar none."
1,"Very knowledgeable wait staff to help suggest wine pairings with your meal, and the food is consistently amazing from bite to bite and dish to dish. A very romantic place to take your significant other, or just an excellent place to have a terrific meal with friends. Everyone should experience this place at least once, it's that good."

1,"This little place adjoins the main restaurant, Vincent's on Camelback, by Chef Vincent Gerithault (sp?).  All simple and astonishingly delicious dishes.  I've had their salads, coq au vin, burgundy beef, salmon, specials, desserts, and not a dog in the bunch.  Service has been spot on.  Every time.  The atmosphere is \""French country\"" and very comfortable.   When the bill comes, it almost appears to missing a digit - it's very affordable.  The whole place exists for the sheer purpose of sharing the chef's delicious, beautifully-presented meals.    \n\nThe main restaurant is there to really showcase the Chef's true talent and should not be missed.  It's a great value as well, but expect to pay for a real meal.\n\nOne last thing, during the cooler months, the parking lot at Vincent's (Cmbk, West of 40th St) is turned into something like a farmer's market with a lot of delicious food served up.  It's very comfortable with a European feel and usually well-attended.  It's a great way to taste some great food."
1,"Their prix fixe menu gives almost unbelievable value on truly fine eats. Truly fine. And some nice-priced tasty wines. Not for the real snobs, maybe (they go to the fancy end of the building), but this place is absolutely one of the best of the best - I'd give it 6 stars if I could, and I eat out a lot and in many different places. Stop reading & get your tookis to Vincent's Bistro."
1,"Welcome to Paris in the desert. Je t'aime Vincent's. Anything Vincent's does I love. Whether it's the 5 star dining in the front, the market bistro in the back or the Saturday morning marketplace outside. They really know how to frenchafy AZ. \n\nI've been to Vincent's Market Bistro several times and most recently, last night for a friend's birthday. The Market Bistro is the more intimate, kitchen style dining at Vincent's and actually my favorite way to dine there. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd entered a cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of Paris. The food was cooking, the guests at the tables were laughing and having a great time and the waitstaff knew almost everyone by name. The authentic french decor helped the cause as well. \n\nWhen I hear the name Vincent's, I immediately think \""oh yikes, here comes a pricey night,\"" but the best part about it is that the market bistro keeps the evening at an incredibly reasonable price without losing the quality of food. Are you ready for this? I got the pre fix meal that began with a delectable crab cake on a salad with avocado garnish, followed by the lobster chimichanga and topped off with the chocolate tart which was really a chocolate souffle. How much? $20. Only $20 my friends! It was delicious. With each savory bite, I became a little happier. The wine by the glass was only $5-$6 dollars and at the end, the waiter brought us a couple additional desserts to make sure we tried them all. Just what my waistline needed...but I had a bite, and I think the lemon tart is my favorite. \n\nVincent's Market Bistro has definitely been added to the rotation of favorite places to dine with character. And when I walked outside and the heat hit my face, I didn't even mind because I had such a great time at Vincent's."
1,"Gotta give it 5 stars.  I wouldn't change a thing about it, from the ambience to the server to the food quality. \n\nTo start, like a reviewer said before me, the valet parking does seem to be for the actual Vincent restaurant, rather than for the Bistro.  And yes, there is parking in the back.\n\n**Another note**:  The Market Bistro only takes reservations for parties of 5 or more.  Two of us went at 7:00 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately.\n\nWhat we ate that we actually ordered:  Lobster bisque, salmon quesadillas, coq au vin, seafood skewers.\n\nWhat the server brought-- for free for us to try-- which we ate but hadn't ordered:  The butternut squash ravioli, mini pumpkin chocolate brownie with ice cream on top.  (And of course the mini croissants at the beginning of the meal.)\n\nEverything we ate was beyond fantastic, with one exception-- the seafood skewers were a little bland.  Not \""bad\"" by any means, just not as flavorful as seafood can be.  The real standout was the butternut squash.  Our second favorite was the salmon quesadillas.  EXCELLENT.\n\nEven better:  our entire bill, including my friend's glass of wine and my soft drink, was $48!!\n\nI will go back again and again.  (And to all you thriving young bucks, this would be the perfect place to take a first date-- classy and unique, yet unpretentious, with amazing food and a manageable cost.  Score!)"
1,"Absolutely love this place!  French bistro food at a reasonable price - gratis dessert and croissants.  Simple, casually elegant, a little noisy - and by all means yummy.  Its really hard to not like the offerings.   \n\nThis gets 5 stars for filling a really awesome niche in Central Phoenix."
1,Great food! Great prices! Great service!  We have gone to Vincent's next door several times but it is very expensive.  But the Market Bistro is very affordable and still has a nice ambiance and awesome food.\nThey always serve croissants and a dessert!
1,Great Sunday breakfast after church.  The staff is friendly and was great with my daughter.  Croissants are yummy and my daughter loved the cookies after the meal.
1,"Reliving my summer in France, I have been sampling French cuisine around the valley.  Found this quaint little bistro that is so charming.  The ambiance is spot on French country.  The colors, furnishings, paintings and flowers on the plates made me feel like I was in Provence was more.  Stopped in for a late breakfast.  The mini croissants and preserves were wonderful.  Ordered a quiche that was absolutely perfect with such lovely flavors and served with a wonderfully light salad.  I can't wait for my next visit to the French countryside of the Vincent Market Bistro."
1,"You know that little, lesser-known, hole-in-the-wall, amazing restaurant that you wish you could think of on a beautiful Saturday or Sunday morning, to spend your entire morning at, enjoying the weather, sipping fantastic coffee with impeccably made pastries (croissants!), rich b\u00e9chamel sauce on some incredible egg dish and a waiter that just brings you randomly delicious things that you didn't order (and he doesn't charge you for!) because he had them in the back and just thought you might like them? Well, you found it.\n\nThis is the \""little secret place\"" you take your out of town friends to. This is the place you lose track of time at with your good friends, laughing and eating the whole morning away until you leave stuffed, totally happy and ready to relax and enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nLove this place. Easy to recommend. We have wandered in on Saturday and Sunday anywhere between 9 and 11am and never had an issue finding a seat. Very casual experience. Start with a cappuccino, enjoy the fresh hot croissants for a while, maybe get a chocolate one (dear god, so good), maybe another cup of coffee, order some breakfast, talk, laugh and just enjoy.\n\nThen be shocked at the end of this beautiful meal when the bill comes, and it is no more than any other breakfast place and the owner probably didn't even charge you for some of the items just so you'd have a better experience (happened every time we've gone). Vincent's place has a really wonderful/relaxed energy that is all about enjoying your day and we do every time we go."
1,"This place is a solid 5 Stars in my book. We took our N. Scottsdale friend here for her Birthday Dinner based on reviews from some friends on Yelp and were blown away with every aspect of this Beautiful Market Bistro. Once you find the entrance and park your car you walk up to a colorful patio decorated like you would see in a French painting by Claude Monet. You notice everyone there enjoying themselves with a glass of fine wine and a table full of tasty goodies. The inside is interestingly charming and colorfully decorated in the same eloquent fashion. Nice.\n\nWe got there early to avoid the crowds and it was perfect. We were also greeted instantly and told to sit wherever we wanted. The server showed up faster than if I had a magic wand. He informed us of the specials while he got our drink orders going as well as bringing us a complementary plate of some of the best tasting buttery croissants I have ever had before. We asked a few questions and he happily answered us with no hesitation and was most informative.\n\nWe started with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla with Dill & Horseradish Cream for $10 and it was delicious. For entr\u00e9es, the ladies ordered Saut\u00e9ed Salmon with Herb Rice and Basil Beurre Blanc for $12.50 and Beef Bourguignon with Mashed Potatoes for $14. I selected the Seafood Skewer with Pesto Sauce and Scalloped Potatoes for $13 off the specials menu. We were all amazed at how nicely the vegetables were cooked just right. The fresh ingredients, textures and flavors were spectacular with all the dishes. Could not help asking for another plate of croissants to sop up all the extra juices and sauces since I was told by the wife not to lick the plate. When we thought we were done the server brings each of us a small plate of flourless chocolate cake topped with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Yummo!\n\nWe had such a great time there and the bill was very reasonable for the quality of the food and the friendly service we received. We will definitely be coming back again sooner than later. Fantastique!"
1,"By far one of the best restaurants/bistros in the US! Scrumptious dishes. Super friendly staff. Great value. I love having lunch at Vincent on Camelback. Coq au vin is divine, and soupe du jour is always a fresh treat. Complimentary dessert is served at lunch time. Trust me, you will love this place as much as I do."
1,"It is hard see how to improve Vincent Market Bistro.  Some have complained about table crowding in this relatively small restaurant, but there is ample room to maneuver and the noise level is not a problem.  \n\nThe portions are not large, but they are not ridiculously small either.  You will probably want an appetiser and a main course, and possibly a dessert.  Get them all for $28 by using the prix frix offering.  This consists of a choice from 3 appetisers, a choice from 3 entrees, and a choice from 3 desserts.  The entries are top-end items too, such as steak, lobster, or rack of lamb.\n\nHINT: I was told that reservations are not taken, and even on a weekday the venue gets crowded.  My suggestion is to go early, like 6 o'clock."
1,"I've come here quite a few times now, mostly for lunch. Each time I go, I get excited to see the daily lunch specials they offer. I've ordered the lamb shank, lobster quiche and beef bourguignon. They all have been really good. To accompany the meal they also offer free croissants that are served with a raspberry preserve before the meal and a small dessert at the end. Although the prices of the lunch special have steadily gone up from $10 since the first time I've been here, I think the quality of the food and the ambiance is still worth every penny."
1,"I literally just came upon this coffee shop thanks to Yelp!, and thank goodness.  I've been searching for an amazing cup of coffee and I found it.\n\nI'm pretty sure the owner was the amazingly helpful and nice lady working behind the counter, (I saw her picture in an article posted on the wall). She was great.\n\nMy coffee was amazing, nicely priced, and extremely fast.\n\nI will be returning and spreading the word!"
1,"This place actually has a new owner now and it's been renamed the White Cup Coffee.  Either way, I like this place before, but I LOVE it now!!  \nSherry has done a great job of giving the place a face lift and it feels so much more cozy and inviting on the inside.  \nThe coffee is still stellar, and my absolute favorite place to grab a drink despite the numerous little mom and pop coffee joints in Arcadia.  If you like Chai latte's, I encourage you to try theirs... you will never order one anywhere else.  I promise you!!\nThe customer service here is so warm and welcoming. I will sometimes stop in with my 9 month old on the way to her daycare and all the employees know her.\nI came in one day just before they were about to close and Sherry let me stay and get an hour of work done while she was cleaning up.\n\nShe also has great interaction with her other customers and I can tell there are already a lot of regulars here.  Great place!!"
1,"I met with Doctor Mayy Deadrick a few weeks ago and immediately felt at ease. I can tell that she will be a wonderful family doctor. Best of all, Mountain View is home to several doctors so we should always be able to get in the same day or the day after we get sick. The waiting room felt clean and comfortable too, which is a big plus for any doctor's office."
1,"Best. Doc's Office. EVER. \n\nMy primary care doc is Dr. Mansfield and she is AMAZING.... as is her assistant. I don't know what I'd do without them. I've also been to other docs if I'm really sick and can't get in to see her, and they've all been great. The front desk staff is very friendly and quick with processing people through. You never have to wait long with an appointment and they have a streamlined process to get people through to a doc quick, but not so quick that you feel like you're just a number. They listen to what you have to say and don't just give you meds for the sake of giving you meds.... which I LOVE! These guys rock!!"
1,"Dr. Mansfield is amazing. She listens and provides valuable feedback and resources. I just moved t the area, and I was worried about finding a new physician. I'm not worried anymore; in fact, I'm going to stick around even though I've moved to Tempe. Fabulous care."
1,I have been a patient of MVFP for over 10 years.  I have a great Dr. (Roseann Collins). And I find them to be organized and efficient.  Nothing but good experience with them.\nRichard
1,"ZUMBA. Tony, Brandon & RyRy are the fantastic!  I recently moved back to Phoenix from San Diego and even though I have been doing Zumba for a few years, every class is different.  These guys are fun, energetic, motivating, have great play lists and easy to follow, even if you are new to Zumba. I love their classes!!"
1,"I've been training with Brian for about 6 weeks.  So far, I've lost 10 pounds and am so much more toned.  My workouts are never the same.  I feel better than I have in a long time and I actually enjoy working out now!"
1,"normally, i love/hate going to the home depot. everytime i go, i get so many ideas of what i want to do to my home and yard, buy a bunch of stuff, then spend the next 8 weekends cursing wildly in the yard for starting yet another project. \n\nalso, going to home depot has always been stressful. i pretty much know how to do most anything, but i still need help finding the right pieces and parts (because i often overlook small details like measurements and sizes and thus wind up going back several times to get the right thing). it would be so much easier if a depot employee would just help me out a little. \n\nwell, this time i got lucky. gardening. not a strong suit but i'm tenacious and damnit, i will get it to grow one way or the other. still, this time, i didn't need help with my choices, but while loading a bag of sand into the truck, those darn paper bags...one of them burst. luckily Gabriel, one of the associates in the garden center must have overheard my F-bomb and came out with a shovel and broom. he first offered to go get me another bag, but it was my fault, so i would've felt guilty. when i declined, he helped me refill the bag almost down to the very last grain, duct taped the hell out of it, and all of it with a smile. \n\ni'll have to change my regular depot to this one if that's the kind of service they offer!"
1,"I visit a lot of Home Depots. They  do carry a lot of things made in China, which is not always good when you are trying to build things. They won't last.\nSo the solution to that is you must read the labels.\n I do purchase a lot of Items here though. So they must be doing something right!\n The very best thing about Home Depot is the great return policy.  If something breaks, or you bought too many, or it is just not right they take it back. WIthout a lot of drama. I really like them for that, and that is why I really like to shop here. \nLots of parking in the lot. The staff is very helpful and friendly."
1,Extremely helpful and positive staff. Did an online order for pickup and then did some miscellaneous shopping.  Special thanks to Tracie at the customer service desk who directed us away from and to items that were better suited for the job we were doing.
1,"The Asst Mgr, Roddy went above and beyond in helping me to resolve an issue with homedepot.com. Thanks to his exceptional customer service, and patience with this extremely upset customer, I will continue using Home Depot as my supplier. Great Job"
1,"For what it is, it's the top of the heap.\nDive bar with spectacular craft beer selection.\nSeveral nights of free entertainment each week, including live bands and stand-up comedy shows, trivia, what else? I guess that's it, but those things are awesome.\n\nFriendly staff, clean enough, and i won't pretend to not remember whether or not i already mentioned the spectacular beer selection, but seriously, it's a really special, extensive menu for beer connoisseurs. one of the best (in a small joint) in the valley."
1,This place is a low-key hideaway with friendly staff. I would not really call it a dive; it's more neighborhood bar. Watching live music here is a really up close and personal experience. They support local live music.
1,"This is truly a hidden gem and I mean truly hidden! Even with the help of the trustee Yelp app, we still drove around and around the shopping center, only to finally see the glimpse of a sign out of the corner of our eyes. With a couple turns, we came to the back parking lot where the sign welcomed us inside. \n\nIt might be hidden now, but I learned that the Ice House Tavern has been around since the early 1960's...during the era when the ice rink was in the middle of a booming mall and a center attraction. I can only imagine how popular the Ice House Tavern was during those days. Although the mall is long gone, the Ice House Tavern survives and serves as a memory of what Phoenix used to be and it's a very cool memory at that. I just wish the mall was still there. How cool would it be to have a skating rink in the middle of a shopping mall!\n\nI must admit, we were a little nervous parking in a secluded back parking lot and walking into a windowless bar, but we had been reading about this bar for years and had to check it out! The moment we walked in, we knew we'd made a good choice! The very friendly and knowledgeable bartender welcomed us inside while two old timers sat at the bar and started to chat with us. Now as the other reviews say, the very coolest part about this bar is the fact that the bar's back wall is actually the window looking out onto the ice rink! We happened to stop by during the men's league championship hockey game so we got to watch a hockey game while we enjoyed a drink! \n\nSpeaking of drinks, who would have thought that this was a bar for a beer aficionado! The bartender handed us a thick binder that listed pages of beer and then the description of the beer. They have several different unique beers here and the bartender knows each one! I also enjoyed the food menu. It's simple. It's one item. When we were there, they were featuring a pulled pork sandwich and it was tasty! It was pecan smoked meat and had a sweet BBQ flavor to it. \n\nEverything about this bar is vintage, casual and friendly. It's truly a neighborhood bar and although we were first timers, we felt like family by the time we left. Besides watching people ice skating, they also have games including Big Buck Hunt. \n\nDon't let exterior appearances fool you and give this place a try!"
1,"I can't believe I've live .9 mile away and have just visited this find for the 1st time. Heck, it's next to Walmart! (I go to the Walmart purgatory all the time.)\n\nAs described previously, finding this dive bar is a hunt. Trust me, YOU CAN DO IT! You should do it. Where else can you pick from a huge beer list and watch hockey? I don't even like hockey  (Sorry everyone :) and found the experience awesome.\n\nYou can saddle up to the bar, which provides an eyeball view of the action, or go up a level and look out. Last night there was even a band! (The Leavehers rocked!)\n\nRIght, so where is this bar? In the strip mall that's stage left to Walmart. Drive around to the back, keep driving, and eventually you'll see what looks to be a loading dock area. Up high are two signs that don't particularly look legit. (They're not actually formal building signs, but plastic banners you might see on a fence. No joke.) \n\nThe door has a tiny awning and there aren't any windows that let you see into the bar. (Just two stop signs stating \""21 and over\"".) YOU HAVE ARRIVED! \n\nNo matter who you are be ready to show ID. \n(Don't be flattered ladies. I was, but alas, for no reason :)\n\nThe beer menu is incredible. I focused on the Porter section. (Porters have their own section!). By looking at microscopic print (or maybe I should get old lady glasses) I learned they have some items on a seasonal basis, or rarely. For this reason I hopped on down to the bar and asked the bartender for guidance. The bartender is SUPER NICE. I love her.\n\nFOOD? They serve one hot sandwich. Super deal at $6.75 (that pice includes taxes)! There are also chips (Doritos, etc.) and they have hot popcorn.\n\nThey also had a few beers on tap. You can pick up a small pitcher for $6!\n\nMUSIC? The jukebox is free! How so? They feature local bands only. I think this is wonderful. Music all night (after the band finished their set) and no need to continuously plug a machine with stripper dollar bills. (What? I've never been to a stripper club!)\n\nDefinitely coming back here!"
1,"I've always wanted a family friendly jeweler.  Esp. if my at the time boyfriend was going to buy me an engagement ring.  It means so much to me to have the true customer service when buying fine Jewelry, someone I can trust.  And when I found this place one day while I was at CVS I knew I had found a Gem (pun intended)! Peggy really made me and my now finance feel like we were family.  She helped him pick out my fabulous ring and answer every single one of his questions.  I'm so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because I think everyone should know about this place!  If your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile, head on over.  They are so excited to help you!"
1,"Definitely a must-try! The building itself isn't much to look at but the parking lot is always full and that's a great indication of yummy-ness. It caters to both meat and veggie eaters with fake chicken, duck, and beef plates. They also have mock seafood plates as well. \n\nMy friend and I went to check this place out because we had heard so much about it. She ordered the lemon grass chicken and I tried the ginger duck. Both were so tasty and we were kinda freaked out because they tasted just like the real thing. The service was excellent and kudos for the waitress who kept filling up our waters...even AFTER we paid the bill. It's reasonably priced and the food portions are perfect. We even had leftovers."
1,"Tasty, even if you are not a vegetarian, you will like this place. The food is great, it is inexpensive. The atmosphere is a bit lacking, but two out of three ain't bad."
1,"Of course this place gets all stars from me.\n\nLemongrass chicken is probably my idea of Grand Master Flash Heaven. Speaking of Heaven, also try the Seventh Heaven Salad rolls thingies.\n\nService is slow but by the time I think about it I'm too busy concentrating on the infomercial/yoga session video of the Supreme Goddess Master on the big screen, who never seems to age. Maybe they just switch her out when the last one dies.... Plus there are ALWAYS weird-looking people sitting nearby who order it up something ferocious, and it's fun to discuss what they could possibly do for a J.O.B. with those white-people dreads.\n\nThat is not to say that service isn't good, because it is.\n\nI couldn't believe it, but someone who went to the Veg House with me actually decided right then and there that he liked tofu. He had never had it before that day, save for a few nightmares, which is just unfair.\n\nI do wish it were open more, though. Kind of a PITA to drive up only to find the place locked."
1,"One of the best vegan restaurants in Arizona.\nClay pot sensation, curry soup, summer rolls, heaven rice rolls, Philly dream, BBQ noodles and Hawaiian burger are all excellent.\nWe go to both locations (Glendale and Phoenix) regularly since both have slightly different menu options (Glendale has delicious Pho and their Carrot Cake is incredible).\nLoving Hut serves amazing food! We have been to locations in San Diego and Orlando and all are DELICIOUS."
1,"Winner.\n\nYou want healthy?  You got it.\nYou want vegetarian/vegan?  You got it.\nYou want your food to taste amazing?  You got it.\nService?  You guessed it.\n\nA spicy cha cha might sound like something you might want to avoid, but don't look over this menu item at Loving Hut.  I don't even remember what was in it, and frankly I don't care... it was simply amazing.\n\nStart with a variety of the spring/summer/egg rolls and get a few different dishes, because you're going to want to try as many as possible.\n\nNext time I will definitely start with dessert.  I could see how you'd always end up too full after dinner, but they look too amazing to miss."
1,"This place is a less expensive but just as tasty Green. (But no tsoynamis.)\n\nGreat service, enjoyed the Noble Broccoli, chocolate cake! All vegan, but I went with a non-vegan and he also loved it.\n\nWeird white atmosphere, but quiet and clean!"
1,"The service is great at this location. Out of the different entrees ordered in my group, my favorite was the Spicy Cha Cha. Usually I can't handle hot spicy, but this one was manageable and DELICIOUS! It goes well with brown rice or the House Fried Rice. If you have time and room for dessert, definitely get the Strawberry Cheesecake. It's organic, vegan, and gluten free! It is definitely hands-down the best cheesecake I have had at any vegan restaurant."
1,"I am not a vegan, but I could eat here everyday!  Great quality and delicious. Very friendly staff!"
1,"Every time I go to this place, my taste buds thank me. I have tried many different meals, and each one has its own great flavor. I have also tried some of their desserts and drinks, totally tasty. People are super friendly there and it has a nice clean fresh atmosphere. Even my meat-eating husband complimented the faux-meat dish he got. I wish they got more business though, the parking lot is almost always empty when I go. The hours are a bit weird but I can understand it if they don't get customers all day long. If I could afford to eat out every day, I'd go to this place for sure. There are so many things still on the menu that I want to try."
1,"I went to the Loving Hut for the first time and really enjoyed the whole experience! The dining area was clean and well lit. The service was prompt and polite. They even ran my girlfriend's purse out to us in the parking lot after she forgot it at the table (I told her she was going to forget it..).  They had a variety of Asian dishes and a few interesting American-inspired entrees for those looking for something different.  \n\nI ordered the Heaven Rice Rolls as an appetizer and the BBQ Noodles entr\u00e9e.  Both dishes infused fresh, uncooked veggies into the meal in a way that didn't compromise taste, but didn't leave you feeling regretful afterwards as some oily or fatty meals can.  And the entr\u00e9e, as well as everything on the menu, was under $10! Great quality, healthy vegan food, served by a polite staff, for a reasonable price; that is what you can expect."
1,Love the studio and the family feeling of everyone there.  My daughter started ballett the first of the year and is having such a great time.  Thank you Regina and Jason for this wonderful studio.  Keep doing what you are doing!
1,"I have seen Dr. Bob and his sister as well. They are very soft-spoken, gentle and knowledgable. My neurologist recommended me to them.\n\nNote: they are opthalmologists not optometrists."
1,"I had Lasik this afternoon. It's now 8:43 PM. I just woke up from my post-op nap and I'm the happiest dude in Tempe. I haven't been able to see this well since I was a little kid. There's nothing like standing in my backyard and staring up at the finite features of the moon through my own eyes.\n\nLasik itself is great but obviously I'm not reviewing a surgery. This place deserves five stars for four major reasons. 1.) They were overwhelmingly friendly from the minute I walked through the door. 2.) They did a fantastic job preparing me for what to expect. 3.) I arrived at their office at 2:15 pm today and was done w/ surgery by 3. I know some people might think that sounds a little cold and impersonal but it wasn't. The doctor was extremely friendly and as soon as I shook his hand I relaxed completely. 4.) This surgery cost me 700 DOLLARS TOTAL! I responded to a banner ad they were running on Google for 299 per eye. I assumed it was a bait and switch. For me, it wasn't. I understand that everybody's eyes are different but I qualified for that price."
1,"I had LASIK done here in June 2012. I was initially drawn to it by Tim G's review, hoping that I would also qualify for the $299 per eye prices. Unfortunately, when I had my consultation they quoted me about $8-900 per eye for traditional LASIK. (I can't remember the exact price they quoted). My contact prescription was -2.50 in both eyes. I was a little bummed and decided that I didn't want to continue and I left. I was already starting to regret that I didn't just get it over with, as it was something I'd been wanting for awhile, when about a week later, they called me and offered me a lower price. They told me that they could do it for $599/eye for the traditional technology if I did my surgery on a specific date. I took them up on their offer and scheduled for a Friday morning. I decided to do all of my pre-LASIK appointment and my surgery on the same day, so I arrived early that morning, had everything done, spent a very long time waiting around being nervous (as your eyes can not be dilated for the surgery, and that is part of the exam to make sure you are qualified for LASIK), and then had my surgery around 3pm. I am very very pleased with my results. If you are thinking about having LASIK surgery done, I highly recommend the Lasik Vision Institute. I couldn't be happier with them!"
1,My favorite is the chicken katsu. Just like back home with one scoop rice and authentic mac salad. The cooks and servers are always friendly and the food only takes as long to be made to order. Great portions alway have one order for lunch and dinner.
1,"I love ono! At first I had the thought that this place charges way too much for a plate, then I saw the portions. We ordered the Chicken Katsu meal and the Short ribs meal and it was enormous! The chicken was so crispy and went very well with the mountain of macaroni salad and rice (not to mention a bunch of katsu sauce). The short ribs were also delicious! They gave a generous amount and the marinade they used was perfect. We had so much left over I had it for another meal! I had recently gone to an expensive Korean BBQ restaurant that had \""premium Angus short ribs\"" and I wish I had just gone to Ono instead! Haven't tried their spam musubi but I plan to in the near future!"
1,"Get the teriyaki mini meal! It has delicious cabbage, AMAZING macaroni salad, & sweet Hawaiian rice. There food is cooked to order so if you're in a hurry you can call ahead"
1,"Fantastic.  Stay away from Filiberto's unless it's the one on Dobson and Main.  Actually, that one might even suck now because of the dregs of society getting off and on buses and the light rail racket.  \n\nThis place, in contrast, is great.  Great service, great portions.  All-around best quick Mexican food joint around.  I risk a bunch of idiots showing up at this place by writing favorably about it but so be it.  If you want your rolled tacos to actually have meat in them, get a dozen of them here."
1,"It doesn't get any better!  Moda Fina not only has the finest jewlery, but it also has the latest styles and on trend looks.  Everything from classic to trendy, Moda Fina has it!  The service is the best and this upscale store makes your whole shopping experience ah-mazing!  Whoever says \""Money can't buy happiness\""...hasn't shopped at Moda Fina! lol!"
1,"Heartfelt thanks to Moda Fina for giving such special care to my mothers 35 year old wedding ring.  It had a broken prong and was quite dirty.  They fixed the prong, buffed up the ring and cleaned the diamond and its setting.  It looks like a brand new ring (and she said, \""Is that my wedding ring?\"")!  Lori is an absolute angel and couldn't have been anymore wonderful or helpful."
1,Uri and Steve are awesome. Great watches to custom priced right engagement rings. They are the best. Check them out!!
1,Best jewelers in town.  Their time is limitless when helping you to find or create your perfect piece. Excellent quality and craftsmanship.
1,"Just saw the all Balanchine program Saturday night -- going back Sunday to see it again!\n\nIt's AMAZING to me that a ballet company can go from startup  to being a destination company is fewer than 20 years!  But, BAZ did it in 15.\n\nNext season is their 22nd, and I renewed my season tix a couple of months ago.\n\nBAZ is a 'must-see' every show."
1,Love the Arizona Ballet and their School of Ballet.
1,"I did not get a sandwich from here. I ordered the spicy ramen noodles since it was a chilly, rainy day. I was genuinely shocked on how amazing it was! Not that I didn't think it would be good, but it was seriously some of the best stuff I've ever had. I now crave it at least once a week! \n\nNot only did the amazing soup earn them the 5 stars. The service was awesome. I only ate about half a bowl of soup and asked for a to-go container. The lady came out and separated my noodles from the broth and put them in different containers. She also explained to me how to reheat it properly so it doesn't ruin the flavor. She then taped them tightly shut so it didn't leak in my car.\n\nFYI this is an \""order at the counter\"" type of place. This type of superb service was totally unexpected, but greatly appreciated. I was able to eat the rest of my ramen the next day and it tasted just as fresh and flavorful as when it was first served. This was all thanks to the wonderful service of this sandwich shop."
1,"Croque is a very different as well as delightful kind of place.  Legitimately there is nothing else out there like Croque's.  You think it should be some kind of Louisiana style restaurant full of fried Catfish and gumbo like dishes or maybe a French restaurant full of less interesting French food but instead its a place that serves sandwiches, soups and various Asian themed bowls.  They have 18 different kinds of sandwiches that are American, French, Korean and German motif, so there is a lot of variety and each sandwich is of the highest quality.  I've only had the Bulgoki myself(people I've eaten with their have had the Madame and the Tuna but say there were equally amazing) but I've had it in the less traditional \""sandwich\"" form as well as the bowl and the flavor is spectacular, rivaling Bulgoki I've had at excellent Korean restaurants all over the valley.  I'm looking forward to trying the other sandwiches as well as various soups of the day (ex Mushroom Brie looked amazing), overall this is the best new sandwich place around, forget about boring Subway for lunch and try a sandwich worth eating at Croque's"
1,I love when I have to retract a review I wrote.  Especially when it goes from 1 star to 5 stars.  I've ordered a few more times in the last year and it's been right on every time.  The spicy chicken bowl is wonderful... the salads are great.  I haven't made the jump to reordering a sandwich after my last bad experience but I'll get there.\n\nDelivery is fast and friendly.
1,"What a difference a dance class makes in my daughters life!  More energetic, more outgoing, and definitely more tired! \n\nThe whole crew at Bricks love what they do and it shows with my daughter!\n\nThanks again Bricks Staff!  Keep up the KILLER job!!"
1,"The smell of this place when you first walk in the door is heavenly. The essence of smoked meat and charcuterie permeates the interior. Reminds me of the smell of the meat section on the sixth floor of KaDeWe (Kaufhaus des Westens) in Berlin.\n\nThey offer quite a selection of house-made sausage and specialties here. It all looked a bit pricey, so I have not sampled their wursts yet. I have, however, done some great stocking stuffer shopping here--they have a good selection of German grocery items. I was thrilled to find their display of Kinder Schokolade-\u00dcberraschungseier (chidren's chocolate surprise eggs). Everybody (including adults) appreciates the complexity of the prizes you find inside these eggs. Maybe it's because of superior German engineering, but Cracker Jack ought to be ashamed of the prizes they offer when compared to these! The eggs were pricey though... $2.50 a pop (but worth it for the novelty).\n\nI also found myself impulse shopping for German candy Ahoj-Brause (basically fizzing pixie stick dust), mustard-in-a-tube, and Knorr seasonings. With all my Christmas stocking stuffer needs met, I was lucky to get out the door without buying too much more.\n\nI'll be back (\u00e0 la Schwarzenegger) to try the wurst here. The smell of their sausage counter still lingers in my mind..."
1,"The German Sausage company is the closest thing we have to a big city charcuterie in Phoenix.  Our family has been enjoying their homemade ham, lyoner, bratwurst and smoked meats for 30 years.  Their prices are so much more reasonable than the grocery store deli counters and their products are always very fresh.  Walking through the door will immediately transport you to Europe!  Don't miss this Valley gem  - cash or check only just like the olden days!"
1,So glad we found this place! Everything is fresh and tastes just like we get when we are in Germany! Walked out with some fresh warm pretzels last week too!  This is our number one place for authentic German meat.
1,Great service. Very friendly and helpful workers. They got my requests correct and very knowledgeable when I asked questions. My new location.
1,"My fianc\u00e9 and I had great experiences with The Right Touch yesterday. \n\nI scheduled massages for both of us at the same time for a Sunday afternoon. He opted for the Deep Tissue Massage with Traci and I had the Therapeutic Massage with Kelly. It had been a log overdue treatment for me and Kelly was AMAZING. She was gentle yet firm in areas that needed to be worked through and my body felt like butter after it was over. I was also pleasantly surprised that she asked me if I wanted the oil removed from my body. Yes, please! She spent an extra 5-10 minutes cleaning me off with a hot towel and even that process was gentle and massage-like. We will definitely return again soon!"
1,"I was visiting Az and had a the pleasure of getting a massage from Traci. She was awesome made me feel comfortable and worked out some of the knots that have been bothering me. I just wish she was in  the bay area, but next time I'm in Arizona I will be back. The place was very clean and the gal at the front desk was very nice and welcoming."
1,"I work just around the corner from this place so I go there fairly often recently. For my money, it is the best. Very reasonable rates and you don't have to mess with a membership, so I can go often when I can, but then may not go for months. I have seen 3 different massage therapists over the past year and all 3 have been fantastic. I don't even request a particular therapist because I know whoever is working will be be great. I prefer smaller, local businesses. I don't have anything against those large chains, but I'd rather go here. Have been going for a year and a half and have zero complaints. I often walk in since I work so close, but they do get busy so I would suggest calling for an appointment. There's no need to spend what the fancy spa's charge to get an incredible massage."
1,"One of the best massages I've ever received! I saw all the positive reviews and had to see for myself... and YES, they are TRUE! Susie has strong hands and knows how to make you feel relaxed and leave de-stressed! She's been a masseuse for 17 years. I'm already thinking of when I could go back...if you are in town, must see Susie!\n\nThank you for the rockin' massage!!"
1,"The Book Gallery is not your typical book store.  If you want just a basic retail book store, Borders-I shop a lot there-Bookstar, and that type are available.  Book Gallery is something special.  The inventory is of books that one probably isn't going to find in the other stores.  Mike, the owner, buys books for people looking for something t more specific to the areas a person might be interested in.\n\nAs to service, you can receive it at this store.  The employees are more laid back and don't follow the (ninety second rule to say hello) most of the large stores are supposed to follow.  The majority of the customers that come in are coming to this store to look for merchandise they won't find other places. It is enjoyable to see what gem is available there at any given time without being bothered.  However, just ask. and the employees will go out of their way to find what you need from books small artistic items to music.  I will admit that there is one employee I'd rather not have help me but that is a personality thing.  At any time, they will call the Mesa store to see if they have something there and have it in Phoenix in a day or two.  They also will keep an out for something if you ask.\n\nMike, the owner, enjoys buying knickknacks, book ends, and just other small things that make delightful and unusual gifts.  I have a friend that is just so hard to buy for.  I found a small piece of De Grazia sculpture that I didn't even know was made.  The very reasonable price surprised me.  I expected to pay more because many of the things there you can't  buy other places.  I don't consider myself to be a snob.   I have a great time shopping at Goodwill.  I am realistic in knowing I should expect to pay more for something the owner has personally selected for some unique quality.  \n\nConcerning the prices of the books in Book Gallery, they will depend on the merchandise you are considering.  I happen to be a science fiction fan. I always find very reasonable prices on older paperbacks from two or three dollars and up. One day I found a signed copy of one of the Dune series and I paid considerably more.  It only made sense. It cost more than the original price, but  considering the author is dead, how many more are going to be signed-zilch, none!  Besides, how many stores would have it available for purchase anyway..\n\nThis store has another quality that really appeals to me and that is plenty parking!  It's a great place to go browse before or after going to one of the other interesting stores or restaurants in this small center.\n\nSo I am a snob for shopping at a small unique bookstore with merchandise that isn't typical.  Quality means more to me than quantity.  I find quality at Book Gallery.  Check it out!"
1,I went here to get a birthday book for a friend and walked out with 2 huge stacks of books for less than $100!  I got mostly cookbooks and the quality was great as was the prices.  I have a book addiction and am running out of space on my bookshelves but I will be back!
1,"My office is close to the \""Book Gallery\"" and I have always wanted to swing by and check it out. I eventually did a few weeks ago, and I'm really glad I did.\n\nThe selection of rare books is really quite amazing. I have to give a shout-out to the man who helped me, Randy, who not only had an amazing knowledge about their offerings, but also had a genuine enthusiasm for them. I picked up a few books, but I'll definitely be back. A fantastic place to pick out a special gift for a friend."
1,"I am from Chicago & I must say the book gallery compared to others I have seen back home really is amazing. The owner was incredibly nice. \nWhen I walked in I was in awe of all the old books many still on great condition. As an avid book lover this store stole my hearts \n\nThis store has a wide range of mystery, sci-fi, literature, children's books, occult, religious, jane austen, classic, westerns, archeology  & Egyptians which was my favorite sections. Only thing this store doesn't carry is romance, which my mom was looking for but wasn't able to get. \n\nNext time I am in town, I will make sure to stop by the book gallery."
1,"This store is a Phoenix. Spending time here always allows me to bask in the happy energy of bibliophiles that gather together. It's always so much fun shopping for books in this store. Bring a compass and a map and be prepared to get lost in this book lovers paradise! They have almost every book you can think of. You can spend hours just looking at interesting books. A book haven. You can find all sorts of books here.They have awesome events here too, so keep yourself updated. You'll never know if your favorite author or other cool celebrities will be there"
1,"I find it humorous to read the reviews on this store.  It is now has the third highest sales of any Tuesday Morning stores in Arizona while being the smallest.  (I asked)  To accomplish that a store has to be fairly well organized with good service.  I consider this store to be a real gem!  I don't have to pay the prices of Fashion Square or the Biltmore or deal with it takes to find a parking place there either. (Don't get me wrong, I like both of those places as well, I use them just for point of comparison.) Nine times out of ten i can go in there, find what I want and get out if I want to.  The problem is I usually look around a bit and go home with maybe a bit more than I expected.\n\nObviously in a store that carries as man better name close outs in as small a place as it is, one does have to keep a sharp eye out, and maybe do a little digging.  Who cares, treasure is to be found.  I have found this store to be infectious.  Every time I go there I seem to find a better price on something than the time before. Be it something for the yard, gifts for the kids, entirely to expensive sheets for the bed, crystal, monogrammed thank you note's, something for the my cat, Picasso, they are all there and waiting..  I took a friend there the other day who complained they didn't have prices like Goodwill.  The truth is this person is not a shopper and never will be.  If you are a shopper, you'll recognize the quality is at prices that make sense. \n\nAnother minor but really nice thing about the Tuesday Morning stores is the music they play when you are there.  At major dept stores you hear music that has been selected by a team to maximize sales according to critical factors.  The owner of Tuesday Morning picks the music you listen to.  I like his taste and usually find myself humming a tune at some time before I leave which is usually with more than I planned on.\n\nI will talk about the service which is unique to this store.  Depending on the lines of customers waiting to be rung up, they may or may not greet you as you come in.  Usually I find they do.  If you just aren't finding what you are looking for, you might have to to be the one to seek out  one of their people and ask them concerning what you are looking for.  At this point, I am usually very afraid.   They are going to steer me to an area where even if I don't see what I asked for, something will be there that will work.  I just have to decide which or how many!\n\nI haven't discussed the wonderful yellow Clearance signs have I?   I look at prices that really can't be beat on things that I probably will use for some thing  at some time.  If I can't see why they are marked down, or there is a flaw that I can live with,  I have this good habit of buying them.  The result is I never really have to shop for the holiday, birthdays or you name it.  I  dig in the back of my hall closet closet and usually something is there that will suffice.  Tuesday Morning is truly one of the stores that helps keep that closet well stocked.  \n\nVisit this location.  It is worth me starting the great American novel on shopping?!?"
1,"While at Birds n' Beer last Thursday, I learned what \""riparian zone\"" means. It is the strip between land and stream or lake. (Cue the \""The More  You Know\"" clip)\n\nThe center itself is beautiful and great for a small - medium sized event. Lots of modern architecture and what looks like reclaimed materials. It's an eco-friendly building with great native landscaping.\n\nNow to the real part of the review: Bird and Beer is a great event, if you are free on a Thursday night between 5:30p and 7:30p. 5:30 to 6:30 is a chatting/snacking/drinking time with Four Peaks beer in a can. The lecture starts at 6:30 and is very informative. This month was reptile sex and last month was bird sex. The events are usually listed on the events section of Yelp, so check it out now.\n\nThe Center is easy to find. It is just south of the river on Central, with a sign posted on the road pointing towards the building and the parking lot."
1,My cousin just had her wedding here. It was so much fun! Everyone had a good time. The environment is so natural and beautiful. I would recommend it for any event.
1,"Oh, Rubio's! How I love thee! You must put crack in your fish tacos because I think I am addicted. I have no need to try anything else at your fine establishment because the sun rises and sets upon your glorious fishy goodness. Have I had better fish tacos? Almost certainly yes. But there is some indefinable feature of your tacos that draws me back again and again. I feel almost embarrassed by how much I care for you, Rubio's fish taco. But I don't care. I wish the whole world to know how great you are. You had me at first bite. So long for now Rubio's fish taco, but I will be there soon to enjoy your company once more."
1,I just had a fantastic bean and cheese burrito.  The tortilla was so fresh and tasty.  The beans were creamy and well spiced.  There was the perfect amount of cheese.  The meal was fast was well priced and the staff was friendly.  The atmosphere was pleasant and clean.  Great place!!!
1,"This is the best Rubio's in town.  The employees and management are so friendly and accommodating.   I am on the Hcg diet and they work with me to make things I can eat.  Every time I am in Old Town for an appointment I make sure it is around lunch time so I can go to this Rubio's.   The place is very clean and they seem to be very happy working here.  Shout out to Steven, he is really nice to all customers."
1,"Visiting Phoenix from the East Coast, I wanted to savor some authentic West Coast fish tacos.  When I asked where I could find the best, I was pointed to Rubio's. Wow!  I knew with my first bite that I had found heaven!  I had the Original and my hubby had the Especial.  Both were very yummy!  If you're looking for great fish tacos, look no further than Rubio's. \n\nThe service was great, the restaurant was clean, parking was easily accessible, and the prices were very reasonable. Can't ask for anything more!"
1,"The mere thoughts of a barbershop have me reminiscing to the days of my youth, when I had to sit on the booster seat to have my hair cut by Amazio. Amazio is either very old or dead by now, and the vision of an octogenarians with scissors is what comes to mind when I visualize me walking into a barbershop today. Not so at V's Barbershop. I tripped on V's when I was looking for someone to shine my shoes. It turns out that in addition to a fine haircut, V's will include a complimentary shoe shine included in the price of your haircut.  Mr. K, the the one issue I had with your review was you left out some of the extras included in your haircut, like the steam towel, massage, shaving cream trim and razor finish.\n\nV's has now opened another location down by the new AJ's in Chandler next to AJ's on Chandler Heights Rd, so it is now my home town barber shop. My shoes couldn't be happier!"
1,"Old school, classic feel. I searched high and low for the type of barbershop you see in the movies where the mobsters are getting the shave and shoeshine. I finally found it in V's. \n\nThey actually do the shave with a straight blade and the hot towel and shoeshine are complimentary with your cut. I would reccomend V's to any guy looking for a good cut in an atmoshpere where you feel like a local magnate in the community."
1,"I was at the club the other morning, grooming myself after my workout (you know, much like lions and monkeys...picking off the tic's and lice, smoothing my fur using saliva, etc.:-) and I thought to myself, \""I need a haircut:-)\n\nBTW, if I can just digress for a moment...I see things at the club that no person should ever be subjected to...this particular morning was no different...an 85 year old, Grandpa Jones look alike, standing naked at one of the sinks, one leg up on the counter and shaving \""himself\"" in places that I had trouble believing that anyone other him would care about...you just can't \""un-see\"" that kind of thing:(\n\nIf that describes you...please, for the love of god...go into a shower stall or something...I was blinded from seeing this and I spent the next twenty minutes stumbling along, asking for someone to just put me out of my misery, before I managed to grope my way into a shower and boil myself:)\n\nAnyway...I still needed a haircut...(or, I needed to reform my band from 1970...we played a very ragged version of \""House of the Rising Sun\""...and that's about all we played:)\n\nThese days, my choice for sartorial reconstruction is V's Barber Shop...I used to go to Great Clips, but V's  has won me back and won me back for good:)\n\nThis location is everything I want in a great barber shop...a manly experience that simply cannot be duplicated at a \""salon\"":)\n\nNowhere near enough testosterone in any salon...even the unisex Super Clips and Great Cut's:)\n\nThat's not the case at V's...it's all testosterone, all the time:)\n\nThe barbers are all barbers...they may be stylists too, but first and foremost, they are barbers...they know how to cut hair for men and they know how to chat with guys like the great barbers I used to frequent in San Francisco and Portland.\n\nLots of sports to talk about (and flat panel TV's with ESPN on at every station), plenty of magazines to read while I'm waiting for my call to action (and not a Cosmo or Vogue in sight:) and tons of wood paneling and manly smells (I mean witch hazel, talcum powder, etc....not \""pull my finger\"" manly smells:)\n\nAnd, most importantly, they cut my hair correctly...all of the barbers and any of the barbers at V's do a good job...they cut my hair right...as right as my poor misshapen head will allow:)\n\nThat's important to me, because (as I might have mentioned before), I'm not a \""classically handsome\"" man...I'm a little bit \""quirky looking\""...and a decent haircut helps:)\n\nI'm pretty sure that a good haircut is the only thing that keeps the Beautiful Carin from second guessing herself and the (possibly drunken) decision making that led her to select me as her husband (no one ever believes that she proposed to me...I can't believe it myself...but that was a great haircut that I was sporting that day! :-)\n\nSo I'm back at V's and I'm happy to swing by and get my \""ears lowered\"" (a colloquialism that I suppose is lost in the mists of time) and talk football and golf and chicks and other guy stuff with my buddies at V's:)\n\nAnd if you need one, there are even post or pre-haircut cocktails available next door at the Arcadia Tavern...and believe me, sometimes quite a bit of alcohol is required to forget the horrors I've seen in the locker room at the Village:)\n\n\""Involuntary Shudder\""..."
1,"I've been visiting V's on and off since they first opened in 1999. For a while I thought that I needed to pay a Scottsdale stylist big bucks to cut my hair but as I get older I've come back to the realization that a good barber is all I need.\n\nI'm not sure why I ever strayed because I've never had a bad haircut at V's. I've gotten a shave here as well, although I tend to think a straight razor shave is overrated, and I also really appreciate the fact that they offer a shoeshine service. In fact I've stopped in many times just to have a polish put on when I'm headed to an interview or an important meeting.\n\nCurrently I'm working in California so I only get back to Phoenix about one weekend a month, but if I can make it work, I try and hit up V's to get my haircut.\n\nToday I took my two boys with me so we could all get our haircuts. As always the atmosphere was great and the service was excellent. It's fun to see all the other fathers with their sons and I know that when I move back to Arizona permanently this will become a regular event for my children and I.\n\nIf you need a great place to get your haircut, get a shave, get your shoes shined or just to hang out with the guys, head over to V's - you won't regret it!"
1,"I had a great experience at this shop for my very first straight blade shave.  I think her name was Abrila( spelling?). She was great and made me feel at ease. I would highly recommend doing this if you have never done it.  Great way to treat your hard working face! \nThanks,  Dave Lastinger"
1,"Great spot. Alex always does a great job cleaning me up, quick, clean, and professional. If you make an appointment they are always ready right away. If you don't, they are busy so be prepared to wait."
1,"The salon is nice and inviting, has always been a pleasant experience.  Katie is a coloring master!  She definitely knows her stuff and I've always walked away from her cuts and colors a happy customer.  I know at least 20 other people who won't let anyone but Katie touch their hair...she's that good.  Highly recommend her!  Oh yeah, they have goodies to eat and drink while you're there, always appreciated. and some great jewelry...!"
1,"one day i was shopping in one of my favorite stores, LUSH, and i noticed one of the employees had GORGEOUS curls. i complimented her on them and started in with the usual styling product questions. she briefly told me what she used but credited her amazing curls to her stylist, lauren williams at leidan mitchell salon.\n\ni took down the number, but i held on to it for a while before calling. i was loyal to my current stylist. after a few times of inability to coordinate an appointment with her, i gave up and decided it was the perfect time to try out someone new.\n\nit took me a few tries to get in with lauren because our schedules are pretty much opposite, but when i finally did it was worth it. i told her i needed a change and basically gave her free reign over my hair. i went from blonde to red, and i never thought of myself as a redhead but i love it. i don't think i've gotten so many compliments on my hair in my life!\n\nmy next trip she chopped my hair (at my request) and gave me amazing bangs. i never thought i could even wear bangs with my coarse thick curls, but she showed me how to style them and make it work.\n\nlauren is amazing! she even texts me to follow up a few days after my appointment to make sure i'm happy with my hair. i highly recommend her."
1,"Love this salon. Very clean and all of the stylist are very talented. If you are looking for someone new ask for Hannah, she is also the best at extensions. Great local business to support. Very convenient location no matter where you are located in the valley"
1,"Got a Groupon and went to see Amy for a full highlight. Loved her work, the salon is Beautiful, and she was super nice. Every employee at the salon had AMAZING hair so Id trust them all! Amy was quick, but I consider that a good thing! She did great work, and I had compliments from 2 random people in 2 different stores the day she did my hair. I will be going back for my up keep.  Thought about rating her a 4 star bc she was a little hard to get a hold of initially, but Like most of us..she's busy! If you can't reach her right away just text her. (For groupon users her # is the one in the instruction box on how to use your groupon with her. Not the one for the salon at the top) Her work was worth the 5!"
1,I haven't had the food but the agua frescas are amazing.  I had them two days in a row and would go back again and again and again.  The melon is amazing right now.  I went here in LA to get one at the farmers market and it didn't even compare.  I almost cried.
1,This place is the best i allways get the nachos mmmmm the best but if u share the nachos with someone fight to get the mother nacho lol
1,"I love Chipotle. This location, though not as good as the one on Camelback, for whatever reason, is still great.\nThe food always tastes fresh and the ingredients are the above standard. The design of the great, simple, modern and ergonomic.\nChipotle uses only natural meats, not factory farmed hormone injected animals. And some of the beans are organic. \nAlthough the menu choices seem limited, burrito, tacos or bowl, the combinations are endless with the different types of meat, beans, salsas, etc. The menu is more than accommodating to vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike. They serve domestic and Mexican bottled beers as well as fountain drinks. The portions are huge, the burritos could easily be mistaken for a newborn baby wrapped in tin foil.\nNo matter how long the line is, which it is usually really long, you will get your food fairly quickly.\nIt is refreshing to have a business that actually cares and at the same time serve an amazing product."
1,"This Chipotle location always has fresh ingredients and a friendly, attentive staff."
1,"I love chipotle, so good. Sometimes the line is long, around lunch and dinner time. If you've had this place before you would understand why. It's a little expensive but it really good. I just wish they would dive you a little more meat."
1,By the far the most friendly chipotle I've been too! Everyone was more than helpful not to mention the food was amazing and fresh!
1,"Yes, I agree this place is a gem.  I have always had terrific food here (the gyros and salad's  are awesome).  ALWAYS fresh.  A little expensive considering it's a dive (a very clean one though).  And i have had co-workers complain they don't give you enough food.  But giving 5 stars based on the quality of the food"
1,"Awesome food! I dream about the falafel from here. I have tried Pita Jungle and many other places, even resorting to making my own but it is never the same as Elie's. Elie is so warm and inviting as she serves you herself. Prices are a little high but so is the quality. The fries are fresh and so is the meat. The pitas are so soft and fresh, very hard to find pitas such as these. I remember I passed out once here, I don't know if it was from a serious disorder or from me being in so much ecstasy from the food! Remember to bring cash, that is their only drawback."
1,"sitting in elie's right now and i have nothing but good things to say. the food is delicious, the owners are friendly, your order comes out FAST (i got my hummus and falafel pita within minutes of ordering--i barely had time to sit down!).  this is a little hole in the wall deli off 44th and thomas but well worth a visit. i haven't tried the famed gyro yet but i'm looking forward to it!"
1,"Well, I completely agree with Tina!  I went to the Bernina Connection for the first time and was thrilled.  I stumbled on their website and found out that they were open late tonight (Tuesdays only).  They have a wonderful selection of fabrics, notions, and some books.  I was given a newsletter and told I'd be getting emails about sales and classes coming up.  Great customer service - I'm glad to have such a great independent business nearby."
1,I hate this place because Gus my sweetie pie spends a ton of money here. But he always gets good extremely friendly service and the best products along with instruction and occasional repairs on his machines.
1,I have been using Bernina Connection for years to have Bernina sewing machines serviced. They do an excellent job for a reasonable price and they give a discount for bringing 2 machines in at the same time. Everybody here is very friendly and helpful. They warranty their work and I have never had any problems with the machines I have taken there for service.
1,"Very helpful, knowledgable and repairs reasonably priced."
1,"I stopped here for some Hawaiian shaved ice and I ended up buying a water bottle. It's been a long time since I last had some shaved ice but I really enjoyed it from here. Pi\u00f1a Colada is the way to go!  The syrup is all natural, none of that scary artificial stuff. Denise was very friendly and welcoming. She actually takes the time to shave the ice and is not stingy with the flavoring. As I waited around I noticed the different water bottles from liters to gallons. One caught my eye of course, perfect size for my workout days. She even took the wrapper off, rinsed and filled it with ice cold water.  AND, I can stop in at any time for a 35cent refill. Can I do that anywhere else? Nope. Thanks Denise."
1,The best water ever!!!!!!!!! Plus when you go in there you are  like family . Denise is wonderful you get to see the dog and you just feel warm and loved .
1,"What more can you ask for when you walk into this family run joint?  The food is great and there are tons of regulars that it almost feels like a mini version of \""Cheers\"".  The white pizza is particularly fantastic!"
1,"Try the Chicken Parmesan!  It's the best I've ever had? Quite possibly. When I worked in that area we would hit it for lunch once a week. Donna is awesome in a take-no-shit-but-still-take-care-of-you kind of way. She calls it as she sees it and I think that's great. By your third visit she will most likely know what you are gunna order.\nI can't comment on the rest of the menu as I've only ordered the Chicken Parm. Yeah, it's that good."
1,"Calzones!! This has got to be THE best place for a calzone, hands down. Packed full of cheese, wrapped in a tasty crust,  and then, for a few bucks more, add all your favorite meats and tasty morsals...you'll be walking away feeling like you really ate something special."
1,I have been going here since they opened! \nLynn is my favorite! She takes her time. This place gets very busy so I suggest making an appointment!
1,I love this spot! Lisa is is amazing and the girls are all so friendly! I always feel so relaxed when I leave.
1,"These guys are awesome! Had a technical failure with a BMW remote key access and they provided a solution, allowing me to continue my destination. If it wasn't for them this issue would have cost me HUNDREDS!!"
1,"Dexter just graduated from puppy school today.  We've been going for 8 weeks and Lauren, the trainer, was awesome!  Even when Dexter piddled, she didn't get pissed.  Of course, he was the most adorable puppy in class...Ok, most of the time he was the ONLY one in class, but, still...\nThe first few weeks, we were given bags of treats to take home and use for homework.  Yes, homework.  After each class, I was given a hand-out of that week's class to use at home.\nThe class cost $109 for 8 weeks and was sooooo worth it!  Not only do I have THE most adorable puppy in the entire universe, but he's also the smartest.  He's a store favorite.  All the employees learned his name!  Of course, he's a lot like Mommy and went up to anyone looking for some lovin'.  Er...*I* don't do that, but you know what I mean.\nI've heard about other PetSmart's training classes.  This one didn't live up to the horror stories!\nHe'll be going for intermediate classes in the fall.  I guess that's like Middle School.  For dogs."
1,"I have to give 5 stars to the Banfield Animal Hospital at this location. Had a little emergency a couple hours ago- my dogs anal gland had swollen and ruptured in less than 24 hours....they were able to squeeze me in and take great care of her. This location is one of the few open on Sunday's (again, this review is for the hospital, not the actual retail store of PetsMart), so I was glad they could help me on such short notice as they did seem to be pretty busy. Prices were reasonable and the vet techs and vet were all friendly and helpful. Thanks for a great experience"
1,Although pricey...they do an awesome job and you get what you pay for! I've looked into cheaper grooming and the positive reviews compared to negative were not worth me taking my dogs elsewhere!!! Thank you pet smart!!! You guys rock!!!!
1,"Excellent service from a New Jersey born bartender.  Jason has been manning the bar at T Cooks for seven + years and certainly knows his clientele.  Locals and hotel guests fill the lobby on a nightly basis and the live piano playing is icing on the cake.  \n\nAn even better treat than the live piano is the creme brulee cheesecake topped off with an espresso martini.  However, start your night off with a glass of wine and any appetizer from the shrimp sliders to the foie gras.  The fresh bread and pesto sauce is delicious, but don't fill up on it... save room for your choice of paella, scallops, filet, or duck - you can't go wrong.  Even the $14 bleu cheese mushroom burger melts in your mouth.\n\nThe resort itself is a secret 9 acre gem hidden in the heart of Phoenix.  The unique old world architecture and lush grounds are the most romantic in the city... what other resort do you know that has a 'Director of Romance' on staff?\n\nCheck it out... you will not be disappointed."
1,"Normally, I would reserve 5 starts for something that I had been back to, but I'm not sure when I'll be back in Phoenix and the meal we had was really stellar.\n\nCourteous staff, relaxed for a formal place, and all of the food was delicious."
1,"T. Cook's is my favorite restaurant in AZ thus far. I really enjoy the spanish colonial architecture, gardens, water fountains, patio, and charming walk-ways and courtyard. The ambiance is extremely romantic and puts me in a calming, reflective mood. I can seriously see myself getting married @ the Royal Palms. \n\nI've read some of the reviews and I've always had great service here. I remembered one of my dates had asked for a romantic corner to seat at and not only did they give us a romantic corner, but the hostess came with a basket of fresh rose petals and placed them all over our table. My date must have seriously thought he was going to get laid that night by just that gesture alone, but was mistaken, lol. Anyways, I love the lobster bisque-not too salty and just creamy enough. I've enjoyed the Asian pear salad, too which is flavorful and has great texture. But if you're looking for one appetizer to try, definitely get the sauteed shrimp & calamari in an organic yellow tomato sauce Fra Diablo. My mouth just started watering. It's not breaded calamari so it's healthier and also tastes better (5 stars).\n\nAs for the main course:\n\n-Pan roasted duck breast with spiced confit pave, sage gnocchi & roasted butternut squash is 3 stars. I'm not much of a duck person, but the roasted butternut squash was to die for and the duck was tender.\n\n-Wood roasted \""Pulet Rouge\"" checkan with a rosemary polenta cake, asparagus and Swiss chard is 4 stars. Any meat prepared wood roasted gives it a twist in flavor, which I appreciate. I usually ask for asparagus steamed so I'm not sure how the Swiss chard is (gotta watch my figure).\n\n-I've tried their fish (they change their menus from time to time), nibbled on my date's plates and everything has been really good.\n\nI want to try one of their pasta dishes next time when I'm not dieting. The bar area is also super sexy, sleek and mysterious. They usually have a live piano player at night. I seriously could come here weekly for just the calamari and architecture-it's like you're in another world besides the AZ desert. It's become my escape to mini paradise."
1,"T. Cook's continues to be my go-to spot... with or without my fiance.  It's like my home away from home.  I feel comfortable going in for a drink or a bite to eat any night of the week.  Let me be clear about one thing, however - I always sit at the bar!\n\nIn addition to the regular menu items, the burger at T. Cooks is consistently amazing. This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul. Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese, bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now.\n\nAnyone up for a burger?"
1,"Visited T. Cook's on the 4th of July for the first time.  Had lived in PHX/Scottsdale for 2 + yrs and return for visits a few times a year.  What a great spot!  By far the best service, atmosphere and food I've had in Phoenix (outside of Lon's at the Hermosa) in quite some time.  Excellent wine selection.  The specials offered something traditional but also creative.  Recommend the pate appetizer and squash soup for a start.  I ate a filet mignon cooked perfectly but I know their paella is also acclaimed.  Decor is intimate, inviting and not stuffy/overdone."
1,"T. Cook's is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.  I've lived in SF, NYC, and LA, which is where I am from and currently reside.  I haven't had much luck in LA in terms of finding really good \""Western\"" food.  I love LA for its ethnic food. \n\nI've eaten at T. Cook's three times now since I'm staying at the Royal Palms Resort.  Tonight's dinner was OUTSTANDING.  I ordered the sea scallops with shrimp mac & cheese.  It was so good.  Even the accompaniments were delicious - the spinach and the corn kernels.  The corn kernels tasted like they were first soaked in vinegar so it was a nice surprise and really complemented the dish.  For dessert, I had the Napoleon.  It was so delicate.  The crisp was so thin on top of a chocolate mousse.  I loved it.\n\nMy mom had the \n\nI'm definitely coming back next time I'm in town."
1,"This was a special night out as we would normally not be able to afford T. Cook's, however the three courses for $40 was a great deal for us and as long as we are able to take advantage of this special pricing we will be back. \n\nThe ambiance was wonderful. \n\nI had the calamari and shrimp first course, which was delicious.\nShe had the red onion and rosemary soup with havarti cheese, which was also delicious\n\nWe both went with the lobster toretllini which was really tasty and had lots of lobster but some the lobster pieces were a little bit chewy. The tortellini was delicious as was the lettuce that came with it. \n\nDesert was outstanding. We shared the chocolate fantasy - very very rich chocolate that when combined with the  vanila gelato and cherries was a great combination.\nThe caramel cheesecake creme brulee was also fantastic. It was much lighter than the chocolate fantasy, which was very dense. \n\nThe wine suggestions of our waiter went great with the meal. \n\nService was oustanding - they were very attentive and friendly - We never felt rushed and didn't have to ask for anything. \n\nAs I mentioned above as long as we can take advantage of the 3 courses for $40 we will back again. There is so much more of the menu we want to try."
1,"I met a friend for here for cocktails a couple of weeks ago.\n\nWhen I got home and answered the query \""where did you go for drinks?\"", I was reminded by the Beautiful Carin just exactly how long it had been since we had been to T Cook's for dinner...apparently a very long time:(\n\nBecause, while I did remember having dinner there, I couldn't have told you the year or the time of year...luckily, I have the Beautiful Carin to remember these things for me:)\n\nYou know, I don't why we haven't made it back to T Cook's a little more often!\n\nT Cook's is one of those rare places that can genuinely say \""everything is good\"" when you ask for their recommendations:)\n\nMaybe it's just me, but the atmosphere, ambiance, service and food combine in subtle (but effective) ways to create a meal experience that you really don't find very often...T Cook's is a jewel:)\n\nI have heard that they went through a bit of rough patch, service and consistency-wise, but if our dinner last week is an indicator, they have solved any problems that they might have had:)\n\nI was lucky enough to miss any rough spots...3 years between visits will do that for you:)\n\nWe had a 7:30 reservation, and by 7:38 we were drinking perfectly made, ice cold Ketel One martinis at the table, and enjoying our conversation (Carin is one of the most delightful conversationalists you could ever hope to meet...she still keeps me entertained and enchanted...we still have so much to talk about after all this time:)\n\nOnion soup, Lobster Bisque and pate started our meal (and could have completed it...it was so good...fortunately, I'm a big eater:)\n\nCarin had Poulet Rouge (Red Chicken? Seriously, the menu nomenclature people need to re-think that one...When I think of red chicken, I think of salmonella, but that's not what they mean:) \n\nI know, I know... they mean the chicken is red with pecan wood smoke, and it is and it's a terrific dish, but still...the name:)\n\nI had braised short ribs...perfectly done with a marvelous horseradish infused risotto cake:)...Inspired:)\n\nThey also have some very pleasant and tasty sides:)\n\nWe had brussel sprouts (that were nearly as good as the sprouts I make at home:)...and potato puree...and seared Foie Gras...decadent and wonderful:)\n\nI tried to get Carin to have the foie gras with me, but we differ in our opinions about foie gras, and so, I had to take the bullet and eat it all myself:)...That should make my cardiologist buddies happy:)\n\nTime really can stand still when you're having an evening like this...by the time we finished our shared Chocolate Napoleon and coffee, it was 10:30 and way past our bed time:)\n\nBut such a pleasant evening...never any rush from the servers, never a wait for the next course...everything perfectly timed, completely unobtrusive (no, our conversation was never interrupted to inquire \""do you love everything?\"":)\n\nIt was worth staying up late for an evening as pleasant as this...and almost worth waiting three years for, too!\n\nBut we won't wait three more years to swing by T Cook's again...they are just too good and right in the hood:)"
1,"Since moving to AZ we have gone to T. Cooks several times and each time it has been a lovely and delicious experience. \n\nIt's my favorite place to go for brunch. It's pricey and it's not a huge Vegas style buffet but all items are high quality and delicious. Plus, you can order a la carte plus the buffet and the price is the same or just a bit higher than the buffet alone. I also enjoy the decor and ambiance. \n\nWe went for dinner last night and oh my!!! It was outstanding! I knew what I was going to order ( I have an obsession with looking at menus online before hand) but they surprised me with a Farm to Table menu from Chef Lee. The \""theme\"" was pork,yum! And to make it even better, 3 courses for $40.\n \nFirst course was pork belly with frisee greens and a poached egg. It was so goood!! A sprinkle of salt and pepper, crusty bread to scoop the egg and it was like breakfast :D\n\nSecond course, braised pork filled ravioli with bacon, squash, pearl onions. It also had a bit of cheese (Brie?) on top. I loved every single bite of it! It was amazing, the sweetness of the squash, the salty bacon, creamy Brie and the perfectly cooked ravioli bursting with the  braised pork was just heaven! \n\nThird course, goat cheese cheesecake with apple compote and caramel sauce. I'm not a huge fan of apple desserts but the compote was on the side.  I never had goat cheese cheesecake before (surprising since goat cheese is one of my favorite foods:) and this was great, creamy, not as tart. A perfect ending!\n\nThere was a nice lounge singer at the bar, which we were able to listen to while eating in the restaurant. Now that the weather is nice, dining on the patio was very enjoyable.\n\nI recommend T. Cooks without reservation. I'm already looking forward to my birthday brunch there!"
1,"Had a beautiful brunch here. Sat outside among the bougainvillea listening to the many birds (some who had equal sugar packs in their nest?...but that is another story).\n\nWe had the option of trying the buffet which looked very nice but as the menu was looking so good we ordered from there. \n\nI had the Breakfast panzenella which was just what I felt like and enjoyed immensely. It is a traditional Italian dish layered with grilled vegetables, tomatoes, potatoes and topped with two over easy eggs.\n\nMy husband had the Boneless \""Poulet Rouge\"" chicken thigh with roasted tomatoes and fingerling potatoes which he said was very tasty.\n\nWe accompanied our meals with a Bellini and a Mediterranean Bloody Mary - both very good - then we ended it with an incredible tasting French Press Coffee.\n\nOverall there was not one thing to complain about - the ambience, food and service were all 5 star. There was even a guitar player inside the restaurant which is also very beautiful."
1,"T. Cook's is a gem in the Royal Palms Hotel. We recently stayed at the Royal Palms, (which deserves its own review) for a week and dined at T. Cook's 4 times! Once for lunch, three times for dinner, including Christmas which was excellent despite the busy the dining room.\n\nThe setting, both indoors and out is charming. The food was great and we had the best paella since visiting Spain.  Chef Lee treated us royally. We can't wait to get back to Phoenix to return to T. Cook's."
1,"Romance. T. Cook's has it in spades, so much so that the Royal Palms, the hotel that it is located in, has a \""Director or Romance\"". Now how great a job would that be . . . . and guys- no more wondering what to do to impress- just call up and they will take care of it all. \n\nWant rose petals scattered about your table? No problem. How about a poem reader? Got it. Or a private violinist? Again- they will make it happen. They will even put together a private dinner out in the garden for you. \""Ahh. Romance\"", she says wistfully while thinking about her evening. \n\nBut I digress . . .all this talk of romance has overshadowed why I always choose T Cooks for dinner every time I head to the Scottsdale area. It's the food, the bar, the service and of course the ambiance. \n\nEnter this historic Mediterranean villa and you know you are in for a special evening. To the right, the restaurant, to the left, the bar. And not just any bar. Live music is always playing and the bartenders (Jason and Jeremy) are terrific. You can eat at the bar (they have a separate bar menu) but my advice is to wait and eat in the main restaurant. \n\nUsually I ask to sit outdoors- either in the front courtyard around the trickling fountain, or in the back, Tuscan styled gardens. On this night- it was a little cool so we compromised and took a seat by the windows looking out. \n\nWarm, fresh bread is placed on the table with a garlicky pesto sauce. Try not to eat too much as you'll want room for their wide variety of appetizers and entrees. \n\nWe went with the charcuterie plate, plenty of meats and cheeses to start. As for our entree's the sliced ribeye was the pick of the night. But there are plenty of choices from chops, to fish to lamb. \n\nService was spot on (friendly, accommodating, and attentive) and we even got to meet the \""Director of Romance\"", Robert, who made me wish I had known about this service before. Robert asked if we were staying in the hotel (we weren't) for if we were- he said he could work his magic on our room while we ate. It made me want to change hotels, if only for the night! \n\nOur evening ended back where it began at the bar listening to old Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra tunes being crooned out by an amazing duo, while sipping a tawny port and reflecting on the dinner we had just experienced. \n\nThis is not a cheap date.  Dinner for two was around $200 but worth every penny.  Go ahead, splurge.  It's worth it.\n\nAhh. Romance. If you were wondering where it went in your life- check out T. Cooks at the Royal Palms Hotel. It's there, waiting for you."
1,"Wow, great experience!  T. Cook's restaurant located in the royal Palms Resort and Spa in Phoenix is a beautiful place to wine and dine. Their colonial Spanish architecture with a Mediterranean flair is both elegant and romantic.  The Resort and Restaurant are both decorated with hardwoods and cherry woods everywhere with and hand-painted Italian frescoes and beautiful floral arrangements throughout.  The unfortunate thing about my visit, I was there for a business dinner... lol\n\nThe service from start to finish was outstanding.  The bar was fairly busy mixed with Resort guest and people like us just their to dine.  The servers were very attentive and we got our food fairly fast considering the type of restaurant.  The Sommelier was knowledgeable and eager to help us find the right wines to go with our meals. Excellent service all around.\n\nI started my dinning experience with a glass of Chardonnay and Pear and organic mixed green salad.  It was good but I was expecting the pear to be grilled.  For the entree I had a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon recommended by the Sommelier, to go with my New York Strip. I added a side of roasted brussel sprouts with duck confit which was outstanding!  My steak was cooked extremely well and delicious.  I did not have room for desert, but made room for a cup of coffee, which was very good as well. \n\nMy next visit to T. Cooks I plan to bring my lovely bride and have the pan roasted halibut with herb potatoes and local veggies cooked in a red wine butter sauce, YUM!!  It looked really good from across the table : )\n\nI recommend T. Cooks the next time you are planning a nice dinner for two or with some good friends wanting to have a great evening together.  Their wine selection is good and they have an Oktoberfest menu for you German Food fanatics."
1,"Whisk your date away into old colonial Spain, where Mediterranean breezes and flavors waft into your nostrils.  The mood is set with dim lighting, siena and sunburnt vaulted ceilings, cozy fireplaces, and an elegant ambiance.\n\nStart your evening off in the lounge, with its posh leather couches, mahogany bar, antique lamps, and baby grand piano to set the mood.  The menu of specialty cocktails will make any discerning carouser dance with delight.  From the \""Sweetheart\"" with chambord vodka, champagne, and chambord - to the \""Rose Petal Infusion\"" with grey goose, strawberries, st. germaine elderflower, and a rose petal, your lovely lady will be swooning with ardour, or from the strong martinis.  The mixologists here know their libations.  Drinks are poured with the finest spirits and crafted with love, and you pay accordingly for an average of $14.  However, do not let this dampen your spirits as Happy Hour is from 5p-7p, and reverse Happy Hour from 10p-midnight Sunday through Thursday.  Appetizers are half price, featured drinks and wines by the glass for $6.\n\nSo after your palate has been readied for the culinary splendour that is about to meet your lips, try one of the lounge's appetizers or wait until you are seated in the restaurant to be impressed.  The lounge has an eclectic menu which features \""Fruit De Mar\"" (tempura fried calamari, shrimp, and scallops), the very popular Belgian snack of \""Mussels and Frites\"" (mussels dish served with a side of french fries), \""Adana Kebabs\"" served with pita and yogurt, and even an American favorite, the short rib sandwhich.  Average price is $12.\n\nWant to impress your date? Order the Chilled shellfish and bubbles entree right at the bar, as the piano man croons in the background.  This delectable entree comes with maine lobster, king crab legs, jumbo shrimp, and oysters on the half shell, and is served with two glasses of house champagne, for a mere $55.  Now if that isn't the perfect aphrodisiac...\n\nIf dining solely in the restaurant, you will not be disappointed by the first class service, attention to detail, and the fine food that is so lovingly prepared by its chef.\n\nThe meals are split up into courses, and I strongly suggest you do all three to fully explore the tempting Mediterranean treats that this restaurant has to offer.\n\nStart off with the \""Burgundian Escargot\"" (with mushroom raviolis, roasted beets, watercress salad, and vegetable beurre rouge) or the phenomenal \""Crab Cakes'\"" (with house-made chorizo, clams, and roasted clam puree).  Not in the mood for seafood, but still enjoy good belly timber?  Then try the duet of roasted bonemarrow and sauteed sweetbreads served with their housemade brioche and a horseradish infused orange marmelade.\n\nNow you are ready to clear your palate for your main course, something light to pique those tastebuds...the \""lobster fennel bisque,\"" or the unbelievably ambrosial \""Pear Salad\"" with its gorgeous blending of spiced pecans and blue cheese on organic greens.\n\nIf you are a devotee to food, then you have saved room for the main course.  Choose from Chef Lee's Carbonara, (my personal favorite) with garlic cream, pancetta, prosciutto, and egg yolk.  For Spanish fare, there is T. Cook's signature Paella, straight from the fireplace, or a sinful slow roasted lamb stuffed with feta.  Many more seafoods and steaks grace this menu, for an average cost of $32.  You will definitely expect to pay accordingly for the quality, flavor, and love that is put into these amazing dishes.\n\nA dining experience fit for the gods, sure to impress your date, and your palate."
1,Well Lee all i have to say is good job mate.  Great food and great service. Just ask for Brian.
1,"I like to be a little stingy when it comes to five stars, but it is easy to create the perfect meal here.  Our group of five had a fantastic evening.  it is also always nice when someone else is picking up the tab.  We had to wait a bit in the bar before our reservation was ready but the bar is quaint with live music.  The surroundings and restaurant are gorgeous.  I wish we would have sat outside, but inside is nice.  Our group started with a sampler of appetizers.  We shared the antipasto platter with locally made cheeses, and in house cured meats and pickled vegetables.  The restaurant is making a very good farm to table effort.  We also had crab cakes and the super amazing carbonara for an appetizer.  Needless to say we were stuffed before the food even came.  I had the bisque which was good not as great as I expected given the reviews.  Everyone was very pleased with the food.  The only dessert we had was a complimentary birthday carmel cheesecake creme brulee.  AMAZING, I watched my husband devour it and he doesn't like cheese.  I was shocked and a bit jealous that I only had one bite, but it was his birthday.  I would go back just to get another shot at the desert menu.   Service by Bill excellent, he never had to ask what we needed it just appeared."
1,"This is my first fancy restaurant in Arizona, and it certainly deserves to be one of the best; one I will return to for special occasions. \n\nMy wife picked it as a romantic spot for her birthday, and it didn't disappoint. \n\nThis place is awesome. You drive in, the palm-lined circular driveway instantly transports you elsewhere. The valet takes your car, and you pass through passageways of intricate lighting patterns. Warmly welcomed into the dining room, which is surrounded in brick, long drapes, and exposed beams to give a classy but comfortable feel. The chairs have nice comfortable cushions for a long stay. \n\nWaitstaff were all friendly and as fast or laid back as you want them to be. \n\nOne thing that I really note is the bread course. Is the bread hot or cold? How is it served? Here, a small loaf of Italian bread with the signature dustings of flour, signifying an \""artisan\"" bread, was served with a small bowl of fresh pesto sauce. The bread was hot, the crust crispy, the sauce deelish. It was a good omen. \n\nThe food was all first-rate. While I had a vegetarian string: yummy Quorn empenadas, pear salad, and the delicately fried stuffed squash blossoms, my wife had the escargots napoleon (she loved it), the lobster bisque (which I tried--great flavor), and the Meditteranean Lamb. I also had a side dish of potato puree--creamy garlicky heaven! \n\nIt is an expensive place, but I would say it is worthwhile, and definitely good for a special night. The food was delicious and servings reasonable: if you get all the courses, you can actually take some home! The dessert menu was quite extensive, too. I think enough to please everyone. I definitely would go back sometime--just make sure you have money in the bank, know what I mean?"
1,"Came for the amazing brunch.\n\nWhat I love about their brunch is the options.  For $33 you can get their buffet brunch which includes the better than usual goodies: omelet station, crab legs, already peeled shrimp, lox, fresh fruit, warm breads, various salads, waffles, grilled veggies and a dessert bar.  \n\nNow to mix it up, they also offer delicious items off their menu.  These dishes range from $10 - $15 a plate, but are fantastic and large.  \n\nHowever, if you want to then add the brunch buffet to your menu selection, you can pay an additional $23.  So, in essence, you can get the $10 pancakes and the $23 buffet, and pay the same price as getting the stand alone buffet.  \n\nI got the banana-pecan French toast off the menu.  OMG, it was perfect - especially with the warm \""real\"" maple syrup.  \n\nService there is great and very attention driven.  Even my napkin would be neatly folded by the time I returned to my seat.\n\nWe came for a birthday and they had inscribed a nice note on top of the piece of dessert.  A very nice touch.\n\nI also love the ambiance and the grounds of the Royal Palms property.  It's gorgeous there."
1,I continue to be impressed by T Cook's happy hour.  The key is to have Connie as your server so that you can avoid the service problem mentioned in my previous review.  I'm moving up to 5 stars because of her.  Here are my 3 favorite happy hour appitizers:\n\nTuna Putanesca - Seared tuna served chilled over a classic warm Italian olive & caper \nGrilled brie served with Como Batard bread & jalape\u00f1o \nZa'atar spiced edamame
1,"First time at T. Cooks for brunch was amazing. Rebecca was great, we will definitely go back to see her and enjoy the food!"
1,By far THE best cucumber martini around. Very light & fresh. The only thing that would make it better is if they would put a thin slice of cucumber on top instead of a wedge of lime.
1,We had a fabulous lunch for four today at T. Cooks and I can't rave enough about the food and the excellent service.  The four of us tried lots of lunch dishes and then passed portions around to share. Yum to everything.  T. Cooks has always been our go to special event place and this experience was another triumph.
1,"Hard to say exactly what you should order, but i've eaten here 5+ times, all three meals.  the service has always been superb.  We typically eat here when we stay at Royal Palms, so having a $50 meal credit softens the blow.  Dinner IS pricey...\n\nPresentation is obviously big here.  Portion sizes are just right.  you won't be stuffed...you will have room for 3 courses.  \n\nI generally order something unique here.  not your typical \""filet\""...go to Donovan's or Dominick's for that.  I think entree's are best.  Apps/soups are #2.  Dessert usually isn't the best part of the meal here.  they almost try too hard with the desserts.  they need to find a couple staples for dessert and make them home runs...i just haven't found that (yet).\n\nBeet salad.  butternut squash soup.  antelope.  lamb.  scallops.  all winners.  enjoy"
1,The food was absolutely amazing and the live band was the cherry on top!! What a great date place. This restaurant has such a nice ambience and we could not have asked for any more. And a special thank you to  Bridget L. for making our experience that much better!!
1,"Customer service here as in the whole of Royal Palms is nearly through the roof great, at times even bordering on obsequious. Service was not quite excellent, but it's really great. Had dinner here and ordered tasting menu ($40) and accompanying libations ($20). The tenderloin was pretty much the best tenderloin I've ever eaten. The beet salad was delicious and the cheesecake was thick and creamy. My bf had the antelope (!!) which he thought was great, cooked to perfection, tender and tasty.The accompanying drinks were interesting and fun, but I'm not a big drinker so I reached my limit pretty early. \n\nI don't know about y'all who are complaining about portion sizes, portions are normal-sized and VERY filling. If you're used to strapping on the feedbag at a buffet, then you may be disappointed, but the bf was happily full and I left STUFFED and quite happy. \n\nI highly recommend!"
1,"After reading other posts, I had a sense this spot might be hit or miss.  I was pleasantly surprised to be mistaken.  It was a perfectly aimed bulls eye.  My buddy and I enjoyed the foie grais sizzling on a hot rock (if you like fg, this is a must!), a lobster noodle dish, the rib eye, lamb pasta, brussel sprouts, mushrooms and fine wine.  The service was impeccable and the decorum was chic as well as relaxing.  While all was spot on, the desserts were the crowning achievement.   We had the chocolate banana caramel mousse as well as a waiter special, dark chocolate peanut butter bars.  I don't make this statement lightly....the dessert was the finest I've ever had."
1,Get the asiago cheese bagel with sun-dried tomato cream cheese!!!!!!!!!
1,My daughter and I had a yummy breakfast. Fast service. Coffee is delicious. Bagel skinny sandwiches were good.
1,"This review is long over due.   I grew up in AZ and now live out of state.  I still have a lot of family and friends in AZ so anytime I need to order flowers I always order through Phoenix Flower Shops.  I've never had an issue and the flowers I've ordered (over the internet) and they have always looked just as beautiful as the pictures which you can't say about a lot of flowers you order online.  \n\nRecently I placed an order for a friend and used some of my reward points on my order.  To be honest I've never watched how many points I had etc.  To my surprise 2 days later I received an email from PFS saying they had redeemed too many of my points for my order and for the inconvenience they were going to replenish the points and also gave me additional points for the mistake.  How often does that happen?  That truly is was customer service is all about, fixing a mistake before I even realized it, more business could learn from this.  I sincerely appreciated the email and the effort made to \""make it right\"".  There are other businesses you can call on a mistake and beg for a simple solution.  \n\nI have used PFS for years and will continue to do so.  They truly define customer service and create exceptional beautiful work!"
1,"I stop in from time to time for fresh stems for the house.  The flowers are fresh and high quality, and the staff is very friendly.  They will stop what they are doing to come and help me out with the selection process every time (even though it's typically a low dollar purchase) - Tip: Fridays are half off day for floral stems.\n\nI don't send arrangements all that often, but the next time I do so in Phoenix, it will be from Phoenix Flower Shops!"
1,"Superb service. That's a big deal when it comes to your teeth. \n\nI had to have a root canal, ugh. But the doc and his assistant made it as painless as a root canal can be. Plus, they call ahead of time to remind me of my appointments. They also called after wards to make sure I was doing okay. \n\nDuring the procedure, they'd check to see if I was hanging in there. The assistant was also kind enough to tell me what they were doing. Whenever I asked prior to my appointment on how long each visit would take, they would give me a fair estimation. I really appreciate that - so I can plan accordingly. \n\nAnother big thing is the wait time. Talk about nada. When you're appointment is at 3 p.m., you can be certain you'll be taken care of on time. Right on. Nobody likes to wait, especially when it comes to the dentist."
1,"Just got back from Ingleside Animal Hospital and I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers. The building is just lovely. I love how big and spacious it is. Some vet offices are so cramped and just not enough room to avoid other dogs. \n\nMy beautiful girl dog happens to not like too many other dogs so I usually HATE taking her alone to vets because it's such a hassle to care for her, fill out paperwork and try to keep other pets away from her. Definitely NOT the case here. She did so well with three other dogs in the room. \n\nThe staff was very nice and helpful. Dr. Bart listened to me and I really enjoyed the whole visit. So did Dee minus her getting her temperature taken. Haha. I did feel pressured to get unnecessary test or meds.\n\nOne of my other favorite parts was when it came to pay the bill. It was ACTUALLY fairly priced!!! What? Isn't that just crazy? A place that actually cares for the animals and doesn't overprice every little thing like 'oh your dog went the bathroom outside here's a $300 bill'. Nope, there was none of that. When the nice lady at the front told me the price I was taken back and in shock. A vet visit, exams and meds for less then $130!!! That's awesome!!!"
1,Dr Serbin always finds the time to squeeze my dog family in when there is an emergency. He ALWAYS follows up the next day; its nice to know he cares.  I love the follow ups because he'll listen to your concerns if you have any and recommend coming back if need be.  Ingleside Animal Hospital is very close to my family and has seen us on our worst of days; they are very understanding and will even offer up a hug if you need one.  They were very comforting to our last dog that we put down and even sent a card to my family in our hard time.  We have been going to Dr Serbin for the past 8-10 yrs (?) and I wouldn't have it any other way!!!
1,"Wow! Shocked that I was able to call in for a last minute check-up as a new patient and they were able to see me in 15 min...\n\nThis vet is very close to where we live, so I think we found our new vet. All the staff was super friendly - - which is typically the case of any vet office. \n\nBut yes, I agree with the other reviews - - nice, organized, clean, and large open environment.\n\nLucy had a nice first visit today. :)"
1,We have been taking our pets here for over 15 years.  Bunnies....kitties...all get treated with love and respect.   Fantastic new building...super comfortable for you and your lil ones.  \n\nCan't recommend them high enough!\n\nJon
1,"Ingleside Animal Hospital was able to accommodate my dogs for a same-day appointment, even though they had never been there before, out of concern for their health. We arrived about ten minutes early and were immediately escorted into the exam room. I was pleased with the hospital's service and cleanliness. For exams and antibiotics for both dogs, I walked out with a bill for the same amount I used to pay for one dog at my old vet."
1,"Update: Found the time to take the dog to the vet myself (instead of sending others). The office was clean, new, and well lit. Everyone was really nice. I feel confident he is getting the highest quality of care and would not hesitate to recommend this clinic to others.  \n\n6/26/2012 :The receptionist---who answers the phones, books the appointments, and makes the reminder calls--was kind and a good listener. I found him efficient and polite. My sister reports that although our dog liked the vet, my sister found her condescending and brusque. My sister is refusing to go back there. However, since my dog liked the vet, I will just keep sending him there and have my husband take him."
1,"We were in need of somewhere that would perform euthansia and on a Sunday. The staff is wonderful and so very supportive and understanding. They explained the procedure and very efficient. When we pulled up, they were waiting for us and had a room ready for us to go into. It was a very calming experience and they gave us all the time we needed to grieve. I would definately recommend them. Dr Bart was very caring. As difficult and heartbreaking as this was,they made it a little easier. A week later, we received a sympathy card which was signed by the whole staff....such a personable touch and it meant so much to us."
1,After my cat was severely injured I rushed to this hospital for immediate care. The entire staff was not only professional and nice but they really care about your pet. \n\nThe Dr thoroughly went over every single detail and was straight forward about everything. He followed up me with several times checking on my pet and going over the procedures he had done and what to expect and look for in the future. I couldn't have asked for better care and true concern for my baby.\n\nThank you Ingleside!
1,"I love the bar at the Royal Palms, not far off the beaten path, yet in a world unto it's own.\n\nYou can easily pass the entrance as you cruise down Camelback.  Once you turn into the drive way the valet team greets you to park your car. On the way to the bar, stroll through the lovely garden/fountain area - as you step into a more tranquil time.\n\nThe bar has a number of nooks & cranny's, four cool seating sections - the fireplace room, the tables along the windows bordering the garden, the spacious corner and up at the bar. The entire property has an early Arizona motif which is consistent in the bar with comfy chairs & couches and a wonderful mix of floor tiles.\n\nCaitlin, our waitress was welcoming and  crisp with her spot on recommendation's.  Pork  flatbread, was a stand out appetizer with a flavorful consistency of meat, cheese and mushrooms. The Bergstrom Pinot,  a real treat, was a nice compliment to our food.\n\nThis gem of a hideaway was the perfect spot for a light bite and glass of vino on a rainy Monday night."
1,"If you're going to eat til your sides hurt, it's good to get an early start!\n\nThanksgiving in Arizona was a wonderful experience thanks to the feast we had here. We arrived at 11:15 and sat down for a 2.5 hour buffet enjoyed in their sunny side patio. This was my first time here and it's amazing to know that their renovations are fairly recent because you would never guess it! The Spanish style tile roofs, huge trees and beautiful overhanging Bouganvilla really set the tone for this place. It has so much character and thought put into the layout, you can't help but feel relaxed.\n\nThanksgiving Day brunch was wonderful! (If only you could take some home for leftovers!) Although I did miss doing some cooking of my own, I have to admit it was nice to skip out on grocery store madness and be pampered for a change! We finished 4-6 plates (the guys ate more!) from their cutting station: turkey, of course, pesto topped salmon, and prime rib, made to order omelettes, salads, and desserts. My only critique is 3 of us got a bowl of squash soup and it was so salty none of us could eat it. Must have been a fluke because the rest of the meal was delicious. They definitely have hired the best. Everyone we came in contact with was friendly, gracious and made us feel right at home. And in case you missed their Thanksgiving buffet or you want a repeat performance of their awesome spread, you can go a month later for their Christmas smorgasbord. \n\nI would love to stay here next time. From what I learned, each of the rooms were decorated by a different interior designer so they are all unique. As I was sitting in the courtyard, I couldn't help thinking, this would be a beautiful place for a wedding! (Don't tell the BF I said that!)"
1,"You have to do this. If you are reading this that means you are thinking about it. Stop thinking. Do it. Impossibly romantic this Scottsdale hideaway is understated, intimate and refined. Curving walkways through bougainvillea and honeysuckle camouflage casitas and villas all with private terraces. The rooms are Mediterranean Spanish with fireplaces and comfortable sitting chairs at the base of the massive bed. Go for the designer casitas. No two are alike. They are all amazing. The entire resort is filled with nooks and crannies where you can find solitude and luxuriate with a cocktail while you soak in the scented breezes and warm sun. It's like a private residence you have to yourself with a few others. The service is over the top good. Room service twice a day including turn-down with ice buckets and spring water. Need your car? Make one call and it's waiting at the entrance. The spa is small but you have it to yourself. Steam room, jacuzzi, massage. Do it again before martinis and a fabulous meal at T. Cooks, the on-site four star restaurant. In short, for a three day romantic getaway, there is no place I'd rather be than the Royal Palms."
1,"I am only reviewing the Restaurant and Bar area.  This place is perfect, they get everything right, the visit to Royal Palms for dinner was the highlight of my trip.\n\nReservations are met to perfection, the atmosphere is super classy without being over the top.  Service is top notch.  Food is great quality and fairly priced.\n\nAs I usually do, I will keep it short - GO HERE for drinks and a dinner date."
1,Loved this place...took my mom for mothers day and we were there for 5 hours getting wonderful services and had lunch by the pool. Cant wait to go back
1,"I spent the day at their spa and then got a 75 min massage. I don't splurge often and do spa days about once a year. Even though I have not been to many spas, I have to say, this is one of my favorites! I spent my time before my massage relaxing by the pool and drinking a couple of mixed drinks. The service was spot on coming by only when I looked up and the pool was nice and relaxing. I went on a Sunday and loved that it was not packed full of people. its not very relaxing when you have to be a vulture for a nice bed with shade, which I've experience in some previous spa days. The women's jacuzzi was private and quite lovely. it was outside, but the water was cool enough to relax in. And the massage was so soothing. With my nerves right now, this truly hit the spot."
1,"There is no surprise this hotel is #1. The property is amazing. Location is perfect. Service is outstanding. Food is delicious. The Spa offers some of the best services Ive ever had. Cant wait to go back!\nNote: Service charges are included with everything including your car service, so no need to tip!"
1,"There is a place, not so far away, where the wine is delicious and the tranquil sounds of divine music play. Should you arrive at this place with a desire for stomach satisfaction, the food will provide the vehicle for your satisfaction. My family came here to have dinner prior to going to Zoo Lights. Our guide was friendly and gentle. Ryn is the best and was able to direct our choices as to food and drink. We had the pizza which was okay (a little soggy) and the vegetabe plate and the hot dogs with fries and fruit. The place is best with just you and someone that you want to pounce on (super romantic) however, they are kind to children as well."
1,"When I think Royal Palms, I think romantic getaway. A quaint yet exquisite resort, the Royal Palms was built in 1929 to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat. Colonial as in when the Spaniards were conquering the New World.  All of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards.  \n\nWe had heard some great things about J Cook's and decided to spend a leisurely Sunday morning dining on the patio. If you're looking to be treated like royalty, you want to dine here\n\nI enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at J.Cooks.  The staff are incredibly accomodating.  What an ideal location for an intimate stay-cation!  It's a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers, I will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer!"
1,"Totally loved it!  It's so quaint and charming.  I have been to some of the best hotels in the world, and this place rocks!  Here we go:\n-charming and professional.  Not uptight like the Ritz Cartlon.  Very, very personable staff\n-amazing food and will do special meals like vegan and gluten free.  Breakfast served at 6AM and coffee bar open.  So nice to be served early as some hotels have client wait till 7AM\n-wonderful conceirge who helped me w local restaurants and hiking \n-amazing spa.  It's like you have the place to yourself and the staff knows what they are doing\n-really nice gym w great equipment\n-little nocks and crannies of fireplaces, fountains and outdoor spaces.  I want my house to look and feel like this!\n\nI hope I get back to Phoenix just to stay here again."
1,"The experience lives up to the expectation set in its name. I was lucky enough to have my wedding at the Royal Palms and must say that the experience from start to finish was spectacular. Set against the backdrop of Camelback Mountain, the setting is simply stunning. We had our wedding reception in the Estrella Room with the cocktail hour in the courtyard in front of the room. \n\nBefore getting married here, I was told by anyone I spoke to that the wedding food is by far the best they've ever had anywhere else. I completely agree with this statement. The food is a culinary masterpiece. It doesn't taste like your typical catered food. It tastes like the food they serve in T Cooks, if not better! Everything you eat, down to the bread and pesto dip is extraordinary.  \n\nThe service is about as extraordinary as the food. I worked with Suzanne who was extremely helpful from start to finish. Each bride and groom gets a \""shadow\"" for the wedding day. Our shadow was the fabulous Christy and followed us around while we took pictures and throughout the whole night and made sure we had cocktails, food and any other help throughout the night. She even helped me in the bathroom with my large wedding dress! I can't say enough about Christy and how helpful she was throughout the night. She was calm, comforting and helpful throughout the whole night. \n\nI will end this review by saying that \""you get what you pay for\"" and while the Royal Palms is on the pricier end, it's worth every penny and they make sure they work for their money. Everyone is kind and helpful and I couldn't imagine getting married anywhere else.\n\nBesides the wedding experience, I was also lucky enough to stay at the Royal Palms the night before and the night of the wedding. I highly recommend staying in the Valencia Casita #125. It's got an adorable courtyard, little sitting area, a small kitchen and a nicely sized bedroom. The rooms are intimate and have a lot of character. The grounds are extremely relaxing and lovely to just walk around and take in. \n\nI have also been a guest at their spa and must say that it's a relaxing and luxurious experience! The staff is friendly, the amenities are very nice and everything is completely relaxing."
1,"This review is specifically for the Alvadora Spa...and even more so for Mariah who gave me the most incredible facial I have ever had in my entire life. Ladies and gents - if I were you I would definitely take advantage of the $99 summer promotion and treat yourself to a truly rejuvenating experience. I've had a number of facials in my life but I've never had an aesthetician actually stay in the room while the masks were drying and give upper back, cranial, arm and hand massages nor have I ever had luxuriously warm rehydrating hand mitts during the process of a facial. My skin has a new, refreshed glow to boot. This is the pinnacle of facials - I will never go anywhere else!"
1,"The best and most intimate resort in Phoenix. Stayed here for my wedding night so of course this is a special place fore but believe me we had many places to choose from. The rooms are beautiful, grounds are intimate and well kept and the staff will go above and beyond to meet your needs. I have not gone to the spa personally yet, but purchased a massage for my mom for Mother's Day and she loved it."
1,"This review is for the Alvadora Spa at the Royal Palms Resort.  My friend planned an amazing weekend in Scottsdale and our day at this resort was relaxing and fun.  This Spanish-style resort is quaint with a very European feel.\n\nI had a deep tissue massage, and it was among the best I've ever had.  Even better is that with any treatment, you can enjoy the rest of the resort for the balance of the day.  Coming from the Chicago winter, we chose to lay by the pool, basking in the Arizona sun with a couple of cocktails.  Perfect way to spend a girl's weekend away!"
1,"I stayed in a Valencia casita and it was cozy luxury, featuring a high bed, private patio, dramatic lighting, reliable temperature controls, intimate pool, Mediterranean meets southwest decor, and an overall boutique experience. Lovely!"
1,"This is a wonderful intimate boutique style hotel where everything is a close walk, not long distances  like the large resort style hotels.  The service is impeccable throughout.  It is situated in the middle of Scottsdale close to everything, but you feel like you have been transported to a place in colonial Mexico or Tuscany, the gardens awe amazing We stayed in a room that backed up to the street and one could hear traffic in the mornings, but this did not bother me in the least.  I will definitely return to this gem."
1,"This resort makes me feel like I have died and gone to heaven.  I didn't want to ever leave.  The pool area is so lovely and quiet is feels like a sanctuary -not at all like the noisy pools at most resorts.  And then there is the restaurant, T.Cooks, which is amazing!  An outstanding menu by a talented chef and the ambiance of dining in a Mediterranean villa.  Staying here is a real treat!"
1,"Amazing.  I did not stay at the hotel , but I did visit the Alvadora spa.  This spa was very warm and inviting.  I liked the fact that it was indoor and outdoor, with plenty of natural sunlight.  I used the eucalyptus steam room, and private outdoor jacuzzi prior to my treatments.  I enjoyed that these facilities were separated from the men's facilities.  The treatment room was lovely, with floor to ceiling plantation shutters that offered just enough light.  Sometimes I feel like I am in a cave when getting a massage, so this was a welcome change.  The therapist, Jennifer, was an absolute delight.  Knowledgable, professional, and a great conversation.  She did both my massage and facial.  She gave me wonderful tips on skincare, and even taught me an exercise to stretch my back after a long day at work.  The rest of the staff was very pleasant and accommodating as well.  The products used were animal, and environmentally friendly.  I will be back for sure!"
1,My wife and I went here for a weekend getaway . Very nice rooms . Great restaurant and bar .Excellent service . Very accomindating . It's small in relation to the Fairmont Princess but much more intamate.Would go back in a second.
1,"Absolutely wonderful no words can describe the tranquility I am feeling. Great staff, immaculate, and will receive serious pampering.  You deserve it. Go"
1,"This is a great place for a staycation!!!  It really feels like you are at a Mexican resort.  We went in July and got good use of the pool.  It is smaller, but served it's purpose of relaxation and had really attentive service.  The rooms are very nice and romantic.   They have a great lounge with live music and excellent mixologists.  I didn't get a chance to try the  restaurant, so I will definitely return for that, as I have read and heard great things.  If I remember correctly, all tips are included so no need to worry about awkwardly pulling out your wallet.  Highly recommend!"
1,"Cars. Haven't owned many of them. I've ridden subway cars for most of my life. When a car did need some work there was always a man around (Dad! My brother!) to handle the fixin'.\n\nYes. That's the sexist truth. So after hearing a number that made me gasp from a Ford dealer I turned to a dude. He recommended Spitfire Automotive. Actually, who he recommended was \""Mike Carlton on Indian and near you.\""\n\nCan I tell you next to useless this bit of information is on Google? (Still shaking my head on that one.) Anyhoo, I finally found the owner. With such a glowing referral (the dude had used him to fix his off road racing bikes many, many times) I figured, \""Eh. Ok. Besides, what do I know?\"" And it was conveniently close.\n\nAfter speaking to Mike to confirm his hours of operation I dropped my car off. His team was able to look at my car the next day of operation. They confirmed the diagnosis the dealer made lickity split. I was shocked, there's no way to emphasize the level here, but SHOCKED when Mike called with his estimate. The difference was substantially less *and* my car was going to be ready the very next day.\n\nLet me say that last part again:\nMy car was going to be ready THE NEXT DAY.\n\nI don't know the location of the magical unicorn tree where Mike grows Ford dealer parts. But my car, Bear, is so very happy. No need for a rental car, so I was happy too! \n\nSpitfire Automotive is family owned and operated. It was opened in 1958 by Mike's grandfather when Indian School was a two-way dirt road. Currently the shop handles automobiles and motorbikes. There are plans to move motorbike repair to a northern Scottsdale location (74th St & Butherus Dr.) where it will be called \""Dirt Riders West\"". Motorbikes can be purchased at Spitfire Automotive. While there I got my first up close and personal look at something called an off-road Beta Motorcycle 300.\n\nThe next part will make men groan. (Ok. Maybe some women too!) I'm looking at the bike and I think. \""Hmm. It's ...red.\"" I don't know! These are things that go thru my head. That, and, you better gosh darn write a review for this place. It's girl friendly. Manly place, but girl friendly. \n\nOh! And efficiently fast!"
1,"Ok, apparently I'm the one breaking ranks here.\n\nAfter I bought my house, I had a housewarming party and I bought a cake from Tammie Coe. It was 50 bucks and people said I was crazy for spending that kind of money on a cake. That was almost 2 years ago, and people still remember how awesome freaking good that cake was. My grandma sat on the back patio with a slice, a glass of wine and a cigarette and looked like she had died and gone to heaven. I don't remember if this location is like a caf\u00e9. I don't think so. But she has a location on Roosevelt and 7th St. in downtown Phoenix and that one I believe does. All great cities need great desert shops, and Phoenix has one of the best."
1,I love Tammie Coe Cakes
1,"I am writing this review strictly on the cupcakes, I have not and do not wish to try anything else, but the cupcakes are amazing.  \n\nMy friends and I had a cupcakes and champagne party for my birthday - everyone brought cupcakes from different places around town for a side-by-side taste test and Tammie Coe's Ooey Gooey's won hands down.  Warning: If you do not like frosting, you will not like Tammie Coe's Cupcakes.  There isn't a ton of frosting, but a fair amount so if you are one of those that likes scant amounts of frosting, this isn't for you. \n\nOther notables from Tammie are the Coconut and Red Velvet - they are always crowd pleasers.  Great frosting, great cake and wonderful colors/designs, Tammie Coe's are great to take or have at a party....or even have LGO deliver to your car on your way home from work. :)"
1,"Not cheap, not healthy, but nothing better.  In this crazy world of cupcakes on every corner, Tammie Coe does it right.  Simply put- right combination of cake and icing.  Love them.  Don't ask/worry about the price, just order and em."
1,"On Saturday two friends and I were in Old Town Scottsdale for lunch. We were craving dessert and a friend suggested LGO. Friend no.1 had her eye on a dessert at LGO. Nothing caught our eye for me and friend #2. I'm familiar with Tammie Coe, but have only had items of hers from Whole Foods or AJs.  I saw the sign and suggested Friend no. 2 and I walk over. The minute friend #2 and I walked in Tammie Coe's we were welcomed with open arms. We enter only to see not the regular bakery atmosphere, instead Ammie and two others are working away at creating delicious yummies out in the open.  She asked what we were craving and we mentioned \""CHOCOLATE\"" something LGO didn't have that day. Tammy walks over, gives us a sour cream sugar cookie and OMG! amazing. I ordered the ooey gooey and it was delicious! As we were leaving Tammie gave us a sample of buche de noel, this delectable treat was maybe the best dessert i've ever had. As mentioned before I've heard of Tammie Coe but I had no idea how involved she is in her business. She was friendly, inviting and a true delight. Tammies desserts were wonderful but her warm personality and hospitality were equally delightful."
1,"I really like Carsten Salon, Ally in particular.  The desk staff have improved and are not any more snooty than at any other high-end salon.  It seems to go with the territory in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  I had tried severl other salons over the last few years trying to save money (Great Recession) but really think Carsten is the best salon in Phoenix.\n\nReally my loyalty is to Ally, she always gives me a perfect cut.  She is super nice and I've missed her.  If Ally left I would probably leave too, but for now I'm glad to be back."
1,"I have always been self-conscious about my receding hairline until Morgan cut my hair. She made me aware that I could show my hairline and that it was only natural for it to be receding \""a little.\"" Because of my new haircut I feel more confident. Thank you Carsten Salon :)"
1,"Having grown up in Europe, if there is one thing I truly miss is high quality sandwiches. Nothing wrong with Subways, but the quality of the bread, despite being made several times a day seems to be very cardboardish. Sack's was close to were I worked and has so far been my favorite sandwich place in Phoenix. Always a but crowded and busy, maybe noisy for some but I'd rather be in a place that feels busy and alive than the only one eating my sandwich. My  favorties are the Improv and the Gothic (warm sandwich). All sandwiches comes with a little cookies which is always pleasant I find. Only negative and I'll admit to ignoring the suggestion is that there is a sign by the owners that ask those who have \""regular\"" sized cups to not refill. Not very customer friendly I think. But, and I ask the manager/owner from time to time I really do wish they would open one up in Scottsdale. Prices are probably a bit high, it comes with the neighborhood but I do think the quality of the sandwiches make up for it."
1,"I love Sacks and will go out of my way for lunch here!  \nEvery time I eat at Sacks, I order something different. Sometimes it's a regular from the main menu, and sometimes it's one of their creative daily specials. I've never been disappointed. Fresh ingredients and fantastic flavor, created and served quickly by their super friendly staff in a casual cool ambiance."
1,"Mama Java...often the highlight of my day! \n\nOk, so i might be a bit of a caffeine addict and while i am sure that contributes to feeling good almost every time i walk in the door at Mama Java, it is also the coffee and the staff that make me smile.  Best coffee, truly!  Jensy and Billie (the baristas) are sweet, fun, friendly and truly coffee prodigies.  I am sure they will have their very own coffee shop someday soon but for now I am happy to give them my $4.06 everyday like clockwork!!"
1,"I love Mama's!!!!!\n\nMy family and I walk over to Mama's all the time... the coffee is great, the staff is cool, & the owner always comes out and gives our puppy treats. This is a cool little coffee house... a refreshing break from the corporate \""coffee\"" joints.\n\nThanks Mama's!!!"
1,"Love this place!  They're so friendly and the coffee is fantastic.  I'm a sucker for Starbucks because of the drive thru... but the more I visit Mama Java's the more I remember just how bad Starbucks really is.  If you haven't visited this place yet, do it!"
1,"New in town, I had heard nothing but good things about Mama Java's, so since I live half a mile up 36th, I decided to walk down and try it for myself. I walked in and was immediately introduced to a warm, welcoming atmosphere. A very popular place, there were many people, and there was still ample seating. As I approached the counter, I had asked a friendly employee what they would recommend. As soon as she had asked if I liked chocolate, I quickly nodded in confirmation. I didn't have to wait very long for preparation of my soy mocha, which tasted truly outstanding. I highly recommend Mama Java's Coffee House, it's very well worth the price...SO much better than commercially owned coffee houses like Starbucks."
1,"I really enjoyed myself here!! I wish mamas was closer to me! The prices are around starbucks but, that's okay. I was spontaneous one day and wanted to find a great place to sit and work and I found Mama Javas! So awsome! Im not a \""hipster\"" so I wasnt really feeling the atmosphere or did I feel like I fit in (they could work on that) But, I was there to work and enjoy coffee and I did. Bagel was amazing too!"
1,"My daughter and I chose the 4 hour ATV ride.  Our guide, Chad made the trip fun for people of all ability levels.  This is a first class operation.  Great tour, lots of fun, I highly recommend it!"
1,"Can't say enough about our ATV adventure and chad our guide.  Chad was very informative and matter of fact which I loved, having three teenage boys in tow.  My youngest son has autism and rode with Chad on his ATV.  Chad was caring and patient with him and my son was thrilled!!! Highly recommend."
1,"I am with Gabi:) I have been a member here for 10 years.  This is a family gym with lots of activities for all ages, shapes and fitness levels.  The staff is exceptional and very friendly.  This is more like a resort than a gym..."
1,"I love this place, i was invited by a friend and when i saw all the facilities i was very impressed. it is expensive but it is woth it."
1,I feel lucky to be able to work out at the Village. The yoga instructors are my favorite part about it - all or most of them are from At One Yoga. The equipment is state of the art & the facilities are very nice. Plus it has one of the best views in town of Camelback Mtn from the back patio/tennis courts!
1,"After the closing of my business last year ( Moss Wellness Spa), I had to find a new place for my yoga practice.   I value and support many Yoga Studios in the Valley ( At One, Metta, Urban Yoga, etc.) but I was looking for more than just a yoga studio.  And I found it here, at the Camelback Village Club!\n\nThere is yoga, pilates, tennis, basketball, a cafe, boutique, spa (Nails, Massage, Facials), Child Care ( not a selling point for me), Socials and it is in my neighborhood.  Their yoga program has talented instructors (Max, Lisa, Harmony, Beri and Amy) that are known throughout the Valley and it is authentic.  I can practice on the floor (without a mat), in jeans, without music and find my flow.\n\nI will be returning to the cafe soon on Friday afternoons with Greg and Max for a beer.  Of course, this will be following a great yoga class.\n\nJoining the Village is not inexpensive, but what price do you put on your health & well-being?  For me?  Priceless."
1,"I'm not sure writing a review is even worth it for The Village, because obviously it's amazing- but I go there so much, I feel I owe it to them to Yelp them :) \n\nMy family (husband, 2kids) all frequent the Village 3/4 times a week. I have to be honest and say that sometimes I go there, send my kids off to the awesome kids club / X-Arcade and just go sit in the steam room, lay out by the pool and/or take a relaxing shower. But yes, sometimes I actually work out! I am a Yoga teacher and the Village is where I take most of my yoga classes (the high quality of most of their teachers and the kids club is a major plus for me). I love their Cycle classes and the fact that they are 45 mins is great when I am in a crunch to get home for dinner/homework/bedtime but still need a quick workout. They have a HUGE selection of workout machines so you never get bored. \n\nNot that every health club needs one, but the Village has a fantastic cafe and a cute bar right by the tennis courts that have served my husband and I well when we need a date night and can't decide between a great workout together or a dinner/wine date. \n\nDefinitely recommend the Village to anyone looking for a gym with many extras! It's worth the high price, if you can afford it. We love it!"
1,"This is the gym I go to when I visit my Dad in Arizona.  The yoga classes are very hard, but rewarding.  The facilities are very clean and there is a good restaurant you can indulge in after burning all of those calories off.  I'm heading to Phoenix in a couple of days and looking forward to visiting!  My Dad loves the yoga classes and has been a member for years."
1,"Amanda's spin class is the best in the city!!! High energy advanced riders kind of class!!  If she wasn't there I don't think I would even be a member!!! Also,Check out the yoga studio, there are many talented instructors practicing"
1,"Great place for families, too."
1,I had a manicure at village spa. Shirene Najm did a fab job. Well worth the $25. Ask for her!
1,"I love it here, and even though I'm moving across town soon, I will always continue to bring my pet cat here.  The vet is wonderful.  He's very honest and you can tell that he really loves animals.  The woman who runs the front desk is very polite and always on top of things.  They were also considerate of my financial situation and didn't try to sell me vaccines that my cat didn't need.  They were very up front about pricing.  I love it here and I'm so glad I found this place.  I trust my kitty in their hands :)"
1,"This place is super cool. The only bad thing about it, is that it got TOO popular! I am very happy for the success of this place. At least they made the place bigger. There was a period of a year where i ate at this place saturday and sunday for breakfast! i was addicted. One thing i like to do if its really busy is to call your order in, so you dont have to wait in line. The only down fall is sometimes your toast gets soggy!\nParking is a pain in the butt for this place.\nThis is place is a big hit for people of all ages and its a great place to chat.\nMy fave is croque monsieur. YUM"
1,"I moved from L.A. to Phoenix a few years ago and missed the little cool small shop restaurant places with character.  Le Grande Orange made me feel at home, and now that I'm back in L.A. I'm super psyched to find out there seems to be a new one opening in Pasadena.  Does anyone know if this is the same owners?  Looks like it.  I HOPE SO!!!"
1,"I would give LGO six stars if I could. I love this place, they really have done everything right. The food is amazing, the displays are fantastic, and the music selection is always great. Parking can be frusterating but once you get inside you realize that it was worth the wait."
1,"Any place that makes a BLT with avocado is tops in my book because bacon and avocado might possibly be my favorite two food groups. (Yes, they are their own food group.)\n\nBeyond that this place is super charming. I loved everything about it. From the novelty candies to the delicious dessert case to the kitschy toys to the kitchen items. I actually thought this place was initially called \""La Garage\"" because it was such a mish-mash of cool stuff.\n\nI imagine if I lived in Phoenix I'd be here quite often."
1,"It is REALLY hard to rate La Grande Orange because there are so many amazing things about it, but it is so hard to find parking.\n\nPros\nThe food is really, really amazing\nThey have an awesome selection of things you wont see day to day\nThey have really tasty coffee drinks\nIndoor and Outdoor seating\n\nCons\nThe parking is really really rough\nThey are pricey\nYou have to wait in some pretty long lines\n\nTry the commuter with avacado. It's amazing. Also, they have excellent chai.. and their english muffins are TO DIE FOR.\n\nIf you live in the area and can walk there, you are set. I used to live a half mile away and would take a walk there for breakfast. The absolute best way to start your day, IMO."
1,"Okay, so it's not their fault that the parking sucks like no other....it makes me feel like I'm back in L.A. though!\nThe atmosphere here is fun. It's noisy, it is great for people watching and there are a lot to see (and, if you're like me, BUY)\nThe staff always seems to be smiling, and are helpful when asked, BUT this will never be the Nordstrom of restaurants.\nSo here are the things you have to try! They are WONDERFUL!\nMia's French Pancakes\nCroque Madam\nCommuter Sandwich (either with avacado or salmon, both are great)\nJersey Girl Omelete\nThe Cubano Sandwich\nThe Rueben\nGuacamole BLT\nI forget the name, but its either a Spanish or a Mexican Latte is wonderful!\n\nI also love the little pickle slices  they serve!! So good!\nThe Tammy Coe cakes are so good too! I love the designs! very creative use of fondant!"
1,"This place is da bomb dot com. \n\nIf you love Whole Foods then you'll love this mini-version. It's a cafe, coffee shop, pastry shop, and grocer that sells anything from fresh greens and post cards to hot sauces and wine.\n\nGabi K brought me here for a small pre-flight brunch. We walked directly up to the counter and ordered from the menu. Like what I saw: lots of health-conscious entrees. Everything looked so delish, especially those breakfast plates they were flinging across the counter with egg whites so artfully laid out alongside fresh fruit and multi-grain toast. \n\nAfter placing our order, we snagged a very small table near the bottled wine. There I spot various jams; particularly the mimosa jam caught my eye, made with oranges and Champagne. I bought that for a future birthday brunch we're planning at the lake, along with some peanut butter dog treats for my little schmoopie. \n\nWhen our food finally came out, just minutes later, my seared ahi tuna sandwich (new to the menu) with avocado, greens and tangy sauce was soon just an empty plate with a few bread crumbs and a watermelon slice. It was a large serving stuffed with so many fresh goods, but even more delectable I devoured it before I could even ask Miss Gabi how she was enjoying her Commuter breakfast taco. Also a popular item.\n\nLove the vibe here, It's lively, friendly, local and smells fabulous with that coffee/cafe aroma. And they have free wi-fi too. Wouldn't mind sitting around for a few hours and get some work done. Til next time La Grande Orange."
1,"Wow,it's been over a year since I have come here.  What in the world was I thinking?  I forgot how much I liked the unique and tastey sandwiches here.\n\nAfter a long grueling Camelback Mtn hike my friend said we should come here for a bite.  Glad I agreed to and that part.  My muscles everywhere on my body were hurting, but that sandwich made me forget all about them as we sat on the patio.\n\nI know parking is a nightmare on this corner in Arcadia, but who cares about that.  Great place to people watch and enjoy great food at the same time.  I definitely won't wait another year until my next visit."
1,"The parking sucks, its kind of pricey, and there is generally a long line....\n\nbut it is ALL worth it and I still give it five stars.\n\nI never come to Phoenix without visiting La Grande Orange. Amazing food and ambiance, amazing pastries and so much fun stuff to buy!"
1,"Man, I *love* this place!!! Great atmosphere & crowd. And I just heart the Venice Beach Burrito (sans tofu) with a delicious croissant for weekend breakfast with Earl Grey lavender tea or a decaf Americano.\n\nGood vibes always on the overhead. I was able to bask in the sun at an outdoor table, enjoy a leisurely meal, write in my journal, and take in all the people (& dogs!!!). \n\nTotally dig this place!!!"
1,"Always very busy, and a 35 min drive for me to get here since I live in gilbert but really, I dont even care. Everything about this place it so worth it. The important part though is, their coffee! Best coffee I have ever had ever. They have a yummy breakfast menu, everything I have every ordered is yummy, including their crepes! Lunch is good, and have to try their pizza!! I always saw a couple of Phoenix sun's players there, which is nice also since I am a suns fan."
1,"How could you not love this place?  Not only is the food fantastic and consistent, it has a great atmosphere and an adorable \""grocery\"" shop next door.  It's a great place to people watch!  (Don't forget to check out the wine section--not only is the wine random, it's affordable and a great conversation starter with all the cute names and labels)\n\nAfter moving here from San Diego, I've been so unimpressed by all the breakfast spots in Phoenix.  This is the one place that I LOVE!  I think it offers something for everyone, however my go to is the Venice Beach Burrito.  It's such a casual spot--you order from the counter, find a table, and wait for them to call you to let you know your food is ready to be devoured.  There's tables both inside and out, and you can peruse the store while your stomach rumbles!\n\n\nThe only thing I've ever been disappointed by is the sangria, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white sangria.  I will not be ordering it again but I have girlfriends that love it.\n\nI had never been here for lunch until this past weekend--it was always my late morning brunch spot.  Technically, I believe its a pizza place, but I've never had a pizza.  Although, they look quite good!  I ordered their tuna sandwich this past weekend, which came with a side of fruit and pickles.  The bread was thin and grilled panini style, and the tuna salad definitely did not disappoint!"
1,"Love Love Love this place! Laid back atmosphere, great music and delicious, healthy food. Mmmm...just writing about this place is making me crave the daybreaker :) If you go for breakfast on the weekends, make sure you get there early so you can find parking and a table. It gets crazy crowded!"
1,"My boyfriend and I visit LGO often ...maybe TOO often! But I just can't get enough of this little place. If you're looking for a trendy place for a lunch with friends, or even a dinner date, this is it. My favorites are the commuter with salmon and avocado, and the cheeseburgers. The cheeseburgers are amazing...and I don't even LIKE cheeseburgers. I also enjoy their Arnold Palmer's! Hands down, 5 stars."
1,The salted chocolate cookies are the most fabulous things I have ever had. I could eat them everyday! They have tammy coe cakes which are jst as beautiful as they taste.  I love their french pancakes they ate sweetened with honey and strawberries and topped with creme fraiche delicious!!!!!! When I step into this place its like going to a french cafe.  I used to live there so I remember what those places were like.  I live a block away so I go a couple times a week its just fabulous!!!! The wine selection there is wonderful...the staff is friendly.  Its nice because they have curbside pick up if you want to enjoy your goodies at home...you can also stay and enjoy at nice little table inside or on their cute patio.  Its nestled in the heart of arcadia you cannot get much better!!! Try it you will become addicted!!!
1,"This place is awesome... it makes me forget that I'm in Phoenix sometimes.  While I can't review the whole menu, I know their yogurt, orange juice, and coffee is awesome!  Service is usually really good and friendly, and the fact that you see a lot of the same people there a lot means that they're probably keeping more than just me happy.\n\nCheck it out next time you're in the area... driving, cycling, or walking."
1,"My fav breakfast place in Phoenix!\n\nYou get: great food, great atmosphere, good service (parking a little bit of a challenge, but I live right across the street so I just walk).  They even have drive up take out service!\n\nI mostly eat the breakfast there but have had sandwiches as well as the pizza at the Pizzeria next door.  Delicious!  Anyone who gives LGO negative reviews has just fallen into the usual boring Phoenix restaurant style type eating.  LGO is something different...order and serve yourself....kinda' like fast food (but you have to wait a little bit because all the food is made fresh), but seat yourself and don't have to worry about waiting for a server to bring your drinks/food!  Coffee is great (and strong). Daybreaker is my favorite healthy breakfast choice (egg white with turkey slices, avacado, tomato and salsa....get with a side of fruit or potato...fantastic!)\n\nYes, prices are a little higher than average in Phoenix....but you get what you pay for.\n\nWe love coming here after a good hike at Squak Peak or Camelback! Fresh squeed OJ is great and fresh made english muffines are yummy."
1,BEST RED VELVET CAKE IN THE WORLD! The store is crowded and always busy but the food is worth the drive and hassle.
1,This place is AWESOME! \nThey have the best Chicken salad sandwich i've ever had in my life! If you're in a hurry this isnt the place to go. It's always packed but thats a good thing! it's absolutely delicious!
1,"I love this place, and the wait is well worth it. If you are not a fan of waits, crowds or good nosh or novelty food, then La Grande Orange is not for you. But those among you with a versatile and educated palate will enjoy all they have to offer!"
1,"I love LGO! Everything that I have had here is always very fresh tasting and delish!  My favorite lunch salad is the smoked salmon salad.  You can also take your dog here and sit on the patio which is very nice since there are not a ton of places in Phoenix to bring your pup!\nThe Tammie Coe desserts are also to die for!  The last time I went I got the coconut cupcake, I thought I made good cupcakes, but then I tried this one!  Very moist and the cream cheese frosting was amazing!"
1,"This place makes such great food and the store is fun to shop in while you wait. They make their own English muffins, which are so freakin good, you'll wonder why no other bakery has ever made them."
1,"I go to LGO any chance I get for breakfast. I love love it!! The coffee, lemonade and the french pancakes (well any of their pancakes) are soooo good.  Besides, you can browse the shop for unique gifts.  I only bought a plant once. But, they have neat things if you ever need it..."
1,I have never had an english muffin like theirs! Absolutely amazing.  The food is high quality and you can tell the difference.  The only problem is finding seating.
1,"I love everything about La Grand Orange!!!!\n\nI would like to review both the grocery and the pizzeria together since it was the entire experience that makes it perfect. I've been here a handful of times now and have been impressed every time! \n\nFirst time visiting: I stumbled across the place so I decided to come in. I love the grocery area and the fun gifts. I bought some birthday cards and took home some Spicy Tuna Maki. The Tuna Maki was fabulous and I knew I was going to come back. \n\n2nd time visiting: Went with my husband for breakfast. He had the burrito and I had the Daybreaker and we both shared an order of potatoes. All was good and tasted very fresh. The best part was my coffee drink, the Havana! Something about condensed sweetened milk makes any drink  tastes good.  My husband that is hard to pleas enjoyed the items in the grocery store too. He bought a few nik naks there during our visit. \n\n3rd time visiting: Tried their pizza for dinner and OMG!!!! I swore on that day that it was the best pizza I've EVER had! We had the Magrherita and it was just divine. The buttery crust was the right level of crispiness and the mozzarella was gooey and perfectly melted. I am not a big salad person, but even the orange fennel salad that I had before the pizza was delicious! \n\nWe've also taken visiting family members here and they loved it too. I would like to find more places like this in Phoenix. So yummy and what a great atmosphere."
1,"Never one to let the idea of three square meals a day deter me from enjoying a visit to a new city my three plus days in Phoenix, Scottsdale, Glendale, and Chandler would additionally lead me to a number of ancillary eats - some upscale and French, some down n' dirty Southwest, some new, some old, some hot, and some cold.  Beginning first with my love of pastries, the first of these six stops would be at the combined grocery, caf\u00e9, bakery, liquor store, souvenir stand, and pizza parlor that is La Grande Orange Grocery; the sort of place you have to see to believe yet the sort of place where it all seems to \""fit.\""\n\nHarbored in a small strip mall with plenty of parking plus curbside checkout for those on the go I made my way into La Grande Orange only half knowing what to expect and having already mentioned the commodities entailed the only thing I could think of when I entered the door was a trip to Whole Foods if you condensed the entirety of one store into a space approximately one quarter the size.  With cups to one side and cupcakes to the other, wine to my right and coffee to my left my first impression was one of total sensory overload yet at the same once I entered and started to browse I detected a sort of controlled chaos as the various lines moved toward their destination with a good flow.  \n\nHaving already eaten breakfast and had plenty of coffee with pizza plans at Bianco for later in the day I took my time investigating the space - children's toys, shirts, travel mugs, cheeses, pre-made salads, locally roasted coffees - before finally approaching the pastry counter to browse the cornucopia of goods.  With many items baked in house and others provided by Tammie Coe Bakery two doors down I weighed the options carefully while additionally gauging my hunger and although any number of the options sounded delectable I ended up settling for two; one my own choice and a sort of obligation at this point and the other a recommendation from the young woman at the counter as \""the best thing in the world;\"" a promise I told her I'd hold her to if she was wrong, and after paying the modest tab I made my way to the street with my choices packed up (ostensibly for later, but in reality for enjoyment less than thirty minutes later as I checked into my hotel.)\n\nBeginning first with my selection, La Grande Orange's very own Red Velvet Cupcake, this large specimen wrapped in red wax paper and topped with an ample pile of cream cheese frosting would prove to be one of the better Red Velvets I've had in some time save for the stellar version at Bouchon Bakery just one month prior.  Loaded with notes of cocoa and sugar plus the faint taste of cinnamon and what I'm pretty sure was clove I really enjoyed the subtle nuance to this cake and despite the $3.95 price tag the portion was substantially larger and the cake significantly more moist than more expensive versions in other major cities.\n\nMoving next to the suggestion of my cashier, the Tammie Coe Crumb Bun, I really was not sure what to expect of the $2.50 option but what I received, while not the best thing in the world, was without a doubt the best sweet I had on my visit to Arizona.  Beginning first with the exterior, this golden biscuit looked something like a cinnamon roll meets a scone with a spiral texture encased in crystal sugar, but digging deeper and peeling off a layer the texture was instead somewhat akin to the famous Breton Kouign Amann kissed with cinnamon and topped with streusel.  Layer after buttery layer, bite after yeasty bite, and making a mess of the carpet (crumb bun indeed) all the while all I can say is that if you find yourself in the Phoenix area this is a must try and given the quality of both selections I was lucky to be staying so far from La Grande Orange and Tammie Coe because otherwise I'd have gone back for more."
1,"One of the benefits of being a native Arizonan is knowing all the best kept secrets our state has to offer.\nThat doesn't mean I'll share them with you, because I won't. \n\nHowever, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, mainly about how I do little or nothing for my fellow man and how the karma from that might bite me in the ass someday.\nSo i'm going to share one secret with you about a Phoenix restaurant this one time. \nLGO.\nThe food is superb, the service is quick, the ambiance, fantastic. That's not the secret.\n\nThe secret is MJ's breads. \nMJ Coe is an award winning baker whose breads are the best in all of Phoenix.\nAll us natives know this, and now you do too. \nLGO not only uses his breads in their  sandwiches, they offer them by the loaf. \nAnd here's the secret that hopefully keeps me out of the karma-cancer hot seat. \n\nMJ offers a signature chocolate-cherry french bread that's quite simply the best bread on earth.\nThe color of chocolate, dark brown, it looks like no loaf of french bread you've ever seen, almost like a pumpernickel.\nOutside, the crust is perfect.\nInside, the crumb is moist and chewy, with large chunks of what I can only presume is world class chocolate along with whole fresh cherries. \n\nAnd as if the chocolate french bread wasn't enough, biting into a chunk of chocolate or a cherry in every bite is the experience of a lifetime, one you won't soon forget.\nBut plan ahead.\nLGO doesn't shelf this bread, it's a special order requiring a one day notice. \n\nHere's another tip, mainly for men. \nOrder at least two loaves. \nOne for the drive home, as you incessantly pick at it until its DOA. The other to present to your wife in a blatant attempt to barter something other than jewelry for a blow-job."
1,"Had their red velvet cupcakes (the ones from LGO, not from the cake shop), and they're amazing!!! I had to bring some home back to CA with me. Really wanted to eat here too but the place was pretty packed Sunday morning. Will have to come back and try their food next time."
1,"So fancy and so good. Pizza, wines, notebooks, cupcakes, coffee.  Everything your yuppies heart needs.\n\nAlong with some free wi-fi, you can see why all the folks and their yoga mats were hanging out here."
1,"Oh My Heaven... I can't believe I haven't yelped La Grande Orange .  I am so in love with LGO , I wish I could be an apprentice back in the kitchen and learn how to make EVERYTHING . I have had almost everything on the menu and love it . When I am running to the office ahead of schedule, I treat myself to breakfast , Crepes are beautiful , the Birchermuesli , the day breaker , you really can't go wrong with anything you choose. The Banana nut muffin is one of the best I have ever had . The Salads are amazing , I've been eating the Thai chicken salad twice a week , trying to figure out how to make it .  I really want to try the Bloody Marys one of these weekends. I had one at their sister restaurant \""The misfit \"" in Santa Monica. I hope it's just as good . LGO should be on your Bucket List . Now Go !"
1,"Get the Commuter Sandwich!!! SOO GOOD!  I love this place- it's always busy, but they move quickly and the staff are always friendly.  I got really excited when I saw that they are opening an LGO at the PHX airport!"
1,"I can't really say anything that has not already been said. This place is fun, funky, and delicious. My go to sandwich is the Croque Madame. The egg on top is always cooked perfectly and its a big sandwich for your $$ ! I have yet to order here and NOT get a desert ( I can't help myself!!).... you really can't go wrong. I love all the cookies but the last few times I have been sucked in by the cupcakes..... banana bread cupcake with toasted coconut frosting... DONE! So moist and the frosting was killer ( but there is a lot of it) \nI love all the quirky gifts you can buy in here, and a lot of it is by local artists! I always get all my stocking stuffers here! My most recent purchase was a LGO hot/cold cup .... so much cooler than the Starbucks ones :) \n\nLove everything about this place! I really do... its my favorite place to stop after a hike up Camelback! ... really its just my favorite place to stop period. :)"
1,"oh wow, this place is amazing! It's like a modern Cracker Barrell (no offense, I like Cracker Barrell) however, this place had a younger, more hip twist to it. Pet friendly patio, picnic benches in the back, and complimentary valet. I could get used to this!"
1,"I've heard the hype about LGO and this was my first visit (and then again a second time at the SWA terminal at the new airport location). I was not disappointed with the huge portions, unique ingredients and fair prices. \n\nTuna salad sandwich is spectacular. Also loved the Thai salad. The sonoma garden salad was a little less memorable as I think it's all packaged before you order it at the airport. It still had nice ingredients and they added shredded chicken for me (at no charge)! The other items I ordered at the restaurant location listed.\n\nI imagine all the food is to die for at LGO.\n\nBe aware that in the evenings the sandwiches aren't available and pizza/entrees take about 25 minutes. Salads are still available"
1,"I generally don't visit the same place more than once - a quick glance at my blog would prove this point; Alinea, Eleven Madison Park, Bouchon Bakery, and The Griddle Caf\u00e9 round out a list of spots that I've  experience, and the people made me want to go back as soon as I walked out the door.  Sure there have been other restaurants that have stirred such emotions but for whatever reason - generally distance or a desire to try something new - I have not yet had the opportunity.  With that said, I've now been to La Grande Orange Grocery and Pizzeria four times in four months and if you count Chelsea's kitchen as part of the LGO empire that number becomes five - the most times I've been to any single space except perhaps the quick casual and fast food restaurants I frequented during my childhood and early years of college.\n\nDescribed simply as \""an organic coffee and breakfast bar, caf\u00e9, pizzeria, and funky retail grocery\"" La Grande Orange was one of the first places I visited on my seminal trip to Phoenix and the place I first suggested to my mother after driving cross country to pick up gifts for my sister and aunt back home. Sort of like The Cracker Barrel (for mainstream reference - I apologize to those I may have offended) or Southport Grocery and Caf\u00e9 (more appropriately) in scope with a small store and bakery up front and a full-fledged kitchen/restaurant in back I'd originally planned to write my standard review of LGO and all of the things I've purchased, eaten, and loved but eventually decided that such a mission would be shortsighted and considering the fact that I now own a home in Phoenix also rather futile - unless they close/burn down or I move/die this list will simply grown and grow.  Instead what I will do from here on out is seasonal updates with salient notes and pictures; from the black and white garden gnome salt&pepper shakers, toad banks and elk-horn knives to the baked goods, pancakes, and pizzas I love this place.\n\nEthiopian Reserve Coffee/Decaf/Black and Tan from ROC2:  I'd be lying if I didn't admit that at least half the reason I spend so much time at LGO is related to the free Wi-Fi and copious refills of coffee from The Roastery of Cave Creek.  Owned and operated by Dave Anderson and Michael Smith with operations not far from my home I've been lucky enough to enjoy some of their single origins from Central America, but for a blend the two offered up at LGO are both excellent with brighter citrus notes accenting the Ethiopian and lower cocoa and earthen notes in the Black and Tan.  Beats wildflower or paradise any day of the week in the battle for best freely refillable coffee.\n\nCroque Madame with Whole Wheat, Tomato, Egg, Ham, Gruyere:  I don't like Dijon and as such I requested the Croque without and what I received was superlative as the savory ham and aged gruyere were briny and bold yet tamed admirably by the crusty bread and sweet, bright tomatoes.  Topped off with a runny egg, sea salt, and just a touch of cracked pepper this wasn't quite a traditional croque but it was delicious...though the accoutrements of sour pickles and sweet melon didn't really 'fit.'\n\nFamous French Pancakes with honey, strawberries, and cr\u00e8me fraiche:  My grandmother was Hungarian and as I remember it she was also a very good cook, a talent my mother unfortunately did not inherit save for a couple of dishes; one of these dishes was Hungarian palacsinta or sweet pancakes.  Sort of like a French crepe but with a bit more tooth LGO's \""French Pancakes\"" reminded me much more of palacsinta than crepe and while others may think this a bad thing I thought it was sublime.  When mom comes back to visit this is on the short list of 'must tries.'\n\nBlueberry Muffin with Whole Wheat Streusel:  Admitting my sweet tooth and wearing it on my sleeve, the first of many pastries sampled at LGO (aside from the Red Velvet Cupcake during my recruitment trip) was this, a killer whole wheat muffin topped with buttery cinnamon streusel and literally bursting with fresh blueberries.  Clearly seasonal with their focus on using fresh, never frozen ingredients I was stunned by the quality of the berries as summer had recently come to a close but hefty in butter and berries while light and fluffy on the bite this was a great muffin.\n\nPumpkin Spice Muffin:  A second muffin, this one just before Halloween, was even better than the first in terms of composition - and with a surprise burst of tangy cream cheese filling on the inside a contender for best pumpkin novelty I've had in recent memory.  Big and bold with the flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg all perfuming the palate and moist like pumpkin pie without being wet I particularly loved the salty toasted pumpkin seeds topping off the muffin - a savory touch that worked nicely with the sweet filling.\n\n...more to come"
1,"This is always a highlight of my business trips to Phoenix.  There is a location in PHX in the Southwest terminal but it just does not compare.  Every time I come here the parking lot is full and the staff is slammed.  The couple in front of me literally ordered $300+ worth of food/wine to be delivered when this isn't a 5-star restaurant.  \n\nI always manage to find so many things to buy in their small ecclectic shopping area....cute stationary, luggage tags, scarves, Voluspa candles...the list could go on.  \n\nEverything is freshly made and there are many vegetarian options.  Plus the desserts are abound...I couldn't choose just one yesterday so I bought two!  Campfire brownie (think S'more on top of a darkish chocolate brownie) & old fashioned chocolate pudding with whipped cream and chocolate chips.  You'd think my pudding was my entree as I gorged myself to the point of rolling out of the place."
1,"I am sitting here now, at La Grande Orange, enjoying myself. Reminiscing, looking at my blog and being in love with their Quinoa/Kale salad which is divinity. \n\nThe music was very loud when I came in an hour ago. This I loved, but the ancients  started complaining so they turned it down..   Ive come to expect this in Phoenix. \n\nWhen will oldies just die already? Just kidding."
1,"If you're looking for a place that has an awesome lunch menu, a great selection of hard to find wines, a great selection of specialty drinks, awesome nick nacks, the best desserts in town (baked in house), and a great selection of specialty cheeses and salami, you have found nirvana!  \n\nI come to LGO at least once a week (on most occasions 3 times a week) and always walk out with a bottle of wine or some sort of cheese or baked good.  Their gelato, dare I say it, is better than Gelato Spot. \n\nOverall great spot to come and enjoy lunch.  \n\nOne complaint though: parking is a nightmare most times.  I hope they expand to a larger location with ample parking."
1,Their smoked salmon commuter sandwich is simply mouth watering. Highly recommended!
1,"LGO is definitely my go-to place for breakfast, lunch, and brunch. Oh who am I kidding...dinner and dessert as well! My favorite thing to do is to come in on a Sunday morning after the hectic activities of the weekend, and enjoy a delicious breakfast in their trendy atmosphere. Of course, everyone talks about their commuter sandwich, but my absolute favorite is the tuna salad on 9-grain. I always come into LGO intending to try something new, but I can never stray away from that sandwich. The thin apple slices paired with the perfect consistency of tuna salad, placed between two pieces of crispy toast, is like heaven in my mouth. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is also a great boost on the weekend mornings!\n\nI love LGO so much that now they've opened a location in the Sky Harbor Airport, I ALWAYS make a point to go to that terminal (even if my flight does not depart or arrive there), JUST so I can get my fill of LGO. Recently I tried their sea salt chocolate chip cookie, and is smitten. It is an incredibly rich cookie, but I love the chunky texture of it and how it looks so fresh and homemade. Plus the shaved sea salt perfectly balances out the sweetness of the dark chocolate! It is a humongous cookie though...and it is very filling.\n\nLGO also has a display of the cutest and quirkiest items on sale in the front. It's a great way to kill time while waiting for your order, as the lines as always very long on the weekends. It's a fun place to grab some unique gifts for your friends!"
1,"La Grande Orange, how much do I love you so!  \n\nYour baked goods consume my thoughts; you have taken the salty/sweet combination to a whole other level! The French salt chocolate chip cookies, where they made by angels? So heavenly! So Perfect! So addicting! The sweet chocolate chip with the crunch of the salt flaked sends me into bliss!! I can't get enough! \n\nThe oatmeal, cranberry, raisin cookie should not be dismissed; this cookie I have to say is my favorite cookie!! The blend of the oatmeal, sweet pop of cranberry and raisin makes my mouth water!!! Its mind blowing!  I pick this cookie over the my delightful chocolate chip cookie as my favorite, and when I 1st was introduced to this cookie, I said no I don't want to try it, I'm in love with my chocolate chip cookie, but then I tried a pieced and my mind was blown!  \n\n Guess I'm in love with 2 cookies, look what you have done to me LGO!!  \n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, you seduced me with your English muffins!! What did I do to you to be so tortured by this delightful food!! These English muffins are heaven sent! Perfectly amazing on their own, but take them home and make a breakfast sandwich out of them, ooooohhhh mmmmmyyyyyy gggggaaawwwwddd !!! Thomas English muffins who??? I only get mine from LGO!"
1,We LOVE LGO for breakfast! Their homemade English Muffin breakfast sandwiches are phenomenal. And their coffee is great. Perfect thing for my husband and I after an exhausting morning hike. We've also had some cupcakes and a red velvet cake from LGO and their desserts are to die for. Highly recommend.
1,Never disappoints back for another commuter sandwich this morning on my way home from airport.  Looks like they have a new rotisserie going to have to stop back for dinner sometime\n\nNice to sit out side and enjoy our beautiful Arizona weather
1,"I am always pleased with LGO!  I'll fight for a parking space any day just to get my coffee and a Commuter sandwich (bfast), Orange and Fennel salad or Stacked Turkey sandwich (lunch), or my favorite Mother Earth pizza for dinner!  The vibe is fun and busy--not the place for a quiet time of solitude, but perfect for any other occasion.  Kudos to LGO for innovating and creating such a great neighborhood spot! :)"
1,"Love coming here.  Great service, neat little grocery area (more eclectic stuff than actual groceries), and the food is awesome (simple menu but delicious)."
1,Been coming here since 2008. This place never disappoints. Great healthy choices everyday all day. Check out my Daybreaker egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms in the pic :) Delicious!
1,Love this place. Great coffee and food. Lines can be annoying and occasionally the music (although good) is waaayyyy too loud. Like nightclub loud and you can't have a conversation. Asked a staff person if they could turn it down a bit and she was totally rude about it and blew us off. Parking sucks but there is valet. Pizza is awesome. The place might be getting a little full of itself however. They need to realize there are growing alternatives nearby.
1,"My go-to breakfast place.  I've never had something here that I didn't love. For breakfast I recommend the eggs any style with fruit and toast (the fruit is always fresh and amazing, also add the bacon, they give you a TON and it's perfectly cooked everytime), the commuter sandwich (but you must add cheese, avocado, & bacon AND get it hot pressed), and the french pancakes are phenomenal if you're feeling something sweet.  For lunch I recommend the kale & quinoa salad, the vegetable sushi roll with goat cheese and sauteed veggies instead of raw fish, the Reuben (AMAZING!), and the burger. You can't forget an iced coffee and sea salt chocolate chip cookie to top of the meal... It's an unbeatable combo. The staff here is really friendly and there always seems to be cute dogs hanging outside, definitely a plus!"
1,"LGO= perfect. \n\nTheir gladiator pizza is amazing. The sausage on it is tasty! \n\nThe burgers are big and juicy and they have the best ranch EVER! It's homemade! \n\nTheir Ruben sandwich is sooooooo good! \n\nLast but not least, they have dessert! They have baked goods and gelato!\n\nIt's no wonder why this place is packed EVERYDAY!"
1,"Five. Fat. Stars.\n\nLGO (as I learned it's called in PHX) is just about one of the cutest spots I've ever been on my various trips to Phoenix. Coming from Seattle I'm very familiar with businesses that focus heavily on locally sourced goods, fresh locally grown produce, and a strong general focus on being eco friendly while not losing their edge or charm. LGO is like a breath of the Pacific Northwest for me!\n\nIt's a local business that's your one stop before you head home. Whether you're hosting friends, you're looking for dinner for one, dinner for two, or just stocking up on goods, you're covered here. \n\nRacks of wine and champagne can be found along a few walls. On other walls and display shelves you can find great gifts or home wares, plus books, greeting cards, kid's toys, candy, and of course food!\n\nThere's a chilled fridge with pre-packaged foods like sandwiches and salads, there are cheese selections, pickled foods, and if you want something made to order they do that too. It's literally a godsend for anyone on the go for any meal, or just about any errand that involves impressing friends, coworkers or family. Nothing you buy here is going to waste! \n\nI especially loved the reversible shopping totes! The fabric so so gorgeous on both sides that your real dilemma is not about when to use the tote but which side to feature!"
1,"I worked with Cole in creating a GF dessert spread for an event held last weekend. The entire process - from the initial order, through editing to delivery was smooth and professional. Not only did he deliver personally, but he brought along the Chef. Desserts exceeded our expectations, and we will absolutely be using and recommending their catering services in the future."
1,"I have only been there once, but can't wait to go back there again and again!!! I had a delicious honey almond milk iced latte, turkey sandwich, and delicious cucumber salad!!!!\n\nEverything looks delicious, and the staff are very friendly and make the lines move quickly!\n\nI highly recommend this place to anyone who likes tasty, health food!"
1,I have nothing but the best to say about LGO.  I have dined here many times and have always been pleased with my dining experience. One of my faviorite meals to get is the pizza and the salmon chopped salad.  This is a great place to meet friends and family at where you know anything you order is going to taste great.
1,"I've been here a few times, trying something different each time and I've NEVER been disappointed. My boyfriend and I split a California roll out of the case and it was some of the best sushi we've had. The open-faced Croque Madame is a must try as well!"
1,"LGO is a classic place to get a quick bite that's going to be quality.  Here are my favorites: \n-Iced Coffee\n-poached eggs and english muffins\n-any of the salads, burgers or pizzas/wings\n\nThe Reuben sandwich is great too!"
1,"The strawberry sorbet tastes like middle school... Sounds super weird but once you try it, you'll understand."
1,Gave LGO another shot and they have forever won back our business. Our servers name was Lindsey and she made our night a perfect experience. Thank you LGO for making it right!
1,Doesn't get much better.
1,"Top Quality Cigars, accessories and staff. They know their stuff and they don't make you feel stupid when asking questions. It's a huge store and once they get their liquor license, it will just add even more to the ambiance."
1,I visit the area often from San Diego and discovered Arcadia Car Wash after a really 'buggy' trip and have been their #1 fan ever since -- clean as showroom new after each visit and the wait is shorter than you think ( if you ever remember how long it would take you to do a complete handwash and vaccuum)! Big J (the owner) takes great pride in making sure each vehicle looks the best it can - you won't be disappointed!
1,"I have driven by this carwash at least 2 million times. I've lived in the Arcadia area for 20 years, went to Arcadia High School, etc. 44th street & Indian School is my 'hood. I finally tried it out, getting my mother-in-laws car washed. They did an excellent job and are pretty cheap- straightforward pricing and never crazy busy so you can get right in. Nice to sit outside and watch them take care of your car! \nThe place isn't fancy or anything, but it's perfect for what it is. \nI brought my bigger, dirtier car in the next week and they did just as great of a job. The owner (or possibly manager?) who is always there is a super friendly guy and makes the experience more personal. \nMy car was sparkling and I will definitely be back. Glad I finally tried this place out!"
1,"Just moved here from Kansas City and my Infiniti was driven the whole way. Needless to say it was covered with KS, TX, and OK bugs. Read the reviews online plus it's close to my house so I thought what the heck!  For $20 plus a $5 tip they did a helluva Job!  Only advice would be to plan on it taking a little longer because it is a true hand wash. \n\nWill be going back!!!"
1,"These folks have kept my cars clean and shiny for almost 20 years. \n\nI drove there yesterday (July 20, 2013) for a wash ... and the place is not only closed, it has been TORN DOWN. \n\nIt was one of the best hand washes in town, and two days earlier, it was still operating. \n\nThe buildings next to it have gone, too, and there's construction equipment there now.  So I'm betting that whatever they're about to build, it won't be a car wash. \n\nWonder what Big Jay and his guys are going to do now. \n\nThis is not good news."
1,"I absolutely love this Target!  True it is not as modern as some of them. However, they are in the process of remodeling. So in March it will be just as fancy as the others. It has a Starbucks for all those folks that need that. You can eve use your Target card there.(Starbucks) It is always clean, tons of parking and the staff is so incredibly helpful and friendly.  The pharmacy is by far the best though. Everyone that works there is wonderful. They can answer all your questions, they are very friendly and of course oh so helpful!  I live on the west side and i will drive all the way over there for my scripts. Of course it is near my job.SOOO it is the best Target in the Valley!"
1,"How can you not love Target!!  Great location right on 44th street and Thomas.          Great Pharmacy, and now they of course carry food..... Seems as if all the Targets are starting to carry food.  They have really good fruit and vegtables....so it is almost like one stop shopping.  The stafff at the Pharamcy is really good always happy and always helpful. There is so much you can get here. Lots of parking in the lot.  They have really great hours as well."
1,"You are awesome!  You have everything anyone could ever ask for. I honestly could spend hours looking at hair products and bed sheets!  Staff is friendly and helpful whenever I have questions. \n\nGuess what??? If you are charged the wrong price for an item, be an adult and say something, they will correct it!  It's crazy I know!  Thank you target!"
1,"I love this place too! Omg fabulous without spending a fortune. The salon is super clean which I love always! The technicians here are super friendly and always ask how you're doing. I enjoy coming here to get my eyebrows waxed, manicures, pedicures, and facials. I can come here and always leave feeling pampered and satisfied. I usually see Diem for my brow and nail care because she is a fantastic nail artist and an excellent brow professional. I don't think there is anywhere else I would want to go but For Nails Only (:"
1,"I hate to admit it (because I usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend) but I love Postino.  It used to be an old post office, thus the name.  It is now a wine bar that serves \""light fare.\""  There are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the Valley -- very California.  One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open.  Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices.  The bathrooms are lovely, clean, and lit by candles.  The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world.   Come early, get your table and enjoy!"
1,I love this place!  It's a fun place to sit and relax and sip a glass of vino.  Be sure to order the bruschetta...I especially love the figs and prosciutto.
1,"I love this place!  I just recently moved to San Francisco from Arizona, but I already made sure to visit it on my first trip back.  I have never brought someone there and had them not like it. \n\nThe atmosphere is great - small and cozy, and very warmly decorated for a former post office.  The wine list is comprehensive for both the white and red wine enthusiasts, and the servers are willing to make recommendations off of the list from their cellar.   Service is typically good unless they are super busy (Friday and Saturday).\n\nIn addition to the wine choices, the bruschetta is awesome!  My favorite is the red pepper goat cheese, but I've also heard very good things about the proscuitto/mascarpone/fig one.  You order a sampler of four different types at a time - and there is a pretty even mix of vegetarian and meat options.\n\nThe only problem is that location is less than desirable for people in the SE Valley - it is a far drive from Chandler or Gilbert to the Arcadia neighborhood in Phoenix.  Here's a tip though: when you get there, don't wait for someone to leave or pay for the valet parking in the crowded lot, there is plenty of parking available for free in the side streets nearby."
1,"I totally heart this place. The food is great - for a wine bar. You can actually eat dinner, and leave not feeling like you filled up on cheese and olives the whole time. Plus the wait staff is great.  You will have to wait on a Saturday/Friday night - but who is in a  rush then anyway? It reminds me of a neighborhood place in San Fran...a must-go in Phoenix."
1,"As per usual no disappointment for lunch and great wine selections for five bucks per glass.  We arrive just before 11 to get our favorite spot and order our usual Bruschetta (4 tough choices) to share.  Having tried all ten choices at one time or the other we chose 1,2, 4 and 8.  You will have to visit to see what we selected but please don't occupy our spot."
1,"After my Radio Milano experience, my friends and I decided to get a wine nightcap at Postino.\n\nI was already tired, but still wanted to hang out.  This was my 2nd time at Postino (first time was for drinks and dinner)  We just wanted wine this time...we ordered 2 bottles.  (I sound like a lush)  The bar closed at 11pm, which I thought was odd...on a Saturday night I thought it should be later.  But the server said that enjoy all we want and we can order all we want until then.  They will so not kick us out.\n\nI just love the atmosphere of this place.  I don't feel that I am in a pretentious crowd and the service is so on its mark.  There is a chance that I will be there for New Years...and if so...update!!!!"
1,"I've been here a few times recently, in various different social situations - romancing, bromancing, and a business meeting. \n\nWow.... is all I can say. The happy hour(s), $5 wine, is a great deal. The food is superb. I think it's a hoot that it's in the old 'Synthony' location, what was once the coolest pro audio and keyboard shop ever. The ambiance is awesome - cool, urban. cultured. The service and knowledge of the servers is above par. It's usually packed. Definitely one of my favorite places for wine in town! I wish I'd been going for a long time, and didn't just get clued in recently. I'm glad I don't live closer... I'd be there all the time!"
1,"I traveled far and wide, convinced many friends and get myself to this cute little wine bar. The outside patio is gorgeous, especially in the spring and fall. The inside is just as beautiful with a warm and comfortable modern feeling.\n\nThe menu is so uncomplicated with delicious bruschetta and cheese plates. I require not much else other than these when drinking copious amounts of wine nectar. However, I remember a special I believe on Mondays with half price bottles and pizza from across the street. It was unbelievable. \n\nThe staff was so nice and gracious when minor mistakes were made. It is definitely worth the trip when I was staying across the valley and would go again and again."
1,"This place is amazing!!!!!  It has delicious food. A great wine list and what else can you say.  It is a great place to sit drink and just talk and chill.  If anything eat the bruschetta.  Share it with a friend.  We need more places like this.  It isn't overcrowded like most places in the valley and lets keep it that way.  The one downside is parking, though I see it as a glass half full problem.  If there was more parking more people would come then it would be crowded.  So go enjoy and be merry."
1,"When I had mentioned to my girlfriend I had never been to Postino's she said, REALLY???  Well then you are in for a treat.  She wasn't kidding!  Who said a wine bar won't get crowded in late June during 109 degree temperature???  And this was at their new location on Central (just north of Camelback). The four of us shared the Bruschetta SELECTION OF 4, so we all got to pick and share...  We enjoyed the Brie & Apple w/Fig Spread, Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, and Warm Artichoke Spread.  Their portions are very generous and each bruschetta is cut in 4 so you don't have to struggle with it yourself.  Anyone who knows me well, knows I ALWAYS slice my sandwiches in 4...easier to eat :-)  Wine by the glass 11am-5pm 7 days a week...yay!!!"
1,"Wine and bruschetta: what can go wrong?  I really enjoyed my visit to Postino.  My friend and I sat outside because we felt like the inside was a little too loud.  The patio was pleasant even for an August Phoenix evening.  I ordered bruschetta while my friend got the panini/soup.  We should have shared because the bruschetta was HUGE.  Four huge slices that were each cut into four pieces.  I picked: smoked salmon, brie and apple, caprese, prosciutto with figs.  Everything was awesome.  My mouth is watering just thinking about my meal.  The wine was also good.  I don't know much about wine, but I enjoyed my 2 glasses.  =)"
1,"I've been to Postino Winecafe once and it has left a lasting impression on me.\n\nI had went there for dinner with a friend one night.  Being the art student I am, I soaked up the surroundings instantly.  The place was artsy with a vast amount of windows.  The overall atmosphere of the place was brilliant.  Any where that allows you to eat on modern and comfy couches by candlelight is definitely a fantastic place!\n\nMy friend and I shared the brushetta sampler [Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Tuscan Tuna with Gaeta Olives, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Salami with Pesto].  The bruschetta was delicious.  It was baked to perfection!\n\nFor two light-eaters like my friend and me, that filled us up quick!  But what's a cozy dinner without dessert?  We shared a classic vanilla cr\u00e8me brulee and it was so creamy and wonderful.  \n\nI definitely recommend this place to anyone!"
1,"Great food.  Great atmosphere.\n\nWe got an Olive Appetizer, a Cheese Plate, and Bruschetta (Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, and Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese)\n\nI got the \""Nine Iron\""\nHickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata\nmozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise\n\nMy wife and her friend split the Vegetarian\nGrilled asparagus, roasted artichokes, red onion, vine ripe\ntomatoes, goat cheese and house made pesto\n\nAnd, of course, a bottle of wine.  We rolled out of there STUFFED to the gills!\n\nWe will be going back again soon!\n\nThere is one problem...if you don't like to give your car to a valet, then you have to walk...far.  On the good side, it's only $3 for valet."
1,"One of the best spots in Phoenix. Great atmosphere, great music, great food and reasonable prices. No need to be a wine snob to appreciate this place. Bruschetta is a must as is valet usually."
1,"We had an event catered last night by Postino for a group of 30.  \n\nThe event was a fabulous success.  The food was terrific.  The service, both during the planning process and delivery was excellent.  \n\nIf you've never catered food before, please, for your own sanity, consider Postino.  They have an easy menu.  It's affordable.  They're easy to work with.  They also offer discounts for non-profits.\n\nWe will be using them for many events in the future.\n\nThank you Postino!"
1,BEST. BRUSCHETTA. EVER. \n\nI now live in Chicago and thought it would be easy to find a good place for bruschetta and wine and NO SUCH LUCK. \n\nPostino is the BEST. I am flying back to Arizona next weekend to get some. Delicious.\n\nYUM.
1,"Tuesday Night Wine and Bruschetta Special Rawks! I love Postino's just for that.  $20 gets you a bottle of wine and a tray of bruschetta.  This is an AWESOME deal.  My girlfriends and I love it.  We can sit and talk and indulge in great wine and food.\n\nTips:  If you have a large group, make a reservation.  Plan to get there early, it gets packed.  The Tuesday Night special starts at 8pm."
1,"Again, I love this place.  I am seriously considering moving into this area because of the restaurants and businesses, and Postino is on the list of awesome places I can't get enough of.\n\nI went here on Saturday afternoon with a girlfriend.  I was really hoping to sit on the patio since it was GORGEOUS out, but of course, we waited till absolute prime weekend lunch time and were forced to sit inside.  I make this sound horrible but it isn't at all, I was just being dramatic.  It turned out great because we sat at the bar next to this super cute, chatty couple and talked with the very nice, helpful bartender.  They roll up the garage door windows and open the doors when it is nice, so it was almost (not quite) like we were on the patio.  One plus: no bees inside.  \n\nMy friend and I decided we would day drink (why not? it is the weekend) so she ordered a mimosa and I a Bellini.  Fresh juice paired with champagne (sparkling wine, prosecco, cava, bubbly, whatever) = delicious.  AND all glasses of wine and beer are only $5 from 11:00am - 5:00pm.  Thank you, may I have another?\n\nAfter our second adult beverage we ordered olives and brushetta.  Both were delicious and perfect for a light lunch.  I probably could have sat there all day had we not made movie plans.  Probably better that way anyways, I wouldn't want to overstay my welcome (or not be able to drive myself home because of Bellini imbibement).  \n\nAll in all, another great experience at Postino, maybe I will check out the new one on Central next time...."
1,"Hands down the best wine bar in Phoenix.  Great atmosphere, music, deals and wine.  This is the number one place on my list for those who have a sophisticated pallet.  It is busy there for a reason and definitely worth the wait."
1,first time here the coke'd up owner stopped by our table and hit on my girlfriend. I would have never come back if he wasn't doing such a kick ass job with this place. Its really well done. The one wall opens up onto a wooden deck letting in the warm breeze. Food is well done and they have an excellent beer and wine selection. Style and substance. Prices aren't so bad either.
1,"This place is one of Arcadia's treasures.  The wine selection is amazing here but it would be nothing without the educated, considerate, polite and helpful employees.  i have never had a bad night at this establishment.  My favorite night to go is on Tuesday's because they have the best deal in town-a board of Bruschetta (4) and a bottle of wine from their special menu for $20.  Plus if you don't finish the bottle-you can bag it and take it home!\nMy favorite Bruschetta are the roasted peppers w goat Cheese, the Apple and Fig and the Prosciutto and Mascarpone one...Mmmmmmm Delish!\nIf you haven't been in yet and you love to lounge, drink wine and listed to good music-GO HERE."
1,"I've been craving to wine and dine here for so long, since my friends rave about it. So I finally got my opportunity to experience Postinos yesterday... Sunday Funday. It definitely felt like summer w/  the live reggae band that actually sounded more like Jack Johnson... enjoyed the music either way... while drinking amazingly refreshing sangrias. I was eager to order from their impressive wine list (definitely next time), but my friend influenced me to taste the sangria... which I'm normally not a big fan of... But it wasn't overly sweet at all.  We of course ate their infamous bruschettas... delicious!  Service was super friendly and attentive."
1,LOVE the brushetta!\nGreat location - fabulous service - and nice wine selection!
1,"This is one of my favorite places around. So much so that it's been labeled my official \""date\"" restaurant. I've been here a trillion times (okay, maybe not that much), but have always had good experiences here - even when I accidently lit a napkin on fire at the table. \n\nI have very little patience for waiting anywhere, but I will wait a half an hour to be seated here, which is pretty often on busy weekends with a party more than two. The wine list is hand-selected and always amazing. The bruschetta is TDF (which, is one of the things I miss most about being #glutenfree), I recommend the ricotta and pistachios and the apple one. Their sandwiches are amazing (although I don't actually like their focaccia bread, I always went with the cibata). The waiters generally remember who you are, and some of them even remembered the wine I get so much so that when they rotated it out of the menu they were genuinely concerned and addressed it as soon as I arrived! \n\nOn Sundays and (I think) a weekday night, they have live music. SUCH a great ambiance! If you love olives as much as I do, you have to try the olive sampler platter. It's brilliant. Even their soups are delicious. If I ever move, I will miss this place for sure. Oh, and try the creme brule. It's a must!"
1,"I've always been a big fan of Postino but don't make it down there very often. A couple of weeks ago I met some friends to hike Camelback. After a struggling hike, we went to Postino to enjoy some food and drinks. What a perfect day! \n\nWe sat outside on the patio and were cooled by misters. Our attentive servers brought us water right away. I started with fresh squeezed lemonade then had a mimosa. My friend and a bellini and the guys had some IPA (I think it was $5 a pitcher??) \n\nI can't go to Postino without having some of their infamous bruschetta... we ordered the artichoke, tomato jam, prosciutto/fig, and date/pistachio. Every bite was delicious! Can't wait to go back!"
1,"One of my fav places that I would recommend to anyone! The atmosphere is intimate and trendy. They have a good wine selection and delicious food. I would recommend the bruschetta which comes in 12 different flavors. The Brie & Apple and the Prosciutto & Figs are the best in my book. The staff is also friendly and helpful. They provided me with some great suggestions on wine after asking a few questions. Overall, it's just a great place to go for any occasion."
1,"Postino is one of my FAVORITE restaurants I have ever been to.  I always make sure to be very hungry when I go.  I can't say enough good things about it so I will try to be as concise as possible.\n\nMy friends and I usually go on Friday and Saturday nights and it is understandably busy.  We all usually grab a delicious glass of wine and don't mind the short wait at all.  I cannot say enough nice things about the staff here.  They are always very polite, friendly, and conscious of getting us seated as soon as possible.\n\nWe always order one or two planks of bruschetta to start out.  I have had them all and love them equally.  To follow that I usually order the prosciutto and brie panini.  All the ingredients taste so fresh and the bread is equally delicious (I have to admit I am picky about bread, coming from San Francisco sourdough land) I have to admit that all the food and wine fill me up so I have never tried their desserts but I am sure they are amazing as well.\n\nThe food is amazing.  The service could not be better.  The ambiance is nice and casual. The price is more than reasonable.  I have no criticisms for this restaurant and encourage everyone to go!"
1,Great for any occasion. The salty sundae is unusual and fantastic.  The bruschetta addictive.
1,Obsessed with Postinos! I live right down the street from there and frequent it quite often. I'm a vegetarian so it's sometimes difficult for me to eat places but at Postino's they have wonderful meat-free bruschetta options. They also have excellent Sangria for those who are looking for a lighter fruity alternative to wine. I like to go there on Sunday's and drink $5 Sangria pints and listen to the reggae band. So fun!
1,"I really miss this hot spot for lunch. You can not lose here. Really...\n\nMy fav would be the bruschetta. Such a hearty, italian treat served ontop of a wooden cutting board. The cheese boards are brilliant for snacking and socializing. \n\nThe building is an old post office. How unique!"
1,"A trendy spot to hit up. I am not a big fan of wine, but gave in to coming here with my friend that loves wine. I hear there is a $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine on Mondays and Tuesday. Well last night (Monday) we got the $13 bruschetta (with 4 pieces you choose) and a $30 bottle of Grayson, a cab, all for $20. I mean what a deal.\n\nDark atmosphere, good food, good variety of wine. Definitely a great local business to support. Parking is probably the biggest problem you'll encounter.\n\nOh and they have a \""People Love Us On Yelp Sticker\""!"
1,"If you have not been to Postino's....WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!!? This is one of those hidden gems...I enjoy everything about this place.\n\nThe food- excellent\nThe Wine-  cant go wrong\nService- Always have been very please\nPrice- Fair\nWait time- Yes...Ive had the pleasure of waiting a few times, but its worth the wait.\n\nBe back soon..."
1,"I have been to this Arcadia location a handful of times. Each time I got the same thing because on Monday, and, I believe Tuesday nights, they feature what is probably the best deal in the world. For $20 you get a BOTTLE of wine, your choice, from a long list, and a large plank of four different sets of specialty bruschetta. The ambiance is upwardly-lounge-casual; perfect for both a date night or meeting friends after work."
1,"Fantastic bruschetta. And $5 glasses of wine during some lunch time happy hour thing (I can't recall the times though).\n\nI really enjoy the food here, and it's pretty cheap for what you get (a lot of food). They have free valet parking if you can't find any parking on the street."
1,I was torn between this place and LGO but was at LGO for breakfast.  Pretty happy I picked Postino for lunch.  Sandwich selection was unique (Prosciutto with Brie) and the general ambiance during lunch was real nice.
1,"I can't say that I would fight for a parking space at many places, but Postino makes the list. Will I ever steal a parking spot? Not at all, but I will look long and hard for one here. The wait is worth it yelp friends. Postino does a great job luring customers in and keeping them. With their incredible happy hour, I wish I could sneak away to dine on a glass of wine before 4:00 PM on a weekday and for those who can, I salute you. \n\nEvery time I wine and dine at Postino, I leave full, happy and satisfied. The original Postino location will also be my favorite based on it's location, ambiance, character, service and quality products. The wine is obviously top knotch here at Postino. Bottles line the walls and the staff knows their selections inside and out. They offer bottle specials all the time and you can enjoy a bottle at a reasonable price practically every day of the week. \n\nTheir food competes with the quality of their wine. I long for their bruschetta. You chose four different flavors and for a reasonable price under $15. My favorite bruschettas are the prosciutto and fig, and tomato paste with cheese. The tomato mozzarella is also a classic. But, it really just depends on your taste buds because any bruschetta you choose will be excellent. Many times, I got for the half sandwich/salad combo. I like to order the Market which isn't on the menu. It comes with pesto, tomato and mozzerela. I make sure to add chicken. The Mediterranean is my go-to salad but I vary between all of their salads. You really just can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. And it tastes even better with wine. Doesn't everything?"
1,"This is the perfect spot to go to with a few friends. Great wine and great food. \n\nThe bruschettas they have are so so good, as well as the sandwiches.\n\nThey have a large selection of wine and each glass is only $5.00 each until 5pm -- The staff I have interacted with have all been really nice and helpful.\n\nSome of the people that go there are wannabe foodies and snobs though, use caution. lol"
1,"This is the perfect setting for a girls day on a Sunday afternoon.  Share a bottle of wine while listening to Walt Richardson perform.  Couldn't get any better than this. Also, can be very romantic with the right man.  Gentlemen take your lady's here, they will be very impressed. The food, beverage and ambiance is amazing."
1,"Bruchetta board, pitcher of Kronenbourg, sitting on the patio, stellar service and boyfriend = death because this is the best dining experience I might ever have. \n Favorite slab consists of: Roasted Red Peppers on Goat Cheese, Warm Artichoke, Dates, Pistachios with Ricotta and Sheeps Milk below a sweet Tomato Jam. \n\n The only *bad* (more so just personally annoying), thing I've ever come across here, had nothing to do with the food itself or even the servers..well not our server..was when one of the ladies walking around clearing tables felt the need to express to us that SHE has OCD therefore, we needed to remove the last 2 pieces of bruchetta from the board, so she could clear it..because it was making HER uncomfortable..\n\n Never push your 'disorder' off onto someone else and expect them to abide, especially when your customers are deep in mid-conversation about serious things like puppies and the night's baking agenda...this customer will not yield and out of spite, leave a lingering, lonesome bruchetta upon the slab for your sake.\n\n I, too, have a disorder - not caring about your fear of individual bread pieces on a plate.\n\n Despite said occurrence, there are NO complaints, ever. A valley staple that I recommend highly, for all occasions."
1,"Can't wait to go back.  I love the Monday deal, it is genius.  I was there with my twin mom group (about 12 moms of twins), we had a blast.  I love the Brie, Apple and Fig, Prosciutto, Fig and mascarpone, Tomato jam bruschettas.  I had the Teira Zinfandel, which was perfect."
1,Love this place.  Love all the food and the staff is great.  We drive from Gilbert to have lunch at Postino's Arcadia.  We understand a new location here in Gilbert will be opening soon.  Can hardly wait. I do recommend this place to everyone I meet.
1,"First time here a week ago. The atmosphere is fantastic ! We came during dinner (around 630PM) and the place was packed but everyone was friendly and so was the service.\n\nWe ordered 4 different bruschettas. I was originally intending on ordering a panini, but one of my sorority sisters suggested otherwise. A few other sisters vouched for their bruschetta, so the bf and I didn't think we'd go wrong there. All of the different kinds we tried were delicious! So much that we ordered another 4 with our 2 favorites. Can't go wrong... just pick one! Or 4... since they come served that way.\n\nI wasn't feeling wine that night for some strange reason, but their cucumber lemonade was sooooooooo refreshing. Yes, that many O's.\n\nNew favorite stop-by-when-we're-in-town place."
1,"Postino is an amazing place to chill and relax with good company, good food, and amazing wine. \n\nWe had a nice Friday afternoon lunch outside with a glass a wine, and it was a perfect atmosphere. The Arcadia location makes you feel like you're in a small town rather than a city like Phoenix. \n\nThe cheese board - amazing!"
1,"This is my 2nd review because I love this place sooooooooooo much...Everyone should go here!!! It is one if the best places in phoenix!! The atmosphere is beautiful especially at night! Im so lucky b/c i can just walk here and i do ALL THE TIME!!!  The greatest deal is the board and bottle night on monday and tuesday nights starting at 8 pm...the wine selection is quality...the selection isnt as large but all the wines are fabulous!! You can also buy wine and take it home...the food is just as fabulous...i love the bruschetta prosciutto and fig, brie and apple, ricotta pistachio and date, artichoke spread and the one with tomato bacon and i forgot the cheese...those are the ones i love but i have no doubt the others are great too!! The soups are so warm and delicious i love them on cold dzys and its great if you get a half panini and u can dip your sandwich in it and it makes both the panini and souo that much better...they have paninis for everyone!! The desserts are fabulous my favorite is the salted caramel sundae...i like the caramel ontop of their chocolate cake and ice cream its amazing...of course leave it up to me to love two desserts and combine them...or if you want a good drink other then wine try their bellinis and mimosas...they are delicious at anytime of the day hahaha...just dnt drink too many and drive have someobe get you a cab...\nI love this place so much and cannot tell more ppl enough about this place!!! So come here and enjoy!!!"
1,"Has got to be one of my favorite restaurants. Monday and Tuesday when you are there at or after 8-close, It is $20 bucks for a bottle of wine and your choice of four different slices of their bruschetta. \n\nThe Chicken and Mozzarella Panini is one of my favorites.\n\nYou can easily have a dinner for two, including an app, two entree's and a bottle of wine for well under $60.\n\nBe aware that there WILL be about an hour wait for this quaint little restaurant. However, in the same center is a place called La Grande Orange that you can grab a decent bottle of wine at while waiting for your table. As well when you do that they validate your valet parking ($3) not including a tip. \n\nValet is a must usually around this spot since the parking is quite horrible. But when you expect it, you should not be disappointed."
1,"Great food, great Sangria, great live music, great vibe, great service EXCLAMATION MARK. Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon."
1,"I effing love this place, that is all there is to it.  I have taken a parade of first dates in here, so much so that when I was single my friend swore they were going to think I was a lady of the night.  But I love it so, I'm so comfortable here, the place is so warm and inviting, and who doesn't look hot gilded in candle light?  I have been here prob more than 80 times, and it never gets old.  I return at least once or twice a week, and not just for a date night, wine with friends, lunches with mom, happy hour are all equally fun here.  \nMy favorite things: $20 night, although Mon and Tue after 8 are busier than a weekend up in here, be prepared to wait and get drunk; brushetta in all it's glory - always fresh, always perfect; the ever changing wine list, always fun to try them all and order for others; the soups in winter; the prosciutto and brie sandwhich, I die.  One more confession, I actually picked my current condo because of it's proximity to Postino.  Less than a mile.  Sold.  xx"
1,"There are a lot of wine bars popping up across the Valley in the last few years and they are pale imitations of this.  Postino's is great.  Love the atmosphere and the Bruschetta boards are amazing.  Lots of choices and each board is a large serving, big enough to share.  Perfect place for happy hour with the $5 glasses of wine.  I can't wait for them to open their Gilbert location."
1,Absolutely amazing!\n\nI finally made it to Postino after hearing great things from many people.  We came on a Tue night to meet up with another couple we hadn't seen in awhile.  Mon and Tue they have the special where you get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20.  This is a great deal.  The place was crowded so if you go make sure you go early and get your name in.  The nice thing is that you can start drinking your bottle while you wait.  We were waiting for around 45 min before we got a table but we were having fun nonetheless.  The bruschetta was amazing and there were many different types to choose from.  We also tried the grilled cheese which was delightful.  We will definitely be back again and I am excited to try more things on the menu.
1,"Beautiful people, tasty Brushetta, good wine all go well with the good weather.  No complaints, but this place could you an early acoustic jazz happy hour a little more regularly.  \n\nGreat place in the sun!"
1,"This restaurant got all the right stuff. Great service, a great wine list, quality food, and a relaxed atmosphere with a European feel to it. \nThe chef must have a great knowledge of foods and flavors that compliment one another because I cannot recall trying a dish that I did not like. Bruschettas are great because you get to try four different flavors in one order. Last time we went I had their chicken and mozzarella panini which was delicious. I highly recommend you try this place."
1,I always have a splendid time at Postino. The food is wonderful and usually comes out pretty quickly. Fun atmosphere and I love the historic building.
1,"I miss Postino! I moved from Phoenix about 8 months ago and every time a happy hour is needed, I think if only I could have Postino tonight... \n\nPhoenix, enjoy this place- go often- eat lots of Bruchetta and raise a glass of wine to celebrate ANYTHING.\n\nTake it from me, a girl who missed her favorite place...there isn't another place quite like it. The atmosphere, the servers, the comfortable patio and wonderful selection of wines to choose from make Postino Arcadia a 5 star location!"
1,"Don't ask me about anything on the menu except the bruschetta, I've never been able to get past it.  Many different inventive delicious toppings on perfectly toasted slices of rustic bread, served on a narrow wooden platter.  Each and every bite is to die for, and they have a good glass wine.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the loud techno music.  Everyone yells to be heard above it.  Which means I have to, too."
1,"Great bruscetta salty carmel sundae, and of course wine.  Service can be a little slow from time to time but not a big deal.  Love the sparkling sav blanc on a hot day.  Cool atmosphere as well."
1,"The soup, salad, panini, and especially the bruschetta were all fabulous! Delicious and beautifully presented. We also really enjoyed the live music and the peach tea. I wish I lived closer - this would easily become a favorite lunch spot for me (although maybe only for special occasions as it's a bit pricey)!\n\nHIGHLY recommend. :)"
1,"There is nothing that I don't love about this place.  My first visit was a late afternoon lunch after a hike and we sat on the patio.  Trust me when I tell you that you MUST get the bruschetta.  I can't wait to go back.  The parking doesn't bother me a bit because it's all part of the experience-don't let it deter you.  If you want a big lot and a restaurant with crappy food, no ambiance, and terrible service, go to Chili's."
1,"There's not much more I can say about Postino than hasn't already been said... the food is incredible, the wine list is extensive, the menu is reasonably priced, the ambiance is delightful, and the service rocks!\n\nI was there last night and enjoyed the $20 bottle of wine + bruschetta deal after 8 p.m. The portions on the bruschetta deal were surprisingly generous, and amazingly delicious! I went with the mozzarella with tomato and basil, the goat cheese with roasted peppers, the smoked salmon with pesto, and ricotta with dates and pistachios; I loved the first three, but I would not order the date and pistachio bruschetta on my next visit. \n\nI also ordered the \""pick two\"" panini and salad/\""soup of the moment\"" combo, with the Brie and prosciutto panini and a healthy serving of tomato soup. The panini was scrumptious! It was perfectly prepared, and tasted amazing ... I wish I had ordered the full sandwich! The soup was just OK - it wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as exciting for my tastebuds as the panini. \n\nI would liken my dining experience at Postino to \""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\"" -- after I had one phenomenal item, I had to have them all! After polishing off a bold and zesty Syrah from California, I ended up leaving with a bottle of the Reunion Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina. Restaurant patrons receive $9 off bottles of wine to-go, so I mean, I wasn't gonna not... (perfectly acceptable use of double negatives).\n\nAlthough it is a trendy spot, Postino has somehow managed to remain friendly and unpretentious - both staff and guests alike. The servers all know their stuff and are more than happy to provide recommendations based on your preferences. Even the least sophisticated palate will feel comfortable dining here on account of the helpful service and charming atmosphere; hence why I hereby award Postino with my first 5/5 star review! \n\nAproveche, my friends!"
1,"Fig and marscapone bruschetta is to die for. I crave it all the time! Vintage 95 in Chandler has attempted to copy Postino's recipe for success, but it doesn't compare to the service, atmosphere and quality that Postino is known for. Prices are completely fair, wine and beer selection is great. The Mixed Green salad was totally amazing. I drive 30 minutes from Gilbert to get there, and it is worth every minute. I can't wait for the Gilbert location to open! One of the best places in Phoenix, hands down."
1,"Monday night is reverse happy hour! Starts at 8pm. You get a bottle of wine and choice of 4 bruschetta for $20! The burrata, bacon, arugula and tomatoes  and the warm artichoke spread are to die for! Outstanding! This is definitely a place to go! One thing that was a little annoying was how loud it is in the restaurant, but the great food outweighed the noise."
1,"So as expected I have nothing but good things to say about Postino Arcadia. In fact it would be silly for me to comment since it will be a repeat of what everyone else has already said. So I'll just say its a great place to hang out, drink great wine, eat yummy food and soak up the vibe. Must haves are: bruschetta, salted caramel sundae and the pub board."
1,"The Brie and Apple with Fig spread Bruschetta is amazing! \n\nSince I don't live in AZ, I orginally heard of this place by Meghan McCain who I follow on twitter and listed this on her blog as one of her favorite Phoenix hang outs for those that are not native to the area.  Although she listed Postino Wine Cafe, I was brought to this location and I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived.  The staff was knowledgeable on their wine selection and provided great service.  The cork on my bottle of Pinot Noir had \""Wine Crystals\"" or Wine Diamonds\"", nothing I had seen before.  The server was very informative on explaining what it was, turns out I did my own research and the information provided was very accurate.  http://winesworld.com/index.php/wine-crystals/68/  \n\nAlso, If you are a fan of music, on the Friday night that I was there, they played music by The Whitest Boy Alive, The XX, Phoenix, Hercules & Love Affair and Band of Horses to name a few.  I was tapping my toe as some of these are on my own personal playlist so it instantly gained a few stars for the music alone.   Next, I'm coming back for Sangria Sundays and reggae.  Overall a very unique experience, great ambiance and delicious food.\n \nCheers!"
1,Love love love Postinos. It is such a great atmosphere and I'm a huge fan of the rasp chicken salad. \n\nWill be back again and again!
1,Good Stuff can't beat the happy hour. Definitely sign up for their email prior to going in and you should receive a free bruschetta board email.
1,"Great place to dress up a bit and feel more of an urban vibe. Hip but not pretentious. I went to Postino's Monday night around 8pm. We were given a wait time of an hour for a party of four. The place was full but we managed to find a standing table near the bar to wait out our table. We drank a bottle of \""Available\"" per the recommendation of folks next to us (heavenly) and were visited regularly by waitstaff to fill our water. The music was just the right level to support conversation, but kept a hum in the background. When seated our waiter came to the table nearly immediately and submitted drink orders. For food we had two orders of bruschetta which was more than enough. Everything was delicious. Definitely coming back here."
1,"Postino. Oh, how you bring love to my heart with your bruschetta boards and interesting atmosphere. \n\nLove this place! Here's some tips; everyday before 5pm the glasses of wine are $5.. You may have a tough time finding parking so make it easy on yourself and bring cash to valet. Make sure to stop by the LGO grocery store after you eat at Postino. \n\nNow, onto the food at Postino. Pretty much the best thing you can order is the Bruschetta board because its SOOOO AWESOME! \n\nAs many other Yelpers with great taste have mentioned, a couple of the best bruchettas (although it's tough not to just order 2 boards and get them all- except the artichoke, that one should be avoided). \n\nHighly Recommended (I don't have the exact names down, but here's the main); the salami one, the one with fig, apples and brie (****BEST*****), the roasted red pepper and mozz/basil/tomato. \n\nThe first time you go, you may just have to order 2 boards if your party is big enough, because they are all so good, except for the artichoke one- that one is NOT good. \n\nThe wait staff does a great job, and I love everything about Postino! After writing this review I need go, like this weekend... Like now, wait, \""Can we go to Postino for lunch?\"""
1,One of my all time favorite restaurants. Bruschetta is amazing!
1,I love this place!  It's on my short list of places to make sure to take visitors.  I always get the bruschetta and there are so many different options to choose from it never gets old.  One of favorites in the valley.
1,Loved this place! Amazing food and wine! Service was great! Beautiful experience.
1,"Always great service, lovely ambience, great wine selection, and appies that can't be beat. The bruschetta is delicious, the meat platter is divine, and the cheese plate delights my palate. Our party of 10 had a very enjoyable evening here with extremely attentive service. I can't ever say 'no' to Postino's. Ever!"
1,"I'm on a huge Postino kick lately and had another awesome dinner there last night with five girlfriends.  Since my last review of this place was in 2008, I figured it was time for an update, but honestly, not too much has changed since then - I'm a very loyal customer and have been for years!\n\nMy favorite menu items are still the same too:\nThe artichoke dip (which actually comes with hummus too but I always special request double artichoke instead because I love it so much), the mixed green salad with added turkey, chicken, or prosciutto, and the bruschetta board... My top two bruschetta faves are Brie & Apple with Fig Spread and Prosciutto, Fig & Mascarpone. Mmmmm!\n\nI'm not currently drinking (I'm prego again), but of course this is the perfect place to go for a glass of wine or four as well!  \n\nService is always fabulous and the atmosphere rocks too.  So in my eyes, this place deserves five stars... even almost five years from my original review!\n\nOf course, it is worth noting that it's not only a favorite of mine, there are plenty of others that love it too... so, sometimes you may have to wait a bit.  If you've got a large party (eight or more), I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time."
1,"My favorite place for a date and conversation. The decor is unique since it was a restored post office. Lots of lounge and table type seating.Try the bruschetta board! I always order the sweet tomato jam and sheep's milk, ricotta and dates, apples and brie, and salmon/pesto. Consistently great food & drinks. Service has more spunk and personality at this Postino location too. Try the cucumber lemonade if you don't like wine or just plain water. If you order wine and it isn't happy hour, you can easily spend more than $30 on yourself. However, I think it is worth it, and I always leave full and happy. Thanks Postino!"
1,"One of my favorite spots for any time , any day of the week ! Everything here is yummy and delicious ! The staff is always awesome ! If I could give this place more stars - I would ! :)"
1,"I've been coming here for years and I'm happy to report that it's still as great as ever. I met a couple of my girlfriends here after work last week. We stayed for hours at our little patio table and the wait staff was attentive, friendly and helpful the entire time. The wine was nice and the portions are generous. The bruschetta is beyond belief good. It's really just a proven nice place to spend some time with people over good food and wine. It will always be one of my go-to places."
1,"Can't say anything that's not already been said, just reiterate it.  Fab bruscetta!  Can't go wrong with any of those selections. I've been in the evening when it's super crowded, but my favorite time of day is lunch especially when it's a beautiful day and the garage doors are open, you can't beat this place for ambiance!"
1,"Perfect date spot!  But also perfect for a friendly gathering for wine and bruschetta.  My friends and I ordered a couple of bottles of prosecco  and 7 or 8 different kinds of bruschetta.  Perfect for 5 people and we had a great time talking and laughing underneath the heat lamps outside.  I loved this place and I will definitely come back every time I visit Arizona. \n\nDear Postino, open a location in San Francisco.  Thanks!"
1,"$5 WINE and BRUSCHETTA FROM THE GODS. WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR?\n\nIt was my first time in Phoenix this weekend and I wanted to shoot myself because I was disappointed by so many places that people raved about on yelp/tripadvisor (i.e. Carolina's, Desert Botanical Garden, The Vig - to name a few)\n\nI stopped by Postino's on my last day there and if it wasn't for this place, I would probably never visit again.\n\nFYI - stop by La Grande Grocery next door and try the A-Z cookie. It's BOMB."
1,"Okay; this place is pretty dang tasty and their most popular dishes are the Bruschetta! How can little pieces of bread with an assortment of toppings can be so amazing? \n\nTo name a few:\nRicotta with dates & pistachios: The cheese is not over powering and the date gives it the sweetness whereas the pistachios give it a nice crunch. \n\nProsciutto with figs & mascarpone: Luckily it was fig season because you can never go wrong with prosciutto and figs! \n\nSalmon and pesto: It's something that everyone usually gets but honestly this was kind of a disappointment. The salmon was a bit thin and I didn't like it with the pesto. \n\nBrie & Apples with fig spread: Brie is literally the tastiest cheese. buttery, sweet and crunchy from the apple (another favorite) \n\nThe bruschetta does change occasionally but they keep some of the popular ones on the menu. Great place to hang out with your friends and drink wine from their extensive wine bar."
1,"Same great happy hour and food as the central location.  I did not note a difference in the food between both locations.  \nArcadia has a nice outdoor patio, I prefer the tables that sit halfway outside and halfway inside.  See if you can get one when you visit.  Enjoy anything with fig on it. :)"
1,"What can I add that others haven't already said?  This place is adorable, the food is delicious, the wine selection is admirable and the employees are great.  \n\nGo.  Go now."
1,DELISH. Atrichoke sandwich is the way to go! (light on the cheese tho!)
1,"Love this place! I still kinda like the one on Central slightly better, but this has a cool inside/outside vibe and being next to LGO is awwesome!"
1,Love this place. Great ambiance and food. Wish I could go weekly.
1,Is there anywhere else in the Valley that does bruschetta this yummy? I think not! Love their catering too!
1,"We stopped here last night and glad we did.  The choice of four bruschetta was awesome loved them all white bean, artichoke, burrata and mozzarella. My glass of Manifesto Zin was really good as well.  A nicely appointed restaurant that I would frequent more given the chance."
1,Bruschetta...Wine\nThe options to choose for your bruschetta are terrific!  And they are the best in town!  The wine selections are terrific!  Great service and very reasonable prices.  What is not to like.\nDick
1,"Live music, great bruschetta, great service"
1,"I always love going here--feels like home in a great sense.  The decor esthetically pleases and relaxes me.  The service is always individual and\nusually great (one slightly short bartender in Gilbert once ... ),  and the food (bruschettas mostly) makes me smile ... Contemporary take on them is refreshing."
1,"One of my favorite restaurants in town , love the food and. Atmospheres there. Bruschetta is the best !!!"
1,"The bruschetta and pub boards are to die for, and we look forward to the $20 wine & bruschetta deals on Mondays and Tuesdays every week! Get here a bit early on those days though, as everyone likes this great deal."
1,"Postino has 3 locations around the Valley!  I've been to 2 of them now and the one thing you can say about Postino, they are an amazing place to dine/drink and they are very consistent with service, quality and ambiance.  \n\nWe typically go the Postino on Central, however we dined here a couple of weeks ago with some friends and found them to be fantastic! I really like the patio area!! It was too cold for us on this trip however this is a \""must come back\"" kinda of place just to enjoy a great meal on their patio!!\n\nFood~ if your dining for lunch go straight to the salads and/or bruschettas!!  Their portions are actually larger than you think and after you pick and choose some of the different ones to eat, you'll thank me for passing on the apps!!  \n\nHowever if you re dinning for dinner or have a larger group or a huge appetite, then go ahead and order some apps.  I suggest trying their Bella Postino~ warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted breads or their Butcher's Block~ with different artisan meats and cheeses served with Tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini.  Both are DELISH!  \n\nBruschetta's~ here are some of our faves;  Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto is my go to!! The Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato is also a go to!  We also like to try their seasonal burchettas as well!  \n\nPaninis~ go for the prosciutto with brie or their Nine Iron with smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and special sauce = nom.nom.nom!! \n\nService~  our service was a little slower than what we are used to at their Central location however our server was very friendly, knew the menu well and tried her best to keep up.\n\nAll in all it was a FANTASTIC experience!! My friends and I are looking forward to coming back on a Monday or Tuesday when they have their $20 special, a bottle of wine and burchetta ~ put me down for 2 please! I hope to see you there."
1,What a great place for focaccia bread. Yummy. Love the pesto sauce. I don't always like paying $12-14 for a glass of delectable red wine but sometimes it seems so worth it to blow a few twenties among friends. Its a great place to relax. Great ambience
1,"Two words:\n\nProsciutto With Brie on Focaccia Bread.  \n\nOkay, that was a lot more than 2 words, but I don't care.  \n\nIt was downright amazing; like my tastebuds were being dry humped by the best sandwich ever invented in the History of the World (Part II)."
1,The best bruschetta ever.\nSo many delicious  flavor combinations.\nMake a meal of it.\nHighly recommended..
1,"Love love this place. Sooooo gooooooood!  Recommend highly,"
1,Everything was amazing. We got the bruschetta: you get to pick for different kinds and a panini to share. We got the iron and it is giant and delicious. More than enough food for the two of us. The wine is great. We went for happy hour $5 a glass so we just got a bottle for $20 - I'll be back!
1,"Another 5 starts for this wonderful restaurant!!  Not only do I love the food that's served here - I mean, best Bruschetta in town!!!  The customer service continues to WOW me everytime I visit!  I hosted my little sisters Bridal Shower here in the sofa lounge area of the restaurant and everyone just loved it.  There were 14 newbies to Postino Arcadia and they'll all be coming back to visit again!!  Thanks for helping me create such a memorable day for my baby sister!  She couldn't have been happier and that means the world to me :)"
1,Great food and boards
1,Arcadia area is very cool and Postino fits right in
1,"amazing food, you literally can not go wrong with any of the bruschetta toppings. I even tried their seasonal one for kicks and it was delicious too..\n\nyou will love it, but you will hate the wait.. still worth it.. especially the board and bottle deal."
1,my friend and i used to come here after hiking camelback.  you can't beat an excellent sandwich and sald w a crisp pitcher of beer or sangria.  we love the patio and the atmosphere along w the live musician they have on a sunday afternoon.
1,"LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. \n\nWhat a great place this is! I mean wine and bruschetta? You can't get better then that!  \n\n On Mondays Tuesdays they have a bottle of house wine and a bruschetta for $20!! What a steal! The only down side those days WILL be busy but it's totally worth the wait! (And you can start drinking your wine while you wait. They have little tables you can stand around or sometimes areas you can sit!)The outside patio at night is to die for! But it can be a bit noisy! \n\nWonderful \""girl night\"" get together spot!"
1,Tuesdays are the best obvs thanks to their special. Not really a dinner place but great place to hang out and have a variety of wine selections.
1,Amazing wine selection AND $5 glasses during (a super long) happy hour. A great variety of bruschetta! My faves are the salmon w/pesto and the roasted red pepper w/goat cheese :) can't go wrong with any of the paninis either! The atmosphere is perfect for dates and lunch with the girls!
1,"Good food, good service, nice atmosphere"
1,This place has the best wednesdays in the valley! I love all of their bruschettas! I will always love this place!
1,Favorite resturant in Phoenix!
1,"I had the best bruschetta here. \n\nThe drinks were good and refreshing.\n\nThe sandwiches and salad were fresh and delicious. The place looks like a bar but comfy and big. Service was quick and patient. \n\nAgain, bruschetta not to miss"
1,"Hands down my favorite restaurant in the valley. I typically go to the Gilbert location as I feel it's the largest but had brunch at this location on Sunday. The bruschetta is an absolute must whether you are there for dinner or weekend brunch. They have $5 mimosas and bellinis which are equally delicious, and a large wine selection. I have never had anything bad from the menu here!"
1,"This place is amazing! They have amazing food.. Love the Bruschetta plate. It's very filling and great for 2! Make it an evening, enjoy some wine, very cool place to hang out!"
1,"Great vibe, great food, great wine. Get there early."
1,;( RIP Chuy's
1,I went to see Dr Cherkuri for an initial visit. I found him to be knowledgeable and empathetic. They looked busy but not rushed. The staff was overall very friendly and seemed to want genuinely talk to you. Overall it was a good experience.
1,"Outstanding team of cardiologists here at Biltmore Cardiology! \n\nI had been experiencing some intense chest/breast pain out of nowhere. You know, just sitting on your couch, laying in bed, sitting at your desk.\n\nPretty scary when you're a youngin like me. Heck, anyone of any age, but you get the idea.\n\nMy Mom has fibrocystic breast condition (easily managed when you dial back on your caffeine consumption or eliminate it all together, no fun), and told me to hit up my OB GYN to make sure there weren't any suspicious lumps. \n\nWell, clearly a mother always knows what's up. \n\nOB GYN was almost positive the chest pain I was experiencing was related to that amazeballs fibrocystic breast condition (aww, thanks for sharing, Mom). But, as an elite level athlete, she didn't want to take any chances. \n\nOut of the office with a referral in hand to Biltmore Cardiology. Boo ... But better safe than sorry. \n\nSaw Dr. Akil Loli and Dr. Harris on my first visit. Teenage like blood pressure, normal EKG, heart sounded great. He also said some of my chest pain could be related to all the torso twisting involved with hammer throw. \n\nCaring, compassionate, respectful specialist, and very easy to talk to. He gets major points for knowing what my sport is. Usually I have to explain it as Track and Field / Hammer throwing isn't too popular in the United States.\n\nDr. Loli still wanted to go forth with an echocardiogram and stress test because of my lifestyle. Nothing like only making it to Stage 6/7 on the treadmill to make you feel like a fat athlete, no?! \n\nFront desk ladies and the testing team were stellar! \n\nHad Dr. Loli's partner, Dr. Gordon (retired, but occasionally covers for the practice) review my results. Clean as a whistle. \n\nWhat a relief!\n\nI hope I never have the need to see a cardiologist again. But if I do, I know I'm in good hands with anyone here. \n\nHighly recommended."
1,"This is a super classy Fry's! They have a Starbucks, nice floors and lighting, and a natural foods sections, which I love! Healthy and organic shopping is becoming a lot easier to do at Fry's. Great deals and savings on milk!"
1,"I've been to each of the three locations of Havana Cafe and have never been disappointed. The food is always delicious and I had the best mojitos I've ever had at Havana Cafe. \nIt can be a bit pricey, but the food is definitely worth it."
1,"One of my favorite things to do is go hike the echo canyon side of camelback and then cruise down the hill to Havana Cafe. The best mojito in Phoenix hands down no arguments please! The black bean fritters, o my holy ****! So good! Everything on the menu here is very well done. I have a good amount of Cuban food and this is one of my all time favorite spots. Good ethnic food is hard to come by in the Southwest and this place sets a good example. Heads up ladies, This place is full of Latin charm so go with your girls and your drinks will be nice and strong!"
1,"Cute little restaurant, very cramped, but I feel like that is how it should be.  On a hot day, I almost feel like I am in Cuba.  They have a diverse menu, so you are sure to find something for everyone.  This doesn't seem like the ideal place to have a dinner date, but so far I have only had hits with this place.  Everyone I've taken here has loved that food and commented on how cute the restaurant is.  Mmmm...thinking about croquettes is making me crave some Havana Cafe."
1,"OMG. If you're afraid of flavor stay away because this place has the market cornered. Papa Rellena ,one of my favorites. But my absolute top pick so far is the Gallina Frita. Its just perfect. But there is soo much to choose from. The Paella seems to be a huge hit on Friday nights when it's only $20. Oh and if you want a potent drink that will make you giggly but not sloppy. \""Pussy's Painkiller\"" Yeah.. I know..its fun just to order it."
1,"Seriously, my favorite place in the entire Valley.  Fabulous food in a casual environment.  Excellent service, great drink menu.  Every time i eat here, i rave about the food.  I usually have the Pollo Cubano.  Its simply delicious.  An entree is about $20.  And worth every penny!"
1,"When you go: try the black bean fritters with avocado dipping sauce---SOOOO GOOD...i could've eaten those for my whole lunch!\n\nThen, my friend and I shared two different dishes: \nthe Cuban sandwich (like a panini), which came with the black bean soup and a pork dish that was marinated in lime juice and spices.\n\nBoth dishes were really good! i would definitely go back, because EVERYTHING on the menu looked tasty. i wanted to try it all, but alas, my stomach and wallet are only so big."
1,"I miss this place every day.\n\nUsed to live right behind it, and took it for granted.  Simple and the yummiest.\n\nTheir Berenjena con Garbonzo is one of the most magical things I have ever put in my mouth.\n\nBlack bean fritters, ham croquettes-- everything is good.\n\nOH!  Their cocktails!!"
1,"This place was great!!! Went there last night and had a great experience. We showed up at 9pm and there was plenty of seating inside and outside on the adorable patio with lights strung up and music playing. Our server was fantastic, and he recommended the black bean fritter appetizer which was to DIE for. I would go back again just for those, with the avocado dip, they were amazing. We also had the gazpacho soup, which was good, nothing amazing but there's not a whole lot you can do with gazpacho. Also had a chicken entree that had fried plantains and beans and rice that was quite good but too big to finish. Great wine and Brazilian beer too. All in all, a great experience and we will definitely come back soon!"
1,We came for lunch. My husband had the lunch special of the jerk chicken with rice beans and a citrus slaw. It was very tasty. I had the Ropa Vieja with plantains and black beans and rice. IT was absolutely delicious. The waitress was very friendly and very attentive. Our ice teas were never less than half full and she made a point to check in frequently. We had a Groupon and everything went smoothly. We will definitely be back.
1,Great food.  Great service. Loved the mohitos...just like in Cuba.  And the Ropa Vieja is excellent.
1,"I had a Groupon and went for dinner with my boyfriend last night.  This place is amazing!  We started off with the tapas sampler, and everything on it was great.  We also ordered bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, which just melted in my mouth.  For our entree, we shared a fried chicken dish--very good and actually not too heavy.  And if course, since it's a Cuban restaurant, I had mojitos.  They were delicious, and very authentic--no Bacardi!  In addition to the great food, the service was fast and friendly.  We will definitely be going back soon!"
1,"Can't believe this place isn't better-reviewed. Have probably been here a dozen times and never had an item I didn't like. Starters are always fab -- wonderful black bean and chicken soups, kids love the plantain chips and black bean dipping sauce. I would go here just for the bacon-wrapped chorizo-stuffed dates. Meaty, salty, sweet luscious goodness? Yes, please. They do a wonderful (and HUGE) arroz con pollo, and their caribbean chicken with black beans and rice is also to die for.  Friendly service, nice location, Havana Cafe is always a winner."
1,Some of the best Cuban food I've had and very reasonably priced as well! \n\nI can never decide between the bistecs cubano or the bacaloa (salt cod)!
1,"If you're looking for a delicious Phoenix feast, head to one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley, Havana Cafe.\n\nI always try a little bit of everything when I'm at the Cuban restaurant, and when my pal and I went this week, our meal was no exception. We had more than 10 different menu items peppering our table, and we both left stuffed and happy. Like it is for me, Havana Cafe instantly became one of his favorite restaurants after one meal there.\n\nOne of the coolest things about Havana Cafe is that there are mojito making classes offered there periodically. I've attended one and loved it, and the mojitos at Havana Cafe are amazing. \n\nWhen we went to dinner this week, we got a pitcher of sangria instead of mojitos, because sangria is another one of my favorite drinks. The sangria at Havana Cafe is packed full of fruit flavor, and it's a really refreshing drink that goes well with the heat of the Cuban dishes.\n\nLet's start first with my favorite dish at Havana Cafe, the Frituras de Frijoles Negros ($5.25). They're bite-sized black bean fritters served with a cool and creamy avocado dip that is to-die-for. I love, love, love this dish and could eat it all the time.\n\nThe Maduros Fritos ($5.95) are just as amazing. They're sweet chunks of bananas that make a perfect dessert or sweet appetizer accompaniment. If you don't like eating raw bananas, you'll probably still love these.\n\nWe also had vegetable empanaditas ($6.95), mini-pies chock full of veggies. For being such little appetizer treats, they're really filling and could make a great main course for vegetarians.\n\nI also had the Potage de Frijoles Negros ($4.95 for a bowl), which is a vegetarian black bean soup that is also very hearty. It's so tasty!\n\nMy companion got the San Juan Combination ($16.95), a massive sampler plate that lets you taste seven different dishes-a Puerto Rican tamale, plantains and pork, a vegetable croquette, twice-fried plantains, peas cooked with rice and pork, fried pork and beans and rice. The dish could probably give you 2 days' worth of leftovers-and they're not gross leftovers, they're almost as good as if they'd just been served to you.\n\nBesides the phenomenal food, I love Phoenix's Havana Cafe for its intimate setting. The restaurant is comprised of a little dining room with mirrored walls, and there's also a patio. It's not quite Cuba, but the aromas and warm, welcoming atmosphere are enough to make you feel as relaxed as you would on vacation."
1,"Mmmm! Lunch for two here was great. We ordered several smaller plates and split it all. Every flavor was so unique. We devoured everything. The sun spots are tasty as well as the empanaditas and the tamale type thing wrapped in a banana leaf (I forgot the name). When we went, there was no one else there. Service was good. We ordered some desert also which was delicious. The decor isn't anything special, but it's not about that here- just the food!"
1,"I had a really great experience at the Havana Cafe.. Everybody there was super nice and the service was great... I don't think our water glasses ever got to less than 1/2 full. The food was excellent. Price-wise it was a little more than we expected, but totally worth it. The sangria and drinks were kind of pricey, but ah well. Overall a very good experience- we will be back!"
1,"JT, JT, JT....OMG...the wings will make you take flight. They are the most delicious little mouth delights. Serious ..dude should have a solid gold chicken wing out front. They are grilled to perfection, the degree of heat or flavor is right everytime. The bar is fun, fun, fun! The regulars may look you over a time or two..but hey I'm good lookin so I don't mind. lol. The tacos rock out Thursday night.  The only problem with JT's is, he's not open on Sunday for football..and that pisses me off every time I remember on hangover Sunday, that I forgot to get them on Saturday. Damnit, I hate that I have to go there twice a week.  Cuz he is open for Monday night football..oh ya.....screw  it..I'm going right now...c ya..."
1,Best wings ever!!!! There is no place that can stand near this place for wings.
1,"All I really need to say is GRILLED WINGS.... but I shall say more in detail. They have the BEST wings in town! They fry the wings, but also grill them. All the staff is VERY nice and friendly. If you go more then a few times, they will know you and know what you will be ordering! Every time I have gone to JT''s it has been busy, so that say's something about the place. So if your mouth is watering and craving wings, JT's is your spot!"
1,"Congratulations to JT's for being voted Best Neighborhood Bar Food by Phx New Times!. I'm a devoted regular at JT's and I love going there. They weren't when I started going, but the bartenders, their sig' o's, and many of the other regulars are now friends of mine. The wings are EPIC! I get the Hot wings, but sometimes I'll go Teryaki Hot and have them double dipped. Messy as hell, but so delicious. The steaks on Wednesday are always great, and Julio keeps mine nice and rare. Perfect. It's a great place to chew the fat with a friend. You can also just walk in by yourself and spark up a conversation with just about anyone there. Be careful with JT though. He is a man of few words, and if you annoy him, he'll likely say 'Fuck you, go home'. (The phrase is actually on the menu, FUGH, somewhere near 'DUH'. Anyway, just food, just booze, or both...you'll have a great time. And the bartenders are definitely easy on the eyes...just don't be creepy or they might knock you out."
1,BEST WINGS EVER!!!!  Service is slow but it's worth it!  Burgers are good too but the wings are outstanding!
1,"Jt's is a fantastic neighborhood bar. Full disclosure: I'm a regular there. This is not a fine dining establishment, but the wings are the best in town, and the rest of the nightly specials are definitely worth trying. Go in and check it out, but leave your attitude outside..we are all friends at Jt's and you will be welcomed by all. Oh, and the drinks are strong and the bartenders are awesome. Tip: don't order a frozen drink. It's not the place for it, and I don't think there is even a blender anyway. Try Applebee's instead."
1,"The BOMB, arguably the best wings in Phoenix. Jana and Julio have it on lock down.\nThe place is tiny but the food is BOSS. Worth the drive from anywhere in town."
1,"Brilliant little bar. Really friendly staff, and the food was fantastic. The wings are incredible. A must visit! I'll  be back for sure!"
1,"This Cleaners is great!  It's called Elite now, not Queens though.\nWe do our laundry here.  \nThey have a convenient drop off.  They give you a bag and you write your instructions on the tag and you never have to wait in line to drop off!\nThey are professional, on time and their work is really good too.  \nMy husband never complains about having a press mark at the bottom of his shirts like the 2.00 cleaners used to do.  \nIt is slightly more than the 2.00 cleaner, but this is close to home and we don't get attitude from the employees like at the 2.00 cleaners.  \nThe owner is usually on site and you can just tell that he cares about his customers. \nIt's right on the corner of 48th St and Indian School by the Arcadia Tavern.  They also do free pick up and delivery and if you call in advance when you're on your way they'll get your order ready and deliver to your car!  Seriously what else can you ask for?  :)"
1,"I started going to Elite Cleaners because it is so close to my house. And never dawned on me to write a review since most people go to closest dry cleaners to their house. But there yelp page seemed unloved so I took one for the team and wrote the first review. \n\nThe women who work here are super nice. They do an excellent job with both laundry and dry cleaning. And the price is not to bad for dry cleaning, I recently picked up 15 articles both dry cleaning/laundry and it was 30 bucks! And that was before my discount as a returning customer. \n\nThe only downside is that this place shares a parking lot with Arcadia Grill. Which I have never been too but based on their lack of parking and over use of valet service means lack of parking. So just dont expect to pick up your laundry durning lunch time. Though there is a drop off only parking spot, but just one. So here is hoping luck is on your side if you do try to pick it up durning lunch."
1,"I found this gem on Yelp (go figure)and have taken numerous shirts, jackets, pants, and dresses etc.to be cleaned.  This company lives up to it's name.  The staff is prompt, professional, and reliable.  The owner takes customer service very seriously and values customer loyalty.  I used the spend $30 for $50 coupon on the yelp site and redeemed it from my phone.  It was a true breeze.  The owner (I'm assuming) explained they have delivery service free of charge.  I agree witb his philosophy- dry cleaning should be hassle free.  Quality work every time, no exceptions.  Not necessarily the cheapest, but absolutely the best.  You get what you pay for.  Cheers!  \n\nOne request for the owner: please put a fan (or anything to cool) in the receiving area.  That place can get toasty for those that choose to pick up in person."
1,I have been using Elite Cleaners for over 10 years now.  I love the free pickup and delivery service!  Clothes come out great and I feel their prices are fair.
1,"My friend and I both went at the same time to the Optique Center at Tatum and Shea in Phoenix.  The store was very clean and well stocked.  (I must have tried on 100 pairs and didn't even touch 1/2 of them).\n\nThe technician was extremely friendly and thorough, as well as the doctor, and we did not wait long.  The staff was extremely solicitous, I would rarely rate a store five stars, and don't know all of them, but have been to three of their stores so far.  (I have several children).  It is good to have your paperwork done in advance.  \n\nGood job Nationwide!  Holly"
1,This is by far the best Chinese food in the valley. The pan fried noodles and sesame chicken are AWESOME!!!! I eat here at least once a week.
1,"I don't care if it's authentic or not, what's important to me is how good is it.  It is so good I find it hard to eat Chinese food anywhere else."
1,"This has got to be the best chinese in phoenix. The food is always fast and fresh. The servers are always attentive and friendly. This place is just great to go to. I normally get the chicken chow mein and my bf gets the sweet and sour chicken and both are excellent. The sweet and sour chicken isn't one of those gross fried puffballs covered in sugar, it's a real chicken breast, fried crispy and sliced. It makes such a difference. I have been coming here for years and my waiter Ed (who isn't there much anymore) always remembered us and knew what we wanted to order from memory. Now that's good service."
1,"I had driven by this place at least twice a day on my way to and from work and always thought it was one of those shady Chinese places that would end up on the news for at least three years. And then one day I had a craving for Chinese did a search for the nearest Chinese restaurant and this place popped up. The ratings were fantastic, so I thought I should give it a try. \n\nI placed an order to go, went to pick it up, parked my car and opened the door...it was an OASIS inside! I have to say, I was fooled by the outside.. The food is awesome. I usually get the Moo Shu Pork and my husband gets something new and we share. Everything is so good and, most importantly, you don't get that ill feeling (that sometimes Chinese food seems to make you feel, you know what I mean the \""I just ate a ton of grease and my day is shot\"" feeling). \n\nWe have been regulars for a couple of years now and I couldn't recommend it enough."
1,Always greeted with a SMILE (and a HUG)!  \n\nGreat Food!  Great Service!  \n\nGreat family owned restaurant that really cares about their customers. They remember their regulars by name and ask about your family members or friends.\n\nAlways fresh ingredients and no msg. Always consistently delicious!
1,"BEST Chinese!  I've been a customer for almost twenty years & they are amazing.  Restaurant is comfortable with nice atmosphere & the food is perfection!  Great prices, too.  SUPER nice staff.  NEVER had a bad meal there in nearly 20 years and Chinese is my favorite!"
1,Nothing beats Desert Jade.  They've updated their dining room and accommodate my now vegan diet.
1,Great food! I loved the Tangerine Chicken! :)
1,Pleasantly surprised! Didn't expect the light atmosphere from the outside... Great fast service... Decent price great food
1,"Food, tea, service are great!"
1,"This place has the best fried rice ever . not too dry , just perfect, I've only eaten inside once, and the workers are very nice. I order take out from here all of the time and they have fast service."
1,"This is the best American Chinese food we have had in the valley. Anytime we want great Chinese food, we drive here. It's out of the way but we'll worth the drive. Today I ordered the Peking Pork & House fried rice. My GF had the sweet & sour chicken. Each dish was amazing and worth adding to your next dining experience. The service is always exceptional. This is our favorite place for American Chinese food."
1,"Holy general Tso's ghost. How did I not discover this place before? So I was in my office and had a wicked craving for Chinese food. But the only place I knew of was Panda Express on 40th and Thomas... I'd rather eat my shoe with siracha than that panda. So I turned to the break room to see what fliers or menus were posted on the cork board... And Lo an behold ... Desert Jade. \nIt was not far at all doe my office and said what the hell I'll try it out. Drove over and liked that it was quiet and quaint. Not to over the top with typical Chinese restaurant decor... I couldn't find any Buddha statues or that annoying waving cat that you can't help but poke it's paw. It was very relaxed and cozy. \nImmediately they brought out water and hot tea... The hot tea by itself with no sugar is awsome. Not sure what kind of tea it is, green maybe or ginger, don't know don't care, it was good. \nThe lunch menu is very inexpensive and very plentiful portions. I ordered the sweet and sour pork with fried rice. It was very rich in flavor for a classic lunch time go to. The fried rice was simple and didn't have crazy extras like bamboo shoots or bean sprouts. Two hearty scoops of fried rice and an egg roll plus my swee and sowa pohkk ... Great food and very hearty portions and left with a bill less than $10 with tip. Can't get that at panda, and unlike Panda, it didn't do the express blowout 30 minutes later in the office bathroom. Great little place hidden off indian school. Will definitely be going back."
1,Great!  Our favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  Staff is extremely courteous.  Try the jade chow mien and salt and pepper pork.
1,"This place is great.  I usually get the pulpo tostadas, but everything is sooo good it's hard to decide.  It is usually packed during the lunch-time hours, especially on the weekends, so if you're in a hurry it's  probably better to go on more off-hours.  But DO go - it's clean, fresh, and delicious."
1,"I know it looks like a hole in the wall, but the food is out of this WORLD. I was introduced to this place by some co-workers who are very familiar with what good REAL Mexican food is. This is it, we have been going back religiously since... The mocajete (i think), is this bowl of seafood tomato sauce, spices and cheese that is made and served in a lava rock bowl, it is still boiling when it makes it to the table. Not only is it HOT but it is also SPIIIIIIIIICY! Delicious...."
1,"I went here because it was the closest restaurant to Discount Tire... What an awesome place, and I will go out of my way to go back! \n\nFriendly staff, clean restaurant, and outstanding food. Chips and salsa were great, and the food was delicious!\n\nThanks!"
1,"Another outstanding Phoenix find!  This place isn't much to look at but the food is fantastic.  I had the Filete Relleno de Mariscos.  It was a fish filet (tilapia I think) stuffed with octopus, shrimp, squid, and snails smothered with a spicy tomato based sauce - fabulous!  I must have looked like a Minnesotan, because when I asked the waitress about it, she warned me that it was very spicy!  I assured her that I like spicy and it was a perfect amount of heat.  My wife had fish tacos and loved em!  \n\nThey serve a salsa unlike any I've tasted.  It wasn't real tomatoey and was brown with just the right amount of spice.  I asked the waitress how it was made but her English wasn't too good and my Spanish is non-existent, so I'll never know.\n\nThe extent of seafood at most Mexican restaurants is confined to shrimp dishes.  The menu here is saturated with different seafood options.  If you like seafood Mexican style you must try Mariscos Acapulco."
1,"Wally's is fab. The decoration is like a classy den with some memorabilia and Americana, but nothing overbearing or tacky. Very casual and convenient, the bartenders are very friendly, and the place is seemingly run by people all very comfortable and familiar with each other (something I really like). Great beers on tap, some super wines, and the food is above average (lots of variety... think Village Tavern with an edge). It's popular with Arcadia residents, but is still politely tucked away, so you rarely have to worry about the crowds. They also stay open until everyone leaves, so getting a big party in late may not be a problem."
1,"Where everybody knows your name.  Very refreshing to be waited on by Wally himself, I'll come back for the we serve mostly \""regulars\"" feeling you get.  I don't think enough people know about this place but those that do come back for more.  The Cuban is my lunch of choice and the beer selection is perfect for happy hour."
1,"I have been dining at Wally's for the past several years. \n\nWally's has great food and drink served by super friendly people in a family friendly enviroment.  The prices are also very reasonable.  \n\nWally's is the Best  casual dining experience in the Valley.  \n\nYou really can't go wrong with anything on the menu but for lunch I recommend the smoked turkey sandwich or fish and chips.  For those of you that like burgers, the Wally burger is great.    For dinner the chicken parmesan is outstanding.  I also really like their chicken marcello.\n\nWally just also opened a second location in Scottsdale.  \n\nIf your lucky, you may even run into Wally."
1,Great place for really good food.  My husband and I have always enjoyed everything that we have had at Wally's\nJane Lynch
1,"God this place is good.  Stepping into their dinning room is like being with friends.  It's quaint and comfortable and the servers are always friendly.  As for the food, it is equally as enjoyable.  The mac n cheese is to die for and the fish n chips is the best I've had in the valley.  Their homemade tartar sauce is what really sets them apart. \n\nIt's a little tucked away, but quite the gem."
1,"Wally's is an upscale pub with a price tag to match but the menu is carefully thought out, well prepared and (usually) served with a smile."
1,Always delicious and usually exceptional service! Love this location and the food! I will be a repeat customer for sure. The salads are always fresh and the food is so flavorful and amazing.
1,"Went here on a work luncheon, not expecting to see a line out the door at 1:00pm on a Wednesday.  After being sat, and greeted by our server, I could see they had a great customer service protocol as we had our drinks within 2 minutes.  I followed suit with the others and ordered their wings \""Wally Style\"" and onion rings.  Usually with appetizers, it takes something pretty special to make me happy, but the wings were fantastic!  Crispy, flavorful, only the drums, and sauce on the side.  The onion rings were so good also, that I brought my girlfriend back that Friday to try their other food.  We started with the escargot, and then I had the bangers n' mash, and she had the fish & chips.  The entire meal was phenomenal, and the service was perfect.  Couldn't recommend more.  My new guilty place to go when I have time to enjoy my lunch during the week."
1,"Wow! My first trip to Wally's .... and I got to meet Wally! Neat-O! \n\nNot only is he the bees knees he was hands on. I was, quite frankly, surprised by that. But more on that in a minute!\n\nTo frame my experience, I popped in on a Tuesday night during the dinner rush. One of our friends had hopped on over ASAP to nab a table. (Apparently this place is hopping. She was spot on!)\n\nIt's a really cute place that is friendly to all sorts of different folks. \n\nIf you want to watch the game? Sure! TV at the bar. \nFeel like eating at the bar? Yep!\nCasual dining? Absolutely.\nDinner date (where you want to impress)? YES. \n\nI was (not on a date) but did see a number of couples engaged in serious conversation over wine. It's not too loud of a place (at least on a Tuesday night) to foster intimate conversation. \n\nFor dinner I followed the menu's guidance (and then asked Wally himself). Chicken Vesuvius is w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l! Chicken medallions, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, 'cider' smoked bacon (HOH MY) with plenty of herbs and spices. My meal was served with a hearty portion of salad and (HOH MY) horse radish mashed potatoes.\n\n1) The chicken was cooked to perfection. Not a hint of dryness!\n2) The chicken wasn't bathed in oil. That sounds like a terrible way to describe it, but, I didn't feel like I was tossing a gym session out the window. \n\nThat being said, note that portions are on the very [very] generous side. I took 2/3rd of it home.\n\nRight. So about Wally, the impeccable service and a delightful experience... Let's see...Our server described the specials with such delight that I only wished I was going off menu. But no! I wanted something \""regular\"" on the menu. Wally was incredibly helpful in helping this first timer navigate the full menu. (Alas, the house was out of the nightly special of ribs.) Wally has a comedic sense of timing. Watch out!\n\nOk, so what's the deal with Wally's fantastic beard? Were you thinking Ernest Hemingway? Why yes! In fact, Wally and his son enter a contest every year for the best E. Hemingway beard in FL. \n\n[Drum Roll] They are 2013 crowned winners!\n\nThis is a great spot if you're popping in to AJ's. Loved it!"
1,Best place in town for Friday night Prime Rib!
1,"While visiting Phoenix we happened upon this place and were pleasantly surprised at how good the burgers tasted!  \n\nIt was a nice evening so we sat outside (coming from the snow we had this winter, sitting outside was something I didn't think would ever happen again).  \n\nThe menu was pretty extensive, I think anyone in your party should be able to find something to please them.  Usually I would expect with such a large menu the food would be just okay.  But not this place, at least not as far as the burgers.\n\nI ordered the buttons and bleu burger and my boyfriend ordered bacon cheddar burger.  We both ordered our burgers medium rare and they were cooked perfectly!  There was a ton of mushrooms and bleu cheese on mine and lots of bacon and cheddar on his.  So much so, that he was able to share some bacon with me.  \n\nThe burgers came with a mixture of regular fries and sweet potato fries (my favorite).  I loved the idea of mixing them so you don't have to decide on one or the other.  \n\nOverall, the food was delicious, the prices were fair (especially for amount of food) and outside sitting was perfect!  If ever in Phoenix again, I will definitely go back to this place."
1,"I've been to Taylor's Cafe on several occasions... both for breakfast and for lunch.  Breakfast is served all day, and there is plenty to choose from.  As Shannon wrote, there is a variety of healthy options including several veggie omelettes and design-your-own as well.  \nServers are consistently friendly and even when the restaurant is crowded, I've never had to wait too long on my food... \nTaylor's is good for groups but it works for solo diners as well... guys may think it is a little bit 'fru-fru' but they will not complain when their food arrives - indoor and outdoor seating available.  My next visit will be one night for dinner - i think they have live music from time-to-time."
1,Love this breakfast place!  My fav place for breakfast.  I can bring puppy and sit on outside patio. Love the healthy omelet options.  The crapes are DELISH. French toast and buttermilk pancake DELISH!! Excellent Menu with several great options for vegetarians. Full five star in my book!!!\nCozy comfy atmosphere- always run into the kindest people dinning here as well.
1,"I am amazed!\nI wear heels...all the time. \nI fall in love with certain pairs and inevitability need to have the tips of my stilettos replaced. I had been putting it off, because I thought I would be without my favorite pairs for a few days. I called The Shoe Shop. They were so friendly and said if I can in before 2pm they could fix my shoes while I waited. What???\nI got there about 1:30 and (having a blonde moment) was wearing one of the pairs i needed fixed. The gal took the shoes I was wearing and the other pair to the back, where the magic happens. She came back seriously 2 minutes later with perfectly repaired heels. I could not believe it! The cost was $12.50 per pair, quite a deal when they are done this fast!\n\nI am a forever customer, it was a perfect experience!"
1,"I know it gets a lot of bad reviews, but since I've been going to this place since I was a kid, and sweet and sour pork is my favorite \""Chinese\"" dish, I'm giving it 5 stars. I remember as a kid, all of the Chinese food buffets had a thin sweet and sour sauce on crispy bits of breaded fried pork, but every other buffet I go to now has a very thick, overly sweet sauce. It's not a desert, it shouldn't be so sweet, and Golden Coin has been making this dish the same for so long, it's an absolutely perfect blend of sweet and sour. No they don't have a big selection, but it's better to make a few great items than to make 1000 mediocre items."
1,Thank you Doctor Romine! She pays extremely close attention to my personal needs and concerns. I have been to numerous doctors and found her practice the most reliable. She even called me the evening after my appointment to check in on me. Very well run and trustworthy office.
1,"Wonderful place that will be honest with you and talk with you about ALL your choices  unlike other clinic who only want you to do what what best benefits their bottom line. Don't go into other clinics where their \""counseling\"" is just a sales pitch! Highly recommend this place! I love my son so much and would be lost without him, never have I ever regretted my decision to give birth to him."
1,"Excellent customer service! The owner personally went above and beyond for our needs, and we were \""wowed\"" by their amazing service. We are customers for life!"
1,"I love this place! The staff are courteous and knowledgable. I am typical man that has no sense of taste on flowers, what to send per occasion, etc... Pam was there when I needed her. On a Saturday I had two close relatives in the hospital, one gave birth, the other hanging on. What can I say, but a big Thank You to Fresh Cut Romance. I appreciate your help."
1,"Dive bars, mmmm good. Wood paneling and cheap drinks, 3 bucks for gin and tonics and most other mixed drinks. A shuffleboard game, Golden cup video golf game, darts and a good jukebox.   As far as dives go this place is a hidden gem."
1,"I have had dogs my whole life and have been to many different Vets around Scottsdale and Phoenix. I got a new puppy in July and a friend recommended Dr. Bracken so highly that I decided to go instead of taking her to my regular vet. I signed her up on the puppy plan which is great when you have a new puppy. It includes all shots, nail trimmings, visits and a discount on spaying. Dr. Bracken is the sweetest, most caring vet I have ever been to, he takes time to teach you puppy training and answers any and all questions you may have.  I have since taken my two other dogs and transferred their medical records to his office. You can tell on your first visit that Dr. Bracken's office is very busy but he is worth the wait. He loves dogs just as much as you do and isn't driven by the all mighty dollar that so many other vets exude. I would trust his honest, straight forward opinion over any one else!!!!!! I normally don't write that many reviews but if you love your dogs as much as I do, you'd taken them here!"
1,"Those who have cats and love them as much as I do, know that it can be difficult to find a veterinarian who is good with them. The reviews written by Teri B. and Sarah K. helped me to make up my mind and give this clinic a try since I was looking for the vet who was on the holistic side and really good with cats. And so far I haven't been disappointed. Dr. Bracken is very knowledgeable and progressive, and just like other reviews say - very kind, attentive to your pet, generous with his time and doesn't try to run the bill or prescribe/do any unnecessary procedures. The day before we went there I read somewhere online that a good veterinarian, before going straight to the exam, will try to interact with your pet, and that's exactly what Dr. Bracken did, even before he introduced himself to us! I have a Bengal and Dr. Bracken already knew what to expect of him, it was obvious he was familiar with the breed. But what is more important, my cat, who usually goes crazy at the vet's office, headbutted him marking him as his friend. He also asked me to tell him about my cat which had never happened before at other veterinarians' offices. \nWhen I told him my cat was on a BARF diet (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food) he didn't roll his eyes and didn't try to convince me that it was dangerous or inappropriate as I've read most veterinarians do. Actually, after talking a little more to him about it, I found out that he had done some reading on this topic and sees positive results. He even accepted \""An open letter to veterinary professionals\"" that I had printed out for him, which appeals to veterinarians to stop endorsing dry kibble and supporting pet food companies that have only one goal - profit and not our pets' health, and instead to learn more about ALL diets so they could help us to make better choices for our pets when it comes to their nutrition. He didn't try to push any vaccines (we were there for an annual exam) either.  To sum it up, the exam was not as stressful for my cat (which means for me as well) as usual, my cat likes his new doctor and I trust him. The only negative - you may have to schedule the appointment way ahead of time, especially if the only day you can go is Saturday. We had to wait about 2 or 3 weeks, but I say it's worth it."
1,"Do you ever meet someone and it just clicks that they are in exactly the right profession, doing exactly what they were put on this earth to do? That's Dr. Bracken. We've been going to Arcadia with our pets ever since I was a little girl and now I take my own family pet there. I can't say enough good things about the kindness, love and warmth that Dr. Bracken shows each pet. He talks to them a little before taking them back to take care of them and immediately puts both my dog and me at ease. He's gone above and beyond his job description in so many ways, from taking a sick pet home with him to care for, to calling long after his office hours to give veterinary advice when I was frantic and needed an answer, I could never thank him enough."
1,Dr. Bracken and his staff are top notch! They actually care about you and your pets. They worked with me and my husband to get our puppies in on time for their 9 week shots even though the schedule was full. Such a great team of knowledgable people!!
1,"Dr Bracken is by far the most hard working, compassionate and understanding veterinarian out there. I was recommended to him by not 1 but THREE separate friends after my dog was hit by a car. My dog, Maeby, is a rescue dog and the light of my life. Seeing her get hit by a car was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life followed by a very stressful few months. I initially rushed her to an Emergency Clinic in Glendale who was available at night. I was terrified by their service. $400 dollars later I took her home with pain medication, some antibiotics and a 3 day internal bleeding watch. The next day I woke up to pooling blood coming from her undercarriage and once she finally let's me take a look I notice a HUGE gash that had completely been overlooked at least 4-5 inches on the underside of her tail. I took her back to find out her tail was broken and needed to be amputated. So now I'm on my second visit and the vet that comes out says that \""these things happen\"" and \""can easily be overlooked\"" Excuse me? She's a 13 pound dog. For that price and for being hit by a car I don't think I'm out of left field in expecting you look at the entire dog. \nUltimately he tells me her tail needs to be amputated and it would cost $1400 but did not want to \""steal my thunder\""..this was a problem as I didn't have that kind of money up front and had already spent a few hundred. I pay for the x rays of the tail they overlooked, the sutures and for additional pain medication-- about another 300 dollars. \n\nI was hysterical. My friends recommended getting a second opinion and this is when my god send, Dr Bracken came into play. He agreed to see Maeby the next morning- somehow he was able to make out what I was saying through my high intensity gurgle cries. She stayed intermittently with Dr Bracken and staff for a month getting her tail sutures checked and rebandaged; checking her hemmoraging and cuts and bumps. We were going twice a week which was extremely overwhelming in it's own. Some days I just had to get to work and they would watch her the whole day for me. Dr Bracken understood my financial concern and the love (understatement) I have for my dog. They worked with me and never made me feel anything less than welcome and at home regardless of my hysterics every single visit. \n\nThe whole staff has a deep love for animals and understands how much yours means to you. They will give you nothing but straight answers, 100% of their attention and fantastic service. I think half of them are also human psychologists. \n\nMaeby ended up losing most of her tail through the process but Dr  Bracken never lost sight of my concerns for her and would call me personally with check ups. She is now back to her normal puppy antics and happy as ever wagging her little nub every minute of the day. \n\nWe will come here for life and I constantly rave about this place. You won't find a better vet anywhere in Phoenix."
1,"I usually don't like to review chain restaurants but I have loved El Pollo Loco since birth! I feel like this is a great alternative to eating fried chicken. I find myself able to eat a full meal with out the guilt that comes with eating McDonalds or Popeyes or any other fast food. If I'm in the mood for something super healthy, which I haven't been in a while lol, I'll go for their humongous chicken tostadas. The whole thing is delicious including the taco shell bowl that it comes in. Their chicken is just amazing. You can taste that it is freshly grilled after marinating forever. Even though it is fast food, it doesn't taste like it! On the more regular occasion we usually opt for the family meal that comes with 8 pieces of chicken, 2 large sides, a salad and dessert for about $20. Macaroni and cheese is my side of choice; super cheesy (probably not healthy). We get some flour tortillas and make little tacos with the chicken, salsa and rice (Eric likes to put Mac n cheese in too). Even if its just the two of us, I love taking the leftovers to work for lunch. I love their salsa, so much that we can never go through the drive thru bc I have no shame and need about 15 salsas :). El Pollo Loco is my fast food of choice!\nP.s. the staff is super nice, they messed up on our order and took care of our next meal!"
1,"Great neighborhood sports bar!! Price is right, lots of drink specials. If you like playing pool or darts this place is for you."
1,"After reading the reviews on this site, I was a little leery about trying this restaurant.  However, my friend had a gift certificate for $50 and was looking forward to  having a nice Italian meal.  \n\nWe had a 6:30 reservation and was promptly greeted and seated.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and was patient in answering our questions about the various menu items.  \nFor starters we had the artichoke hearts stuffed with seafood drizzled with a Vodka sauce (mmm Yummy!) Just the right amount of garlic but not so much to overpower the delicate seafood mixture.\n\nWe decided to skip the salad and went straight for our entrees:  P had the seafood creps (again, in a Vodka sauce with pistachios.)  I opted for the halibut.  The halibut presentation looked like a Picasso artwork and the halibut steak was the lightest and flakiest I have ever had in my life. Sauteed in seasoned olive oil and italian bread crumbs with three circles on the side of the plate consisting of pureed green pepper drizzled with red pepper sauce. ( Isabella, owner and chef , cheerfully shared her recipe with me but I don't think it would ever come close to how she prepared this awesome fish) She told us that she purchases most of her produce from local growers as well as her meat.  She is a proponent of the \""Slow Food Movement\"" and understands the importance of supporting local growers and businesses.\n\nFor dessert we shared  freshly made 3 cheese cake with mix of fresh berries - it was light and oh so delicious. The homemade Tirmasu -light with perfect layers of sponge cake soaked in coffee liqueur combined with sweet whipped cream, mascarpone cheese, coffee, cinnamon and cocoa powder was also divine\nThe wine list was small but original (not your typical run of the mill or popular California wines) and the cappuccino was excellent.\nService was not too slow nor rushed.  The menu also has a couple of gluten free dishes\nThe only slight negative was the bus person who seemed to have an ongoing tiff with our waiter.  This was more amusing than anything else. \n Most of the tables are rather close together which is probably not conducive to a confidential conversation. A couple of the tables at the entrance seemed a little more private.  However,  we met  some very nice and interesting fellow diners which made our dining experience even more special.\nIsabella occasionally makes homemade cookies and instead of mints with our bill we got to sample her chocolate almond cookies that she had made fresh that afternoon. \n\nI am sorry that some of the Yelpers had a bad experience here in the past because the experience we had was totally opposite  Perhaps Isabella read their reviews and decided to make some changes???)\nAnyway, we defintiely will be back to try some of their other tempting dishes and to chat with Isabella again.  Ciao!"
1,"this is perhaps the best italian food in Az. We have been going there for about 10 yrs and always recommend this place to all our clients. Best food, which is all homemade best service. This place never disappoints us. We recommend this place to our  clients and the feedback is thank you for the best food experience we have had."
1,"Great food in a very homey location. Set up as a cute local family style place, we tested it with my well behaved 3year old grandson. Most of the other diners were our age and enjoyed the young enthusiastic Italian eater. The staff went out of their way to show him a good time. \nAs for the food, excellent homemade pasta with a very delicious sauce. Meatballs were light and tasty, ravioli were homemade ade delicious. I had the veal parm which was great. \nIf you are in town for a meeting, give it a try"
1,Probably the best Italian food I have had so far the in the valley. Our waiter was very friendly as well. This is more of a spot to bring your significant other then a group full of kids.
1,"This place is the best! It is very traditional inside, like a family home. It is family run and you can taste it! Food is excellent, really excellent. I had the gnocchi, a salad, and tiramisu. All delicious, savory, buttery, the kind of food you think about later. Personal service. We went here on a date night and it was great from the wine at the beginning to the dessert and coffee at the end. You really want to spread out your meal and enjoy."
1,"Best Italian in Phoenix. The pepper steak is just like grandma used to make. Best diablo sauce i've ever had outside of Italy, but very spicy. Service is not the best so dont go in a hurry."
1,"I took the White Knight (my Rav4) here on a Wednesday and got the $8.99 wash and interior vacuum. My only complaint is that they neglected to clean the bottom edge (under the doors) all around. I got home and had to wipe off the tar myself. Everything else went smoothly...fast service, little waiting, car (most of it) clean and shiney.\n\nThursday night it rained and the White Knight was a mess again. I brought \""him\"" back in and they rewashed and vacuumed at no charge because they have a 48 hour rain/rewash policy. I love that!\n\nI'll be back."
