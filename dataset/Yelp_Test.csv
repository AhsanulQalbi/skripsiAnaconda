0,"My wife and I used to love Arriba's, til recently when we joined some friends at the end of their table for dinner. We arrived about an hour after they did, and they were finished when we got there.\n I ordered a stuffed poblano chili dish and it really was not good at all. Bad enough that the food was bad, but when we were ready to leave, we asked the waitress for our check, so she gives us a check for the whole table.\n My wife said, \""No-we want our check only\"" and the waitress said that they do not do seperate checks, which is B.S. because we always have gotten seperate checks at the Arriba's in Arrowhead. This created a big hassle for us because we never carry cash, so my wife had to pay back one of her friends for our share of the bill the following week.\n This is no way to conduct a business, and I also sent the main office an email telling them about what had happened, but they never answered the email. I guess customer satisfaction means nothing to them, so we will NEVER go back! \n\n Anyplace can roast chilis, so thats nothing special for Arriba's.\n\n Macayos is the place from now on, and the food there is superior to Arriba's."
0,You get what you pay for.  The food is inexpensive but taste that way.  The only thing good is the bean dip and salsa that you get at the beginning of the meal along with hot corn and flour chips.  The rest of the meal is bland.
0,"Unfortunately, yesterday's visit was one of the worst dining experiences I've had during my 10 years in Phoenix. The food was sub-awful (seriously, a cheese crisp that a 7-year-old deems inedible?), the service was terrible (zero smiles, and I had to basically tackle our server get the check, much less some refills on water glasses), and the atmosphere was equal to that of the third lunch shift at a nursing home.\n\nI won't go back. Ever."
0,"I went into the Scottsdale location yesterday.  I was going to be seated right by the kitchen by the host when the restaurant was 20% full and then asked to be seated in another area where there were more people around and better lighting.  The waiter never cleared our plates, and I had to order 3 meals before I could even eat anything.  This restaurant had dirty menus dirty plates/glasses, slow waiters, the food was unedible and the kitchen was slow...  I think this time I am calling the food inspector.  I am sure that there are many violations happening in this restaurant.  I tried to give them feedback, however, they  did not recieve it well.\n\nPlease don't waste your money.  This is such a poor example of no service and bad food.  I expected to get food poisoning after this experience."
0,"It takes a lot for me to write a review and blast a company like this and to be fair, all the negatives come from their Gilbert location; the auwatukee location has always been good.  I've tried Ariba's several times and have been disappointed every time.  In the four of the last five visits, I've found the floors sticky and the tables dirty.  If they pay this little attention to the cleanliness of the front, I'm scared of what I might find in the kitchen.  Although I've always found the service to be slow and the waiters inattentive, Sunday's (8/5/12) experience was one of the worst I've ever experienced anywhere.  I thought I would take some out of town relatives to a good AZ Mexican dinner, but once we received our water/Ice tea, they were refilled once during our visit and that only after flagging down the waiter.  Minor, maybe, but when the food was delivered to the table, one of the meals was missing and I was assured it would be right out.  20 minutes later I flagged down the waiter once again and with apologizes, was told they would get it right out.  Another 20 minutes went by and my guests had all finished their meals before the waiter came by to see if we needed anything else. When I told him we still hadn't received the meal and since everyone else was done, we no longer wanted the meal and wanted it removed from our bill.  Again with apologies, he left and finally returned 20 minutes later with the meal removed.  Annoyed with the slow service I tried to return the bill with my credit card immediately.  I was ignored and waited another 20 minutes for him to return to take my money.  Save yourself a lot of aggravation and disappointment and go somewhere else."
0,"Arriba has been one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, but tonight I have really had to examine my love of this restaurant. It has been at least 6 months since I ate there and I was really excited about going back. I was seated in the back room. I immediately noticed that it looked like it needed a deep cleaning. My table was clean, but the walls and the areas surrounding the cheesy nature scenes in the back were filthy. The service was good, and my meal came quickly. As I was eating, something caught my eye not far from my table in the nature scene plants. It was a set mousetrap. This really turned my stomach. The food that I was eating was great as usual, but it really creeped me out that the place was so dirty and that they apparently had a rodent problem. My advice to the owners is to bring in a professional cleaning team and for heaven's sake don't leave mousetraps out for the patrons to see."
0,I got sick eating this food.. DONT EAT HERE.. my wifes co workers had the same experience
0,"Omg, what happened to this place. Had some shopping to do across the street.  Me & boyfriend stopped in after work, sat in the bar. Checked out the grease covered hh menu,  order a beer & Jim beam. \nDrinks come & the beer is half ass cold, Jim was fine. Chit chatting with the old man & we noticed a fly...no big deal...As the conversation progressed we couldn't keep the conversation going without swatting flies.  After a while I burst out into hysterical laughter,  this shit was ridiculous!\n Instantly transported back to rocky point hungover eating fly infested tacos roadside and you don't care because your lucky to have survived the night in Mexico!  Its Ok, I'm Mexican I can say this shit!\nAnyway still sitting at the bar waiting for pozole & enchiladas,  the couple right behind us is in sneezing distance - literally this fucking guy is sneezing open mouth all over the place, my back was wet. \nFuck it, I actually taste the food. Eh,  the posole was decent & the spinach enchiladas salty. \n\nOh wait we also ordered taquitos appetizer.  See the photo, the fucking fly posted for a SELFIE! \n\nYou want Mexican,  tons of other places. Skip this place, overpriced.  Loved it back in the day, crash & burn this place is toast!"
0,"Very low budget! Margaritas in a plastic Dixie cup!!! Will not return. We were told because of budgeting. The server Josh was great,he made the visit good. Give him a raise!"
0,"Surly, poor service - we spotted a couple of thick gray-white hairs floating on top of my girlfriend's wine. After scowling at us for bringing it up, the new bartender from Flagstaff poured out the wine and then informed us that these were tiny strands of cheese from our con queso, which my girlfrind didn't touch and was about 2 feet away from her. It is obvious when you have hairs in your drink!\nIn attentive service from that point on, but when we left after awarding the bartender the 5% tip (more than he deserved) he pursued us down the sidewalk to the south, outside the building by walking along the plate glass windows on the inside, banging on them alongside as we walked. \nWhat a weird experience! Been going here for years and years, some of their dishes are quite good, others not so hot; wine list pretty indifferent and slipping. But this kind of behavior is a game changer. I will never go back."
0,"After making a dinner reservation for two, arrived to find several people waiting.  We waited 15 mins past our reservation time and with no other choice, were seated at an after-thought, tv tray-sized table crammed into the corner behind the frosted glass partition at the front door.  On top of that lovely description, every time someone went in or out the door, it slammed against the glass and sounded like a gunshot.  This was enjoyed during our one drink and appetizer before leaving.  So if you're a party of two, be forewarned."
0,"If only zero star was available. After one sip of my drink, I wanted to leave; ordered a Coke but got a flat diet soda. I am allergic to diet soda. The food was just plainly bad. Couldn't wait to get home to use mouthwash and brush my mouth to get rid of the flavor of their food. Please, I am serious, when you want to find a place to go out to eat then go some where else. Not here."
0,"Boo bestbuy. You are a major inconvinience for me. And your employees are brain dead. I only like the fact that you are close to my house, but that sorta doesn't count anymore because Circuit city is now closer to me. You know best by, your not the best and maybe I don't wanna buy from you anymore! Why don't you put that in your back pocket?"
0,The WORST Best Buy I've ever been to.  I was charged $231.27 for an AMP install ... and they crossed the wiring so my right speaker was in the front left and the left speaker was in the right back ... and it kept shorting out on me.  And it sounded like compete shit (go figure) because they never played with the settings.  I went to the Manager Kevin S (he would NOT give me his last name) and he was a total unhelpful prick.  Anthony was the kid who f'ed up my install ... finally I got Keith to FIX the mess up ... Shop ANYWHERE but this store run by complete ASSHOLE PRICKS.  And what ever you do don't let Anthony touch your vehicle!
0,"This is the dirtiest and mostly disorganized Best Buy I've ever been to.   Today it took some girl in customer service 10 minutes to look up whether they had a PC game I wanted.  As it turns out, the game hits shelves tomorrow, not today, but I had to go to 5 stores to figure that out.  The folks at Best Buy said they would not carry it, which is hilarious since I know they'll carry it since it's an expansion pack for a top-selling game they have on the shelves.\n\nIn the words of Napolean Dynamite: \""Gosh, idiot.\"""
0,"Oh yeah, this place absolutely blows. I'll enter in a new reason (though all mentioned are perfectly valid): Limited Clint Eastwood selections in the movie department. Fie!"
0,"Picture it: August 2009.  My HD TV suffers from some unknown affliction.  Luckily I purchased an extended warranty through Best Buy which covers parts and labor through 2011.  Geek Squad's earliest appointment (in-home service) is almost two weeks away.  Day of appointment I miss work to be home.  Supposed to hear between 7 and 9 am.  Nothing, so I call at 9 am to confirm.  Yes, appointment...between 8 and 12.  1 pm: \""Oh, he called and line was busy.\""  No.  No, he really didn't.  After pressing...and pressing...for additional info, turns out the tech didn't go to work that day!  He wasn't at work...but the line was busy when he tried to call.  Huh?!!  Had it been a Saturday, it would have been an annoyance, but I missed work and was then lied to.  I've got a bitter taste in my mouth..."
0,I have shopped at bestbuy on a handful of occasions.  Once at this particular store.  I have never had genuine customer service experience from this establishment.   Every time I shopped here I feel like I am bothering an employee when I ask questions or call in for service status.    \n\nMy last experience was with a camera that had an issue.  This issue was covered under the extra plan I purchased.  I took the camera in.   After 2 weeks I received an automated phone call that my camera was ready for pick-up at the Geek Squad counter.  Before leaving the store I did as most do and I checked out the repair.   The camera was exactly the same as it was before I gave it to the geek squad.  I showed the customer service lady and she said that the paper work shows it was repaired.  She said if I was not happy with the repair I could sign the paper work and re-submit the claim.  This is when I got furious.   I was being asked to sign a paper stating I was happy with the repair and then re-submit the claim that the camera was still broken!!  I refused to sign the paper and asked that the camera be re-submitted with out a second claim.  During all of this I was never apologized to or offered an expedited service.  I had to ask for the camera to be expedited the second time around.  I don't believe they expedited the second claim since it still took another 2 weeks for the camera to come in.  They camera was repaired the second time but I was out of a camera for a month and never did receive an apology. \n\nI have learned my lesson for the last time.   I will now purchase my electronics from one place and this place is newegg.com  These guys know customer service and have a customer for life.
0,"Let me start by saying, historically, I like Best Buy. I like what they stand for, I like their products and I like their customer service. For these reasons, when I recently bought a condo and I was in need of a washer, dryer, refrigerator and television, the first place I looked was Best Buy. However, I picked the wrong Best Buy to make my purchase. \n\nThis review is not about ALL Best Buys. This is about the Best Buy on 20th and Camelback. \n\nLike I said, I purchased a washer, dryer and television and the Geek Squad mounting from this Best Buy. \n\nThe washer, dryer and TV were to be delivered on a Saturday morning by 10:30 a.m.  I received the call on Friday confirming my delivery. On Saturday at 10 a.m. the delivery truck arrived, but there was one MAIN problem. They only had the dryer. Where were my TV and washer? Good question. Well, the washer was on a truck that apparently \""broke down\"" while coming from California. Best Buy didn't bother calling me to tell me that my washer wouldn't be delivered. The television was a whole other story. The sales associate apparently filled out the form incorrectly, and so the order was cancelled. Was I called about either of these issues? No. It wasn't until I talked to the delivery company and 3 different people at Best Buy to \""resolve\"" the problem. At this point it was too late to have my items delivered on Saturday and because I work, I had to wait another week to have them delivered.\n\nBut, this saga isn't over yet. When they messed up my order, they PROMISED me I would have my washer and television delivered by 10:30 a.m. the following Saturday since they messed up my order. I had to be somewhere at 11 so it was impertinent it was delivered before then. They said, not a problem and promised it would be there. \nI called the Geek Squad on Thursday to confirm that my TV would be installed and delivered Saturday. They confirmed that the Geek Squad would arrive WITH the TV and install it. \n\nI then got a call from the delivery truck about my washing machine (remember, they promised it would be there by 10:30 am.) They told me the washer would be delivered between 1-3 pm. I had to argue for a half an hour with the manager before he  final \""pulled strings\"" to \""accommodate\"" my original delivery request. \nBut...it's not over yet. \n\nThe second Saturday morning arrives. The washer gets there. Check that off the list. Then, the Geek Squad arrives to install my TV. Remember, they PROMISED me they'd arrive with the TV. Guess what. They didn't. The poor guys had no idea they were supposed to pick up the TV. In fact, I learned that they aren't even allowed to pick up deliveries from this store. So, my installation guys are there and the TV is missing yet again. They did me a HUGE favor and actually drove across town to this store to pick up the TV (shocking fact; these guys don't work at the store on Camelback. They work at the one on Frank Lloyd Wright). So, they go all the way to the Camelback location to pick up my TV....which they learn was about to be shipped to Texas for some random reason. If they hadn't picked up my TV, I'm sure I'd still be missing it today. Was I ever called by Best Buy with an apology? No. \n\nI don't think I need to explain further why I would never shop at this Best Buy again. I bought my refrigerator from the Best Buy on Shea and it went off without a hitch. \n\nSo my Yelp friends, if you want a seamless experience with your pricey purchases of major appliances, I would suggest you shop anywhere but the Best Buy on Camelback and 20th. Not only did they mess up my order on multiple levels, the sales associate staff was rude on top of it. \n\nThis is not the experience you want when you are making a large financial commitment."
0,"Best Buy is a necessary evil because I don't know where else to get/do the things they have/can do for me.  But if anyone does know a good local electronics place, let me know.  ASAP.\n\nI took my computer to Best Buy to get it recycled.  Computer parts are super toxic and should NOT be thrown into the trash.  They wanted to charge me $10 to recycle it.  Someone step out there and pass a dammed law saying that recycling charges must be included in purchases, for the love of god.  It doesn't take a genius to determine cause-and-effect incentive structures and figure this out.  Oh, tangent.\n\nBut I didn't have to pay $10, because they were going to charge me $20 to remove my harddrive, and that apparently trumps the recycling charge.  $20.  TWENTY.  It's 4 screws.  That's it.  That's $5 per screw.  I asked him if i could just borrow a screwdriver and I'd do it right there.  He said no.  So I went to try and find a screwdriver for purchase in the store.  The only one came in a $30 computer toolkit set.  Defeated, i retreated back to the Thief Squad and paid them $5 per screw, which took them all of 40 seconds, and left harddrive in hand and $20 lighter.\n\nBest Buy, I hate you."
0,"I generally like Best Buy and have always had very good luck with them.  I recently moved just a few blocks away from the 20th St and Camelback store -- This has got to be the nastiest and most disorganized Best Buy I have ever been to. \n\nLast week I was there to purchase a tv bracket -- 70% of the items were out of stock.  The next day I went to purchase a simple cable for my phone -- out of stock.  Last night I went to return an item -- no one was in line, however it took close to 20 minutes for someone to come to the customer service desk.  Once she was there, she didn't know how to use the register, then register ran out of paper once she was ready to process my return and took another 10 minutes for her to find a manger to change the receipt paper.  Employees are rude and mostly brain dead at this store.  I'd rather drive 20-30 minutes to Fry's Electronics in Tempe than ever return to this store again. The manager of this store needs to be fired."
0,"Worst customer service EVER.  This is a repeat offense with the car audio install bay.  \n\nThe rep Anthony has a really offensive sales tactic of treating customers like idiots.  He must have some kind of super power because he told me (over the phone) that what I had in my car currently sounded \""okay\"" but not as good as it could if I bought some new speakers in addition to the deck I was inquiring about having installed.  \n\nYou know what Anthony, I'll go to Fry's or better yet order from Crutchfield."
0,"Ok has been 7 months since my 1 star rating.  I thought I'd stop in to buy a new camcorder.  BIG MISTAKE.  One guy working in the department while the store manager and other employees talked at the customer service counter about what they watched on TV last night.  After asking 3 times for the camera guy to request some help, I gave up after waiting 40+ minutes.  I have now sworn to never go back to this store.  I have no idea how they even stay in business."
0,"Best Buy,you really suck.\nTried to buy a camera the other day.\nMid day,mid week,store pretty empty.\n3 employees hanging around the camera department as I started to look at options.\nNo one asked if they could help,in fact they first stopped their conversation in an attempt to become invisible.\nNo problem,I'll poke around till I either find what I want ,or until I have comparison questions to narrow down choices.\nI think I have it,I'm ready to select.\nWhere'd everyone go?\nI'm so lonely.\nI start to wander a bit and see if they're doing laundry in the appliance section.\nnope.\nMaybe around by the video cameras.\nNope nope.\nUnder a display cabinet?\nNah,that would be silly...\nThey were just gone.\nPoofed.\nVanished.\nVaporized.\nI decided it had to be the nefarious work of aliens.\nYes,I said \""nefarious\"".\nI became frightened in my alone-ness Fearing next would be an invasion of the Apple People of the Crack Basha's.\nWho would protect me?\nThe aliens abducted all the staff of Best Buy,so it would just be me.\nI couldn't possibly stop them all.\nThey would come,snarling their toofless grimaces at me.\nI would be defenseless.\nFearing my life and existance as I know it,I saw only 3 choices.\n1)Face them all.Aliens and Apple People of the Crack Basha's.Fight till the end or vaporization.\n2)Take what I wanted as there was no one left to stop me.\n3)Make a hasty retreat and go elsewhere to purchase a camera.\nGentle readers,as you read this harrowing tale,you can safely assume I chose plan #3.\nNew camera in my possession,safe at home taking pictures of the pets grateful to have gotten out alive.\nSince all the help at Best Buy has been vaporized,you may want to go elsewhere if you'd like to purchase anything that isn't self serve.\nRemember to get a subscription to some crap magazine on your way out.\nThank you,come again."
0,"I am NOT surprised that this store is the lowest rated in the area.\n\nExcuse me, I have a return.  It's unopened but I bought it more than thirty days ago.  I DO have the receipt and you still sell the product, Linksys router.\n\nMgr:  I'm sorry.  We do not take returns over 30 days.\n\nMe:  If I didn't show you the receipt, would you accept it?\n\nMgr  Yes, but you did show it to me.\n\nWay to go mgr, you got me there.  Took it to Frank Lloyd Wright store- they accepted it immediately and told me they didn't care when I bought it but, could only give me a store credit. \n\nGood job guys, got me for $1.75 in gas."
0,"here's a tip - they don't stock their shelves, so what's on display they might not have, and they often have discontinued items on display. lame."
0,Client service is awful. Nobody knows what they can or can't do. Waited on manager to come over to see if they could sell a video game and he said if it's not our policy we can't. Real qualified manager if u don't know the policies. Have had bad experiences multiple times at this location maybe why they have such bad ratings. Try and help the client that is your job don't just try and find every reason why u can't help.
0,The employees of Best Buy are super shady. Purchased over 2000 laptop out of state. Purchased additional ram to be installed by best buy and their geek squad. I stopped by to pick up and they want to charge another $30 for the install. I can't believe how dishonest this company is. The geek squad manager implied she didn't care what the salesman from another store told me. I guess they are all independent!  Customer service is extremely lacking. I knew I should have went to Fry's Electronics!
0,Geek squad is the worst to deal with and NEVER shows for appointments..When you call they can't find work order and when you provide the number that was given for service call they tell you it is someone else and where did you get the number.\nNever again!!!!
0,"DO NOT BUY GEEK SQUAD INSURANCE.\n\nI just bought a brand new galaxy note 4 last week with the full package insurance. After being told I would get $100 off for trading in my iphone, I had to ask as I'm about to swipe my card why I would not get credited, reason, I had a small crack on the back. This crack does not influence phone function or the front screen, cameras, or any phone function. Thanks guys for telling me after I have the plastic out.\n\nA week later, my phone was lost/stolen after a night out. I go to geek squad and after waiting on the phone for upwards of an hour. I finally get to the deductable for the phone. It's $240. The same price as a new Galaxy with a new 2 year contract. OHHHHH and the real kickers are, it takes 2-5 business days for it to arrive AND it's a refurbished phone, not a brand new phone a flippin broken and fixed leftover. I'm beyond furious with them. Also I had to ask the manager about anyway to walk out of the store with some sort of phone, and she more or less dismissed me. This 1 star goes to geek squad. Well done guys seriously you earned this one.\n\nLike I said this review is for Geek Squad NOT the rest of best buy. The computer guys there are fantastic. I've talked to a couple of them and they have been nothing but knowledgeable, honest, and straightforward. If you have computer problems they are the ones to go to hands down. They won't steer you in the wrong direction."
0,"So, they're good for a few things when in a pinch.  Problem is, tags are always mislabeled, they don't stock most items, they're over priced, and they have the worst return policy I have ever seen.\n\nI have a theory that amazon purchased best buy years ago, and made them really crappy so that people would just shop at amazon.\n\nI am just going to buy what I needed on amazon and do same day delivery - which is free during the Christmas season, and have what I need tomorrow afternoon."
0,"I've never seen so many fat, ugly people working in one place and all of them doing nothing.  Yet another store that claims to carry PC games but couldn't tell me when or if ever they would carry a major-market PC game expansion.  This is my 2nd trip there, the last time they tried to sell me a laptop with Vista despite a quick explanation that we were just trying to see if they had any XP inventory.  \n\nUg."
0,"Man what a mess! I found myself walking in circles trying to figure out where to start and where to end. Everything is out of order and the placement of new releases (movies and music) makes absolutely no sense. This store could use a training day in merchandising. The staff seem disengaged and not familiar with the product. Want to throw the staff for a loop, ask for a copy of LA VIE EN ROSE...had to repeat the title several times to two different people who could not figure out what I was asking for. Oh forget it! \nSincerely,  Empty Handed"
0,"Very disappointed and wouldn't recommend them to anyone, actually I would go out of my way to make sure my dogs story is heard. After three vet visits and a month worth of medication and permanent eye damage, my shih tzu is partially blind because of this shops negligence. When I noticed my dogs eye I immediately called the owner who denied any potential wrong doing. Coincidentally my dog was fine before I dropped him off but when I picked him up he all of a sudden either got burned by a blow dryer or cut with scissors per the vet... ON HIS EYEBALL!!! I'm certain it happened at puff n fluff. The owner sounded concerned for his health and said she would follow up in a few days after the vet visit ... Here we are three months later and still no call. Sad because I went there for more than 6 years and no longer feel safe there. Highly recommend looking for alternate groomers."
0,"I'm not sure what gain I would get by accusing your shop of doing this to my dog. As I said I've been going there for years and never had an issue. I'd actually preferred to continue going but your behavior changed that. It was not 6 days after he was there and I'm sorry you don't remember. He was there on Thursday and if you recall my conversation on Monday w you and not just try to refute my credibility, you'd remember I said I walked him Thursday night and noticed he couldn't bare walking near car lights, which made me wonder what happened so I took him to vet Monday when they opened, when he could no longer keep his puss filled eye open. I didn't ask for any vet bills or future bills, but a little accountability would have been nice. So to say it didn't happen and it's a matter of right or wrong doesn't make sense. It's not my integrity that's compromised by writing a review, it's your pure denial and lack of accountability that's questionable. If you notice I don't yelp often and felt compelled to share my story so other eyeballs could be spared. You know we all know accidents happen and we have to deal with things and that's just life. This was an accident and he survived and we are doing just fine, as suspected. If he and my other dog were really like family you would have returned your end of the bargain and checked back, regardless of what you think happened. I never insinuated your shop didn't treat animals like they're family and again have absolutely nothing to gain by purposely putting negative feedback here other than my experience. \n\nCoincidence? Hmm I don't think so, nor did my vet. You would have known had you followed up as you said you would. It's your conscience that needs to be cleansed, not mine."
0,"Martin's auto Repair NOT THAT GREAT!\n\nYELP REVIEWS ON MARTIN'S AUTO - SO POSITIVE, \nBUT THAT'S NOT MY EXPERIENCE\n\n I called Martin's and a guy asked to call me back.  He had time to research my question, what will an oil change cost?  He called me back and said, \""oil change, with oil weight and model specified, $35.  He told me it would take 30-60 minutes and it would cost $35.  But they took two hours and charged \""$55\"".  \n\nI won't/can't dispute the very positive reviews, their lengthy history, hell, these are the actual reviews that led me here.  My experience?  I was overcharged by 57%.  FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT!\n\nAs I complained, the owner, I assume he was the owner, came out but there was no give: the bill; was the bill. \n\nListen, this was a $55 oil change vs the promised $35 oil change.  It was handled.  But I did my research, I called around, I read all the feel-good reviews Martin's had and they still shived me.\n\nMY ADVICE?  BE CAREFUL WITH MARTIN'S.  I DID NOT FIND THEM TO BE THE RELIABLE, LOVABLE NEIGHBORHOOD-AUTOGUYS.  \n\nTHEY OVERCHARGED ME AND KEPT ME WAITING."
0,"The only thing NIbblers is good at is being on time. (Kind of...)\nI ordered basic box lunches, tea, coffee and water for an event for 80 people. The bill was $1500. That comes to $18.75 per person. The sandwiches were those things that have a lump of stuff in the middle which are then cut in half to display said middle. What you end up with is mostly bread. \nThe tea was in gallon sized plastic milk jugs which were just left on the table. Just like everything else, there was no presentation at all. They were on time, but forgot to bring several things so they had to run back to Hq and get them. \nI don't have a lot of experience with catering, so maybe for 20 bucks a person you shouldn't expect much, but this was just cheap, cheap, cheap. I would not use them again."
0,They deserve negative stars I heard that there is new owners and it shows from a terrific caterer to a terrible one I've used them for many charitable events it was always on point now I wouldn't recommend them to the dog pound
0,"I arrived mid-day, with one goal in mind - buying a new mattress for the guest room.  This should have been a very quick purchase, since I pretty much knew exactly what I wanted.  Unfortunately, the salesperson didn't even bother to acknowledge my presence for over 5 minutes.  Finally, I got a quick \""hi\"", and he went back to his other customer.  I walked up and down every aisle in the store, waiting, waiting, waiting, while he walked them from bed to bed while they tried laying on each one.  Seriously? I could have chosen and paid for my bed in the amount of time it took them to try out just one!  Someone needs to instruct him on handling multiple customers at once.  Two isn't really that many! Since the salesman was clearly more interested in serving them, I left and bought my bed at Mattress Firm instead."
0,"About 7 years ago I purchased one of their mix-n-match 99.00 deals for my spare bedroom! After the set-up, I noticed that the box spring was completely made of cardboard!! The mattress was not much better and the WHOLE thing was thrown out in about 6 months! Well, I figured, you get what you paid for..my bad!! About 9 months ago I was back at Sleep America....thinking it was my mistake the last time...this time I spent almost 900.00 for a queen set for my teenage son. Every morning I have noticed a really funny sound when he is getting out of bed, and low and behold ...the box spring is CARDBOARD!!! MY BAD AGAIN for not inspecting, but I feel SOOO CHEATED!!! The mattress isn't that great either!! I will be replacing shortly and I can ASSURE you that I will NEVER step foor in a Sleep America again!! ughhh..BTW...it was not at this store...the store I purchased from was in Gilbert and is no longer there!"
0,"We purchased a high end mattress that was delivered on May 30, 2011. It has become very uncomfortable to sleep on it and the concern to make it right is non-existent at this point. They have received a report from Integrated Bedding Group but so far have failed to acknowledge that report. One of their reps told me that just because it was uncomfortable didn't mean it was defective. They tell you to shop local so you would think they would care about satisfying a customer. Never again will I shop there!"
0,"Very poor customer service. Apparently when you only have one customer sitting at your computer is more important. In addition, very rude sales person who must assume they are the only mattress provider in Phoenix. Needless to say we walked out from what could have been an easy sale and I rather go spend my money elsewhere."
0,"I took my BMW here because the dealership I purchased it from (used) took it here to have an oil leak repaired.  First off, the oil leak was \""repaired\"" only to find out later that it really wasn't.  Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket, which either occurred when this shop put the part in, or they purchased it with the defect, but either way, the problem was missed on their part, which tells me they do not pay attention to detail.  \n\nSo, when we noticed the leak was still an issue, it was under warranty through this shop for the original work, so I took it back.  I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley, they did repair it, however later that day my \""service engine\"" light came on, then went off.  A few days later, I parked my car, turned it off, and went to start it again after picking up my mail, and the car would not start.  Thankfully, my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty), we towed my vehicle back to my house, which was only down the road, but it was dead.  Come to find out, the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way, which is what tripped my \""service engine\"" light a couple of days before, and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle, the vehicle finally wouldn't start.  My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak), and there have been zero issues since.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if this shop did this on purpose, or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well.  But, given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn't notice was defective or they messed up themselves, and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished, I am not very happy.  On top of it, I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance!), and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son, and I were both sick at the time.\n\nI would NEVER recommend this shop to anyone, I will never ever go back, and I also intend on notifying the dealership I purchased my vehicle from of the issues in the hopes that they choose another BMW shop in the future to service any used BMW's that come onto their lot.  What a complete and utter nightmare."
0,"If I could give negative stars I would. One of the used car salesman hit me with one of their cars. After being cited by Phoenix PD, he proceeded to lie about who owned the car and what insurance was responsible. Later, after finding out that Auto-Europa actually owned the car and was responsible I tried calling to get insurance information. I spoke with Jason who was rude and dismissive and refused to give me any info so now I have to hire an attorney to file a civil suit. If this salesman Joseph Pratt and the owner/manager Jason are any indication of the type of service and sales it's my duty to warn everyone of their scumbag practices."
0,"Recently purchased a car here. Thought it would be decent, due to average reviews and featured on an app I downloaded for recommended dealers. By far not the best experience. They will tell you what you want to hear during the dealing process, and then make all sorts of excuses not to follow through with promises. \n\nHave had issues with the car, drivers window quit working, so they told us to let the guy who was replacing the windshield know. We did, the guy fixed it, we were on our way. \n\nCame time to make our first payment, which they told us wasn't due for another two weeks, and then a few days later was supposedly due and late, and informed us that we owe them now for the drivers side window. And since we were late, it \""threw up red flags\"" for them. Really?! So not coming through on your cheap little 500 mile warranty didn't throw up \""red flags\"" for us as consumers? Whatever.  \n\nThese people are very shady. Do not let the initial welcoming manner fool you. They are money sharks and will not help you whatsoever in good faith. Shop around and stay away from them. The only reason we didn't give the car back is the 1000 dollars we had already paid. We are just going to go to our regular mechanic now, and deal with them as less as possible.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, the car blew a head gasket a month after we bought it. They want $2600 to fix it, and will not do anything in good faith. Waste of a lot of money $1700 to be exact (down payment, first month worth of payments and all the towing)... Words of advise...STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE. There are way better dealers in the valley that will help you. We now have to save up for another down payment for a different car. They can eat s**t."
0,"Wow, I have never received such crappy service in my life. The Barista must've worked for the welfare office or dmv, or another city service job, cause her attitude showed. Sometimes these people forget what they do and who they work for. Avoid this location, either go to the on on camelback or 7 st."
0,"Shady pricing!!! I took my 12 year old nephew there and they charged me $17.00 for a fade. The price chart say that children under 13 are $14.00. When I questioned the inaccurate fee I was told that it's an extra $3.00 to get \""lined up\"" which wasn't even given to us as an option nor was it on the price chart. We will never go back and we will continue to spread the word about their shady prices and hidden fees."
0,"I don't understand the regular bustle and patio crowd here, except for maybe the wine.  I thought the sandwiches were just so so, unmemorable.\nthe tea as well."
0,"So, I've been going to this place for years, not b/c the food blows my mind, but rather it hits the spot. Plus, I love sitting on the patio drinking wine when the weather is nice with my best gal. \n\nAnyhow, my other best gal, my mom had never tried this spot. I  thought Duck would be great for a quick casual lunch. She's a vegetarian so we ordered the Where's the Beef sandwich to share. It took about 20 minutes to make the sandwich, which feels like an eternity when your hungry.\n\nWhen I glanced at the sandwich I thought perhaps they had added some portobello mushrooms to it. Turns out, the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado. REALLY!!!!??? I mean come on! Avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians. How can you F this up? It was truly nasty. It got me to thinking, if someone actually put this into the sandwich, what else would their low standards allow them to place into an unsuspecting victims sammie. It's not like they make them with blindfolds on. I was really grossed out.\n\nWhen I brought it to the manager's attention, she didn't seem that bothered by it. They remade half a sandwich for me, and that was that.\n\nIt was annoying b/c I left feeling that Duck & Decanter takes for granted the fact that loyal customers will stick with them no matter what. Well, not this one.\n\nPlus, that place needs a serious dusting. Yuck."
0,"I was very shocked to see that my review from yesterday had been hidden! What is the point of this website if people can't write their opinion? Obviously whoever is in charge of this restaurant's yelp site didn't want people to see how POORLY my children and I were treated at this establishment. A friend of mine and our 3 little boys (two of them babies) came into eat yesterday when a manager came to us and told us we needed to quiet it down. It was quite ridiculous and offensive, seeing that two of the children are ONE year. Yes sir, let me talk some sense into my baby and tell him that he is being rude. I bring my children out to eat quite often and have never had this issue, my kids are not in any way out of control or bratty. Also, a note to whomever this concerns in management in control of this site: if you take my post down again, I will continue to write this review."
0,"I was a fan of this place 10 years ago and moved out of state. I recently moved back and was excited to take my partner and out of town guests to this eatery!  It was awful, long wait, skimpy sandwich, loud music on patio, so loud and somewhat abrasive when the singer talked to the audience. I couldn't hear or talk to the person sitting right next to me.   This was the 29th and a Sunday brunch.  Disappointed, will not go back, especially since there are so many new and fantastic eateries in Phoenix!  You can't rely on a name, Duck and Decanter, your poor service, etc will catch up and you will not survive.  My advice to all who ask,  where is a good place to eat, I will say not Duck and Decanter!"
0,"I arrived a bit earlier than their opening time of 11am (about 5minutes too soon), and figured I would wait until they opened because I needed a new flat iron. I peeked through the front window because the flat irons were on a display facing the window so I figured I'd window browse until they opened. At 11:03 the brunette \""manager\"" (she was pretty young) started unlocking the doors for the employee who had just arrived, smoking a cigarette on her way in the door. Then the same manager opened up the gates on the windows and walked away. I tried to make eye contact with her because it appeared that the gate opening signalled they were open and I wanted the go-ahead to enter but she refused to look at me. So finally I just opened the door and asked \""are you open now?\"" very politely. The manager snipped \""Yes, we don't open earlier than 11. Those are the hours!\"" with a frown and a white-trash attitude. I said \""okay thats fine... I just wasn't sure if you were opening the gates because it was officially open or not.. wow.\"" \n\nNow, I know how irritating the \""waiting at the window\"" customer can be so I tried my best not to be that person - but was not greeted, was treated rudely and received a nasty \""welcome\"" by the angry-at-life manager.\n\nThen the employee girl and manager started talking together about going out to clubs, about how they were 30 dollars short on the till the day before because they counted it too fast the night before because they wanted to \""get out of here and go out!\"" and other inappropriate conversation. The employee did her best to be polite and helpful, but it was clear she had never been trained on proper customer service (probably because her manager is so awful).\n\nI ended up buying the flat iron thanks to the help of the employee. At one point another customer tried to pay with a credit card, but the employee had to wait for the manager to get off the phone so she could use the dial-up to swipe the card. When the employee asked the manager to end the conversation so she could help the customer the manager yelled \""No just wait!\"" from the back of the store. I was shocked!\n\nToday is a Sunday so I don't know if this is the regular manager, but this relatively young brownhaired woman was like a bad joke. I won't be returning again, even if this styling iron fries up tomorrow! Not worth it!"

0,"Today is 4-15-2011 and myself and my husband were driving back from another place and came upon Europa Pastry Cafe. I am European and my husband is Middle Eastern so we love authentic cuisines from all over. My husbands sister-in-law is of the boat Polish and cooks like a goddess and we were craving some good food/pastry. We went in and right off the bat there was such a great aroma of pastry. My mouth was watering. I still did not go over board as we have learned our lessons from the past. Place was clean and well organized. Not much of selection of anything but i guess for the space it is was ok. We were asked if we were ready to order, we were asked in a cold way. Jeeze, we are customers say hello or have a smile. So this was a bit of a turn off. We ordered 4 different things. 10 minutes after ordering we were home and cut the cinnamon/raison bread holy crap it was horrible. It was dry it fell apart and had a stale and bland flavor. I want so much to return the crap right back to them. I have not tried any of the other 3 items but, I hope they are good where I can forget the crap raison bread.\n\nI will never go back. Knowing first hand how Polish pastries and food is supposed to taste I can say this place rates at the bottom. Polish food is VERY GOOD and very favorable and this place does not add up."
0,"the bakery is okay but the service is terrible; went in on Saturday to pick up a cake I paid for and ordered on Tuesday; Waited 40 minutes and then when they finally got to me they said they had not started on the cake yet! I waited 40 minutes and there were only 2 people ahead of me. 3 employees walked by and did not aknowledge the wait; They told me to come back (too bad I pre-paid for the cake) and did not apologize, just went to the next customer; there are much better European bakeries in N. Central such as Karl's or Jana's that are better bakeries and better in service"

0,"My words in this review will most likely not convey my disappointment with this establishment.  However, I will try my best.  I dropped off a prescription Tuesday evening.  I pulled up to the drive-thru and waited at the window for over 5 minutes without being acknowledged.  Not a \""hi, we'll be right with you\"" Nothing.  I wasn't in a hurry and understand that these places can get crazy busy so I waited this time without pressing the \""Call for service\"" button and when I finally did, waited another several minutes before I was rudely greeted by a younger girl who looked like she would rather be doing anything at that moment besides helping me.  I then gave her the prescription and it took her another several minutes to tell me that they would have to order it and it wouldn't be available for me to pick up until that Friday!  I was a little upset that I needed my medication and would not be able to obtain it until then, but I figured what can I do, and agreed to be there Friday to pick it up.  Upon arriving Friday after work, I was in a hurry to get home and figured they had plenty of time to get it good and ready for me by Friday afternoon and assumed it wouldn't take more than a couple minutes.  First off, they only had one of what I had been expecting three of, THEN they wanted to charge me over 80 dollars for something that has always cost me 10.  I said that there must be some mistake and the \""kid\"" behind the counter said he didn't know what to tell me except this is what they are supposed to charge according to my insurance company.  So I left, extremely upset, without my medication.  Then I called my Insurance company and I was told that CVS was wrong and I was only supposed to pay the 10 dollars as usual.  When I went back, I was prepared to sit and wait as long as it took in order to get my medication at the price I was supposed to be charged.  I ended up spending over an hour in the CVS this time until they finally figured out they were wrong.  I ended up leaving that day with my medication which I paid the amount expected from the beginning and left with a smile on my face and at no time was rude to the \""less than educated\"" workers behind the counter because while I waited for them to fix their mix up, there were several customers who were presented with similar situations, all of which were not nice to the staff.  This however is no excuse for them to be little punks and not give a crap about people, this is our health we're talking about and it should not be dealt with by a bunch of dumb dumbs...  I will most likely be going elsewhere next time I need a prescription filled."
0,"Avoid this pharmacy especially if you are on any critical medications and can't risk errors and/or long delays in getting your prescriptions refilled. \n\nCVS seemed like a safe option after my insurance plan and Walgreen's parted company, but has proven to be anything but. It has now taken seven different attempts to get a simple prescription refill, one that was easily filled correctly the first time at Walgreen's with no issues. \n\nCVS has said it was ready when it wasn't; filled it with less medication than the prescription specifies; argued over what the prescription calls for;  told me on one visit that it was not covered in my plan without even checking; finally recognized they had not done it correctly and said they would; notified me it was ready to pick up and then called back to say oops, they needed more time to get the rest of it in; notified me that the new version was ready for pick up only to give me the old, incorrect version and  then go to the back to find the newer version of it, which I purchased, only to find they had gotten closer to being correct but had once again shorted me on the medication. \n\nI have cancer, and the time and energy it has taken to deal with this one prescription has been very wearing. Fortunately this is not a life-saving medication, but if a simple prescription is handled this badly I would not trust the people working at this pharmacy to handle a complex one. Additionally, the majority of the individuals that I have encountered have been rude and curt, with no real interest in serving the customer."
0,So slow. One cashier and 5 customers!!!!!
0,The pharmacy here is the WORST!  In the last several months the service has gone down the tubes.  Routinely get the wrong medicine (and sit in the store for 10 minutes and listen to how many others this happens to)!!  Service is the worst too!
0,Worst pharmacy service ever! Messed up my prescription several times this year already.
0,"I hate this CVS with a passion. There are always people hanging outside begging for money. Sometimes, CVS allows these fundraiser groups to hang outside their door and ask you for money on your way in/out. I normally wouldn't care, but I'm not handing cash to a cheerleader to go to camp when there are children dying of cancer that could use the money more. Just saying. \n\nAnyway, back to the panhandlers. About a year ago, I was coming out of this CVS and heading to the bus stop. As I turned the corner, a guy approached me asking for money and before i could answer, he pulled out a knife. Luckily, I was able to run to the bus stop and the bus came right then. I was pretty shaken up because it was summertime and nobody was really around in that area (it was by the drive thru pharmacy). That evening, I decided to call the store and ask to speak to a manager to address their issues with people begging for money. Not only did I get an attitude, but the lady from the description of the guy that I gave her, seemed to know exactly who this person was (described him as a regular customer). She defended him by saying that it didn't sound like something he'd do. Um, excuse me? I was able to give her the exact time according to her that he is around CVS, a description, etc. Why would I lie about this? So a simple task like keeping panhandlers away was proven to be too difficult for CVS to handle and their managers could care less about their customers."
0,"I am running out of CVS pharmacies to get my prescriptions correct.  I went in early yesterday with a prescription for medicine that had to be ordered from God-knows-where, and was assured that I would be able to pick it up today.  Well, my prescription sat there for 24 hours before anyone got around to placing the order. Because it is Friday now, the medicine will not arrive until Monday.  I need my medicine and nobody seems to care. Thanks, whatever your name is, for your cluelessness. One week later I have finally been advised that THIS DRUG STORE CANNOT GET MY MEDICINE, and they told me to look elsewhere.  Can you imagine having a pharmacy that does not stock/cannot get the medication you need?  I am sick to death of CVS...good f%^&*#@ bye!!!!"
0,"CVS is pretty standard, right? Pharmacy, overpriced beauty section (but you sure avoid going to Ulta if you can find what you're looking for there), great sales--on booze, on food, stationery, games--whatever. When I lived across the street, I used to come here at night when I was bored and it wasn't busy. Now, though, there are new employees and unfair practices. On more than one occasion, the employees have held sale items for themselves behind the counter. Today, there were no Connect Four on the shelf, but there was one in the cart behind the counter. When the manager was asked about it, she shrugged and pointed at another employee. I've worked in retail before, and this goes against most store policies. \n\nSo, the next time you get a CVS flyer, remember that if it's okay for the employees to shop the sales for themselves here--then it might be happening all over the place. And if they can put one item behind the counter for themselves, then they can put a lot more for their friends. Prepare to be disappointed. Make the extra trip and hit up Wal-Mart."
0,"Very frustrating experience.\n\nI came here to get my passport photo done. I walked up to the counter that had a giant overhead sign that said, \""PHOTO\"" on it. I waited for 10 minutes as I watched cashiers and the manager chit-chatting behind the counter. I kept smiling, but they just looked away. Talking about whatever they did over the weekend was much more important. Finally, I had to say, \""Excuse me?!\"" rather loudly because of the volume of their conversation. The manager turned my way and said, \""Oh! Has anyone helped you?\"".\n\nFast-forward a couple minutes. The manager didn't know how to properly take the photo. She didn't tell me when she was taking it, and when I requested to see the photos she said, \""Oh. I already printed one.\"" She made me wait then gave them to me, told me to go to the cashier's counter, and walked off.\n\nMy photo looks incredibly pissed off. Hopefully the consulate won't reject my Visa based on how angry I look, haha.\n\nOverall, annoying experience. I won't be using this CVS Pharmacy again (unless, of course, there is an apocalypse)."

It was very slow to have our order taken, and it took almost 40 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food. The food itself was tasty enough, once it finally arrived.\n\nHowever, the worst part about this meal was the COCKROACH that we discovered on the wall over our table.  Immediately, my friend and I began to point at it and talk loudly. We tried to get the attention of waitstaff for several minutes.  Finally, the cockroach fell onto our table. That was it. We leapt out of the booth and exclaimed \""COCKROACH!\"" Is this the worst part of the visit?  NO.  Waitstaff then came over, pulled back the table, squashed the cockroach, and then gestured for us to resume our meal and said \""Cockroach gone.\"" \n\nAt least the manager comped the meal.  But,  if there is one cockroach allowed to crawl around the dining room TABLES, I can only imagine what the kitchen might look like. I definitely can't imagine going back!"

Because of their errors, my paycheck was held up for a month! AND you get to pay the office $25 each time they fill out paperwork. \n\nI've been to 3 other orthopedic surgeons over the years in the valley and none with as poorly managed office as this.

Mind you this is the woman who was threatening physical violence against us not 10 minutes before. If you'd like to be treated as a CUSTOMER, and not a whipping pole, I'd suggest ANY other bar. If you'd like to be treated like absolute garbage by a raging alcoholic, head on in.  The bar tenders were ok, but clearly not fast paced enough to handle our group of 12."
0,"I was having issues with my laptop turning on, some times it would and other times it wouldn't. They were unable to figure out the problem and advised me that my computer had several viruses. Which I found odd because I had someone else already do a virus scan and they found ZERO. Data Doctors wanted me to pay a ridiculous amount of money, on top of what I paid for them to figure out the problem (which they were unable to do)  and he said its very possible that I had 250 viruses on my computer. He stated that this other expensive scan would be able to find them and then if I pay even more money then they can get rid of them. My computer was not even worth the asking price of what they wanted to fix it. I then contacted a friend and I was referred to another shop that would look at it for free....although they couldn't figure out the issue either...they told me that I have absolutely ZERO viruses on my computer. The whole thing seemed so fishy.  DD also did not finish diagnosing my computer in the time I was promised and I  had to keep calling them. They didn't even start looking at it until I was on my way."
0,"Horrible customer service.  Paid $400 to get computer fixed, however after reinstalling computer my printer would not work.  The lady on the phone said they would have to charge me AGAIN for reinstalling proper drivers.  Really?  I will never use these people again."
0,"Bah!  Below is my outdated review.  I hate Danny's. Do not come here.  I got my oil changed and they forgot to put a plate back on the bottom of my car.  I found out when I brought my car into the dealer for a repair.  They were like, uh, do you know part of your car is missing....  my friend also had a bad experience.  Over $200 for a crappy detail job.  Don't bother.\n\n\nWhat to say about Danny's...    It's a full service joint.  You can have your car washed, oil changed, tank filled all while relaxing in an air conditioned sitting area.  The prices are on the high side and it can be quite busy.    I'm still looking for a cheap place to get my car washed, but I do bring my car to Danny's for oil changes."
0,"\""Been there - done that\"", with this discrepant racket.  Besides the mediocre wash jobs - the customer service, in a blatant word - SUCKS.  First, they threw out my clothes that were slated to be taken to the dry cleaners.  That car washing cost me nearly $300.  I boycotted the place after the owners claimed no responsiblity.  \n\nThen, in a desperate moment over a year later - I had an oil change and a wash just before leaving town on a Sunday morning road trip - nothing else was open.  I was told that the transmission fluid was low and it needed to be filled.  Halfway up the hill on I-17 North there was  pinkish crap blowing out of the tail pipe all over the back of the SUV and the idiot light on the dash indicated trouble.  The diagnosis given to me by the car repairman enroute was the transmission fluid had been over filled.  Nice.  Of course, Danny's Car Wash was not responsible.  I now done with them - figuring I got off lucky with the vehicle still in tact.  \n\nBut, you'd think I was from East Texas - the third time is really the charm.  The car was \""For Sale\"" and I had painted this fact on the outside of the back windows in water soluble paint.  In my final heinous act - I ran it thru this car wash, calling attention to the windows to the incipient attendant.  He assured me it was \""No problem.  We'll get you all taken care of.\""  The car wash complete and not outside my realm of expectation.  It was rendered to me with remnants of paint still plainly on the windows and the attendent present shrugged his shoulders.  When I pressed the issue, he suggested I to speak to the manager.  The rudimentary attendant was no where to be found.  The manager appeared.  Cut to the chase - they didn't even try to reclean the windows.  In the final scene I was driving out of the lot with dirty windows and the entire outside staff flagrantly geering and laughing!   \n\nI know... sounds like the dumb chick in the horror film - but I think it's safe to say - that was the last time I left tracks in that driveway.  If I could deduct stars from this business, I'd give them MINUS - 5 stars.  There's my experience and opinion of Danny's Family Calamity Car Wash.\n  \nCheck out Quick n Clean on 16th Street and Colter - Fabulous!  Inexpensive.  Excellent customer service!"
0,"They just phone it in.  On top of that, they bother the heck out of you to spend more money there, and then they take so long to finish that you're in too big of a hurry to notice just what a lousy job they have actually done.\n\nThis review is especially for their Scottsdale location at Shea/Scottsdale Road, but it really applies to all of their locations as I have used many of them over the years.\n\nI lived in the Phoenix Area for more than 40 years before my current job took me to Southern California.  During that time I drove vintage cars and always wanted them to be looking nice.  In the mid-nineties, the car wash that I had frequented 2-3 times per week for years changed hands and the quality just fell apart.  I had noticed Danny's all over town, and decided to give them a try.\n\nThey were spectacular in those early years.  I got great service, everyone was friendly, and you didn't have those annoying \""how about a detail, oil change, upgrade to first class\"" upselling as you drove up.  You chose, you paid, you hung out in a nice place while they really cleaned your car up nice.\n\nThen somebody got greedy...  At first, there was this attack of the upsell elves coming up to your car and asking you if you wanted to buy more stuff, sometimes two-to-three times.  I fended them off at first, but they became so persistent that I complained, and well, I got a bewildered \""it's our right to make money\"" attitude from them, so I basically started looking elsewhere and just used them when I was desperate.\n\nCut to the present.  I came back this last weekend to visit family, and my volvo wagon was a mess.  Kid, dogs and busy wives lead to a critical mass where the car just needs to get washed once a month.  I had some time so I took it to Danny's which was close by.  Bought the \""Royal\"" wash which set me back nearly 30 bux.  I was sure my car would be clean enough to build a satellite in when I got it out the other side.\n\nWell, after being chased around the exterior waiting area by bees for 45 minutes, I finally saw the attendant waving his rag at me that my car was done.  Or at least to their standards.\n\nBut not mine, oh heaven's no.  There was still bird poo on the roof.  When I pointed this out, the guy sheepishly griinned and made a half-hearted attempt to rub a few of them off with a rag.  When I scratched at a couple with my nail and they just came away, he just shrugged his shoulders.\n\nWe were in  a hurry at this point, so we just got in and sped off.  But wait, there's more.  While we were driving back to the house, we noticed that they hadn't vaccuumed around the inside of the car in any \""not so hard to reach\"" areas like the center console or under the front of the seats.  I can sometimes forgive not getting in the nooks and crannies, but there was still TRASH in some of the places.  \n\nLooking around more, I noticed that the car's interior handn't really been \""protected\"" with the goo they use -- the tops of the doors, the dash top, and that's about it.  The center armrest was filthy and definitely not clean, and the back seats were still dry as a bone.  I noticed that the workers there obsess over new cars and cars with lots of chrome.  As I was dodging the killer bees I watched in amazement as the chrome bumper of a very large Ford pickup was polished like the mirror of the Hubble Telescope.\n\nBut they are totally phoning in the work on the family car.  My 8-year-old Volvo is far from a beater, but it doesn't compare to some of the exotic French and Italian stuff I used to have.  I still feel it should get the same attention, especially at $30."
0,"I have been several times just because it is convenient. Last time, I had two shirts stolen out of my backseat. I went in and told the manager. He acted like I was making it up. I paid to have my car detailed and spent almost $80.00, and it looked like I got the basic wash. They didn't even get all of the tar (my main reason for detailing) off of the guards. I will never go back. I would rather do it myself than be so mad that I wasted the money everytime I go to Danny's. Ok, the owner must be a complete idiot. He will have the guys for immigration in soon asking for green cards. Talk about a \""run for the border\"". Taco Bell."
0,"Everytime I go to this place I wonder why.  Why do I pay for the VIP wash when they do no more than what you get for the basic?  I went this last weekend and my SUV literally went from vacuum to wash to interior in less than 10 minutes. \nYes, you'd think that would be a good thing.  But there were literally 3 cars ahead of mine in the row it was in.  This place is based on pushing cars through, NOT cleaning them.\n\nThey did nothing more than smear their cheap version of armor-all on the tires and wash the windows.  This is VIP?  What a joke.  I told the attendant (who actually spoke english!) to run it through again, this was pathetic, but he said, no I'll clean it, and he took a dirty rag out of the back of his shorts (he might as well have used his tighty-whities, they'd be cleaner) and started rubbing down the console and such.  \n\nYeah, that's what I want.  Danny, you should be ashamed to put your name on this joke of a car wash.  And I should be double ashamed to have run my car through this place repeatedly over the years.   What am I thinking?  I'm an idiot.  Never again."
0,"No shock at all on the numerous bad reviews for Danny's. I wish I would have read them before I took my car in. Why you ask? Here goes:\n\nThey stole my change (probably over 15 bucks).\nExterior was dripping with water and back was streaked with mud.\nThey wrote on the car window, \""basic wash\"" and it did not come off after the wash.\nIf they vacuumed the interior I couldn't tell, I can tell you they didn't vacuum the floor mats, or the driver's side.\nThey didn't wipe down the interior; there was still dust exactly where I left it.\n\nNormally I would have back to complain, but after waiting over an hour I just wanted to get F out of there. Danny's should take some lessons from Los Olivos, they do a proper car wash.\n\n1 Star is generous."
0,"Wife took our vehicle in today for a wash - said she was thinking of skipping it because it looked like rain.  Hindsight that was a BIG mistake.  Arrived evening - just after 5pm.  Paid for wash that was adequate at best.  They had the drivers door open on the vehicle when she walked out - pretty normal protocol.  She got in and drove home - only to realize the interior driver's side door latch was broken.  She had to power the window down to reach and release the exterior door.  I was jammed up so she drove straight back.  Spoke to manager - Martin Mejia.  He claimed the vehicle was like that when she arrived, which begs the response she provided 'your employees saw me get out of the vehicle - i would have had to roll the window down to do that'.  He was NOT interested in taking any responsibility and said they had looked all over for her - it was 5:20 and my wife and daughter were inside the waiting area and there was only ONE other customer in the building.  None of what he said was true and when my wife looked at the cashier - who had started to speak up - the manager stared her down.  My wife said 'are you going to coax her into lying now because she knows no one came to find us as you are saying'?  Here's the reality - and yeah i watched Columbo as a kid - was after hours, the cleaning guys on the cars were rockin and rollin, blowing over the windows with big damp rags, one of the rags wrapped around the interior plastic door trigger, and some tugged hard.  End of Story.  Now i get to see if there is any integrity in the corporate office.  I'm not optimistic."
0,"Go to Lindstroms on Indian School!!!!!!!!\n\nIts been 3 or 4 weeks since I last washed my car, so I took it to Danny's yesterday because the location was more convenient than Lindstroms - Trader Joes was on my to-do list.\n\nI had little mud splatters on one side of the car - somebody must have driven through a puddle while I was parked.  But I was getting the car washed for general reasons, not just because of the mud splatters, so I made the mistake of not looking closely after Danny and his Family were done washing.\n\nWhen I got back home, I noticed most of the little mud splatters were still there.  My first thought was \""sh%t, its paint and not mud\"" but I scraped one with my finger and it came right off.  And there are water spots all over one window, coffee and dust in the cup holder, etc etc.\n\nSo now I need to go back and argue with a manager, or pay again at Lindstroms.  I think I will pay again and go to Lindstroms - I've been a big fan ever since they got raided by the Country's Worst Sheriff:)  You get raided by Sheriff Joe, you must be doing something right."
0,"Uhh should have listened to yelpers! My roommate said this place was good so I went this morning and now, I'm regretting it. My car is still dirty but now I have messed up tint on my back window! I have no idea how they managed to mess up factory tint but now every time I look out my review mirror it's a reminder of how terrible this place is. When I brought this to there attention a guy with gold teeth pretended like he all of a sudden didn't speak english! I didn't have the time to try and speak with anyone else but, if I ever go back it will be to complain. The car is dirty and I'm sad. Don't do it!"
0,"Danny's Family Car Wash is a reminder of all that is wrong with this world.  \n\nThis is nothing less than a third world car wash with all the dirty water, inattentive labor and indifference that you would expect from people that really do not want to be there.\n\nLook Danny, here it is bro.  If you don't want to run a car wash, do something else.  If I was in your family, I would be the one that does not talk to you."
0,"Danny's Car Wash has become synonymous for me with the words \""HELL NO!\""\n\nDanny's was a 5 star Car Wash 15 years ago! \nThis place use to really have the WOW FACTOR!\nI liked it so much I had my vehicle dolled up here as if it came out of the factory show room several times a week... Going to Danny's was a Friday ritual before going out on the town! With the friendliest customer service & a Job #1 attitude, I use to think how I can motivate people like this! I even went to different locations, because I thought maybe the people @ the highland location think I'm a repeat customer & are going the extra mile to keep me coming back!\n\nDanny's Family Carousel Car Wash is now all about the Up-sell! No Danny's Family Carousel Car Wash is now all about the Pressure Up-sell! \nI understand this is a business & there is a bottom line, but to pressure your customers to purchase more than they intend is not up-selling, it is unscrupulous!\nThey hit you full force the second you pull into the station! Instead of earning repeat business like they use to they are trying to up-sell you get the works, an oil change and windshield damage repair, and everything else they have to sell! When you decline all the extras they disappear as quickly as they showed up & everywhere else you get nothing but bad attitudes!  They try to rush you out of there as quickly as possible, to the point that they always miss something... I've left there several times in a rush to find the front end of my car still covered with bug marks!\n\nIn the past several years I've had countless bad experiences. \nSo bad that I go out of my way not to use a Danny's Family Car Wash!"
0,"I had been planning on getting a complete car detail, somewhere, and was still reading reviews on where to go, but needed a quick wash in the meantime, so I stopped by Dannys. The Dannys salesperson, Jorge, presented the complete detail package and although I explained I didn't have time to do it then the hard sale included \""we'll give you 3 free quick washes you can use 1 now, and come back for the detail when you have time. The price started high, then kept rapidly dropping and including more features the more I declined. Finally came down to the \""I give you good deal if you do it now, includes complete interior and exterior wash, engine clean, and more things just kept getting circled on the paperwork\"". Out of exhaustion, sympathy for the people waiting in line behind me, vacuum people waiting ahead of me, and really needing the detail anyway, I gave in, signed the form, gave them my credit card, used my \""free\"" quick wash and was on my way. (average job on the wash then, btw.) \nPart 2- \nFinally scheduled and went in for my detail. Upon arrival the \""greeter\"" promptly looked in my window, read the damn \""need oil change\"" service reminder that's been glaring at me for a few hundred miles, and suckered me in to that service too. (whatever- convenience to me). I explained I was there for my detail, They popped the hood, Jorge (again) said I he had given me a good deal but didn't I want the engine cleaned too? I tried to remind him he had included that in the deal, but apparently since he hadn't circled it, it wasn't really included. Jorge says \""I can't give that for free, you'd have to talk to the manager\"". When I asked for the managers name, he seemed surprised that I would actually do it, so I did. The manager \""Alex\"", was actually quite nice, gave me the engine detail, apologized and said he told Jorge to not push the sale so hard in the future. I was told 2.5- 3 hrs and I would get a call when it was done. So 4 hrs later, I call, find out it's done. Pay for the oil change, hunt down my car and someone w/ the keys. So-overall results, looked all bright and shiny at first, but they just gooped on extra armorall on my leather seats, still had finger smudges on the interior of the sun roof, white spots where the wax had not been rubbed off, small scratches that I'm pretty sure would have come out anywhere else. The kicker was on the inside of the windshield there were 2 spots where parking permits had left a residue (one with part of the paper liner still attached) and they didn't do ANYTHING to try to remove ANY of it. I drove away, again exhausted and vowing to write my first ever negative yelp review. Sorry for the long review, but I hope it helps someone save the time, money and energy. Good Luck!"
0,"Bad wash as usual and NO customer service. Now they expect you to do what they can do in 30 seconds (change my new license plate number in their system) - now the customer has to go online and do it. Convenient yes - but never going back!!! The good news is they get you in and out quickly, the bad news is the quality of the wash leaves little to be desired and they beat you up for everything from windshield repair to oil changes to details and so on. After many years, I have had enough!!!"
0,"Visited them today to spruce up the Tacoma. Filled up the tank and chatted with the attendant, nice guy. Truck went through the wash. While in the drying line the guy that was supposed to be drying my truck spent more time flirting with his co-worker. He barely ran the rag around door jams. When they flagged me down, I walked around the truck. I asked if they were going to actually dry it  or was that extra?  Had to get them to finish washing the spots off. The windshield is still dirty. Had to remind them to put the antenna back on.   Could understand if they were busy,  but it was slow  This place is a joke. Wonder if the owners have any quality control in mind."
0,"I had a whole review written and then IE crashed and I lost it but essentially, here's the gist:\n\nDon't go to this joint. It used to be decent to good..more towards the good. Now you bring your car in dirty and it leaves dirtier after they've used dirty, damp towels to swish the dirt around.\n\nSave your money,. I'm not sure where to go unfortunately because I can't seem to find ANY decent car wash in the valley anymore, but I can tell you not to bother with any of the Danny's car washes in the valley."
0,"This place is cheesy, cheesy \""Daryl's O.K. used cars\"" type of feel. They have about 67 sketchy characters trying to wash your car at once, and the end result is a car with water spots? I was very upset with how poorly they handled the simple task of washing my car. The worst part of the whole thing: THEY STOLE 6 QUARTERS I HAD IN MY CUP-HOLDER!! If you are a recently paroled felon, or person who has no hope for a decent shot at a career- get a job at Danny's on E Highland Ave. I tried this because my regular car wash is closed on Sundays.. I would recommend everyone go to Hot Shots on 16th street. The management there has some integrity requirements when they hire employees."
0,"Customer service inside was decent...the people outside though weren't as nice. After my car was washed, they let it roll in neutral nearly hitting a wall. Guess they didn't realize it's a manual transmission. So after some guy jumping in and slamming on the brakes, he took it to start drying it off. As he was driving it to the drying area, he started driving it hard.  After drying it off, another guy got in to park it. He was driving my car hard like a race car...just like the young man before him. I told him that I'd appreciate it if he didn't drive my car or any other customer's cars like that. He looked at me with a smirk and pretended like he didn't speak English. They obviously have no respect for other people's personal vehicles or opinions."
0,"I have been a customer for many years. I ALWAYS get the VIP carwash. The VIP carwash includes WASHING THE CAR, correct?  And the windows, and vacuuming the inside of the car? And cleaning off the door and window sills? \n\nThe last two times I have been at the Highland Avenue location I have had poor service. Today was (again) a poor experience. Even after specifically asking that they clean the bugs off the front end (assuming they would do the rest of car without being asked) I still had to ask (again) at the end to please wipe off the bugs.  Last time the car did not even looked like it had been washed.  Just the top/superficial dirt was removed. \n\nThe attitude of the workers is that they are doing me a big favour by wiping off my car - and I always tip when they are finished so it's not like I am being overly picky. Additionally - when you have three or four workers all speaking Spanish and all of them looking at me, snickering, pointing at the car and then looking at me, laughing and the young lady actually rolling her eyes; well being rude to the customer and not making me feel welcome when the car was not clean is inexcusable.\n\nIt was just after 8:45 this morning that I was there.  You were NOT busy - there was not a big line and you had plenty of workers in the finishing area.  Seems like 4 or 5 guys were quite happy to work on shining up a large white Humvee that was there for over 30 minutes while the (less than) 10 minutes spent on my Mariner was half-hearted and sloppy. The mirror inside was dirty and pushed all the way to one side - I thought the idea was to put the mirror back in an approximation of where it was when the customer gets back in? Both seats in front were moved and the passenger seat was wet. The center console area had not even been cursorily wiped, and the areas inside all the door and windows was filthy and looked to have never even been touched,.  This is the same sloppy work the last time I was there.\n\nI have had to ask a couple of times in the past to get the car wiped down better -- 18 dollars and I cannot even get a clean car? Lately there seems to be no one outside managing the lines or workers. I pull in -- no one bothers to look up or point me to the lane they want me in.  Someone else pulls up after me and they get waved into another lane and serviced before me. \n\nI specifically ask that the front end is wiped down and all the bugs are removed. The young man checking me in assures me this will be done and he writes a note on the window. I do not stand out there and watch every move they make - I assume the car will get vacuumed out and then sent through.\n\nSo today:\nFront end is filthy after wash and I have to ask AGAIN that they clean it\nRude and disrespectful employees laughing at me is not a good way to do business\nThe center console has not been wiped and still has dirt in it from when I pulled in. \nThe passenger seat is wet.\nThe inside of all the doors sills and windows sills are filthy and have not been touched at all\nThe water dripping down from the door seams and from around the back window streak up the finish by the time I pull across the street to Trader Joe's. I saw them happily blowing all the water out from the Humvee - I guess no one bothered to do mine.\n  \nI should not have to go back AGAIN and spend another 30-45 minutes waiting for them to wash it right. They should do it the first time without me having to ask specifically.  Especially for 18 dollars.\n\nI am extremely unhappy. I have tried to contact the management.  Let's see if anyone cares enough to email or call me back. Otherwise - do not go here. EVER."
0,"Let's use the power of Social Media to inform people about Danny's Carwash at 83rd Ave & W. Bell Road.....Please share my bad experience with your contact list. \n\nBell Road has the worst customer service ever. After forgetting 4 things I paid for and only addressing 1, I was told by the GM Tim B.-H., that he was sure that I put grease on my windshield so I could complain and request a refund. I was there just 8/25/2012, around noon with my 20 month old grandson around noon and if you have toddlers I'm sure you know that hanging around a carwash in the heat of the day ...when he just wants to take a nap is not my idea of fun. When I asked him to at least fix the windshield his reply was.... he would but it was going to take him quite a while to get it fixed. When I went to the counter to ask for the phone number to corporate, he advise them not to share any phone numbers or names etc..... with me. I then proceeded to ask one of the workers to please just get the grease ...off my windshield...he tried but was stopped by Mr. Tim B.-H., and instructed not to help me. Danny's car was has had huge financial issue recently and I have still been a faithfull customer for the past 10 yeas, but obviously this will now change. The best part of the story is when I did call corporate this morning I was instructed by Corey who answered the phone... that all issues must be resolved at the location in which you had the problem....He would not let me speak to anyone at the corporate level and told me not to even try cause he would make sure I didn't get to speak with anyone in the corporate office.  Later I called back and Corey did give me an email address.   So anyone out there know a good carwash in the NW Valley?\n\n Thanks, April Blair Childs-Brossman"
0,"Called to make an appointment for a \""Complete\"" car wash and was quoted a price.  When I arrived, the price doubled.  The salesman thought it was really funny.  The manager backed him.  I used to be a regular customer (four cars!) for many years.  Time to move onto another car wash company."
0,"I reviewed these idiots back in July and filed a Better Business Bureau complaint against them.  \n\nThe empty platitudes from Heather at Danny's corporate that they do a great job for a good price ... Really?  20+ dollars for a VIP wash and the back is not vacuumed, the windows are streaky, there are still bugs all over the grill and hood?  \n\nOffering me a \""free\"" crappy carwash  or try and intimidate me when I point out the car is not clean is no offer at all.  I do not feel safe patronising this business at this location.  Maybe someone has had good service from another location but stay away from this one.\n\nI actually never expected to get a refund as these folks have over and over demonstrated they DO NOT CARE when you attempt to bring something to their attention. They have the worst customer service I think I have ever experienced anywhere and getting your car washed there is a complete waste of time and money.  They do a crappy job, and you may get items stolen from your car or something broken on your vehicle and they will say it's not their fault.\n\nLos Olivos Car Wash charges 20 dollars for a hand washed car that is immaculate and the staff is pleasant, friendly and honest. Go to Los Olivos and see for yourself.  You will never settle for the inferior work and service at Danny's ever again.\n\nI will post my most scathing review of this horrible business everywhere I can.  Someone will see it and Danny's will NOT get the business of another unsuspecting fool like me.\n\nRead the other reviews on this place.  It's stay away or you are throwing your money away plus you'll get intimidated or insulted for your trouble."
0,"I went to Danny's this weekend to get an oil change and car wash and I paid for a VIP car wash.   After picking up my car I was disappointed that there was still dirt on my car floor.  I later noticed that money I had in my car for parking was missing.  I'm highly upset that I paid for these services, tipped the staff, and had my property stolen.  I've been going to Danny's on and off for years as they are close to my home but I will never frequent their establishment again."
0,"This place is horrible. So, so horrible. Please don't get your car washed here! This is a quick and convenient car wash for me, and I am just so over it. I will make the hike to Los Olivos, because Danny's is just awful. They don't vacuum the back of the car, wipe off my door handles, wipe down the cup holders. Nothing. They mess with all of my seats, don't fix the door mats, then give me a dirty look when I don't tip them. What do they expect?"
0,"Major suck.\n\nI have been here 3 times with three separate vehicles. I think \""Hey? Why not try again?\""\n\nEvery time I get my car washed here I feel like they always forget something: the very bottom of your front and rear bumpers, the water that dripped from your liftgate onto the bumper, anything on the windshield that isn't dust......\n\n\nI could go on and on, but my point is that they don't seem to care, they just want their tip and you leave. I feel bad so I tip, as it's hot and I sure as hell ain't doing the job.\n\nGo somewhere where your car actually comes out clean though."
0,"This is one of those places you want to give negative stars to--that's really all you need to glean from this review. \n\nAre you a lady who hasn't had her fill of being talked down to or hit on by sleazy dudes today? Do you need an oil change but really can't be bothered to find out how much it will cost? Do you like overpaying for a carwash whose end result you could have paid $3 at Clean Freak to achieve? Well, sounds like you want to go to visit the total clowns at Danny's. \n\nI went here once about a year ago for an oil change and car wash. It took over an hour and I was really annoyed by the clumsy, gross flirting from the guy and that he forgot to give me the free car wash that came with it and how long it took them to give it to me when I pointed out that I was owed one. Don't make my mistake and go back because they happened to by close to your work and open when all other options were closed and you really need an oil change. \n\nFirst, I pulled up and waited five minutes for someone to make eye contact so I can figure out what bay to pull up to for an oil change. Seriously, if I'm not supposed to pull up to where the signs say OIL CHANGE to get one then get a sign to tell me where else to go to arrange this. Finally, I'm approached by some guy who stared at my cleavage the whole time he gave me the runaround of what costs what. Oh, you want me to pay $10 so that you CHECK--not act upon--the fluid levels in my car and check the tire pressure? Is this ridiculous upcharge only for ladies who you assume to be total dummies or are you an equal opportunity rip-off artist? \n\nAfter about five minutes of conversation, I still have no idea what an oil change costs there, only what extra fees they'd like to charge me for stuff that should be free and I'm pretty sure the employee doesn't either because he wants to be paid under the table. He told me he'd do a full service oil change if I just left $20 in the car. Like, don't exchange money with him out in the open, but leave it in the car, like he's an oil change hooker and I'm the john. I'm assuming your employer isn't keen on you not paying taxes, dude, but thanks for the offer?\n\nI never followed up with these guys to figure out why the employee would tell me that it's $31.95 if I pay inside and $20 if I pay him by just leaving money in the car because I'd rather just stay away from these guys. I got in the car and closed the door on the employee while he was still trying to give me the hard sell because he wouldn't take no for an answer, which is every woman's dream, isn't it?\n\nOh, and the car wash I got last year with the oil change sucked, too. There's nothing to make a girl feel more self conscious about her reliable yet boring Toyota like watching her car get ignored and left with water spots drying on it while all the guys working gather around to take pictures of themselves cleaning a Lamborghini."
0,"Very scary and shady vibe. As a woman, I will never come back here. A lot of standing around and staring at customers.  I felt extremely uncomfortable."
0,Be sure to ask if your car is ready yet. They forget to announce it sometimes and leave you in the lobby waiting for Christmas.
0,"I will never be going back.  Its too bad, years ago this was a pretty good place.  recently I got a Groupon 3-pack. 2 of 3 times, my car was not cleaned well.  There were spots and when I pointed it out, the guy told me it was because I didn't add on the wax!!! \n\nThe 3rd trip was the kicker...i decided to add wax just to see whether they actually cleaned the car.  It took about 40-50 minutes(!), didn't look like they had done anything different... And when I got home, I realized they had stolen my iPod from my car!!!  On a previous trip, they stole my husbands phone charger.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE! They will rob you and then give you back a dirty car!"
0,"This place is so slow. I got the express wash at 11am on a weekday and waited 40+ minutes for my car to be done. Wtf. \n\nOh and now you must need a face or neck tattoo to work here. I didn't know if they were washing/drying my car, or figuring out how to steal it later. \n\nI'm not coming back here. It's not worth $5 to waste almost 45 minutes of my lunch hour.\n\n----\nI just got back to work from the place, and I noticed that 1/2 of my change/quarter pouch and all of my gum was gone. What the hell. My $5 car wash just became a $15 car wash. I called and complained, but what is it going to accomplish. Never again. I'm over this place."
0,"There is definitely a reason why this place gets such bad reviews. I thought it would be quick and convenient to stop in for an oil change. They up sold me on the more expensive fluid topper and \""free\"" car wash for $35. After finally getting my car I sat down to drive off and I see is a completely dirty floor mat on the driver side. I pointed it out to the guy that gave me my keys and he said \""yeah that's still dirty, should I take it back and have it redone?\"" Uh, yes, please. My windshield is still dirty on the inside and out, and the back windshield has water spots all over it! \n\nI'm tempted to take it to Jiffy Lube to have them check the fluids to see if they even topped them off. There was an attitude of less than mediocre at this place.  Unfortunately, I don't care how close you are to my house, Danny's, I won't be back."
0,Arrived there at 3:48PM today.  Had the VIP done with some detailing and was told it should take around 45 minutes.  Left there at 5:52PM.  They did a good job with the actual cleaning of the vehicle but being grossly mislead on the turn around time was inexcusable and enough to prevent me from coming back or recommending the company to anyone.
0,"Seriously Danny's. I just left, you washed my car just fine but why in the world can you not open the back hatch and vacuum!  This is the second time it's happened. Shame on me for going back. I will be calling management to complain as well. This is crazy that you have to inspect everything before you leave. \nI'd rather go to Francis and Sons on 7th St even though it takes twice as long. As least I know everything will be cleaned"
0,"I paid $20 for a crappy car wash. When I went to get in my car, the floor mats still had leaves on them, I paid extra to wipe down the doors and inside of the car and there were still marks all over the back trunk area from my dogs. The windows weren't wiped down because the writing from the type of wash I was getting was still completely legible and lastly, the back window was still covered with nose marks. I definitely won't be going back."
0,"Decent wash, sloppy dry. They had my car for 1hr 40min and still did not manage to find time to dry the car nor finish wiping down the inside. I don't know if they don't have enough employees or the employees they do have just don't care but, they took my money and delivered a piss poor product and did so in an extremely lengthy fashion. Will not be returning to this rip off spot again."
0,"Negative experience overall. The place made me feel uncomfortable. I brought my new pre-owned baby (a 2012 bright red VW) to get her first wash here, thinking it was the ultimate deluxe treatment. I was so wrong. I didn't count exactly, but from start to finish I think there were 6 people who drove my car, and they didn't drive it with care or regard, and their clothes seemed dirty. They were tapping the brakes too hard and making me uncomfortable just watching them drive it. \n\nWhen you drive up, it is entirely unclear where to go. As a first-timer, I had no clue. A lazy guy in a Danny's uniform pointed for us to get in one lane, and then pointed to another lane, which was confusing. Then he came to the window and tried to upsell us on getting our car detailed and buffed, saying it would \""return it to new\"". Buddy, it's a new car - it was washed a month ago at the dealership. When my husband politely said no, he seemed mad. We chose the VIP wash for $20 and from there it was a waiting game until our car was in the front of the giant blob that they call a line. In my opinion, it took a long time. I took my shopping bag inside with me, thank goodness I did because apparently there's been a lot of robberies there. \n\nAfter a short time through the tunnel and a half-assed rubdown from about 5 different thug-looking guys, the car was \""done\"". Yes, the bird poop was off the windshield, but the ultimate telltale sign was there was still a  Starbucks straw wrapper in the front console that they didn't even touch. The interior detailing promised in the \""VIP Wash\"" was a joke.\n\nI'm highly disappointed. My car seemed worse off than it did when it went in. Next time I will go to Los Olivos. Even a Clean Freak $3 wash would be far superior to the yuckiness we experienced here."
0,"STAY AWAY FROM THESE RIP-OFF ARTIST.  I moved here within the last year and don't know many mechanics in town.  I have always relayed on my brother who is a mechanic at Mazda to service my Mazda for me.  Before moving here my brother did complete check of my car including changing the transmission fluid at 65,000 miles.  I have taken my car to several places to get the oil changed.  Today I needed to have it done again and thought I would go at lunch by work.  I went online and visited their website and even printed a coupon for a complete oil change for $28.99. No hidden cost or shop fees the coupon said.  When I arrived my car was put in line for service. Approximately 45 minutes later a tech can in to tell me that my transmission fluid need to be changed or it was going to burn up.  When I told him I had it done at 65,000 mile at Mazda, the car only has 79,000 miles now, he said that they lied to me and I should go back and get my money back.  Now who should I believe, my brother of 51 years or this 23 year old kid I just met.  I told him that I would take care of the problem myself and he said again, \""it better be soon, this car might not make it much longer.\""  When I went to pay expecting my bill to be around $30.00 with tax but was informed that it was $35.48.  When I asked the cashier why, she told me that the oil filter is not included in the oil change.  Who does a oil change without changing the filter?  I asked to speak with the manager he was not available.  When I told the tech that I would just pay the bill and not come here again and YELP their business, he said \""DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.\""  So buyer beware of this place, they will rip you off when ever they can."
0,The worts place for service on your car they stole my wallet even though was hidden in the glove compartment. They hired criminals and illegals    to work for them I will suggest to never go to there isn't safe
0,"Here is what I can legally say:\n\nMy brand new truck went in with flawless factory chrome wheels.  My brand new truck came out with a chunk taken out of the factory chrome wheels.\n\nAlso, they didn't dry the thing - I had the attendant come back twice to dry it but gave up with water spots on my car.\n\nThe manager, Andy, will most likely raise his voice to you and deny responsibility for the damage you receive, if he treats you the way he treated me.\n\nI have been going to this car wash for years, and it has usually been nearly flawless.  Now the one time something bad happens for me there, they stand behind their \""flawless reputation\"" and, in the words of their manager Andy, they are perfect and all the others who have said they damaged their vehicles are wrong... Strange.\n\nI am waiting for the general managers response."
0,"I went there less than an hour ago- they are lucky I didn't go to a manager. I'm sitting there waiting to be called, and after 45 minutes I went out to find my car. Turns out they never called me and had parked my car in the parking lot. Took too long to track down my keys, and then the guy follows over pretty much wanting the \""tip\"". I look at my car and there's spots everywhere, the paint is scratched all over and it was obvious they hadn't bothered to get the soap off, vacuum properly, or even clean at all. Wiped my hand over the dash and came back with more dust than I had gone in with!!\n\n\nOverall, if I could give even less stars they would get it. Absolutely terrible!"
0,"I used to frequent this location - I think I'm pretty much done.\n\nI guess now that the illegals who actually took pride in their work and had a spring in their step are gone, it truly is \""bottom of the barrel\"" employment.\n\nLook, I have tattoos. I date men with tattoos and piercings. Some of the people I love the most in this world have significant alterations. However - creepy dude with the craptastic jailhouse tattoos covering a good portion of his face as one of the first employees I interact with? No thanks.\n\nEveryone looking miserable, as though they hate what they're doing and move at snail's pace to do it? No thanks.\n\nAnd I've seen the sign for years that there's an upcharge for \""large\"" vehicles. And when I had the Infinity QX4 for many years, I was never charged. (I figured it was for Suburbans and Expeditions and the like.) Well, I now have a Nissan Rogue. Which is smaller than my QX4 was. And l was charged for the oversize vehicle.\n\nMediocre at best wash done by creepy people who take no pride in the job they do that I get overcharged for?\n\nNo thanks! I'm done."
0,"After being raided several times by Arpaio's posse, apparently Arpaio started hooking them up with tent city work furlough workers. \n\nI made a huge mistake of getting my oil changed there. Halfway into the change I asked them if they replace the oil filter (I shouldn't have assumed), he said no, but he JUST MIGHT have a matching oil filter that he could install for $30 bucks. What? He then tries to upsell me on an air filter, saying oil filter and air filter costs $150, but for me he'd do it for $100. I have no doubt in my mind this guy was going to try and pocket the cash.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague."
0,"Only reason I come here is because I get $5 off the total before 9am on Sunday. This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) and I almost drove off with the marker of my wash on my windshield?! Those are the two most important parts to clean after a car wash!!!!\n\nIf I didn't need to come here, I wouldn't. Plain and simple."
0,"Damnit! They did it to me again!  I drive in for a simple car wash and end up with more dings on my fenders than Armor All on my tires!  When I brought it up, they dragged nearly every employee on the premises over to my car to take a look. Then one by one they all got Idiot's Amnesia.  Even the bonehead who I watched drive my car up to the conveyor denied he was even in my car! \n\nAs I stood there pointing out the fresh scratches with the paint color that perfectly matched the jagged block wall of their drive path, they all went dumb!\n\nMy first experience with this type of senseless customer service at Danny's was a few years back. A manager was pulling my car up to the drying area at a high rate of speed, and I actually watched him sideswipe another vehicle with my car. When I confronted him, and pointed out the fresh patch of rubber rash on my fender from the hit, he denied it...and guess what? He suddenly got that exact same case of Danny's Family Carwash Idiot's Amnesia. Luckily for me I was able to get the rubber patch off so I didn't need to follow up. \n\nAfter a recent statewide bust for hiring illegal workers -- TWICE -- you'd figure these morons at Danny's would be a little more willing to curb their bad behaviors and be a lot more customer centric. \n\nWhen Danny's Dysfunctional Family Carwash starts offering body and fender repair services along with their mediocre car washes... customers beware!"
0,"Terrible this will be their final chance, after an hour half they forgot to vacuum the back!! There was trash under the seats, windows had streaks . The exterior had dried water spots . R u kidding me ??!"
0,Won't be back...these guys stole all my Change out of my console...generally you expect random coins in the cup holders to be taken...but they went into a closed console and stole an entire change holder...don't give these guys your business!!!
0,"LAZY, UNPROFESSIONAL AND DOWNRIGHT RUDE. Three best words to explain what a horrific experience I had at this Danny's for the first (and most definitely last) time this last Tuesday. I had just gotten my car back from the shop and decided to get a full interior detail done. I live right off 16th and highland so it was a convenient choice. Well boy was I the fool to think 80 bucks would get me a somewhat decently clean car....to my shock it was actually WORSE then before I went in and wasted my money. They actually took a small contained coffee stain in the back seat and somehow spread the stain all over my cloth seats, w/ some of the stain moved onto the front passenger seat!! It was like they actually used the stain water to clean the entire car. There was a huge soap stain on the interior windshield, spilled sticky soda stains UNTOUCHED in the drink consul and on top of all of that, they soaped up my tires randomly (I didn't even buy an exterior wash) which irritated me as I pointed out to one idiot who remarked, \""oh it's to make them look shiny\"" with an imbecile grin. HELLOO!!! Why not focus on the interior and actually get it done RIGHT?!? Utterly pathetic. I am still angry w/ myself for wasting my hard earned money to this joke of a business. I was so upset I took it back and the men who worked on my car the first time were all there and just stared at me with the rudest glares. Had the guy w/ the tattoos all over his head and face redo it, who actually did a little better. It's amazing this place is still in business let alone always so busy when I drive by, must be all new-timers about to be screwed out of their money...80 dollars down the drain, for a job my two year old daughter could have done better. The raids shouldn't have stopped with the illegals, should have arrested all of the LAZY WORKERS AND STAFF AS WELL!!"
0,"The treatment I endured here was so atrocious it made me activate a Yelp account. I initially came in for a prepaid interior exterior detail package that included a wax. Upon my arrival I agreed to a polish add on/upsell. After retrieving my vehicle  I quickly observed that no detailing had occurred whatsoever;  the inside was still dusty, dirty and there were water stains in my passenger seat. Something shampooing the seats and carpets would have easily removed. It was then that I realized that  what I had originally paid for was not done, only the upsell job. Even that was hard to confirm since they parked my black car across the street under a tree that left it with a coat of green pollen powder all over it. I asked for a manager, Danny, who offered me two free washes and to actually detail the car when I could make it back. I declined the courtesy washes and brought my vehicle back later in the week to be completed. This time when I picked up the car, it was under one of their carports in the detailing area. A staff member gave me my keys with the interior floors and seats wet to the touch. Why would you shut the doors to a car with no way for it to ventilate when the interior is still wet? The mats?  They were wet as well on top of each other locked in the trunk. Why not put them in a dryer? Again, this made no sense. Then, to top it off I noticed that both my Armor All and Meguiar detailing wipes as well as the Ozium I put UNDER my seat were missing. These items were not trash, they were barely used. There was still dirt debris and leaves under my driver seat but they had time to steal my car care products. What a joke! I again asked for a manager to voice my frustration and in return a towel boy came out asking do I still need help with my windows. I ended up just leaving in  utter disgust coupled with shock that places like this really exist. I have encouraged all of my friends, family and co-workers to never, ever give any Danny's location their business. I would implore you to do the same."
0,"I've never before left a negative review for a business, but the experience was bad enough to sign up for a yelp account. I went in for a car wash, agreed to a wax for an additional $20 because it was on sale, but when I got my car back (an hour later) it had not been washed. There were spots on the outside of the car. The interior had not been cleaned at all and when I brought it to their attention, I was told that the \"" VIP wash\"" that accompanied the wax only included the vacuuming of the floor matts. If I wanted the dash dusted or the cup holders wiped down or the windows cleaned, I should have purchased the $50 detailing. So $42 later, I have a slightly less dirty car on the outside and vacuumed floor mats, but not much else to show for it. \n\nI wish I had read all the other bad reviews here before I gave them my business. It was clear to me that this business has very little regard for its customers."
0,"I've been going to Danny's for years. I would take one car, fill it up, get the Works wash and go back for the 2nd car, at least weekly. Have always been pleased with the finished product and thought it was a good value. The employees were top-notch; Friendly, efficient, had a passion for their jobs. \nIn the last 6-9 months there has been a dramatic change...zombies for employees, the service is very slow, crappy job on the cars. \nSorry Danny, you have lost a loyal, formerly happy customer. \nNow I need to find a new place!"
0,this location of Danny's is slow and they do a poor job . lack of attention to Detail. On 2 occasions I was there for over 50 minutes and had to walk out and get the car before they were done as I had to go or be late for a appointment. This was for just a standard VIP wash no extra's. If you are a crunch on time you may want to go elsewhere as you will probably have to have them redo something if you want to get what you paid for
0,The best way to waste your money: 13$ and your car is just enough cleaned outside and not vacuumed inside at all. 1h waiting. Worst service ever!!!!
0,"I went in a few weeks ago. I reached into the car when they were done and the cash in my ashtray had been stolen. This is funny only because I was going to give it to them anyway. When I told the Manager, he told me that it had been happening recently and that he would look into it. I never heard anything back. \n\nI went in again today and when I didn't tip as quickly as they had liked, the staff told me how rude I was for not tipping. \n\nCar wash is is mediocre on  a good day, but convenient location for me. Too bad the management can't manage the staff. It is a case of the inmates running the prison, if you know what I mean."
0,"Yikes!  What happened to this place?  I haven't been to this location in a couple of years.  Its awful!  So sad that management let it go!  Maybe new owners? I remember I used to come here and shop for greeting cards while my car was being washed.  The card racks are all empty.  All the snack and candy bar boxes are empty, too. But no one has bothered to remove the empty boxes.  There's a few dusty old stuffed animals And just a few air fresheners for sale. They used to take pride in displaying their merchandise. Not anymore. Even the fish tank looks awful.\n\nI hope they did a good job with by oil change but I really have no way of knowing. My VIP wash was not worth the money. The inside was not vacuumed very well and their armor all is streaked and missing in places.\n\nThe entire visit was totally disappointing. But the worst part is that my glove box has clearly been rifled through. I keep my papers in a particular order with my sunglasses on top. When I went in the glove box to get my sunglasses everything was topsy-turvy and the sunglasses were on the bottom.  What reason would the staff have to rummage through my glove box?\n\nI wonder if all of the locations are experiencing a similar decline.  I will never return."
0,"Very unprofessional and rude employees...I would not recommend coming here unless you want the most expensive car wash, an oil change, and your gas tank filled for $0.20/gallon more than Cobblestone Auto Spa. I politely cancelled my wash (due to the badgering for upgrades and oil change) and the woman did not remove the writing on my window, just wiped two streaks through it and made a few comments under her breath. They then asked me to park my truck across the street while I go inside and pay for the gas they pumped while we were talking, then I was asked to come find her outside and bring her the receipt. Even though this location is close it is far from convenient. ..two thumbs down."
0,"The worst customer service you could ever imagine!  I read the reviews and still bought a groupon because they are so close by our home.   They refused to accept our groupon because their computers were allegedly down upgrading their groupon program.  Their cashier Tereasa  had plenty of attitude in telling us that there was no way possible to redeem our groupon, so we had to pay full retail price instead!  She wrote a messy note for us to walk out and get our car back from the line of cars being washed!  She did not have a phone number for her manager, so we had to just chalk this one up as another failed effort for consumers to use a groupon at Danny's."
0,"They tried to sell me a $79 oil change. I had to call my dealership to verify the oil type. It wasn't what they told me. They super up sell products and then don't deliver the best quality. The \""$19.99 oil change and wash\"" is actually $39.99. Don't be fooled. As it does not include the wash or amount of oil needed for a full change. Still not a bad price but the principle and sneaky sales tactics make this place sketch."
0,"Last two times through Danny's my car came out with marks it didn't have to begin with and I was upsold for their removal.  Some of it is cash to the guys doing the work (which I don't mind so much) and some of it is for services that I paid the cashier.  \n\nThe clincher was a detail (can't believe I did it) that was promised in 2 hours and took 4 - and my car wasn't clean.  You see, I needed the clay wax treatment rather than the treatment they sold me with the detail.  \n\nI have friends who used to go to Danny's, but they have had the same problems recently.  Danny's wasn't like this a year ago - one of the guys working there said it got a lot worse after the raids.  All I know is I will never be back.  \n\nI promised them I would post my experience on Yelp, and they were not concerned.  They know exactly what they are doing and have no shame.  They are thieves."
0,"Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Customer service was awful and my car wasn't even clean. Seriously, as I was driving away I noticed it hadn't even been wiped down inside. I would have driven back to complain, but was too upset by how I was treated by the men who were washing my car. Never going back. Ever."
0,"Will never be back and will tell everyone I know how terrible and unsafe this place is! Today at 2 pm, John at the beginning of the line took forever to get to me - checking in 3 other people who arrived after me.  Then he asks if I wand the floors and mats cleaned and I said yes if it was fast - I asked him 3 times and told him very clearly that it had to be done fast since I had another appointment.  \""Yes, yes, fast, I know\"" is what he said.  50 minutes later I asked another guy to check on my car and he comes back to tell me it will be another 45 minutes!  That guy was really nice but I was now very late for another appointment.  I watched 3 of them gather at my car, stop work and just start talking.  I waited 7 minutes to see if they would start again and finally walked over to the car to see what was going on.  Those folks were very nice but then John walked up and told me that it was my fault because my carpets were so dirty and that he never made any promises to me.  I disagreed and did raise my voice, but never yelled, when I said, \""oh so this is my fault?\"" He immediately took a step closer, got in my face screaming at me not to yell at him and that I \""disrespected\"" him all while pointing his finger less than inch from my face. I told him, very quietly and very sternly to \""Walk away John, Walk away now\"" and he just kept going, backing me up until another very nice worker stepped in and had to physically push him away from me. FYI, I am a woman and I was alone today.  I can't remember the nice guy's name as I was pretty shaken at this point but he had a black bow tie on and he was great, apologizing and trying to make it right.  I told him that at this point i didn't feel safe staying there and to just give me my car.  It took forever since their spin dryer for the mats wasn't working and I drove home with sopping wet mats in the back of my car and quite upset.  I'm still upset and am considering filing a report with the police.  There were dozens of witnesses and one customer even stopped to give me his business card telling me to share his info if I decided to file a report.  And as for the rest of it, there were spots all over my car, 2 windows not cleaned and more crap work.  The store was a trash heap - empty racks, dirty floor, etc.  Disgusting all the way around.  If you value your safety, stay away or don't dare complain."
0,"Convenience was the only factor when choosing to come here for past car washes and, most recently, an oil change. There's something overwhelming about the amount of people that swarm your car the minute you pull up and repeatedly try to sell you additional services without your solicitation. \n\nOne of the employees asked for my phone number and I asked why he needed it. \""In case we have to up-sell you or return your car,\"" was his response. Reluctantly I gave it and sure enough I received a call while I was grocery shopping and waiting. The employee asked me if I wanted additional services after I already said no. I insisted \""no\"" and he still persisted. Very frustrating.\n\nAfter the carwash, there was oil all over the inside of my car and I had to ask the employee to wipe the writing off my windshield which obstructed my view. \n\nI will drive the distance for a better place in the future. Convenience is no longer worth the compromised service."
0,"The wash was OK and didn't take too long. But I had a coupon for an oil change so I had them change it. During that process the mechanic told me the power steering fluid was very old and detrimental to the power steering pump. I agreed to let them change that as I was planning on a long trip the next day. Two weeks later my battery died and the dealership replacing it called to tell me my power steering fluid was very old and that although the sticker on my windshield indicated my oil had just been changed, the oil filter looked old and the viscosity of the oil in the truck looked very old. Somebody is not telling me the truth. My decision will be to never give Danny's any more business."
0,"Quick Review: This place is terrible, don't ever go here. \n\nLonger: Went here to Saturday afternoon (2:30pm) to get an extremely dirty car detailed. $100 detail but the guy says \""hour and a half and it will look like it never had dirt on it\"".  We were a bit skeptical but sure man, your the pro! 3 and half hours later the place is closing and they tell us that we will have to bring it back tomorrow since they couldn't finish it. But they promise they just have a 1/2 hour left.  No one there to really  complain to since management had all left and we weren't gonna yell at the poor guys out in the heat who get paid terrible. \nNext day visit lasted another 5 hours! The car still wasn't really that clean when taken off the property! \n\nDon't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here.\n\nFind a hog wash for $3 and with free vacuum.  It will be just as good and will only be 10 minutes."
0,"I chose this place because it was really close to my new residence in Phoenix and with a ton of relocation costs, I had little money I wanted to spend on maintaining the look of my car. With the word \""carousel\"" in the name, I thought, \""Interesting idea.\"" With the word, \""family,\"" I thought, \""Can't be too bad.\"" I hadn't looked at the Yelp reviews for this place, but immediately regretted it.   \n\nFrom the minute I drove in to the minute I exited the place, I felt REALLY REALLY uncomfortable. Sometimes, I wonder why I didn't just back my car up and take off. \""High temperatures, dumb choices,\"" I keep telling myself. Going on, I was greeted (kind of) by a man with a clipboard and a bunch of choices. I had a bunch of questions, as the sheet he gave me seemed incomplete but every time I asked a question, the guy was completely distracted by whatever his fellow coworkers were doing on the other side of my car. I brushed it off, found the good person in myself, and just made a choice. After making a decision I was immediately KICKED OUT OF MY OWN CAR not really sure where I should pay or what I should do. Finally, another customer recognized my, \""deer in the headlights,\"" look and told me there was a lobby inside. As I walked in, I could hear the employees making those sounds men make when they want your attention on the street. (What kinds of women respond to this anyway? I was fully clothed, not wearing anything scandalous, mind you.) This is where I almost lost it. Really, is this a professional business? \n\nI walked in to the lobby thinking I may never see my car again (what we should think at a car wash, right?) and was greeted by a bunch of uncomfortable stares. I keep thinking back to this experience wondering if there was anything wrong with the way I looked resulting in these stares but can not think of anything out of the norm. Again, I was helped by another customer, telling me where I should pay. So I pay, no problem there. The guy even gives me a student discount after I noticed they honor them. I turn to my right and see that my car had just come out of the washing area. I followed it outside, where, again, I was greeted with more uncomfortable stares and one employee telling me that, \""your car smells like bud.\"" What? Bud?...Marijuana? Ok, I'm from California, so we use that word pretty loosely but that's definitely not a FAMILY word, nor was it very professional to say that. (I've had friend smoking cigarettes in my car awhile back in college, but never marijuana, if you were wondering. ) \n\nIn the drying station, yes, more uncomfortable stares, only to be alleviated once, by another customer who brought a very expensive luxury car to get cleaned. When this happened, the employees all started whoop hollering and praising the car. I was thankful for that, but I'm pretty sure the owner of the car was not ( but I don't know, do you buy luxury cars to be noticed?) \n\nWhen they were close to being done with my car, one of the employees asked if I could remove stuff from the cup holder so he could clean that area. I politely declined, because I was more than ready to get out of the place. I also feel incredibly bad that I didn't tip, but should I have? \n\nNever going back again. \n\nAdvice for people debating going here: Don't go here. Spend a little more. Go somewhere with customer service and professional value."
0,If we could put 0 stars we would. For what they charge they barely clean your car even if you ask for detailing. How can anyone be so bad at running a car wash? Then one of our windshield wipers got hit and torn off in the car wash and left a crack. When we asked for them to fix the $7 problem they lied to us and said it wasn't their problem. Then one of the workers who was obviously on meth started going tweeker crazy just by us asking them to fix their mistake. Everyone who works there is high on either meth or crack and they don't even try to hide it. How is this place still open?
0,"This is the worst Danny's I have ever been to. Whoever runs this location should be ashamed of yourself. I have been to the other locations and NEVER had the experience I had here. I even heard other people complaining while I was in there. I would've rather waited an extra 15 minutes to actually get my car washed.....there was dust, yes dust not dirt or grime or something hard to get off, still on my steering wheel and radio. The back of the car wasn't even vacuumed out. I paid for a works, there was no air freshener in my car. On top of not getting the car wash I paid for they stole my   auxiliary cord. When I called they asked if I saw someone steal it? Of course not they are inside my car and in sitting on the sidelines, it's not like I'm standing over my car watching their every move. They told me they would keep and eye out for it......"
0,"The worst, the store manager is unprofessional and not very bright. He brings the whole establishment down. Never ever will I ever go back there. Disgusted!!!"
0,"Pathetic use to be a good place to get the car washed, paid for their \""VIP package\"" and they didn't vacuum an inch of the car, Not the console, back seats or trunk. didn't dress the interior or even put the air freshener in.  Then use the same black greasy tire rag on my door handles, side panels & interior( exterior is candy white & interior is beige) now my interior has this awesome black grease stain in the back seats,even though I've had passangers in the back 3 times at the most. To make it worse after I got home I had to polish the interior my self, I noticed THEY BROKE my passenger window button, even though there was still crumbs and trash in that area. By far the worse place ever. Took over an hour and it wasn't even busy nor did they do a Damn thing they had been paid for. Bring back all the Hispanic people,they did a way better job. NEVER bring you're car to this joke of a business. Take you're car to los olivos or Tom thumbs fresh market."
0,"$23.99 I had to finish wiping down the dashboard, cup holders weren't wiped out at all. Floor boards were kinda vacuumed. Rear of SUV wasn't cleaned at all but I was charged extra for the size of my vehicle. :("

0,"Absolutely worst car wash! Had my truck for 5 hours after a $200 detail and it looks like a cheap wash..step boards and tires still filthy, mirrors and windows dirty, cup holders in back seat still full of gunk. Will not return and should of checked yelp reviews before I went!"
0,"I ordered the teriyaki chicken, which is apparently their specialty, and priced accordingly.  It was $7 for a medium sized bowl and drink.  The chicken was mediocre and the rice was kinda gummy.  \n\nEven still, this wouldn't have warranted the one star until I bit into a chunk of bone that they forgot to sift out.  Nasty."

0,"This does not exist.  It is now an unbelieveably soulless gay bar with the inventive name \""Bar One\"".  That is all."
0,"I have been using this store for some time now and noticed the manager was always in a bad mood. As each time passed it just seemed odd the mood was always the same. Well this last time I spoke with Ted (manager) he tried to upsell items I didn't need. In asking questions as to why I would need them it aggravated him to explain. So much so that he got argumentative, my assumption is I didn't say \""yes\"" to all the unnecessary items. I come to find out there is another store on 32nd st and Camelback, not far, that is great. Customers come first and when it becomes a problem just to do simple tasks I'd rather go elsewhere. Save yourself time and aggravation and use another store, not worth it."
0,"I had color copies made here. The staff did not know the prices and then they charged me $1.50 for me to use their computer to access the file from my flash drive. The computer was so out of date it could not even read a Word 2007 file. When I looked at the copies the next morning they were misaligned and the print quality looked like a poor inkjet rather than a laser print.\n\nI called them and they said they would have to talk to the manager. When I went back after the weekend, he was not there and the clerk would not give me a refund.\n\nPoor equipment\n\nPoor attitude\n\nPoor customer service.\n\nThere are other UPS stores relatively close. I suggest you use those. I will stick to my local one in Ahwatukee."
0,"I've been a regular customer for about one year now. I've come to learn that the owner is the main issue. When he's at the store (not always) he seems to be put off by providing assistance to any customers. He doesn't seem to know how to use all of the store's equipment. And he's particularly rude on the phone. It's too bad, since I actually like most of his staff. Don't waste your time at this store."
0,"Was not greeted or assisted when I came in. The place is disorderly and dirty looking. Finally when I figured things out on my own I waited for the ladies to finish their conversation about whatever trivial weekend blunder they were talking about. Kimberly was the raised eyebrow, gum chewing teller indifferent to the clients needs. She input the information from my sheet, and tried to tell me that if the recipient is not there upon first delivery, UPS sends it back to the sender and that I should get additional services added.  I'm no shipping pro but obviously they take it back to the nearest UPS store and leave a note at the door.  I then said that I was ok without extra services and said \""I don't care how it gets there as long as it actually gets there\"" in a friendly way. She then half rolled her eyes and smirked and said \""I don't care either\"" in a smart a** way.  Her smart attitude was a turn off considering I'm usually patient with lazy service people. All In all I do not recommend this store I don't feel trustful or secure in sending my important document with them, I'm afraid it could get lost now- I checked the status I my shipment using the tracking number and it says its not available.  Don't recommend, find another location to ship from. :)"
0,"UPS needs to do review on this store and shut them down.  They are ruining the UPS brand.  The clerks who work here are very rude.  I walked in there needing to ship something specifically \""overnight\"" and was given options that were not overnight/next day.  I was at the store at 1pm which is relatively early and before the cut off for next day.  I was assured that the shipping service I purchased was going to be next day.  \n\nThen throughout the night I was checking the tracking number and the product had not left.  The next morning I call the store and they say that they still have the product.  I was sending a passport that needed to be at my destination by 2 days after the first day I initially tried to send it (I chose next day \""overnight\"" to get it there one day before luckily).  After talking to the store over the phone and asking them why the package was not delivered, they told me I did not choose an \""overnight\"" service.  The one thing that I specifically told them was that \""this needs to be sent overnight so that it will arrive tomorrow\"".\n\nThen they tried to charge me more money saying that I did not purchase an overnight product.  Which first of all, I asked specifically only for their overnight options, why would you give me an option that is not overnight. Second, even if your incompetent clerks selected a service that is not overnight, why would it still be there.  I am assuming if it's not overnight, it should still be on it's way for 2nd day and my 1 day cushion would save me.  \n\nSo I ask the clerk to tell the owner to give me a call.  The owner did not give me a call back and told the clerk, \""I will not settle the difference for this, he will pay it or I will throw it away.\""  So the asshole wants to throw away the passport that I need to send because his staff sold me the incorrect service.  I specifically stated to his clerks that the package \""needed to be there by tomorrow\"" and said \""overnight\"" several times.  I paid a hefty premium as well for this service given that the product weights much less than 1 pound and I was there relatively early in the day.  \n\nThese guys are incompetent, distrustful and unreliable.  If you need to ship something important, consider using another UPS store or Fedex."
0,"Very poor customer service. Have been there 3 times in last few months and the same woman who I think is manager. she said some guy named John is owner. She is always rude never says hi, never has smile on, and just looks at you when you come in with blank stare. I came in to return package that needed very small amount of tape and I asked her if I could use some tape and she said it would cost me extra $1.10 for small amount of tape for top of box. She said strict orders from owner. Wow so you would rather lose a customer instead of giving them small amount if tape to help them out. I now go out of my way to go to another ups store."
0,"This is my second visit to this store. Kimberly (the woman behind the counter) is the rudest person I have ever met in retail, who does not deserve to be behind the counter of any retail counter. She is cold, un-inviting, and overall appears to hate her job by the scour look on her face.  She is useless when it comes to helping customers and overall she has a \""can't do\"" attitude.  \n\nI lodged a complaint on the corporate website and this store is privately franchised and owned.  I spoke with John the owner and apparently he must have trained Kimberly because his attitude is just as bad if not worse. He didn't show any concern for my complaint nor did he show any empathy for my experience.  He hung up on me twice in conversation. \n\nKimberly followed me out to the parking lot and show aggressive signs of intimidation with my friend and I and in my opinion that was inappropriate and unprofessional. A sales person NEVER follows a customer outside. \n\nAvoid this store at all cost. The post office is around the corner and is much cheaper. I am fling a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  \n\nGood luck John and Kimberly!!!"
0,Unbelievably bad experience.  Not only is the woman behind the counter the rudest person I have ever met in my life she refused to answer a simple question. Anyone should be able to tell you what the estimated time frame for ground shipping us. Is it 12 days or 21 she had to be given an explanation of what I was asking.  I will be using FedEx to ship anything just yo not have to deal with her again.
0,"I see nothing has changed with this store. I just watched a ups store commercial and I laughed out loud!!  Kimberly (the brunette bitch behind the counter) is still the most evil woman walking on the planet.  I have more respect for the hookers on Van Buren Street than I do for this low class, snotty, unhelpful useless piece of trash!!  Stay away from this store at all cost!!!!"
0,"Stopped in to drop off an Amazon return.  I had a prepaid label and box, but the box was opened.  At another UPS Store,  they always tape it up for me at no cost.   Not here.  They charge a $1 handling and taping fee for all prepaid packages.  I thought the guy was joking until he asked me if I had read the sign.  He pointed to a partially blocked sign, attached to a register around the counter from where I was.  If I wasn't so limited on time, I would have taken my package elsewhere.  I definitely will not return to this location."
0,"Sorry to leave a bad review since these seem to be nice people, but my experience here wasn't good. I took in a high-end CD player that wasn't reading discs, and paid a $25 diagnostic fee. A couple days later the guy phones me and says the unit needs a new laser assembly, but he can't do it because he only has one of the two calibration discs required to do the job. He recommends I send it to the Sony facility in Laredo TX. I look at the reviews for the Sony facility and they're *horrid*. I decide to try one more thing, and contact an SACD \""modder\"" I found through Audio Asylum. This guy says he can fix the unit, but he suggests I open it up and clean the pickup lenses before going through the trouble of shipping the unit to him. Long story short, the thing works like a champ now. I don't think I could trust DynaTronics to give me competent advice at this point, especially on audiophile gear. Sorry"
0,"If you are an audiophile, then stay away   FAR AWAY.!!!   I brought in a Luxman hybrid amp because of some parasitic noise that I thought was due to a dirty volume pot.  After they replaced 5 capacitors for about 175.00, ( WHY??)  I took it home and guess what , it made NO difference whatsoever.  So I brought it back.. Here is where the problems really began  Martin, ( you are a total DICK) was so rude I thought I was getting punked.    I hope to all that is holy you go out of business soon.    My amp is still not fixed.  I am out 175.00.  And I do not want to go back there to face this very very rude individual.  He was even rude to my wife, who by the way is the sweetest person I know. (I have to say that).  I am sorry our paths crossed at all!!   By the way, even if you are not an audiophile, but simply a decent human being I still advise you stay away...far away."
0,I retract my last positive review. I had a reciever repaired here.The equipment they installed failed 5 days after the product guarantee. They wouldl not even give me a break in the diagnostic fee of 20.00 to have it looked at again. They told me it would be about another 150.00 to fix it again.  I would stay far away from these guys.
0,"I took a turntable in to.have them adjust the tonearm settings.  They told me it would take a week for an estimate.  A week later I was told it would be another week.  A week later they said they would take three more days. When I stated the constant delays were unacceptable he got extremely angry and told me in a rude tone to pick up my turntable since they had someone die. I started to explain that I was not aware of their situation, but before I could he hung up on me. It turned out that a tech had died and they were short handed.  I would have understood if they had explained and not been totally rude.  In fact I had a tragedy involving my son the same day.  I went in to talk to them to explain That I was not aware of their situation and was only concerned by the constant delays.  The manager said that I had been abusive and had used foul language with the tech which was a total lie.  He said based that on what the tech had told him. I will never use this company again. Their customer service is lacking."
0,"My Hi-Fi Dynaco tube CD player right channel had no sound output. Went to Dyna-Tronics, paid $25 for a diagnostic/estimate. Later, was told it would be $150 to repair. I picked up the CDP and was informed that everything was fully functional but the volume output was really low. I had no idea what they were talking about until I got home.\n\nI called Dyna-tronics and told them that the CDP wasn't fixed.  Originally, 20% of power was used to listen to music. After Dyna-tronics, 90% power was needed just to hear any sound from the CDP. Dyna-tronics asked if both channels were working properly? Yes, I said. Shockingly, they said, \""so, what's the problem? You identified that one channel was not working, is it working now? Then we fixed the problem. Also, we informed you that the output level was really low when you picked it up.\""\n\nI tried to reason with Dyna-tronics \""expert\"" to no avail. I told them if there was a volume issue I would have informed them. Although they fixed the channel issue, now the volume output is a problem. I was told that they did all they could do and there is nothing else they could do for me, that they fixed the channel issue and the volume problem was like that when I brought it in.\n\nTrying to trouble shoot the problem myself, I replaced the old tubes with new ones but noticed that the old tubes weren't lighting up. The new tubes had the same light and volume issue.  I took the tubes out, using no tubes, the volume issue was the same!  No tube and low volume! WTH?\n\nMy face-to-face encounter with an \""expert\"" actually exacerbate the problem.  The \""expert\"" used his informational advantage to make me feel stupid, rushed and ignoble.  I am no expert, but I know how to use my audio equipment and if there was a volume issue I would have mentioned it at the diagnostic stage.\n\nI would not recommend taking your valued audio equipment to Dyna-tronics. Their \""mightier-than-thou\"" attitude is unwarranted.  If they can't stand by their work, listen to reason, have empathy for customer's feelings, and talk down to customers, then they should close their doors and make this world a better place. Hopefully, my bad experience will save music lovers from being belittled and save some money."
0,"I have been here on multiple occasions and each time the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Their selection in 38s-40s seems pretty limited. \n\nI've been twice now when I was looking for a particular color / style. When asked if I needed any assistance, the answer to \""yes, I'm looking for x type of jacket in x color\"" should not be to say, \""hold on a few minutes while I\"" do something and then to leave your customer waiting 10+ min for an answer.\n\nSave yourself the hassle and go check out, pretty much anywhere else. I hear they sell jackets and suits at the thrift stores. At least there I'm expecting to be ignored and have to fend for myself when trying to find something."
0,Worst service and pizza!!!  Just ordered Chicken BBQ and I got something totally not Chicken BBQ.  So I called them to let them know we got the wrong pizza and they keep hanging up on me.  I didn't even get to tell them.  I just said I got the wrong pizza and they keep telling me to hold then hangs up.  My favorite pizza is Pizza Hut but not this location for sure.  If I can give -star I would.
0,"you couldn't pay me to set foot in this shady place... I tried it a couple of times in 2011 and 2012 and I was surprised that a place like this was still in business, especially given its prime location.  \n\nService was horrible, we were treated like trespassers by the thug behind the bar.\n\nconsider yourself warned."
0,"Well, Armadillo Grill, I'm not a fan.\n\nWe came here on Wednesday night for an NBA playoff game after reading the reviews touting the great food and the plethora of TVs. I was disappointed with the food and really disappointed with the service. I won't be back. \n\nOur server clearly did not want to be there; she seemed annoyed that we were sat in her section. She didn't know the menu very well, and kept having to (unapologetically) leave the table to run our questions by the other staff.\n\nMy boyfriend had the stroganoff and I had a veggie burger. Both plates came out within 10 minutes, which always makes me a little nervous. His was sub par; he ate about 35% of it. The veggie burger was near the quality that I've come to expect from most restaurant vegetarian options. The bread was decent, and the patty was an unaltered Boca burger. Everything was below average, except for the music, which was about average.\n\nThey played it at a decent volume (thank you), and was probably someone's itunes playlist of hits from the 90s. I'm okay with that.\n\nThey do have a decent amount of TVs (though nothing to swoon about in my opinion), however they are small and outdated. Most of the ones near us were staticy. I ended up watching the game from a TV that was half way across the room, the only one in our section of the restaurant with a decent picture."
0,Probably an ok place to grab a drink and watch some sports but wouldn't recommend you eat there. I ordered the chicken/brie sandwich - sounded lovely on the menu but it was boiled chicken - so rubbery it was tough to cut through. My husband ordered the steak tacos. They were so greasy he couldn't pick them up. We both had bad stomach ache for hours after eating there.
0,"I was here with friends for drinks and dinner last Thursday evening, and I have to say that nothing about this restaurant was acceptable for any of us.\n\nFirst, we didn't have reservations and were greeted with slightly rude service by the host.  However, I think she noticed that we were a little taken aback by the attitude, and quickly changed her mood.\n\nIn the downstairs bar, we ordered drinks while we waited for a table to open up for us.  The bartender made a mistake while preparing my friend's Bloody Mary, accidentally dumping an enormous amount of tabasco in her drink.  However instead of simply making a new one, he served it to her anyway (admitting his mistake while setting it down in front of her) and told her to let him know if she didn't like it and wanted a new one.  Of course she tried it, couldn't drink it and had to ask for a new one.\n\nAfter we got to our table upstairs and ordered our appetizers and meals, things got worse.  It took well over half an hour to get our appetizers, and when we did they were cold.  We were not sure that our oysters were supposed to be as cold as they were, but the fact that they had congealed melted cheese seemed to indicate that they should haver at least been warm.\n\nAfter we finally got our salads (about 45 minutes after ordering), we were rushed through them before getting our meals just a couple minutes later.  None of us enjoyed our meals, as we found them either burnt or bland.\n\nEven though we made a few complaints about our meal to the server, when our check came we found that we had been charged for everything and were only offered a very pallid apology for the obvious problems with our meal.\n\nthis was not an inexpensive meal, either, so we will likely not be back!"
0,"Really nice ambience, super nice. So nice that we wanted to stay and have a drink and something to nibble on in the downstairs bar. Unfortunately the server wasn't anywhere as nice as the ambience, she essentially kicked us out because we sat at table that was reserved (although there was no reserved sign) and didn't offer to help us find a seat in a full bar. So much for hospitality. They probably do have great offerings here in the food and drink category, but lots of other (nicer) places do too. So that's where we ended up going."
0,"this place looks really nice.  The ambiance was great, but the food blechk!  I ordered the lamb and it was basically just fat.  My Beau ordered the schnitzel and it was salty.  Our waitress was rude, and our bill was 100!  (2 entrees a bottle of wine and 1 appetizer)  When we got home my beau was up all night throwing up.  It was horrible!  In their defense after calling several times, they reimburssed our bill.  That was the first time I've ever called and complained anywhere.  I used to be a server so I know how it is sometimes, but this was just terrible!"
0,"Worst experience ever!  I am a fan of Richardson's so I thought we should check this place out.  Stopped in on a Friday night around 8pm without reservations just to see how long the wait would be.  Great host at the door greeted us and was really friendly.  He said there was over an hour wait upstairs but we could try our chances downstairs where it was all open seating.  We headed downstairs, grabbed a couple glasses of wine and waited for seats to open up.  We waited quite a long time for a table and multiple groups were able to grab seats before us, so we saw a couple ladies paying their  tab and asked if we could get their seats when they were ready to leave.  We ended up talking to them for a while before they left.  When we went to sit down, a very unfriendly brunette bartender said this other couple had been waiting longer and were next on \""the list\"".  The other couple was already sitting!  She gave them our seats  at the bar and someone else who had just walked in grabbed their chairs.  I'll never be back.  If there's a list, tell the door guy and offer people to put their names on it when they arrive.  And if that couple needed to sit at the bar so bad, I would have been fine with the table.  Customer service is obviously lost on this place (except the sweet door host.  Worst experience I've had in a long time.  Contrary to my efforts to calmly explain to the bartender, she did nothing to resolve the issue."
0,"I heard good things about this place, and was looking forward to what the \""basement\"" atmosphere would feel like, lowbrow, a little seedy, etc. Sadly, too many middle-aged men wearing flip flops out on a Friday night. Flip flops? UGH..in Winter? Also, our waiter SUCKED! He acted like he had a hard night and was unwilling to suggest a beer, so I am sure he spit in my draft...Anyhoo, does not matter as I will not return."
0,"BEWARE...if you want a reservation for less than four people, you are out of luck! Apparently there is one table in the dungeon that is reserved for parties less than four but it was reserved for he night. However, we were invited to sit in the bar...yipeee!!! I think it's good for them that they are busy, but I think they should seriously evaluate how they treat new customers. This place was highly recommended, but impossibly unaccessible."
0,"Just returned from the Rockerij, we had a house salad that was mixed greens (Costco style) with 2 small pieces of tomato and croutons for $8.00!  Sorry folks this is not a salad this is a plate of lettuce.  $8.00!!  \n\n We ordered Prime Rib and once again we were disappointed, seriously the meat was tough and that \""melt in your mouth anticipation\""  just didn't happen.   We walked out vowing never to return again.  If you are commancing high prices then provide superior quality.  As for service, it is a reflection of the 'lack of flavor, quality and true concern for patrons', everyone is too busy to concern themselves with the details.  \n\nWe dine out often, returning to places that once valued client, quality and service.  We will not retun to Rokerji,  Bummer, once upon a time the client, service and quality meats reined supreme.\n\nSharon G."
0,"Let me preface this by saying this used to be my favorite restaurant in PHX... This experience has changed that...  I made a reservation for 11 5 days before the dinner at 730 pm on a Sat..  after arriving promptly at 730 we were forced to wait 20 minutesonly to be sat at 2 separate booths...  Completetly defeating the purpose of a group dining experience..  Now the bad part...  For dinner I ordered off the special menu a wild boar bacon wrapped bone in beef tenderloin cooked rare..  I received a baconless well done hunk of meat...  I pointed this out to the waitress she took the meal hoping to have it prepared correctly..  a few minutes later the manager approached the table and informed me they were out of the bacon ( one would think they would know that before the meal was prepared and attempted to slide this past the diner). I was offered a replacement meal , but declined and decided to go with the soup.... This prompted the manager to inform me it was a spicy dish to which I accepted and said it was fine, he proceeded to inform me of the heat of the dish 2 more times both times I assured him this was fine leading him to question my order again at which time I was in disbelief and asked if there is some reason he doesn't want me to  have the dish..   this was enough to finally agree to let me place the order the soup came and was excellent and spicy.   I managed to persevere through the heat and eat the whole bowl ( I enjoy spicy food).  This ruined the whole experience for me ..  luckily everyone else's meals were enjoyable its just disappointing being treated like that at a place I thought so highly of and do everythingin my power to get people I care about to do it....  A sad day"
0,"Okay food, terrible, slow and arrogant service.  You guys need to change your attitude.  The server could have cared less about her service, ignored, us and the food took forever! Not even an acknolwedgement from the staff that the food was taking too long. Also, we were sat down about 15 to 30 min after our seating time and there was not enough space for us to sit to wait for our table as there are only 4 chairs - 2 back to back so I had to sit on the edge as there were several of us. After asking to get a drink a waitress shoved a menu in my face and said she would take my order and never came around. We also had to chase our check down as well."
0,"Used to be one of our favorites, though the last two times in have disappointed. Recent outing included drinks downstairs and staff was unfriendly and uninterested in helping guests.  Dinner upstairs was a poor experience. Our entrees for our party came out about 10 minutes apart and to make matters worse two entrees were incorrect. One entree was replaced and the second was replaced using the previous plate with a portion of the meal replaced.  Has Rokerij lost it's touch?"
0,"What a disappointment. We began our late night (9:30) dinning experience here really happy with high expectations as the ambiance was wonderful and the recommendations were good. However, we left bitter and disappointed. My sister and I enjoyed two lovely \""small plates\"" one was beef skewers and the other a shrimp bruschetta type dish. It was all down hill after that. Shortly after ordering our main courses we noticed a bug crawling on the top of our booth...yeah, it was a COCKROACH!!! I grabbed it in my napkin and crumpled it up and left in a side station area. We both were grossed out but were not going to make a huge fuss and have it ruin our meal. We're both flexible and understanding and didn't complain. But seeing that in a restaurant is really inexcusable and disgusting-and definitely dampers your appetite for their food. Where are his friends? Are they in the kitchen?! YUCK!!! We then waited 45 minutes for our food: an enchilada plate and a relleno plate. When they set down the steaming hot plates the food was cooked to nuclear levels because there  was a one inch crust around the plate and the beans were so dried out it was comical. Now mind you, these are $16 and $18 dollar plates of food. That is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such. We promptly sent the food back and the manager came out and apologized which was appreciated. He stated that \""it was inexcusable the way the food came out (which our server didn't monitor) and that his cook is obviously more interested in cleaning and getting out of here, then preparing the food.\"" They offered to remake the food but it was literally too late around 10:45 and we didn't want to wait. They then took the food off but left the other stuff on. The bill came out to around 42 dollars. Which seemed unreasonable after only having a beer, a cocktail, two appetizers and a totally ruined dinning experience. We didn't mention the cockroach or the fact that it was my 30th birthday to the manager but it boils down to this: after that kind of experience he could of saved our business by comping the meal. The fact that we had TWO ruined entrees and walked out of their still hungry AND paying 40 dollars is bullshit. There are too many other quality options in this town with exceptional service. I wont ever go back to Rokerij."
0,It was abnormally warm inside and the food was sub par at best.  Drinks were also below average.  Not worth the price or time.  I had high expectations for this place and it definitely did not live up.
0,"So I have been wanting to come to this joint for EVA! How-EVA, our experience was not fabulous. It was more like DRAB-ulous. Things started out great when we snagged a cozy little table in the corner about 9pm on a Friday night. The liquor wall looked too tempting to pass up, so I ordered a Gibson with some Tito's vodka (my fav!)- well the cocktail onions were soggy and mushy upon first bite and it pretty much ruined the drink. The server did not offer to bring me something different, he just apologized and looked for the jar of onions and said they are all like that. Hmmmm. There were a MILLION specials. It took like 5 minutes literally to read the entire list. It was baffling. The prices are NOT cheap. We were already thinking we should give this place a shot during $5 plate happy hour. Anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters. Well, they came out with Chirozo on them- and I barely eat seafood, but definitely not pork! All the server said was \""Well it listed the chorizo on the menu\""- Hmmmmmm. Again, we just kept them. Then my boyfriend tried one and it was full of sand! At this point, we had already ordered the mushroom toast points, but after the oyster debacle, we had pretty much decided to go elsewhere and especially when the next appetizer came, it just was overloaded with brie and canned looking mushrooms, totally overcooked and unappetizing. We politely told the server that we were just going to call it a night (there was NO WAY we were going to spend 35-40 bucks on the entree lottery)- he then offered to \""do anything\"" to make our experience better and we thanked him and just explained why we were leaving and we would be back to try the happy hour another time (truth). Anyway then he took like 15 minutes at least trying to get the manager to take the oysters off (I would rather have paid for them) and then he FINALLY brought us our bill with the two drinks AND the uneaten mushroom appetizer. I am a foodie and have been in the business since I was 15 and I NEVER EVER want anything for free or removed from my check, however, there are certain circumstances- and I must say I can not remember having a completely horrible experience like this one on a long time- where I feel  that as a server, let alone a manager- I would comp the entire tab and offer to have the guest back on some sort of gift certificate or comp.  Again, I NEVER EVER look for anything free in a restaurant, but if you had been sitting in my shoes last night, you would agree this experience warranted some above and beyond customer service to retain guests in the future. Well that didn't happen, perhaps they have been around so long they just figure oh well who cares, we are well known so whatever. Well, whatever is I will NEVER attend that restaurant or any of their other concepts, plus now I have written a poor review, and all my FB friends know about it too. I'm sure in my life moving forward Rokerij will also come up in conversation with some of my foodie friends and they too will know I think this place is overrated. We left the waiter a very nice tip and thanked them by never attending their establishment again. Such a shame. Customer service is dead these days... SIgh....Hope it was worth the $30 bucks guys."
0,If you choose to go with the mexican side of the menu its disgusting. Everything is slop on a plate. No one should come here and pay these prices.
0,DO NOT EVER BUY a gift card from this restaurant.  We got seriously scammed on our gift card and management has done nothing about it.  They don't care that their customers are  being ripped off because they already got their money.  I had to file a complaint with the Attorney General's office against Richardson's/Rokerij.
0,"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST SERVICE IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I gave this place 1 star because the food is truly amazing. Too bad the manager has absolutely no clue what he is doing. Probably gets tipped on the side by \""regular\"" patrons and believes that's where his priorities should be at. First of all I made reservations for my mother's 60th birthday because the food here the first time was great. But did I mention the first time I was here our server made a mistake on every single food item we ordered?? At least he had the decency to get our desserts to make it up. An hour or two before the reservations we had called to see if we could add two more people. They told us fine and moved us up to 9pm for the private dining area. Well we showed up exactly at 9 and our room was not ready. Ok no big deal. A little annoying cuz what's the point of making reservations but we were ok. But after 20-30 min of waiting, I started to get pissed. I told the manager and he actually had the nerve to blame it on me!!!! That I called and added two people last minute!! Isn't it his job to make sure that this doesn't happen?!!! If he couldn't accommodate 8 people then say so and we could have went somewhere else. Also the whole time, he was even apologetic and instead of offering maybe a round of drinks for the wait or anything, he just stood around doing nothing!!! So we left and went to Capital Grille instead. We were very happy to celebrate and spend tons of money where we didn't have to wait and the manager and staff knew what they were doing!!! I will never go here again and if u want to go just expect to wait at least am hour even w reservations!!!!!"
0,"If I could give a zero I could.  Waited 45 minutes for a 7:30 reservation.\nWere told \""We are overbooked\"".  Downhill from there.  There was no place to wait so we stood in the middle of the restaurant jostled by waiters and customers.  Our waiter was clueless and disappeared during our ordering and our meals.  The entrees arrived before the appetizer and the before meal bread came as we were finishing dinner. My chicken enchiladas had no discernible chicken and was just a large mush pile. None of us five liked our meals.  The only good thing was the roasted beet side dish.  Maybe this qualified for one star.\nThis used to be our favorite restaurant in the area.  No longer.  The staff\nTreated us like we were in a post office.  The hype is killing them.  The kitchen and especially the employees need attitude and training lessons.\nThe owner needs a wake up call."
0,Keep in mind i did NOT eat here. So this post is not about food quality. its about the service \nit was like i wasnt even there when i waited for 30 minutes before the bartender asked if i would like something to drink\nofcourse as soon as a girl came up to the bar the bartender would run over like a little puppy hoping to his ear scratched
0,What happened to this place? Food and service used to be on point but we just went there for my bday and the service and food was not what it used to be. Won't be going\nback...I'd spend your money elsewhere.
0,"Went here with a friend the other night. Decided to sit in the dining room because I haven't seen it before. Someone brought us waters but no one greeted us for at least 5 minutes, so we decided to move down to the bar downstairs. It was only a couple minutes before happy hour ended and the bartender threw in some food and drinks for us which we were delighted by. But the rest of the visit was less than pleasing. Both of the bartenders were detached and not warm, or welcoming. I honestly felt like we were a burden (although there were only three other people at the bar) it felt like we were getting the cold shoulder. The guy bartender did not smile once. Let alone make eye contact.\nFOOD: the oysters were more disappointing. They were not shucked whatsoever and they were too large, and did not taste fresh. I let them know and they were taken from me but without apology or any action taken to remedy the situation besides taking half of the order off of the bill. \nNeedless to say we decided not to order anything else, the uncomfortable visit went on long enough. \nI'm extremely disheartened by this and when before I would recommend this place to friends, I will not be returning and I will not subject others to this."
0,"Overpriced, overrated, HORRIBLE SERVICE!  \n\nWhen asked for a spoon with which to eat my pasta, they actially gave me an iced tea spoon!\n\nNo bartender, I sat for 15 minutes without a greeting, anything. The grey-haired manager stomped aroumd the restaurant avoiding all contact with customers.  What's the point/benefit on that?\n\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AT THIS AMATEURISH OVERPRICED DUMP!  INSTEAD, GO TO MEATBALLZ IN THE SAME CENTER,ON CAMELBACK. MUCH BETTER FOOD, REASONABLE PRICES AND NO ICED TEA SPOONS!"
0,"35 minutes. That's how long my four-year-old son and I waited from the time we sat down until we received our lunch. Granted, my son is more patient than most children his age, but after about 20 minutes, he started to ask about where his food was. This occurred on Good Friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm.\n\nI guess I should have been alerted to this situation from the moment I walked in. No one greeted us, and it took about three minutes before we were even acknowledged. We wanted to sit outside, but after 60 seconds of debating with a colleague, the gentleman told us there were no outside seats - although we clearly saw two empty tables. Then, the shirts on the employees said, \""Unique like a Brooklyn accent.\"" I really should question a company that doesn't use proper grammar. (It should read, \""Unique, like a Brooklyn accent.\"")\n\nThe person who seated us also took our order moments after we sat down. I asked for apple juice for my son and was told they were out, so we switched to iced tea for him and water with lemon for me. We shortly received our drinks - sans lemon. \n\nAfter we were there about 10 minutes, a large party of 10 was seated near us. Half were small children my son's age and they received lemons with their beverages, so my thought that the restaurant was perhaps out of those too was erased. Unfortunately, our waiter never checked on us, and I actually had to flag him down as my son was whining for food to get a water refill and ask - again - for a lemon. It was then that he told me he'd check on our food.\n\nFINALLY, 35 minutes in, our food arrived. I think we were so hungry at that point that dirt would have sufficed. My son doesn't usually like mac and cheese that is penne with cheese sauce, but he ate nearly all of it. My eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best I've had. Neither of our items was baked, so I'm still not sure what the holdup was. And, by the way, the table of 10 received their food before we did and came and left in the hour we were there. While I'm complaining, my son's ice cream was so frozen I almost needed a knife to cut it for him.\n\nI would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed. Although the place was full, I counted seven employees, including a manager. Other tables were receiving much better service, so I'd have to say the problem was more with our server (who never shared his name). My son and I eat out about once a week, and I always leave 20% for a tip, but this time I left $1 on a $16 bill. At first, I felt badly about it, but then I remembered, \""Oh yeah, it's not like I'm ever coming back here.\""\n\n*** On 4/5/10, Alana, a representative from NYPD Pizza sent me an e-mail when she came across my review and offered her sincere apologies, a follow-up call from customer service, and a coupon for a free pizza / meal. I was very appreciative of the response, and as I told her, I've been to other NYPD Pizza locations with much better results; I think this episode was the result of a new or poorly trained server."
0,"Their delivery service was disappointing.  I was told 45min to an hour for delivery. At about 45 minutes the driver shows up with the wrong pizza.  He calls in and they tell him that it's in the oven, so he tells me he'll be right back. 45 minutes later he shows up with a cold pizza. This ruined the dinner experience.  I couldn't tell you if their pizza is good because I am not a fan of room temperature pizza. As a consolation the bum driver gave me some coupons (thanks!)."
0,"WOW!  I have never been to a place with service this horrible.  I may have caught them on a bad night, but I'm not giving them a second chance to find out!\n\nI came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..\n\nAs we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.\n\nWe stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.\n\nWhat a joke...\n\n**EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something"
0,"Overpriced, Terrible service!  I've been a long time customer of this chain, but I won't be going back! \n\nFor a long time I was happy to pay the high price for a great pie, but on a recent trip the poor service left a sour taste which has prompted me to visit the MANY other great pizza joints in the neighborhood.  \n\nThe manager was short, snarky and seemed to be put out to have me come pick my pizza up for take out.  When I called from a friend's phone and told him I didn't have my phone but that I was a previous customer and gave him my number, he said he would just drop the pizza at my house and charge my credit card if I didn't show up.   When I did show up and had a beer with friends while waiting he had the audacity to make a comment that if our intoxication became a problem he would have to ask us to leave."
0,"Mediocre pizza, HORRIBLE service.  We told the waiter that we were in a hurry and it still took 45 minutes to get the food.  We had two minutes to eat it and it was boring.  Then I got to argue with the waiter, so that was fun.  Go to the Parlor.  It's got better pizza and WAY better service."
0,"I ordered a pizza for delivery and requested it be delivered to my work office (right up the road) by noon. This was at 10am. By 12:07 I called to check on the order. I was assured that it had already left the building and was on its way. At 12:30 I called and was told the same thing \""Oh yes, she just left. It should be there any minute.\"" 12:50 and my pizza finally arrived. The woman who brought it had a piece of paper with my name on it and nothing else. She was on the phone, on hold, to find out if I had paid by card or if it was cash. I informed her that I ordered the pizza over two hours ago online and paid by card. She ignored me and we stood there for 5 minutes before she would hand over my small, now cold pizza. I signed the blank piece of paper. Now with 10 min left in my lunch break, I opened the box to find a cold and soggy pizza. The crust was wet with, I don't know what and the bottom was almost completely soggy. \nThis is probably the worst experience I have had. One thing after another, not to mention the website crashed on me three times when I ordered, should've know it would be a problem.\nNeedless to say... I won't be eating here again and neither will my friends."
0,last ditch Christmas eve take home pizza...ok...I ordered it on line and went and picked it up..they kept me waiting anyway...I asked for extra crisp...might as well have asked for extra raw...just to much dough..ingredients just laid on top of mushy dough...flavors..so so...would never go there again thanks....
0,"Oh NYPD Pizza. You seriously disappointed me. \n\nMy husband and I stopped in on Saturday around 1pm. We were seated quickly since the restaurant wasn't busy but it took us 15 minutes for a waiter to come by. FIFTEEN minutes. A different waiter dropped off two waters when we sat down, but other than that - no one even acknowledged us. We had to stop another waitress and ask who are waiter was - and she seemed super confused. \n\nFinally Connor rolls around. Doesn't apologize for the wait - just seems nonchalant about taking our order. \n\nWe split the chopped salad and had a few slices of pizza. The pizza was fine but don't bother with the chopped salad - not worth $10 at all. I think we counted a grand total of 4 tiny pieces of sun dried tomatoes and 8 quarter pieces of cucumber. \n\nWe were never checked on during our dining experience until my husband was taking the last bite of pizza crust, Connor asked us how was the food. Really? Water was never refilled and extra napkins never appeared. \n\nWe won't be coming back."
0,"What has happened to this place??  New management?  I came on here to see if there are any other disappointed customers recently.  My office has ordered from here numerous times for years. We know it takes over an hour for delivery so that is why we call in shortly after they open.  Last time we ordered it took 2.5 hrs for our food. They gave us a 50% discount. We were never gonna order again.  However, I am pregnant and just miss this place!  Today after an hour and a half went by I called to check on order.  \""It was next out for delivery.\""  The girl didn't seem to happy I was checking up on it.  It took  2 hrs this time.  The worse part is it seemed they threw on some cheese and did a quick run to heat back up.  It was awful.  Looks like Streets Of New York it is for now on.  :("
0,"I'm seriously shocked that there are not more neg reviews on here about this place because I hear people bitching all the time. \n\nFirst of all, do not expect to make a quick 'in-and-out' experience. You walk in and put your name on the List.. yes, list with a capital L. What is interesting is they ask you what your question/comment/concern is but when you finally get called five hours later, they ask you to explain your question/comment/concern all over again.\n\nLet's just say you have a Blackberry Pearl 8130 and the roller ball does not work anymore. Hypothetically, of course. So the highly skilled guy behind the counter looks at it for 2 seconds and says \""Oh, looks like it needs to be replaced...\"" I'm pretty sure I already said that. \""Unfortunately, we don't have any of these in stock..\""\n\nWha? Come again? You don't have any more of one of your most popular phones in stock, in any of the 542 colors it comes in? Boy oh Boy.\n\n\""Here, you can call this number and request they send you out a new one.\"" Great, the same number that told me I had to go into the store to get it replaced.\n\nOh brother what a bummer."
0,"This location is the sole reason that after 13 years, we are no longer AirTouch/Verizon customers, and will never, ever be again. I went in to upgrade my phones one afternoon only to be accosted by an angry, pimply faced little elf of an employee. He was disrespectful, got in my face, and talked down to me the entire time when all I had wanted was two new phones. When I got sick of his attitude I demanded a manager and he said there wasn't one. As if. He then called security, which is when I REALLY got mad! I began yelling at the top of my lungs when \""magically\"" a manager appeared out of the back room to investigate the commotion. The manager sent the kid on a \""walk\"" and apologized profusely, saying they've had problems with him before. My question was: WHY THE HELL DOES HE STILL WORK THERE?!?! He asked what he could do to make us happy and I asked for the regional manager's phone number. He provided the regional manager's cellular number, which I promptly called. After explaining what had happened, both managers agreed to cancel our two accounts with no early cancellation fees. Woot."
0,This location of Verizon gave me the customer service experience equivalent  of a car wreck.
0,"i wish i had got his name, but they have an employee in there, white guy, shaved head, he was trying to be kinda smart with me and act like he was above me, kinda like he was competing, now i wore my tank top in there, i am 26 but i look like im 20 and im not trying to act tough, i never do. Anyway i tried to be nice at first, and when explaining my problems (there are about 5 different problems i am having with my brand new stratosphere 2) he would tell me \""well there's nothing we can do about that\"", and im like \""well what about all these other problems\"" he would reply \""what other problems\"" 2 TIMES after ive explained all my problems he says\""what other problems\"" i said f*** it dude you are an idiot im going to talk to someone else... so i talk to someone else here are the problems im having with the stratosphere 2 in my first two days (mind you i haven't really used my phone these two days because these problems are constant and f***ing annoying):\n1. i cant send or receive calls/texts (this happens on and off)\n2. if my text is somewhat long people either dont get it or they get a couple words out of the few sentences, just a couple f***ing words sometimes half of a word\n3. the calls that do go through, well 75% of the time no one can hear me, i can hear them, they cannot hear me\n4.the phone reads my sd card but it wont play my music (the sd card works fine in my stratosphere 1)\n5. i cant use my apps, they randomly just exit and im back to the front screen, if i try again it happens again\n\nOF COURSE when i go in to show them the phone starts acting normal, so i cant get a replacement on this f***ing phone that i cant even use, have to keep re trying my calls, miss texts, people dont get my texts or they get a couple words from it AND i cant use my apps, so pretty much nothing on this f***ing phone works, but i cant get a new one....."
0,Most inefficient place I've been at.  Told it would be 30min and turned out to be an hour.  All I needed to do was replace a carrier clip.  Everyone was pissed off in the store.  You can't get simple service without waiting.  The only positive was the guy who checked us in finally got a clue and got me a new clip before my name was called.  The want personalized service but there only getting pissed off customers once they start to help them out.  Oh yea employees there park in the prime parking in front of the store.  I noticed this while we were waiting.   If you have a lot of spare time on your hands then this is the place for u. I will never go back to this store.
0,they are LUCKY to get even this 1 star ...if possible i would of given them -5.....EXTREMELY RUDE....I will never walk into this location again.....AVOID at all costs this location!!!!
0,"My husband and I came into this store on Saturday to upgrade our phones and to add him to my plan. We were put in the queue for a sales associate, and were then called over by a woman with blonde curly hair who basically refused to help us at all.\n\nHere's what happened:\nUnbeknownst to me my maiden name was still on my account, so when asked for my ID it didn't match up. \n\nMe -So how do I change my name on my account?  \n\nSale associate - Do you have anything on you with your old name on it?\n\nMe - No, that's my old name, everything I have on me now has my new name.\nSo how do I go about changing my name on my account?\n\nSales associate - If you don't have anything with your old name on it, I can't help you.\n\nMe - People get married all of the time and change their name, you're telling me I can't change my name on my account?\n\nSales associate - Not at the store level\n\nMe- Fine, I guess I'll just figure it out myself.....\n\nI then walked out of the store and called their customer number to ask them how to change my name on my account since, the Sales Associate in the store wouldn't tell me how. I was told I just need to bring my marriage license into a STORE, and they could change it there. Um, I was just told in the store that I couldn't change my name there, but I guess that was a lie.\n\nThe woman I dealt with clearly had no desire to help me. It's fine if you don't know the answer to something, but at least make the effort to find it out! I don't understand people that work in customer service, and totally lack it at the same time, isn't this your job?\n\nCongrats for earning my first 1 star review!\n\nIf you need to go to a Verizon store, drive the 6 miles to the other one on 44th and Thomas where they actually will help you."
0,"The store manager is lazy, rude and unhelpful. Same with the assistant manager Charlie. I feel really bad for the reps who have to work under such poor management.  I got no help from anyone when it was clearly a problem caused by someone at that store.  The manager refused to take me off speakerphone even when it was obvious that the echo in his tiny, depressing office was making it impossible to communicate. GO TO THE ARCADIA STORE AT THOMAS AND 44TH. MUCH BETTER!! BOYCOTT THE CAMELBACK STORE!"
0,"I went to this store 4/10/2014 and was Daniel took very good care of me upgrading my phone.\nI went back 4/12/2014 with my wife to return a item that was defective and upgrade my wife's phone.

When I mentioned my wife having to walk that far several of the young wise mouths said so what. \nOne female and one guy felt the need to mouth off over the bathroom issue, even with a handicapped person.\nOf course I got pissed with their additudes and expressed my displeasure with Verizon and their wise mouths.\nI told them now my wife refuses to buy from that store and they said they don't really care. They then told me to leave, that they would not do the refund.\nI've been a customer since 1995 when it was Alltel, and then when Verison took over I stayed with Verison. When I mention this they said they really could care less.\nOf course being 62 and handicapped myself, I then told the female and one guy for both of them to F-OFF.\nThe customer service has really gone down since they are the most popular wireless company in Arizona.\nIf I can do anything to assist in taking them down a few levels I will.\nIf Verizon continues to hire and employee people like this with absolutely no customer service professionalism, Verizon will fall like a rock.\nIf I had not gotten my new phone 4/10/14 and now being stuck with a 2 year contract I would have jumped ship and gone with Sprint.\nVerizon is going to have to do a lot of butt kissing to keep me with them when the 2 years is up."
0,"Terrible service! Worst location I've ever been. I had to go to this location in the past, never liked the service. This time I went in and they immediately approached me at the door, first time ever btw, and asked me to leave immediately because I had my dog with me. I had brought the dog with me before. They said it was company policy, I went to another store and guess what....it's not!!!!! Horrible place!!! Considering on dropping them entirely!"
0,"I was toying with the idea of upgrading my iPhone and in the process switching from AT&T to Verizon so that I could bundle the new phone with my iPad. A coworker went to this Verizon store over the weekend and was telling me that she got all these great deals and discounts, along with them buying back her current device and then giving another discount for bundling her iphone with a tablet, etc.  \nI went in 2 days later hoping for the same great deal only to be totally confused by the associates explanation of what my options were, deceived about the difference in the pricing options, not being able to bundle iPhone with iPad for some reason, no discounts/credits, nothing. Not even any incentive to come over from AT&T. Would end up costing me a lot more than what I'm paying for with AT&T. Also their service was slow and they weren't very customer service focused. This guy just wanted me to sign off on whatever and be done. I recommend checking out ALL of your options thoroughly before deciding on switching to Verizon, and definitely before going to this particular branch."
0,"Let me start of by saying I LOVE food, great service, I like to share the enormous portions served in restaurants, drink water with lemon and I do not drink alcoholic beverages.  I know, I scream cheapskate, but I think I deserve a decent 2.5 star experience, at least for the food.  Most places meet or exceed my expectations.  Guiseppes did not. \n\nAnd there comes a time when my youthful, ethnic appearance, water with lemon, request to share, and sober living is met with that \""I am not going to make money off of you\"" vibe from the owner.  It hasn't happened in a very long time, but Guiseppes proved their still is bad service reserved for their unwanted patrons.\n\nI was very excited to eat here seeing it on Diners Driveins and Dives on Food Network, my favorite food network show, and seeing all of the New Times best of awards.  Got there at 8:30pm Friday night, there were people waiting outside, thought it was a good sign.  Now I thought being in a strip mall, next to the water N ice store, the service would be warm and welcoming and the place would be chock full of non-dbags.  I am always cool waiting a bit for good food but being stared down by rich, overweight women with their husbands in flip flops, cargo shorts and Affliction tees and teenage platinum blondes with their smug smiling boyfriends in their flip flops, plaid shorts, and Affliction tees is never my cup of tea.\n\nFast forward 30 minutes of this ish we get seated, another 10 minutes menus, another 10 minutes a water and a watered down gross iced tea which they CHARGED us for even though she took it back and gave him water, and by 9:30pm we get our 15dollar saltysaltysalty bolognese ragu with overcooked spaghetti (we didn't get the homemade pasta) to share, 4dollar baby 1/2 inch thin toastettes, and 2dollar marinara bowl for dipping.   (FYI this is an Italian Restaurant that not only makes you pay for an ounce of bread, they also CHARGE for extra virgin olive oil)\n\nSo go to Guiseppes if you like:\n\n_\""EH\"" Italian Food\n_Cold and dry humor from the owner\n_Slow waitresses\n_Being stared at by stuffy people in such an unlikely, un-stuffy atmosphere\n_Your hopes let down =) Enjoy!"
0,What a joke. We recently moved to this area of Phoenix and thought we would try it one night after seeing the sign that it was on the food network walking out of Sprout's. They charge $3 for bread and it is four small slices of stale french bread. The two pasta dishes had no real sauce or flavor and the prices are ridiculous. \n\nIt was $32 for two pasta dishes and bread. I am so angry right now that I didn't go with my gut feeling and just go to Mamma Mia's. Mamma Mia is similar in price but offers twice the portion and you get the bread for free like a normal Italian Diner. I think this might be the angriest I have ever been after eating dinner out.
0,"Everybody who thinks about coming here should go to the real Giuseppe's, in Scottsdale.\n\nI grew up eating at this location pretty much my whole life. So many great memories of the spot but unfortunately the change in ownership left this place with shoddy food. \n\nEveryone who rates this place above a two, please do yourselves a favor and try the location in Scottsdale (13610 N Scottsdale Rd). The difference is stark."
0,It's gross.  Don't waste your money please!  Hope this helps you!
0,"Mediocre, unsatisfying and barely average!\n\nI joined a friend recently on a Friday night and the entire meal was barely passable. The calamari was uninspired and bland, just sauteed with a thin red sauce and a few frozen peas. Hardly inspiring. The 4 bruschetta were good, with interesting touches like honey and chicken liver, but another tasted like it had plain old strawberry jam on top of mascarpone cheese? \nThe fettucini carbonara was exceptionally bland and lacked the classic ingredients in abundance like it should including peas. Did they end up in the calamari by mistake ?  \n\nThe house recommended fresh tagliatelle with bolognese sauce was sad and uninspired and poorly prepared and presented. Really, as a Chef, I found the dish lacking any depth, including the unseasoned meat sauce (6 different meats in the sauce according to the owner, but still lacking any depth, flavor or significant interest). The sauce was mixed into the noodles already and looked very amateurish and very cafeteria-like. A real disappointment overall.   \n\nThe prices are actually a bit expensive for a strip mall and poor quality. Plastic cups for water, paper napkins for dinner service and piccolo pours of a limited wine selection only added to the lack of value. \n\nWill definitely not return. A disappointing experience that needs attention and correction."
0,"This place was a huge disappointment. After hearing how it had been recognized on the Food Network, I went there with a friend on a Sunday evening and found the food to be mediocre and overpriced. The waiter also tried desperately to get us to purchase wine and sides. I finally relented to an order of garlic bread, and was served plain, stale bread. For this stale bread, we got charged $3. I will not be going back. If you want Italian, Red Devil is a better deal with a nicer atmosphere and better wait staff.. Oh yeah, the bread is good and complimentary."
0,The food here is decent but certainly not worth dealing with the very condescending owner. I'd much rather take my money to a place that appreciates their customers.
0,"I have never written a review before but felt i had to.  This place sucks!  Went here with 3 other friends for dinner.   My osso buco was below average, flavorless, and dry.   We had garlic bread which was 5 pieces of cold, stale french bread drizzled with olive oil and dried oregano.  R u kidding me??  My guests were disappointed with their dishes as well and the dinner was not deserving of such high prices.  Some of it came out cold!   Dinner for 4 of us was WAY overpriced.  Only thing good was desert.  Service was just OK, but he didnt take much time to check on us.  The owner thinks he's a 5 star chef.  Gimme a break dude.  Plastic water cups with these prices??  Go to North, or any other place for that matter.  Sign out front is super tacky.  Guy Fieri must have been stoned when he reviewed this place, or else the quality has sunk.  I believe it was years ago anyways."
0,"I was visiting family and we decided to go out to eat and found this place 5 minutes from my sisters house.  We stood at the front for 15 minutes with no acknowledment from ANY employee (we did show up kind of late so if it was because they were closing soon all they had to do was say so instead of ignoring potential future customers, the restaurant was not packed and there were servers standing inside talking to one another). I also let them know on their Facebook book page and my comment was later deleted. An apology would have been nice along with a \""we hope you would consider giving us a try again\"" instead of just, again, ignoring potential future customers. I'm from Arizona but am not currently living there because my husband is in the air force and is stationed in Idaho. I will not recommend this restaurant to any of our friends or service men heading that way because of their sheer lack of consideration of their patrons. I do not want to lead them to a bad experience when there are plenty of great places to eat in phoenix that do not need the help of a \""as seen on food network\"" sign to attract business. (We ended up at Tomaso's in Phoenix with great customer service and delicious food!)"
0,"\""They don't need your help. You probably waited 5 min and have now wasted more time out of your life. Armed service people?!?\nYea so they can ask for a military discount for not being able to make a real life choice about direction. Take orders as a server , then talk to yelp bout educated disappointments of yours.\"" -CatchM T.\nFirst of all this was my experience at this restaurant and I do not need any \""compliments\"" from anyone telling me that it wasn't. Since you would like to know, I've never been a server because I do not want to be one but I'm sure it's so much more harder than being a \""armed service people\"" (as you like to call them). I do however know a thing or two about customer service  (my review says the servers were standing around talking to one another meaning they could have easily taken the 10 seconds to walk over and say they were no longer taking anymore customers or whatever the reason was). The one thing people in customer service know is the customers pay your bills! Without them you're broke and out of business! That is why It doesn't matter if it's a $2 check or if business is doing so well that you don't need or care for any new customers, you should always treat the last customer just as good, if not better, than the first. I'm also sure people could care less but I can also talk to yelp A bout any educated disappointments I would like."
0,The food has no taste.  I went here for my birthday because we saw it on TV.  I have no idea how anyone can give this place a good rating.  If you like tasty food please go somewhere else.  Not even my 3 year old son liked it.
0,"Doesn't matter how good the may be, if you get bad service, the whole evening is ruined. \n\nThis was a return visit, so we knew about the limited seating. The wait was a half an hour, not something I have patience for but since we were with friends, we stuck it out. \n\nAfter we were finally seated, it was 45 minutes before we were served our entrees and then we got one by itself and the rest of the table had to wait for theirs. It would be understandable if the whole restaurant was slow, but two other tables who came in after us were served before we were. \n\nOur server kept saying \""I'm sorry for the wait\"" as her mantra.  I'm sorry, too, for a very unpleasant experience."
0,"Avoid. Expensive wine list and our waiter pulled a wine scam on me.  The wine list here is ridiculously expensive. I ordered the least expensive bottle of Chianti for $32 ( what they call \""house\"",  and this is not a fancy place) and I got attitude for it!  Our waiter asked: \""Wasn't I sure I wanted the next step up at $38?\"" I did not want to pay more. Even after I accepted the tasting, the wandering owner of the place shot our waiter a look like \""dig Mr. Cheapskate over there...\"" The waiter poured three half glasses from our bottle. Then the waiter took the bottle away. ( Bad sign, in retrospect) When I asked for the rest of the bottle, he said we finished it! I know wine bottles and there were  more than three half glasses in that bottle. I asked if he was sure and he said yes. Rather than create a scene with my party - a buzz kill for sure to argue over this -  I ordered three more glasses  - at an additional $24. The waiter opened a new bottle, poured, and guess what, there was about a half bottle left!  I was not happy! Not happy about the brazen attitude for ordering a $32 bottle or the very short first bottle. I think I was scammed.  Every order should be respected. The food was good, I admit, and reasonably priced but it must act as a lure to soak you on the wine. They do carry out and this would be the only way to enjoy this place, in my opinion.Better yet, try someplace else."
0,"I went to Guiseppe's February 19th with another person.  It was a disappointing dinner.  Water was served in plastic cups and the napkins were paper.  Both dishes we ordered were tasteless -- adding cheese on top did not help.  The dish I ordered was a mushroom \""stew\"" over ravioli dough.  The second time I found myself chewing something very gritty, I called the waitress over and told her the food either had sand or broken glass in it. I gave her a piece of the grit I had taken out of my mouth and, after a long examination by the owner & staff, the owner said he thought it was crystallized sugar.  I think it was dirty mushrooms.  Regardless, I then replaced that dish with pasta fagioli, a little greasy with  90% broth.  Not good. The avocado/tomato salad was delicious.  However, I thought an owner who wanted return business would have comped my meal or, at the least, have offered free coffee or dessert.  Nope!  I will not be back."
0,"Well I held out on writing a review based off my 1st experience,  which was two weeks ago.  I called in a order to carry out.  I ordered shrimp fettuccine Alfredo with fig and marscopone purchtuo burchettas. When I got home it was terrible.  The pasta is home made so it's super thick.  Four small shrimp and hardly no Alfredo sauce, I mean dry. That fake bruccetta is hard and dry.  So I called a spoke to Cindy and explained that I lived far from the location.  It practically took me an hour to get there and I couldn't come back.  So she put the owner in the phone and we worked out a deal that I would get a $27.00 credit the next time I came in. \n\nFast forward to today which was a couple of weeks later. When I arrived Cindy wasn't there but the owner Richard was.  So I explained who I was and he remembered. So he said I can give you a $17.00 credit because you ate the meal didn't you?  I didn't even touch that dry mess. So being pressured and embarrassed of what the phone conversation was and what he was saying to my face and the place was packed and I didn't want to argue.  I just ordered their signature dish, the Osso buco to- go again. So the waiter rang me up and I ended up paying them about $15.00 additional dollars.  I was pissed off. But I figured well maybe it will be worth it.\n\nI get home and make nice salads for me and my husband to accompany the meal still with high hopes because it looks good and the meat is falling off the bone. So we eat it with disappointment.  The sauce is tasteless I mean no flavor at all the bread was dry.\n\nI will never return. I will go to Olive garden which I far better than this place. Or just wait to go back to New York and eat authentic Italian at Carmine's or Rao's in Vegas. Or for great bruccettas go to Postionos.\n\nI don't know why this place is crowded.  The food is bland and it's so tiny.  I have been to several DDD destinations this one is a BIG miss."
0,"We are new neighbors just up the hill in Paradise Valley, and we SO wanted this to be our \""go to\"" dinner place for nights when we were too busy to cook and to take visiting families and friends.   Full disclosure:  we tried four times, each time it was around 8:00 pm. Two of the four we were treated pretty poorly by a female hostess. There were still patrons eating in the restaurant, but she told us they were getting the main dining room set up for a big event the next day (both times) and sat us in the bar. Last night, there was a basketball game on in the bar...I would not mind eating in a pub atmosphere if we were paying pub prices. So, when we told her that the noise was too much and asked to be reseated in the restaurant she refused. I don't think was too much to ask, for just the two of us. And it's interesting the other two times we went, the male hosts gave us the choice, and sat us in the restaurant.  Food has been inconsistent, but not all that bad.  Pasta on two visits was all small pieces (spaghetti one night and fettuccine another) like we were getting the dregs. I'd be more tolerant of that, but for the price of the food, we expect a more pleasant dining experience.   Too bad.  They need to make some changes."
0,"My husband and I found it one Open kitchen. We read the reviews and decided to try it out. We waited 5 minutes before anyone greeted us at the door. The hostess asked us if we wanted the formal dining area or lounge. We chose the lounge. She asked if we wanted a wine list. We said yes. Bread was brought over and that wS the last we saw of anyone for 20 minutes. Finally, I said lets go. My husband went to find the hostess and I guess a manager came and asked if we have been helped. I said no, and he brought someone over. The waiter didn't seem to thrilled to serve us. He had trouble remembering the specials. Not impressed with the service, staff, or food. Won't be going back."

0,"I spend too much of my waking hours at this mixed office/retail space and I pay $75/month for garage parking in a city where parking is usually free so naturally I can't be completely objective about this review.  Generally, it's Outdated, with too many empty suites, and expensive parking.\n\nTake a look at the restaurants that somehow survive or haven't.... Houston's moved across the street, McCormick & Schmicks remains empty, and so does the space that housed a chain steakhouse that anchored one end."

0,"We came in here to have a few drinks before going across the street for dinner. As soon as we sat down at the bar, the bartender (who couldn't speak English very well) comes over. I immediately ask her to relay the happy hour specials. $3.99 house wines, and $2 drafts. My companion has a budlight draft, I choose a house pino grigio. We ended up staying for two rounds. The bartender disapears and we ask the \""manager\"" for the check. After he brings it over we notice that my wine was $10 a glass. After explaining to the \""manager\"" that we came in here for the happy hour. He says he will go ask the \""owner\"" in back. He comes back, shrugs his shoulders and says that there is nothing he can do. Meanwhile the bartender (who can settle this) is still nowhere to be found. I explain to him that I live very close by and usually come here to watch football on sundays, but sadly I will not be returning. He says \""Oh.... let me ask the owner again\"" and walks back. At that point, I had enough. It wasn't about the money. I stood up, left money on the bar and walked out. This place is a joke."

0,Went for a late night meal since Los Cerritos was closed. First time eating at the this location. The following day was filled with throwing up bial and not keeping anything down. Pins and needles in the hands and feet. Nausea and light headed. 90% sure I have food poisoning from this steak egg and cheese burrito with potatoes and beans. Never again.

0,Don't rent unit 242. This is privately owned and not one of the thirty units that currently are for rent from the management company. The landlord will not pay for any maintenance while you are renting from him and he will keep your security deposit regardless of the condition of the apt. I paid two hundred dollars to have the place professionally cleaned. I also filled all the holes in the walls with spackle. He claimed he had to have the walls retextured and was keeping my deposit. The hot water in the unit takes about 15 minutes to get from the community boiler which is located in the front of the complex and never exceeds the temperature of 107 degrees. I moved because the maintenance done by the HOA is very slow and the pool is often green before it can be blue. As witnessed by the review before this. I incurred over 300.00 in plumbing expenses in the two years I was there and the owner refused to pay for any of it. Someone climbed the balcony to the second floor and stole my bike. Your parking space is no where near the unit.
0,Terrible Nasty Trashy Place
0,Worst place I have ever lived. No water half the time. No A/C the other time. The staff is here to make sure they get paid only and do not care about your problems.  I can't wait to move.
0,"This place SUCKS.....joke is on you if you stay here. Only reason we did is because we hosted a customer seminar here the next morning. However, if you like staying in your great-great-great-great grandmothers old time shack you would enjoy it.\n\nWe arrived late (around 9 pm) and the valet guys were pretty good. I don't know if you can self park the car anywhere close. Valet asked my name and spoke into his headset, but after I walked the ten feet to the front desk the clerk had no clue who I was or what I was doing there (basically no clue at all). She couldn't tell me where our event would be (I like to check out the room the night before) or if anything had arrived for us (we shipped some things).\n\nI headed up to the room and it reeked of fresh paint. I was going to call down, but decided I would stop on my way to the fitness center. The itself was AWFUL - could have really used a good cleaning and some new wall paper.....it just looked old and beat-up. Don't ever get suckered into staying in room 827.\n\nHeaded down to front desk and asked if the room was just painted, answer was \""I don't think so\"", and instead of asking if they put me in a new room that was it. Service = Horrible.\n\nThe \""newly remodeled\"" fitness center was weak -- very, very small, limited free weights, tread mills/ellipticals, and old weight machines. It would be a disaster if they had a house full of people who wanted to work out. Might be a nice spot if you were over 100 years old!\n\nHeaded back up to the room and was unimpressed with the shower and bathroom. I would say it was on par with a Super 8.\n\nAlthough breakfast was included in our package, I headed down early to our event. I will say the food for that was great, service was top notch and the coffee cake was so unbelievably good...I also liked the free shoe shine.\n\nNo way would I ever stay at this location or any Ritz for that matter.\n\nTotal - $231.80 (room was 208 for the Schwab rate - including $18 breakfast)"
0,"You, sir, are not a Ritz-Carlton. When I first walked in, it impressed. It had tasteful, old school decor and helpful people at every turn. The problems started when one of the people in our party had his card declined at check-in (not for the room cost because those were already covered, but for the incidentals). I am told that this decline was not his fault and I would certainly believe him as this is not the type of man who runs up his credit cards. Either way, the hotel staff should have asked another one of us for our cards, but for some reason they just stubbornly kept trying to run the same card for 5 minutes. This was while the rest of us waited, twiddling our thumbs. Oh, yes and we were already running late so this was very annoying. Finally, a manager came over and said that they would figure it out later. Well, within 10 minutes when we were finally in our room, here comes a call on the room phone telling us to come down as soon as possible and put a card on file. Ummm, okay. And why couldn't they just ask when we were just down there???? The room did not impress and was in fact so terribly run down that even the marble in the bathroom had rusted in spots and the pipes under the sink were corroded and leaking. Really, supposed \""Ritz-Carlton\""? But here it is, people. Probably the most rude thing that I have ever experienced from a hotel W down to La Quinta: I went to the front desk to ask for a razor and shaving cream. The woman at the desk very helpfully and condescendingly directed me to the tiny gift shop closet where she said they sell it. So, here I was expecting to pay $12 for some crappy bic and a tiny bottle of foam. But no, I guess they were out of them because none was to be found. When I came out of the shop-closet she asked if I found it. I said no, there wasn't any in there. She replied oh, well I will see if room service can bring one to your room. Now, that's odd. When I went to my room, housekeeping was just outside the door. I asked if they might have a shaving kit and the maid rolled her eyes, dug around in her cart and handed me a \""ritz carlton\"" official box with a razor and tube of cream inside. For...real... What terrible, money-grubbing, uncouth service! So, yeah. Perhaps consider staying here if you like to be treated like trailer trash who is not nearly good enough for their moldy, falling apart hotel. But, then again I think there is a W nearby. Paris prices for Arkansas accommodations."
0,We had a ROACH on our wall crawling. We called to have some one spray it took the maintenance 15 mins to get there. We go and spam to the manager he took another 30 mins to come talk to us then told us well I don't know what to tell you the damage is already done. It's dead we can't kill it. Then proceeds to insinuate that maybe we brought it with us or maybe a hitch hiker brought it in. Maybe it was just that we were youbg and blavk he fekt he coukd be so disrespectful. I'm so disgusted with how the  Ritz handled the problem MILAN KOPRIVICA has to be THE WORST manager ever.
0,"Surreal experience at the Ritz this week. My friend is a guest there for the week. We were having breakfast and a server recognized my friend from past visits. I was introduced by first name only to the server. This afternoon I get a \""no caller ID\"" call on my cell and its this server asking me out. I was stunned to say the least. This is supposed to be highly inappropriate for their employees to do. The only way she could have gotten my contact info is to have looked up my friend in their database and seen that I am listed as their contact. My friend met with the hotel management today and they were more accusatory than helpful. We had Thanksgiving brunch scheduled but that is cancelled since the server is working it.and my friend is checking out early. The mgmt told my friend they would contact me and they haven't.\n\nThank you Ritz-C for allowing one of your employees to be a stalker and not giving a shit.\n\nDo yourself a favor folks and stay elsewhere. Like the Biltmore Hotel, Royal Palms, or the Phoenician. They are very close and certainly care more about their guests and reputation than this glorified Motel 6."

0,"Steve is a great guy but the gyros and fries fall short of OK let alone great.  First off the gyros always sliced so thin that it quickly burns and curls on spit when cut. That Would put you out of business in Chicago. Next the toppings are weak and need to be improved. The pita is ok but not worthy of my mouth or money. Now the fries, come on guys these fries are greasy and no flavor Steve turn the temp on the fryer to 350 and they will fry properly.  Stop giving us greasy fries they suck buddy.  Gyros needs to be flavorful and juicy you know that, but many places here have no idea how to make that happen.  I wish I could have a gyros like central gyros or costas gyros back home. Your sauce is good but that's just not enough to earn more stars.  I will submit this to the AZ papers as well maybe just selling the business would be best.  The gyros here should be free.  Come Steve better gyros for all is needed.  I mean dry and burnt just doesn't work man. I will be watching this place and informing others if things improve.  Peace."
0,"Not impressed. My coworker and I were waiting for a movie across the street and decided to try and beat the heat by getting some ice cream. I have allergies to soy so I have to be very careful about what I eat as it is in *everything* these days. There were two gentlemen in the store one dark haired and kinda sullen looking,  the other heavy set. I failed to get their names as I was quickly put out by our experience and just wanted to leave. \nThe heavy set guy was busy with a customer so we asked the dark haired one if there was nutritional information available and politely explained I had allergies and had to be aware of everything I eat. He looked at us blankly and kind of put out sounding responded \""I have it in a book.\"" There was a pause as he just stood there staring like we were some sort of circus oddity. Finally, my coworker politely asked if we could see the book. Without saying anything and with a slight roll of his eyes he turned, grabbed the book and shoved it in my face kinda rudely. I took it from him and turned away from him because it was clear he had some sort of problem. I remarked to my coworker \""Friendly... Love that\"" because he clearly was not.\nPerhaps he despised his low paying job. Perhaps he thought we looked too low class to be in his presence. Perhaps he was having a bad day. Perhaps he was just a jerk. Whatever the case, his unfriendliness and and our unwelcome  were palpable. I flipped absentely through the book but quickly decided I really had a problem giving money to a store who had employees that seemed to think openly treating customers with disrespect was okay . Handing the book back to the employee in question, I smiled and said thank you as we left. As if this wasn't enough, as we were leaving I noted that he never took his eyes off of us and even kind of elbowed his co worker and started making some sort of comment while staring us down through the window of the store as we left. They chuckled amongst themselves if full view of us as I watched. They seemed not to care that I could see their every move. \nWhen I called back after we left and asked to speak to a manager, at first I was put on hold while whoever answered said they would go get the manager. A couple seconds later, the same person came back and said, \""Oh I'm sorry. She's not here.\"" He then informed me he had no idea when she would be back in. \nCall me crazy, but I find it hard to believe in a store of that size one could be unaware their manager was no longer in the store and further could not give me any sort of estimation of when she was expected except to say she was \""usually\"" around in the morning. \nAt any rate, I have scarcely been treated so rudely in a customer service environment ever. So, to the manager, whoever you may be, I would suggest you inform your employee he should endeavor to adjust his attitude towards paying customers if he intends to continue working with the public. Honestly, I really don't care what his problem was. Not my issue. I couldn't care any less what he thought of me or my coworker. However, I steadfastly refuse to give my hard earned money to a store which allows this kind of blatantly unacceptable behavior from one of its employees. Next time, I'll just find a Ben and Jerry's or simply endure the heat without aid."
0,"OMG! what the heck happened to this place? It hasn't even been more than a year since I was there last, and it has totally gone down the drain. the ladies restroom was worse than a truck stop restroom. I've driven coast to coast 4 times, and from CA to AZ a plethora of times and have never been in a bathroom as sick as theres was. Worse part about it was the managers rude reaction. I pointed out the fact that the toilet paper was all wet, making it impossible for anyone to use it and all he did was pile up rolls on the top of the toilet. He didn't even bother asking anyone to clean up the paper droppings; being that the toilet paper was coming off in chunks there must have been at least 20 pieces of toilet paper all over the floor. \n\nI guess that is why the place was dead at midnight on a Friday. The over priced drinks, the horrible toilet paper and the bartender tossing ice all over the bar each time he poured a drink might also have something to do with it. \n\nI'm just saddened that with the influx of new businesses going in across the street, improving the area, this place is going straight downhill. The manager Sunny was a smart A-S when I brought the restroom issue to his attention as well. Guess I shouldn't have expected anything more, especially when the first thing you walk through when you arrive at this bar is a cigarette cloud; as you have to go out front to smoke. \n\nThis used to be my favorite spot, but alas the times are a changing!"
0,"I really hate to do this, because I have been a fan of the Merc Bar for years, but its a must.  My fiance & I were looking for a place to entertain our wedding party the weekend before our wedding and it was clear to us that the Merc Bar would be the perfect place.  We love the atmpsphere.  It usually has a nice & mature crowd.  The service is usually good.  It was perfect.  \n\nUnfortunately, it was the management and not the lounge that ruined our perspective of the venue.  The manager (Tommy) was slow/nearly impossible to reach and even harder to get info out of.....i.e. Whats your process for group reservations. \n\nHe seemed annoyed that I conntact him and unwilling to make time for us.  After several incomplete emails he finally called me, at my request, but it became clear, after 5 mins on the phone, that he did not want our business.  It was also apparent that he lacked basic customer service skills.\n\nSince, the goal of the evening is relax & enjoy our time with our friends, not to worry about bad service, we took our covo with Tommy as a hint that the Merc Bar would not be a good fit.  We need a place with a more mature management staff.....so, we're going with the Montelucia.  Its a nice upscale resort, with an awesome spa, a very nice lounge & live music on Saturday night, a great pool & nice rooms.   Truly perfect."
0,"hours posted are wrong. arrived here at 4:45 today, opened door and was greeted by a woman telling me they didn't open until 5:30. well as of now posted hours here are from 4. I get that hours change and not all media gets updated, but their doors were open and their hours reported as such. No offer to be seated and offered a drink anyway or even an incentive to return during new business hours. just a simple we are closed until 5:30 and an escort out.  I repeat, hours posted on this site as of writing this review reflect my attempted patronage. lock your door or update online info or be courteous. there were only 2 of us, and not even a question if there would be more which there wasn't. never been here before. probably will not try again thanks to this experience"
0,"Waitress good, bartender slow... Could have a few more drinks but.... Could not order since bar backed up. Need more staff on the floor. Oh and this little gem! (manager did make right but I pointed it out), drinks were not consistent in volume. \n\nMoscow Mule in copper cup was 30-40% bigger than in a glass. Because we were having those we ended up with multiples in glass since they ran out of copper mugs. We did the water test (pour from glass to copper mug) and was 30-40% LESS! Pointed this our to the manager (Adam) he said he was aware but disputed the 30-40% claim, said maybe closer to 20%! WOW, don't admit that! . I told him to head over to the table and we will show you. My issue is this, HE KNEW IT! The price is the same, but you are getting less. I told him that the house wins every time in this situation. Less Drinks, Same Price! Did, I mention HE KNEW THIS! With a $300+ tab, he comped 3 Drinks ($36). He attempted to right a wrong, but only after I made a big deal about it. Thanks for the 3% comp on my 30-4-% less drink! Great decor, waitress was great, but based on the inconsitance of the amount you are paying for...WILL NOT BE BACK"
0,"Don't let this place fool you. To keep the story short the server, Erica, said there was no merlot. Okay. Ordered a couple Malbecs ($8 each) instead. When we got the bill she charged the order as both Merlots ($10 each).  She never told us she had it on stock. It was more like...surprise! Let's charge them more bc either the server is thinking a) I don't know what they ordered or b) I'm gonna charge more so I can get a bigger tip. For that we gave her $3 for lying to us!! Btw def didn't taste like a merlot.  Checked my credit card charges for 2 separate receipts few days later. The server gave herself more than 20% tip when I clearly put zero on one and $3 on another receipt for 3 drinks -- purposely!!! She doesn't deserve it! \n\nCalled the manager a few days later and short story was the manager, Adam was trying to sound professional but totally sounded annoyed. Yes it's only a few dollars but the whole principle behind their service was shady to say the least. Adam said he would call back a couple days later. Nope!! One week went by and no one called me back. So guess what? I called back. Spoke with another manager, Francisco. He told me that Adam said it was an INCONVENIENCE for him to reverse the charges and that it will cost them!!!! Hahahahahaha really??!!?? You have to be kidding me! What kind of service is this!?? They're worried about a few dollars rather than their reputation??? Wow!! That really says a lot about them. He told me the only way to get credit back is to come back for a free drink. How about NO!! Why would I go back to a place that is shady? Anyway he said Adam will call me back. We will see about that. Maybe they will when they see this. \n\nAlso I agree with the other reviews from Rick and Rich. Going cheap on the Moscow mule by serving it in a smaller glass. Classic."
0,"Beautiful place, nice ambiance. Ok drinks. Music could be better. The waitress was dressed very provocatively (large breasts falling out of the top of her dress- showing her panties each time she bent over- which was often)- it appeared that many ladies on dates felt uncomfortable, arms crossed immediately with the men looking at the ground... Probably more uncomfortable for the guys really- because one wrong glance or blink and that date is over! \n\nIf this is the vibe Merc Bar is going for then... well done I guess.  I will say, it is awkward when a girls large boobs are coming out of her top and she keeps bending down with her chest in your date's face... kudos to her for being an attractive young lady, but it's a bit much when it makes the guests uncomfortable. \n\nAlso,  as one woman left her table to use the restroom, I watched the waitress flirt and stroke her husband's arm up and down as she gave him the check... I have a feeling if the wife saw that.... well, I'm happy she didn't, because you just don't know how people are gonna react to that disrespectful, intrusive behavior. It knocked the place down a couple notches- not quite Hooters vibe or strip club lounge- Maybe Champagne room? I really did wonder if I got up to use the restroom, would this girl come over to feel my guy up too? I didn't like that one bit. It wasn't a good feeling to have out with your significant other- and unfortunately, this is the memory I so strongly took away. Then again, it was also interesting watching the guy that somehow ended up on a date with a transexual squirm in the corner as she insisted on playing with his hair and trying to kiss on his neck... That must have been an internet date, lol!\n\nAlso, regarding the service, each time we would ask questions about the drinks the waitress would have to go ask the bartender. It's a specialty cocktail lounge- we aren't liquor micro-biologists asking for a chemical analysis of their concoctions- just regular basic questions. It would have been nice if she would have had some level of knowledge and training- given the niche and price points. \\ \n\nAll in all- I remember when this place was hot, back in the day- when I don't think I was even old enough to drink. It's still a nice place, but there are so many more options in this town now. Urbanity in Phoenix is progressing- gotta keep up with the times Merc Bar. When my barista knowns more about the soymilk in my Latte than this chick knows about a fresh squeezed lemon in a cocktail we have an issue. \n\nAs for the drinks... They were okay. I wasn't blown away by the choices. We ended up going to Sidebar afterwards- I love their muddled blueberrry whiskey sour- house made. Delicious! The drinks were better at Sidebar and the vibe was a little more modern less stripclub/2001 Scottsdale nightclub.\n\nSorry Merc."
0,"Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my \""plastic money\"" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???  \n\nThe customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying. \n\nNeedless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores..."
0,"This store has set hideous customer service standards! I was lied to about their return policy by an employee and screwed over! They gave me the run around when I asked to speak to a manager...she was conveniently never present and was the \""only one who could help me.\"" When giving me the final verdict on my issue, she cowardly had her employees do it for her on the phone (of course not face to face) and could not even call me herself. I highly recommend taking your business to a different pet boutique where quality service matters!"
0,"Just because you have the word Plantation, implying old Southern American charm, in your name doesn't mean you can't provide modern services like clean restrooms? Perhaps you could sweep the floor. And wipe down the counter. Oh, I know, maybe the pigeon poo could be scraped off the tables. I know. I know. I'm asking so much. And you'd think with a sort of Southern American name, you'd have that Blanche Deveroe, drawl and all, southern service, friendly and warm, like a peach cobbler on an autumn afternoon. Sadly, no. If I were to go again, I shall bring my Dustbuster, Lysol and my Miss Manner Guide to Etiquette book (yes, I do have one, quit laughing Kristin and Stevey P.) Rants aside, the coffee was passable. Although the coffee station was messier than the Circle K near the airport. It looked as a group of overly caffenited monkeys had just used it. And the croissant. Was like a pastry boomerang. And yes, when I threw it, sadly, it came back to me!  I have better Pillsbury products in my fridge. Coffee Plantation. Ya'll don't come back now, ya hear!!"

0,"While this CPK is largely like the others, it does have one thing to distinguish it: really terrible service. \n\nI was here for lunch the other day and noticed they have lunch specials where you get a soup or salad and one of a selected number of small pizzas. I ordered one but asked if I could substitute the soup offered for another kind of soup that was on the menu. I told the waitress that I had noted that the soup I wished to substitute cost $0.50 more and that I would gladly pay the additional charge.\n\nShe said she could not do that. No substitutions.\n\nSo, I asked \""why?\"" esp. as I was willing to pay the difference.\n\nHer reply (it's a classic): I might tell other people.\n\nHuh? What? I might tell other people I got what I wanted? That CPK allowed substitutions? That they, too, could get what they want at CPK?And does she really think I have long ranging discussions about my lunch soup choices?\n\nI tried to argue my point, but, quickly, realized that there is no arguing with that sort of unassailable logic.\n\nYep, I might tell other people."
0,Are you serious!!! Stop putting sugar in the gravy!!!! Cali can't do pizza!!!! Nasty!!
0,I can't actually rate the food because we left before it got that far. \n\nDrinks and service were horriable - not to mention the fact that it was like 100 degrees in there. Ohh and they  seem to have worked very hard in the design to  fit the absolute max amount of people per square foot with zero regard for comfort. There are tables jammed into every possible space.
0,"I used their catering services for a corporate training we were holding in our office. It was supposed to be delivered at noon. At 11:55, I received a call letting me know they were running a \""few minutes\"" behind. Fast forward 35 minutes later, I am sitting on hold with them for 10 minutes trying to find out where our food is. The gal on the phone was rude and acted like I was out of line by asking where it might be.\n\nI guess I just assumed a chain as large as CPK would have their act together when it comes to these things. Instead they didn't offer an apology or ANYTHING. We definitely won't be using them for corporate catering again, or anything else for that matter."
0,"TERRIBLE!!!!   The new \""hand-tossed\"" christ sucks!!!!  We will never order pizza from here again!  The mac and cheese was good though"
0,"The food is delicious here, but the experience always varies. Whenever I get a good waitress, the experience is excellent along with the food. The problem is that having a good waitress isn't something I can count on. The most recent experience I had was with a waitress named Courtney. She was very direct and wasn't pleasant at all. I ordered a soup with the edges of the bowl near the soup being dirty. I gave the soup back and she didn't apologize. Then she returns with a a new soup but in a much smaller bowl (it was still a little dirty). It was disappointing. The rest of my lunch was very uncomfortable and unenjoyable afterwards. \n\nI'm tired of coming here and having bad experiences like this. I will not be coming anymore because I can easily go to other restaurants and get the full package of excellent service and great food ALL the time. This service is too inconsistent. California Pizza Kitchen really needs to reconsider who they hire for these jobs because it degrades the experience and enjoyment of a well-known restaurant that should be held to high standards."
0,"The food was great, although my only complaint against this location is our server named Courtney was extremely rude and only showed any friendliness towards my friend and I because the manager was in the building. First time at a California Pizza Kitchen but the worst service I've had in my life from a waiter/waitress."
0,"I would not recommend taking your pet to this hospital. My dog went in for ACL repair and died. Dr. Ferrera called after the surgery to tell me my dog was fine and everything was great. I could pick her up in a few hours.\nAn hour and a half later he called back to say my dog had stopped breathing and he brought her back but she now had brain damage and would never be the same if in fact she pulled through.\nAfter seeing my dog it was clear I would have to put her down. I was told they would call me when they had her ashes back in about a week.\nTwo weeks later and with no call I went in only to be treated with absolutely no compassion what so ever. The girl at the front desk acted like see had never seen me before even though I have been going there for 12 years. She then went to the back and brought out a little black container which she plopped on the counter and said, \""here you go have a nice day.\""\nI will never step foot in that place again."
0,"I took my Bassett hound in on Wednesday 11/7/12 she has something wrong with her left eye looked greyish. They did no testing and gave her drops for possibly being bitten, by Saturday morning the eye was almost completely grey and I took her back the doctor came in didn't even look into her eyes and said it has to be Valley Fever and needed to do blood work but started treatment on Saturday and would call when the results came in. She acted like I was wasting her time by asking questions about Valley Fever. I just moved to Arizona and had never heard of it. So we did blood work and more medicine and off we go. By Tuesday afternoon I get the call saying quit giving her the pills for Valley Fever and take her to the Eye dr for animals it must be glaucoma and they can't help. So, after $300.00 with them and another $300.00 for the eye dr YES she does have glaucoma and is blind in the eye  I believe they possibly could have saved her sight if she had been diagnosis properly"
0,"I took my sixteen year old  Scottie in because he had stopped eating and drinking and was very, very ill.  I had called the night before to tell them that if he lived through the night, I would be bringing him in.  He was in total distress and clinging to life.  \nI was put in a room, where I was told to wait for an unknown time.  My dog was gasping for air.  I asked that he be viewed as the emergency,  that he was.  I was told again to sit down and wait.  I waited for a few more minutes and then walked out!  I went straight to Orangewood Pet Hospital where I was immediately taken care of and where blood work done. It was obvious that my dog needed to be put to sleep.  The experience was as good as any experience of that nature could be.  I am disgusted with the clinical, uncaring atmosphere of Squaw Peak Animal Hospital."
0,"DO NOT GO TO THIS CLINIC! My dog died as a result of negligence by both Dr. Ferrara and Dr. Clinton. I filed a claim with the veterinary board in September and after a lengthy process they finally made their decision yesterday. The findings were \""medical incompetence, failure to communicate professionally and a minor records violation\"" against Dr. Ferrara, who was my vet but I saw Dr. Clinton on several occassions when he was not available. The board also decided to file a claim against Dr. Clinton based on both of their testimonies. My dog was diagnosed as diabetic Memorial Day weekend and was dead right after Labor Day. I went in almost every week to get his blood tested and it wasn't until I finally took him to another vet that I found out how many basic things these two vets didn't check which could have been easily solved. He was so sick that as a result we had to put him to sleep. \n\nThe board won't decide their sanctions until the next meeting late January - and I understand he does have 30 days to appeal but I don't think he would be successful after the unanimous votes of the board."

Dr Clinton refused to see her patient because it was \""too close to closing time\"".  Dr. Clinton never made a referral, told me to go to the ER or made any indication that she believed me let alone cared.  She downplayed the severity of the situation and after the 25th seizure I rushed her to Phoenix Emergency and got her competent care and treatment.  I told Dr. Clinton the following that my puppy was in the hospital and she made every excuse imaginable why she did't see the patient, make any referral, send her to the ER and why she never even looked at the patient chart.  Dr. Clinton promised to follow up with me two days later and she NEVER called me to ask how her patient was doing let alone take responsibility for some of the bills that she promised to pay due to her incompetence!  I also left message for Dr. Ferarra to call me with my phone number and he NEVER called me back either! If you are looking for vets that actually care about their patients, this is not the place for you or your beloved pet!"

0,"\""Hey, Kerstin! Why are you eating a grilled cheese for dinner? Didn't you just eat out?\""\n\n\""Yeah, but we ate at Miracle Mile.\""\n\n'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.\n\nI got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager \""saved\"" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. \""Why don't you like caraway?\"" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, \""I really don't like the taste.\"" When she asked me \""Why?\"" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the \""sauce\"" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that \""real\"" texture. Foul, foul, foul. \n\nHence, the grilled cheese."

0,"Dear Miracle Mile,\n\nThis is the last time you will ever sucker another $15 bucks from me for bland, over-salted cafeteria food. I hate to be the rabid cur of dissent in this love fest, but I can no longer fake it and go with the flow. I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.\n\nUnless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so? Because every NY staple I've tried from your fetid excuse for a deli has sucked so effing hard it just about pulls grey matter out through my ears. \n\nStale and mealy defrosted cheesecake that was as unappetizing to look at as to consume. Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.\n\nAnd then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich. If it weren't for the spicy mustard at each table, I'd hardly have tasted anything at all! Bravo! You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix! \n\nAlthough I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. \""Next? Bread?\"" Unappetizing slop of meat, slid down the line to the next guy. \""Fries?\"" Heap of fried garbage, liberally applied, slid down the line. That is, unless you're asking for something outside of the crap-sandwich-and-fries box. At that point your request will be wordlessly acquiesced to with a scowl and a slop. \""Drink?\"" No! Please! NO! Just get me out of this slovenly pit of cafeteria hell. What do you want, I'll pay anything! Anything!\n\nWait a tic. That's your whole ploy all along, isn't it Miracle Mile? Brainwash the masses with mediocre food and overcharge for everything to make it seem like it's a privilege to be dining upon such slop.\n\nWell I'm on to you. I've given you plenty of chances, Mile. Your Reuben was the only sandwich that didn't make me want to violently upend tacky cafeteria tables on the way to my car. \n\nWishing you the bland, inoffensive dreams of an automaton,\nErica"

Alas, that was not to be.\n\nAlthough I came inside in the mood for pastrami, watching the staff throw together - and I mean that quite literally, I've never seen anybody, anywhere make a sandwich as quickly or carelessly - I lost my nerve and ordered the meat loaf special, thinking that was probably a better way to go in a place like this.\n\nUnfortunately the meat loaf was dreadful as were the mashed potatoes.  Absolutely devoid of any flavor and covered in a gloppy gravy.  Seriously awful.\n\nI see that one reviewer described it as hospital food.  That's being charitable because some hospitals actually have edible food.  It's more like what I imagine prison food to be like. \n\nIt's also not particularly cheap.

0,"Before I jump into this review, let me just preface it by saying that I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Jersey Mike's and Yogurtland excluded). And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants. \n\nRight off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once. \n\nI ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta. \n\nWhen the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. And if you happen to be looking for dinner at the Biltmore, I would suggest you stop ANYWHERE else."
0,"I know alot of people seem to like this place,but you wont see me going there again.We had some friends in from Boston,and they wanted to eat somewhere that wasnt very fancy,so we picked Cheesecake factory.You should know that our groupd consisted of our 2 friends,my husband,my 4 yr old son and my 2 yr old son,and myslef who was 9 months preggers at the time.\n               When we got there,it was extremely crowded,we gave them our name and they said 10 minutes tops.Well 40 minutes later we were finally seated.The waitress was nice but stuffed us in to a very small booth.She was slow bringing our drinks and our apps,and only refilled our drinks once.\n           All of this could have been forgiven if the food was good.My husband and friend Tim ordered the steak both medium rare,what they got was a piece of meat smaller than the palm of my hand fully cooked.I ordered the Philly Cheese sandwhich,it had no flavor and tasted like it just came out of the microwave.Ive bought better at Wal-Mart.I ordered two kids chicken finger dinners for my boys but they only brought out 1 and when I told the waitress,she insisted that I only said one and that maybe the boys should share because the kitchen was really busy.\n                    I will never go to this restaurant again,bad service,horrible food,and not a good value at all."
0,"The last time will be the last time. \nYesterday at CF, waiter was passable. He did not offer to bring a glass with the beer, and did not do so until asked. \nFood and drinks were good. \nHowever, at end of meal a waitress from another table dropped/spilled a tray of drinks on the left side of my husband who is in a wheelchair with electric wheels. Husband's left side including wheels and batteries were drenched. Waitress did not initially apologize but stated, \""It's just a spill.\"" We asked several times for a wet cloth to wipe off sticky soda from husband, shirt, wheelchair and wheels. We moved to the next table to finish meal and to get out of the large puddle. \nThe manager came over after several minutes and offered to pay for dry cleaning; then the waitress said she was sorry. No comp, no apology until we cleaned up ourselves. \n\nEven worse; two years ago a waiter dropped a tray of drinks on my son at the same place,and another customer who was sitting at a table next to us was also drenched. \nThis was weird deja vu.  \n\nMaybe CF has a policy that waitstaff have to carry as many drinks as possible, and they don't know their limit until they exceed it. Ha. \nOverall, food was good and service was sub par. Attitude was LOUSY! \nThe customer who is paying about $25.00 per person ought to be treated as a guest and with courtesy. \n\nBetter luck when seated at the bar, on past visits. No spillage."
0,"Normally I would never pick to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, ever, but a co-worker picked it for a work function, so off we went. \n\nThere were about 10 of us in our group, and before we ordered we apologized to our waitress for needing separate checks. I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first. \n\nI have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue. \n\nThe other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side. \n\nWell, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless. \n\nAs for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much. I hope for the rest of my life I never step foot in one again. I know I won't be missing much."
0,This location is a hot mess.  I love the Cheese Cake Factory but this locaton is not up to the standards that I accustomed to from this company.  Choose another location The waitress smelled like a pack of cigarettes.  So standing over me taking my order made my stomach turn.  Then my rice was undercooked.  When I told them it was undercooked they wanted to question me and say are you sure.  Im Asian I eat rice almost everyday.  There were Nat's flying around the food.  I won't be back to this location.
0,"$7 per slice for a Cheesecake? Okay that's understandable for being at the most expensive commercial real estate on 24st & Camelback in Phoenix. \n\nWhat is not excusable is the Moroccan Chicken. The only reason I got in my car a blew $30 on a meal on take out, is because of a video showing how delicious it was. What I got from this location was nothing short of horrible. It looked nothing like what I saw in the video, and on top of that the chicken was so dry I had to chase it down with water just to swallow it. It did not matter that they were generous, giving 3 breasts with the meal, because I could not finish even one. Since I hate wasting food I gave it to my 3 cats, but they would not even eat it, and they love chicken!\n\nI would not have even written this review because I hate bashing businesses, but this place refused to answer my email complaint about the bad meal. At least answer and acknowledge you read it. Next time I'll just go down the road to Chili's. At least they try.."
0,"I recently moved to Phoenix from Las Vegas. I live across from Cheesecake Factory on Camelback Rd. I was hungry one night and stopped in for a quick bite on December 4th. I've always enjoyed their pineapple Mojitos  and the menu variety . I sat at a small table in the bar area. It was literally 5 mins before I was even acknowledged (I timed it)! Then menus were haphazardly dropped on the table. I wasn't offered water and warm bread came out 5 mins later. Meanwhile, the servers were congregating, laughing and joking in the back station, which was clearly visible from my table. I finally ordered a chicken Marsala and that took another 20 mins (I also timed that), to which I jokingly replied to my server (a young, bald AfricanAmerican server with large diamond earrings) \""I thought that you forgot about me?\"" His curt reply was \""It's gotta cook!\""....I probably won't go back to Cheesecake Factory based on this last visit, even though it is across from where I live, even if I am craving a pineapple Mojito. I am discovering that there are many other options in close proximity to me.....You NEVER know who your customers are! I've been in the restaurant business for over 30 years in New York, Paris and Las Vegas and have moved to PHX, to live and open a restaurant here....Oh, yeah, and I happen to be one of the Top Chefs in America:-)\n\nHerb"
0,"Tonight my fianc\u00e9 and I took my parents to Cheesecake Factory to catch up over a slice of cheesecake and a cup of coffee (it was 5:30PM) We got our coffees right away, but had to ask for water twice. After about 30 minutes we had asked for our check and a box from our waitress. 20-25 minutes went by and we asked again, she said \""I'll be right back.\"" Another 20 minutes goes by and we tracked down the manager. He apologized and said he would have the check right out to us. At 7:30, an hour and a half AFTER we asked for our check the first time, we had to walk up to the front, wait in line, and ask the manager AGAIN for our check. He apologized and brought it right out. Instead of offering to comp the meal, or ANYTHING, he took the coffee off. Really? Oh thank you for saving me $2.95. I waited an hour and a half to pay you guys. Needless to say, we left a $0 tip. Never going back to this Cheesecake Factory again. Also, we never got our boxes for our leftover cheesecake."
0,This place is not there anymore.
0,My mom drove me all the way over there yesterday and it wasn't there.  We should have checked Yelp first.  I looked on their website and it looks like there aren't any in Arizona anymore. My mom was very disappointed.
0,"Time for another riveting review for all my fellow Arizonians!\n\nLet's start by saying I have had dental issues for many years and in that time have seen MANY dentists!\n\nWhen the time finally came to have some serious dental work done  I chose Artistic Dental as I have seen his work on 2 people and was impressed with their results.\n\nBoth of these people had many teeth extracted and partials and or full plates done.\n\nI do realize it is a lab that makes them not the office\n\nI am very nervous going to dentists simply because I know the pain they are capable of inflicting, \n\nWhen I met Dr Daugherty I found him to be friendly and comforting.  The staff was wonderful and did everything they could to relieve my anxiety!\n\nWe came up with a game plan and part of that was to remove some teeth.\n\nLet's talk prices for a moment.. \n\nKeep in mind the office is in the Biltmore area...need I say more?  \n\nLocation and cost does not guarantee better work.\n\nThey are more expensive than any dentist I have seen but....they say you get what you pay for and my smile is very important to me.\n\nI decided to let him do my top teeth and if the results were positive I would let him do the bottoms.\n\nIt was several weeks before I was to start the work and I had a terrible toothache so I went in and  told Dr Dougherty which tooth was hurting and requested he pull it and that would make one less to be pulled in a few weeks.\n\nWhen he was done I looked in the mirror and was horrified to find he pulled the WRONG tooth!\n\nBecause of this I was embarrassed to smile in fear my big gap would be seen since the tooth was toward the front.\n\nAlthough the Doctor apologized I had lost my faith in him and was now petrified to have the remaining work done...\n\nWhen the time came I put on my \""big girl pants\"" and went back for the other extractions .  I made it clear how nervous I was and Dr Dougherty assured me he would be gentle and I wouldn't feel any real pain......HE WAS WRONG !\n\nSo  what would have happened if he told me the truth?  I now felt lied to ... So let's add things up to this point:\n\nHe pulled the wrong tooth\n\nHe lied to me\n\nHis prices are exsorborant \n\nMoving on... When I paid for the top work I had given them the full amount to cover top and bottom from the estimates they gave me... Although the estimates seemed to keep changing! \n\nThe top teeth, although beautiful simply did not fit right... Even after the alignment ... and the only way to fix it would be to drive the 28 miles each way to his office and leave iit with him and make the same drive back to get them with no guarantees .\n\nI decided to just deal with them and find a new dentist.  \n\nAfter my experience I put the dentist off for over a year and found a wonderful new dentist close to my house\n\nWhen I told this new dentist of my anxiety he was HONEST with me and said there may be some pain for a very short time during injections but they would do their best to distract me.\n\nWhat do ya know... Honesty... And it didn't kill either of us in fact I trusted him completely after that \n\nAt Artistic dental AFTER insurance I would be responsible for appox $1800.00!!!!!!\n\nMy new dentist did the same work for $725.00 after insurance!!  Saving me $1075.00!!!\n\nI called Artisic dental and told them I would like the $800.00 approximate  money they were holding sent back to me so I could get the work done.\n\nI also requested a refund of the \""alignment\"" since it didn't correct the problem. I was told they would speak with Dr and call back\n\nI got a call back and surprise surprise it seems they had a bookkeeping error almost 2 years ago and never billed something therefore they only owe me appox $300.00\n\nEXCUSE ME....WHAT? !\n\nI asked her why they are just finding this error now and why they have had my money for almost 2 years and never bothered to call and ask if I wanted it or if I was ever going to come in again.\n\nI told her that was unacceptable and their error from long ago just won't cut it nor should I be held responsible \n\nI had mentioned to her it would cost me $ 725.00. to have work done and I agreed to accept that and put this experience in the past .. Until.... Yesterday.\n\nI was with my friend who had her work done at Artistic Dental and she also told me of her \"" BILLING ERRORS\"" she had with their office and that is why she has not been back.\n\nIf you are looking to whiten your teeth or do cosmetic work I am sure Artistic will work for you.... But I would think twice about letting them do any serious work. \n\nMy last words of advise are.... Check their billing!!! Make sure they are billing your insurance only once and that you are getting the credits!\n\n\nOn that note I will say...\n\nLive each day as though it were your last and.... ENJOY!"
0,Thank you for all the emails you sent me on my review! I was surprised at how many responses I recieved from people searching for the right dentist..\nI shared my new dentist information and even got some movie tickets from my dentist for the referrals!\nI find it funny how since I wrote this review how many people have reviewed with 5 stars... They must have a lot of friends and family! \nI hope everyone reads my review and picks the right dentist for your needs!\nHappy Holidays
0,"Most definitely the dirtiest Chili's I've ever experienced, inside and outside. The patio had cigarette butts, a dirty ash tray filled with water from the misters, bits of trash strewn about. Inside tables were left dirty, the bathroom was filthy too.\n\nMy food was cold and dried out like it had been made for someone earlier and then left under the warming lights.\n\nBecause I was in polite company and we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't sent it back.\n\nI am quite shocked that I didn't get sick after eating there.\n\nBoth the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit."
0,This place is gross. They did an okay job but the whole place smelled horrible and looked really dirty! \n\nI don't know why the reviews are so high except for these people must have never gone to a clean nail salon!

0,"RUDE AND HASTY. I always base whether or not to get a full set/manicure by the way they care for my feet.  I was greeted and promised \""10 more minutes.\"" I sat and soaked for 15 min before a man who looked like he just built a house (dirty white shirt and dirty nails) start my pedicure.  Long story short, the shape of my nails were crooked,  he forgot to put lotion on my feet and talked sh*t about me in Vietnamese the WHOLE TIME about me being too picky while the entire staff made bets on whether or not if I was going to leave a tip.\nI paid and left the man a tip anyway. \n\nI've never been so appalled,  humiliated and dissatisfied with a service. \nI asked for the manager and there was no manager avail."
0,"This place is horrible.  The sandwhich/paninis can be summarized as follows.  They take some french bread, put maybe a slice of meat or two on it, but no more, and toast it.  They have absolutely no meat on them.  You will leave hungry, along with lunch taking a bite out of your pocket book.  Pricey and bad service.  I have eaten here 3 times, as I used to work in the vicinity, and every time I had absolutely horrible service.  I always have to get up and ask for napkins, refills, silverware, whatever it may be.  Also, there pastry selection is always inconsistent.  I have also had several of their muffins.  They are ok, but not anything special.\n\nI would not recommend this place and certainly will not go back."
0,"OVERPRICED AND OVERRATED!!!!\n\nI cannot believe how much money I spent here for two sandwiches and two sodas.  $25.46\n\nThe mozzerlla panini had tasteless tomatoes, the thinnest slice of procutto that had a large peice of fat in it causing me to nearly gag.  Plesto sauce was okay.\n\nThe roast beef sandwhich was a huge dissappointement.  Two thick slices of overdone beef, two thick slices of cheese and a tasteless tomatoe with the top hard vine connector still attached (who wants to eat that?).  When I say thick, I mean, 1/6 thick but did not cover from side to side of the bread.  \n\nThese sandwhiches were $9.50 each!!!!\n\nWe got one with pasta salad (corkscrew pasta and a dressing, no veggies or color) and a green salad (lettuce and dressing, nothing else).\n\nWe also got two diet cokes.  In a can!!!!  For $2.25 each!!  They did'nt offer a glass, ice and straw which in my oppinion might account for the upcharge, but no, nothing, niet.\n\nThis place might be okay if you are in the area, at the building working or visiting someone, but we drove from Ahwatukee.  So not worth it.  Do not drive to this place.  Do not go out of your way for this place."
0,"So let me preface this one star with the fact that we never did eat here. The reason is because despite the fact that the website says they close at 9:30 on Saturday, they actually were closed by 8:00 when we went there....TWICE! Note to Au Petit Four, this is 2011 and either update your website or inform people if you close early because it is slow. We drove from Southern Scottsdale to Arcadia and it was a waste of time. Also, waste of groupon money!"
0,"Review 2/5/12\nWe were searching for a place to end the night with dessert.  We found Au Petit Four on Yelp and their were .4 miles from where we were.  COOL!  And we had their desserts before at the Esplanda location, so we know the the stuff is good.  Parking was almost impossible.  It is hard to find a space but we have a promise of good desserts so we grab the kids and walked.  \n\nThey have only been in the new location for 6 weeks.  It was pretty nice.  So we all walked to the dessert case.  Everything looked good.  We settled on:\n\n1 Coffee, 3 Bottled waters, 1 Lemonade, 1 mango cake, 2 creme brulees, 1 white chocolate cake, and 1 large chocolate chip cookie.  There wasn't a pricing for any of the things we ordered, so when he came to tell us our bill was $48.50.  We were shocked.  WHAT?  No detailed bill?  The kids were tired and we just wanted to leave.  \n\n10 items for $48.50 = Average $4.85 per item since we don't know the prices (non alcohol drinks and dessert)!  REALLY?????  I feel a little ripped off."

Thank you and have a nice week end.\""\n\nPart of their review on 3/9/12 states: \""Also,  if 50 dollars is to expensive for you after having 2 sodas especially the delicious lemonades who are from france so they are more expensive then a can of coke, 2 meals and 2 desserts then mcdonalds is better for you..price wise of course.\"" \n\nAfter review their review, I was shock to see how they think about their customers.  How 2 faced can you get.  Nice in the private message and then blast a customer on a public review.  If I would have had 2 drinks, 2 meals, and 2 desserts for $50, that is a great deal.  We had 5 non-alcoholic drinks, 4 desserts, and a cookie for $48.50.  You know, we should have taken the kids to McDonalds for dessert.  \n\nTo read the rest of Frenchie B.'s review:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/au-petit-four-scottsdale#hrid:b6f4KzsK5ApkWZxLumt-SA"
0,"After reading Judy F. 's update, I will no longer go to this establishment.  I was a BIG supporter of this cafe when it was at the Esplanade, however reading Judy B. or Frenchie B's comments, private and a review, I will never send anyone there.  And I've sent many, saying the desserts are wonderful.  The desserts may be wonderful, however, that type of attitude is not needed from those who are related to the owners or who are the owners.   Very disappointing.  Desserts are worth more than Mc D's yes however the attitude is not worth my time, therefore, I will have my caramel sundae for a $1or support another local cafe.   All yelpers try to help locals, however, this cafe doesn't seem to care and approach the reviews very defensively."

0,"worst brunch I ever had!\n\nI was hoping for a nice Sunday brunch but was very disappointed. The waitress told us that it is a fourty minutes wait for any order. She suggested pastry even though the cafe was less than one third full (12 people including us).  So we selected two crossants, a quiche and two cups of coffee. Pastries arrived quickly but no coffee.  Crossants were cold and soft, not as good as crossan from Paradise cafe but twice the price. \n\nHalfway done my croissant I realized I had no napkin. Asked her about coffee she said that it is brewing and need to wait four more minutes.  My husband noticed that the lady behind me complained coffee was too cold and it was then microwaved. He was puzzled as the waitress told us they serve freshly brewed coffee.\n\n I finished my croossant and had some quiches. finally our coffee came. They were luke warm too, not as hot as from McDonalds. At this point, twenty minutes later after we sat down,  the waitress  told us if we order now she will be able to serve quickly. We were not happy.  We asked her if there was anything we could have done differently to have a proper meal and she said no. \n\nThe worse thing is it destroyed our whole day being treated this way. \n\nWill not go there ever again!"
0,"These people are horrible and rude. The macaroon and tiramisu that I got from them were so stale, they smelled like the fridge they were kept in.

0,"Last week I went on yelp to find a good alterations place to fix two pairs of pants and a shirt of mine. Creations & Alterations had some good reviews and it was down the street from my apartment. I dropped off my clothes thinking it wouldn't take more than 2-3 days. I dropped it off on a Tuesday and they told me it'd be ready the NEXT week Thursday!! At the time I didn't care and just wanted it done. I came in the next week Friday morning before I drove out to California, intending to wear my newly fixed jeans, and they said it wasn't ready. They hadn't even started on it. They asked if I could spare an hour for them to fix it, which just added insult to injury being informed that they sat on my clothes for a week and a half when everything could have been taken care of in an hour. I asked for my clothes back and will NEVER come back again. 0 stars."
0,"Pros: Easy to find, reasonable prices, close to my home, always has available parking\n\nCons: I used to come here because it was the closest to my home. I just had to stop. They messed up my clothes 30% of the time, but I still kept coming. However, they absolutely destroyed a pair of pants I brought in one time. When I tried to bring it to their attention, they argued that it was the way I washed the pants. I had not even worn the pants or washed them."

0,"In all seriousness, I have heard good things about this place from several people, I kind of walked in and was trying to think what the hell was the theme here, seriously if PETA ever went in here they would close this place down, with stuffed animals on the walls they would have a field day. I would say from start to finish I was thoroughly not impressed. I will honestly say that I will probably never go back to this location. It wasn't even that the food was just blah, but the fact that the staff seemed to ignore me, maybe I was under dressed for this establishment. I guess my money truly is no good here, because I honestly did not feel the staff gave two fucks about me the whole time I was there. Garbage. I grabbed a card on the way out from I believe was the hostess. Torri McFarland...you and your staff from the top down got work to do this place sucks!!!"
0,"Bad food and terrible service.  Went here during restaurant week with a large group of friends and everyone was disappointed.

0,"I'm a little disappointed, it seems like I've eaten here before and it wasn't so bad.   The caesar salad dressing tasted mostly of mayo.  They cooked my medium steak pretty well, but turned out they had switched my friend's steak and mine and his was supposed to be medium rare.  I feel a steak restaurant should know how to cook a steak.  The mashed potatoes were lumpy.  They tasted ok, and did not feel pasty but could've used some kind of flavor.  The green beans were actually pretty good.  The salmon was cooked well but the citrus based sauce was a bit too sweet.  The sauce that came on the steaks was better, but didn't have much flavor.  The steaks themselves could've used a bit of salt and pepper.\n\nThe creme brulee was pretty tasty as always but I wasn't a fan of the flourless espresso chocolate cake.  \n\nAll in all, I don't think the experience and food is as put together as their competitors.  The waitress also seemed a bit joyless which didn't help the experience.  With so many better options, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  Maybe for lunch?"

My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \""corporate recipe\"", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \""signature\"" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. We might as well set $500 on fire."
0,"This restaurant is for the rich kids that had never eaten any other fine food in the world other than steaks : ) Pricy steak (cow that is not even organically raised). Salmon that is farm raise(Atlantic). The steak that is almost tasteless. Veggies that are plain but buttery. The server was kind of racist (only asked what my white friend wants to drink, didn't ask me, and then brings me water). The only good thing about this place is the interior itself. The dinner alone was 83 dollars(split amount 3 people). If you have friends that want to get you there please steer them away because both of your stomach and wallet will leave unsatisfied."
0,"I have gone to Capital Grille over the years in other locations and have always had a nice experience but the Biltmore location gets a \""D\"" in my book!!!!\nThe bar area and bartender were friendly and attentive :) so that part was great! The dining experience was TERRIBLE!!!!  The waiter was not only very rude, he constantly forgot simple things and was totally unattentive... so after 5 things and 2 hrs into dinner we requested the manager who was just the same and sarcastic on top of everything else! For a $300.00 meal that was average at best. Thank goodness the company I was with was wonderful!!!! Too many other choices to be treated the way we were :( I was so disappointed that I wrote corporate headquarters! To be continued when I hear back from them!!!!"
0,"This place has slipped significantly in the past 6 months.  No meat in the rolled tacos, smaller and smaller burritos, same or higher prices.  I would like to direct anyone close by to Armando's on 48th St and Thomas.  Cheaper, better tasting and larger portions.  This Filiberto's has become run-of-the-mill and cheap.  Other good reasons to stay away:  adjacent to a bus stop and a telemarketing joint.  Enough said."
0,"I love pita, hummus, Mediterranean food and was anxious to try this place. What a huge disappointment. Dressing was over spiced, just burned. Pita was bland. \n\nGlad to see stable something in Town & Country."
0,"The food was pretty decent, but the waitresses were inattentive. No ambiance. Good green tea. They tried to commit our order to memory, which was a colossal failure. Both orders were slightly wrong."
0,"I'd give this place 0 stars if possible. Went there for pickup and the waitress was EXTREMELY rude!! Acted like I was wasting her time, didn't say hello or goodbye, just kind of left us standing there awkwardly after she handed us the reciept. The food was very overpriced for what you get (got the felafel dinner) and the felafel was very dry. Don't go here!"
0,Worst service I've ever experienced. Called my order in 20min ahead and had to wait another 30min after I got there till my fries and pita were ready and there was no one else in the restaurant not a single person. It happened once and I thought it was a fluke but this is now the second time. Staff is incompetent and rude. The cooks just seemed to be hanging out and flirting with the server. I ordered pesto fries and they were out of pesto which they should have told me when I placed my order by phone instead of making me drive there to find out. Terrible I will never go there again which is sad because they're pesto fries are great but their service is so terrible I can't imagine going back and dealing with them. Service is everything and cypress grill is a prime example of losing business over service alone. I'm telling everyone I know and they have already stopped going because they are experiencing the same lack of professionalism and service.
0,"They need to change the oil, fries both regular and greek came out brown and well done. Everything was bland. Greek salad tasted like nothing.  Calamari fried in old oil as well. Gyro sandwich was bland too. Beer selection limited. I'm not sure how this place is still running? Service was outstanding but we will never go back."
0,Mediocre food. The staff also has no idea what the hours are. Yelp and their website says they are open until 10pm but I was just turned away at 8:45 because they just closed. Avoid.
0,"Tried to go, they were closed an hour early with employees outside drinking. Not impressed."
0,"Stayed at the Biltmore and went here because of an American Express dining certificate.  The experience: a dirty soup spoon, sending back the soup, taking a bite of scallop that made me sick, and terminating the dining experience as a result ... If I could give \""negative stars,\"" I would.  This is a nasty, as in dirty-ass nasty, restaurant pretending to be fine dining."
0,"This comment is directed to the gentleman that works in your Phoenix Colonnade location in the Furniture section. (The really short 80's looking guy)..\n\nWhy in the world would be so condescending to customers and butt in on their conversation? Why did you feel the need to critisize their description of a chair they were looking at?\n\nBecause of your rude and flippant behavior, and obvious lack of customer service skills you lost an extremely large sale and any future business my wife and I would ever give you. That unfortunately includes the clothing side. we refuse to give business to people that treat customers so disrespectfully !"
0,"I used to be a huge fan of this place until last night. I went in to find a nice dress to wear. After wandering the store looking for the plus size section (I proudly wear a size 18) and not finding anything, I asked the clerk where it was. Apparently they no longer carry anything over a size 16.\nTalk about being disappointed. I was so upset I almost cried. \nShame on you...... You should also put a sign up now so that girls like me don't waste our time wondering through your store anymore..."
0,"Smaller sizes...not much for the plus or large crowd.  Also, the staff is almost incredulously rude everytime I'm in here!  I know people love it here, but it's like a very expensive Goodwill.  The clothes and accessories are way overpriced for what you're getting!  Save yourself some money and go down to the Goodwill at 16th St and Indian School.\n\nAlso, if you have clothes to sell, don't get your hopes up.  Gawd knows I've tried to figure out what they are looking for...when they did take a couple of my smaller size 12 sundresses to consign, they ended up giving them away to a thrift store for dogs (I shit you not) and didn't even bother to call me.  I guess that's not their policy...if you consign here and they don't sell your stuff in whatever time frame they think they should, don't expect to ever get it back."
0,"It's one of that consignment stores that refuses clothes one originally bought from them because the labels aren't designer enough. \n\nI would never shop here again, since if I pay $40 for a skirt, wear it twice, and decide it doesn't work for me, they'll snootily refuse it as inferior to what they stock, obviously, in tones of \""how dare I sully their store with this trash?\"" They even accused me of lying about ever having an account with them, when I'd said I wasn't sure and it was from years ago. \n\nIn fairness, I would swear the place has changed management or employees. It used to be possible to buy high-end office clothes here and the staff were nice. Now it's a trophy-wife clothes, staffed by the rudest, snootiest women I've ever encountered in a clothing store. I should probably be grateful I now don't have store credit I'd have to use there."
0,New location needs better ventilation. Awkward layout reeks of musty clothes.  Odor persists into breezeway. \n\nOrganization not clear. I sincerely hope this is a temporary location.
0,"Not good. And it's not been for a couple of years. There are advantages: good location, rarely busy, good for larger groups. But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.  When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard, the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it.  Only 2 beers on tap. Garbage."
0,"Absolutely terrible, and dangerous!!  Manicurist cut my cuticle and then cut Herself somehow. Didn't see a thing wrong with it. No apology. She didn't put on a glove!! She simply said \""it happens\"". Unbelievable! I do not want a bloodborne disease from a salon and if you don't either stay far far away from this place. She was so casual about it!! Also, I left with polish all over my skin and a French manicure that would have been dine better at a $10 Korean nail salon."
0,"I went to this salon for a 50 minute full custom facial. What I got was 25 minutes of steam in my face in a loud salon. My appointment was at 1:00 and, at 1:05 I met Dunia, who would be doing my facial. What happened in the next 25 minutes was this: a quick cleansing of my face, some gritty stuff applied and steam in my face for about 15 minutes, a bright light in my face without my eyes covered and a rough rinse off of my face, some really strong (she said it was antiseptic to \""kill bacteria\"") stuff applied to my face, followed by sunscreen ... that was it. Oh - and all of this WITH THE DOOR OPEN ... and let me just say it was not quiet in this place (aka: NOT relaxing). I walked out of the salon at 1:30 wishing I hadn't wasted my time and money for something I could have done myself at home."
0,"I bought a travel zoo voucher for my daughter, me, and mother-in-law to get a mani/pedi. I even took my daughter out of school early for our special day, since they don't have later times for nail services. That morning, they called to tell me that they couldn't take all of us, and we would have to re-schedule. This was not an option for me, so it ended up just being my daughter and mom-in-law getting service. \n\nThought I would give them another chance. Next time, the appt was for me, my daughter, and my own mom. I took my daughter out of school early again. This time, when we arrived, they said that there was an error in scheduling and we would need to re-schedule. Really? Again, this was not an option for me. So my mom and daughter just got pedicures (even though we had paid for a manicure too). No attempt to offer a discount or anything.\n\nTheir front desk staff is less than incompetent. Make sure you have a plan B, before you go. WIll never go back."
0,Business CLOSED... no call cancelling appointment.  Very poor form - purchased a three pack of facial/pedi's and doubt I will see any refund :(
0,"This business closed in early November with no notice.  Voicemail said that clients that had purchased packages would be contacted for refunds by the end of November, but I haven't been contacted about my unfulfilled pedicure package.\n\nHowever, I have located the owner of Salon 3121, Michelle Davis and she is now doing business at:\n\nNails by Michelle D\n3240 East Camelback Road Studio #4\nPhoenix, Arizona 85018\n\nIf you are awaiting a refund from Salon 3121, you can try contacting Michelle and see if she'll make good on your prior purchase.  Not sure if she's selling any new packages, but I'd be careful about advanced purchases.  Good luck."
0,"Trendy spot?  Maybe, if it was 1982.  This place is in need of a serious update, but it looks like most of the customers need one too.  How does it survive in this competitive town?  \n\nI expect it to be shut down when I come back to town.  Good spot for something new."
0,"Zen 32 is terrible. In every aspect. The sushi is fishy, it's too crowded, and the servers are rude/clueless/slow. \n\n'nuff said."
0,"Zen 32 was my sushi standout in Phoenix, AZ until today. \n\nAfter moving to NYC, I went back home and visited my old hang outs. Some things have changed. \n\nThough Kona Grill at the Fashion Square in Scottsdale was always my fav, I considered Zen 32 to be the best sushi place in Phoenix -- great dim ambiance, a big outdoor patio with misters for Happy hour, and cute canoes on the ceilings. \n\nHowever, today there were not one, but two flies in my Saki-Rita drink. The waitress apologized, but left the charge on the bill, plus the charge for the replacement drink. After much aggravation, the manager removed the charge. \n\nThe floating flies were not the worst part. I was left wondering what eles is floating around the kitchen. There was also a 1/2 inch piece of who knows what in my spicy tuna roll -- maybe it was a scale? A piece of plastic? Hard to tell. \n\nConclusion, go to Zen 32 for the ambiance. Not the food or drinks. Perhaps bring friends you dislike and watch them eat?"
0,"UGH. I ate here for my last night after spending my whole summer in Phoenix/Scottsdale and it was perhaps the worst decision (and my least favorite place I ate at over the entire summer)! I was thoroughly bummed with my dining experience after hearing constantly how Zen 32 was supposedly \""the hip\"" place. I was completely unimpressed with the hostesses and the service (which was slow, rude, and totally unhelpful), the food was disappointing (not fresh, not tasty, not innovative), and the ambiance was definitely not what it was built up to be. We ordered a variety of entrees and sushi rolls, both of which were completely inauthentic Japanese and nothing special in terms of preparation or ingredients. I would have rather eaten at PF Changs or Roys, where I would be spared the pretentiousness. Also, the place is crowded. Not in a good, social lounge scene way. In a nasty, don't have enough room to eat/breathe way. For some reason word of mouth has gotten out that Zen 32 is THE sushi place, but spare yourself the tasteless reality. Seriously, it's not that chic. Unless you're really dying for sushi at midnight, you're better off next door at Delux."
0,"Went to Zen for lunch today with a friend....waited at the hostess station for a server to seat us....no one came....finally the chef said we could sit anywhere...we sat down...waited ten minutes for a server to come to our table to just even bring us water and menus...never happened...we got up and left without ever seeing anyone. They only had about 10 customers on the patio and NO ONE inside but us....this was sad....we saw servers walking in and out and a few even made eye contact with us, but none approached us. Very sad....plus the place smelled like bad fish....this place has gone way down hill...sad! Worse service ever!!!!!"
0,"Ok, I am not one that knows her sushi well, but when I order a roll that said that is comes with crab, cream cheese, cucumber, and avocado, why am I getting a roll with just whitefish?\n\nI have been here twice and each time I have had the worst service!  This time around was the most interesting.  Twice, bussers came to our table and just tried to take our chairs.  Did they ask? NO.  Did they notice that my friend's purse was on one of them?  NO.  Did they ever come back when we said that we actually needed one more chair? NO.  \n\nAlso, when it was time to pay the bill...all of us (6 people total) decided to make the server's job easier by writing on the back of the check on how much each of us was going to pay.  My one friend wrote $40 and I wrote $15 (I didn't eat much and I didn't get anything to drink)  This was with tip included.  Server comes back and charges my friend $15 and me $21.98.  (HUH!)  Then she told us that she couldn't add the tip with it.  Couldn't she have told us that first?  Especially when a sharp person could see that we were giving her way more than what the bill stated.\n\nThe food both times I was there was bleh.  Even the temperature of the food wasn't right.  I kept on thinking to myself this is how one gets food poisoned.  (I did not)  They turned off the heaters outside when there were still a bunch of people enjoying happy hour.  (It wasn't very warm out there!)  \n\nNext time...we are going to meet somewhere in Tempe for sushi happy hour."
0,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I'm Chinese and I know my rice.\n\nSo after a meeting next door @ Hava Jave (review for that place to follow) a friend and I wandered over to Zen32 for a 10pm snack.\n\nBoy was that a mistake.  I normally eat up at Celsius in Desert Ridge so I thought I'd get the same food down here to compare.  \n\nA couple of the rolls we ordered:\n\nViva Vegas Roll\nCaterpillar Roll\n\nThe service was just fine but honestly, even if I had Angelina Jolie serving the food naked, the food would still be crap and the rating would still be an UNO star.\n\nThe rice seemed like it was day-old rice.  It was clumpy and honestly, I don't know how a sushi chef  takes CLUMPY rice and puts it into a roll...  so anyway, due to the clumpiness of the rice, the Vegas roll was loosly rolled so it fell apart when I tried to pick it up.\n\nThe Caterpillar roll tasted super bland which is VERY hard to do because it includes so many different ingredients like eel, faux crab, avocado, cucumber, and eel sauce.  Not only did it taste bland, it was also poorly rolled.  \n\nAgain, the service was nice but you might want to bring your own sushi if you're going to eat here..."
0,"I should have went to the Safeway next door for sushi.\n\nThis was the first time I went to sushi joint, looked at the menu and decided that the best sounding thing was the steak. I opted for the grilled salmon and wasabi mash. While I am a huge sushi fan, the price of the rolls were a wee bit more expensive than some GOOD sushi places I went to. My friend opted for a bento box that had a crab nigiri (which was simply a half a stick of imitation Krab on top of rice). So sad. \n\nMy plate arrived and looked like a garden threw up on my plate. The steamed veggies were scattered around my plate like the salad shooter malfunctioned. The grilled salmon was just okay, served on top of wasabi mash that was also just okay. \n\nThe server was also very clueless. She brought over a bowl of miso soup and sat the soup between my friend and I. I wasn't sure who it belonged to so I asked for straws so we could share. =) She didn't think it was too funny. She said she wasn't sure whose meal it came with so she just left in the middle so we can figure it out. (THANKS!)\n\nBy the way, the waitresses were wearing traditional Chinese dresses. Shouldn't they be in a kimono or something? Who is the smart white guy that owns this place?!\n\nI walked away from Zen 32 and I won't be back."
0,"I would never return to this place. Food is mediocre at best. The interior is sooo small.  The patio is about your only option.\n\nPlease go else where for your sushi and Japanese needs.  The cloth napkins alone is a total turnoff.  It leaves lint all over your pants! So cheap!!!\n\nIf you want to get a cheap eat, by all means, go there, but don't expect a top notch experience being that it's near the Biltmore."
0,"I don't think there's much to Zen 32 besides looking trendy.\n\nSomething seemed strange about the place when I walked in, and after reading other reviews it's been pointed out--the waitresses are wearing Chinese attire with Mandarin collars. I won't hold the lack of authenticity against them. Also, the music is soft and the seating kind of cramped, making for an awkward dining experience.\n\nI'll get the good thing out of the way--the reverse happy hour. The hot ginger sake was overpowering, but for $1 there's no way I can complain. Also, they had a few basic rolls for $3, and that's not too bad. \n\nEverything else sucks! The specialty rolls are all stuffed with krab, so what hope do you have of ever getting quality sushi? My tootsie roll was garbage, I couldn't taste anything beside the krab inside. The caterpillar roll looked nice, but I could only taste krab and eel sauce. Even the rainbow roll looked promising, and THAT was drenched in sriracha. \n\nI also had some of this teriyaki chicken entree, and it was rough and a bit dry. The edamame had way too much salt, and I began noticing a pattern to this place. Take crap and season it as much as you can.\n\nI'd like to give this place a second chance for a cheap date or something, but I'm still a little angry at this place (and their sketchy waitress!), for being the first to make me tired of sushi. A friend bought me this meal and I still regret it. It's that bad."

0,"Blah, worst coffee ever. Had this place 2 weeks ago and I will never come back. Their drip coffee tasted watered down, overpriced and it was by far the shittiest coffee I have ever had. I would much rather get my coffee from AM/PM then ever walk into this place again. Horrible."
0,"Yep Yelpers - I'm not ever going back here again. \n\nI asked the girl at the counter if they had Iced Toddy. Nope...no big deal. I asked instead for iced coffee with two shots of espresso in it.

I came home and made everyone in the house try the most bitter coffee concoction I've ever come across.) Okay so then she sent me over to the bar to the hot coffee. Melted my ice and my plastic cup. Not exactly what I meant when I asked if they had iced coffee... \n\nHow much did this crud cost me?? A whooping $2.75. Oh, but wait! It's actually $3.00, an extra 25 cents for running it on my card, which she tells me AS SHE SWIPES MY CARD. I had cash on me. And I really would have preferred to be offered a choice to use it ahead of time. \n\nAlso, their seating consists mostly of a long bar against the wall opposite of the coffee counter. You wouldn't be able to camp out here with a laptop, homework, or even a book. There just isn't any room. There's a few tables, but if a group walked in you'd have a major guilt trip. \n\nAll in all, you'd go to Hava Java for a run and go coffee.

I liked that, so I tried it.\n\nInside & out, the place looks very old.  I would guess 1940s.  It's medium in size, & there were about 25 trays of food out.  There were only about 5 other customers in the place on a weekday at 12:30, which was my first warning sign.  The second was the egg flower soup.  It was gooey & blah (1940's style, I wondered?).\n\nThe food table was against the wall, so you have to reach far for the items that are in the back.  The ranch dressing was runny, & the macaroni salad blah.  The unfriendly Chinese lady brought me some \""hot tea\"", which was lukewarm.  Back at the food table, the rest of the food was greasy, not very warm, or both.

0,Read a review from the newspaper so I tried it. Not impressed. The atmosphere is about as dismal as the food. They need to make it a place people want to come in and eat instead of get out of there as soon as possible. Gross!
0,"This restaurant is one of the filthiest I've ever visited in the entire world (and I travel frequently to third-world countries on business). During my lunchtime visit the dining room tables were strewn with uncollected plates and uneaten food, the steam table buffet had food scraps hanging all over it, and the carpeting was full of stains from ground-in food particles. If that wasn't bad enough the buffet food was terrible, too.  It all appeared to come from frozen, restaurant supply entrees--very oily stuff with poor smell, taste and appearance.  During the 30 minutes I was there, someone at another table complained about an unidentified object in her noodles, while another customer complained that the buffet was essentially empty.  This place isn't even worth the 5.99 +tax for lunch, even if it does include beverage.  YUCKERS to the core!"
0,I'd hate to waste a star on this place!\n\nI lived right outside of The French Quarter in New Orleans for 8 months. I remember the best of Cajun food and this place was far from what I remember. I'm not big on seafood but everyone at our table ordered a seafood dish and all were not happy with their entree.\n\nWhat did I order? I ordered a simple Chicken Po'boy sandwich. How can a Cajun restaurant get this wrong? This place did. The chicken was placed on bread that was hard. I expected the chicken to be smothered in BBQ sauce. Wrong! The sauce was on the side. The lettuce on the side of dish that was to be used in the sandwich was a bit on the brown side. The fries were cold. Yuck!\n\nWaitress was great. She was the best part of this dining experience. Never again.
0,"If you've ever been to New Orleans and have therefore been spoiled by actual cajun food, this place is a guaranteed disappointment. My $12 shrimp po'boy had maybe 10 shrimp on it, something that is supposed to be a staple of cajun cuisine. The couple of small pickles, half of a tomato slice and soggy lettuce given as dressings for the sandwich were an embarrassment. I'm not sure what flavor the chips were, because there was no flavor. I think I could have had better at Long John Silver's, and I hate Long John Silver's."
0,"nothing to rave about this place.\nservice was poor and the food was bad.\nI know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure."
0,Rude customer service on the phone-like you are doing me a favor even answering my questions regarding bringing my vacuum in for repair=I am going somewhere else.
0,"I went in to have cateract eye surgery in both of my eyes which began in Nov. 2012.  The two surgeries were done 2 weeks apart.  I was sold for an additional $7000.- above Medicare and Blue Cross charges to have  lens implants that would not require me to wear glasses after the surgeries.  One of the lens's that was implanted in my eye was not centered and 3 weeks later, it had to be removed and replaced with a different lens.  Both eyes had laser surgeries.  My left eye also had retina work after the initial implant (supposedly my retina was torn in 3 places.  Also in my left eye, I had to have cornea surgery on my eyelids.  Finally after 7 months of office visits and surgeries, I decided to get a second opinion from an outside opthamoligist.  He explained to me that the LensX ($7000.-) should NOT have been used for me due to my stigmatisms.  I asked why Dr Perkins recommended it to me, and was told that it was all about additional money.  To date, my vision has become alot worse prior to going in to Barnet Dulaney Perkins.   NOW, I have eye glasses for both reading and distance.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY- THEY ARE A TOTAL BUNCH OF CROOKS AND NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL."
0,"Don't go here!  I tried to get some necessary surgery done but to no avail after having the staff \""forget\"" to schedule a physical and do the necessary insurance paperwork, and having them overcharge $1000 because they could not add. \nTo start they insisted I had to have another expensive eye exam even though the optometrist who referred me did the exact same exam two weeks before.  Cost $305!!!    I called many times only to be left on hold sometimes for 30 plus minutes.  My husband is disabled and I had to schedule care for both of us after the surgery and during the appointments prior to the surgery.  I waited months and MONTHS to be scheduled in and then had the staff tell me a few days before the surgery as they \""forgot\"" to do the insurance paperwork and they could not do the surgery unless I paid for the whole thing up front.  Much to my chagrin I re-scheduled some weeks later but two days before they called again as they \""forgot' to have me get a physical.  I couldn't get care for my husband on that short of notice. \nI got the bill yesterday.  They charged me almost $700 just for a 20 minute consult and an un-necessary eye exam. They also charged $90 for two digital photos of my face which took 60 seconds by an assistant. I have to start over as I neither trust the Doctor or the staff.  You decide if it is worth it for a careless service.   I've never had a good visit!!!!"
0,"After having the President Mark Rosenberg call and apologize to me for a whole series of mishaps wholly Baret Dulaney's fault, nothing he promised came true: He said they'd fast lane me through the process;  it took months and months.   He said they'd make sure no more charges were involved: I got the bills and my insurance was re-charged for extra visits and some of the same exams.  He said they'd make sure I was satisfied; the surgeon called and cancelled for the forth time.  Four different excuses for the cancellations over a period of nine months because they couldn't get their act together. Now I wonder if you want a company that has employees who forget to schedule physicals, forget to do the insurance paperwork and a surgeon (Dr. Berdos) who cancels the appointments after you have waited months and months to get on his schedule?  Does this seem right or fair to you?"
0,"What a waster of time and money!  My regular ophthalmologist recommended I see the same doctor who performed my previous cataract surgery (which was here) for a followup procedure.  Step 1:  Repeat the same exam I had just received from my ophthalmologist at a cost of about $200.  Step 2: Go in for an evaluation with the Surgeon ... wait in 3 different waiting rooms for over 2 hours, then leave, since I myself had appointments. Leave having accomplished nothing as I never saw the doctor!  At no point did they indicate to me it would be over an hour delay and offer to reschedule or give me any indication of actually how long the wait would be. Feels more like a surgery factory than health CARE.  I have no intention of coming back to this facility."
0,"Just had the worst customer service from the management at the  Chilis on Camelback and 20th st. As a long time former employee of the company, I'm even more appalled! Sad day :("
0,"Most definitely the dirtiest Chili's I've ever experienced, inside and outside. The patio had cigarette butts, a dirty ash tray filled with water from the misters, bits of trash strewn about. Inside tables were left dirty, the bathroom was filthy too. \n\nMy food was cold and dried out like it had been made for someone earlier and then left under the warming lights.\n\nBecause I was in polite company and we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't sent it back.\n\nI am quite shocked that I didn't get sick after eating there. \n\nBoth the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit."

0,"I feel horrble to have to say this to my fellow yelpers, but working with Checker Pool and Pump Supply was a horrible experience.  The whole thing.  From the intial phone call I made to the office to the final installation of the new motor.  Just awful.\n\nFirst the phone call to the office was less than desired. The fellow who answered the phone wasn't terribly helpful and told me that he couldn't schedule anything, but he would send my call to one of his \""technicians.\""  Okay.\n\nA couple hours later a technician called. He was abrubt and abrassive in his tone, asking me to describe what was wrong and then interrupting me when he figured out that he knew better than I did what the description was.\n\nHe came and diagnosed the problem while I was at my office in Chandler. He very tersely told me, \""either I come in an hour or on Monday.\""  I had just come back home to 114 degree weather, so I thought it better he come quickly than wait 5 days.  So he came.\n\nThen he called from the car and told me he had taken my motor as it needed to be repaired. I wasn't given a choice.  He just took it.  So now I can't have someone else come out and give me another price quote.  Of course, this fellow still hadn't told me what was wrong or what the price would be - he just took my motor and called me from the car.\n\nWhen he returned on Tuesday (not on Monday as he promised because he said I didn't answer the phone soon enough for him and he couldn't leave the motor without any money from me) he installed a new motor without telling me. He told me on the phone that if he couldn't repair the motor someone would call and quote me the price for a new motor.  I guess not, and what choice did I had - he still had my old motor.  So we were forced to accept the new motor since it was already installed without a price or a pre-installation discussion.\n\nHe then told us that a pipe was cracked and that the suction for the pool pump was compromised, but he didn't fix it.  Why not offer to fix it?  And after he left, he left our pump clock on for just 2 hours.  Really?  In the summer?  And he didn't tell us the fill valve was also broken.  A cheap 20.00 part that I am sure he had on the truck would have fixed that.\n\nThe new motor was 289.00 which I am told is very fair, but then they charged 16.50 for shop labor (for what) and nearly 100.00 for the miscellaneous parts needed to install the motor, and 95.00 for his labor.  The price should have been about 385.00 in my opinion.  If he had repaired the plumbing and the fill valve so we didn't have to have someone else come by, I might have thought 580 was fair?  But now we have to have more work done on the pool by another company.\n\nThis particular technician was so horrible I am afraid to call this company ever again. He was rude to me and to my husband and"
0,"There was a time, when service at this company was excellent. I have used this company for over 10 years. I went down a couple week ago because my pool sweep wasn't working. The person at the counter, was pathetic when it came to providing service. My wife went back to pick the pool sweep, the guy that waited on her was eating his lunch at the front counter. She said she would never go back there again, because the service was so poor. My pool sweep was under warranty they told me, there was nothing wrong with the sweep, it just need to be cleaned. They charged me 20.00 to clean it. When I put it in the pool it still had the same problem. I took it to Leslie Pool Supply they took it a part while I was there replaced a couple parts put it back together and didn't charge me, because it was still under warranty.  It works now. I have spent my last dollar with Checker.. guess who my new pool company is!"
0,"Can I give these company a worse score?  Less than 2 years later, the pump I purchased is broken. My regular pool guy (who was out of town in August of 2011 when I wrote the 1st review) took the pump apart and found out that it was never grounded.  Buyer BEWARE!! I am not the only person this happened to. No apologies. No warranty. Nothing."
0,"About a month ago I had Checker replace the sand in my sand filter.  Immediately when he turned on the pump there were bubbles coming out of the return.  I said \""why are there bubbles coming out of the return.  I've never had bubbles coming out of the return?\""  Mike just basically blew me off.   Bled it to get the air out and still have bubbles.  Had their tech guy out and he was just plain rude.  I told him to humor me and check the O ring on the filter lid because I never had bubbles coming of the return and the only thing that has changed is they changed the sand.  The guy didn't want to do it and didn't do it and preceded to tell me how he gets paid.  Bottom line, he just wouldn't get paid enough to check the O ring and heaven forbid he had to replace it.  I've never dealt with a company that won't do something you have asked."
0,"There are a few guys that work here. One guy, who seems to be in charge, is just a total prick. One time I was in there, he got into a yelling match with a female customer - apparently what he remembered was different than what she had recalled of their phone conversation earlier that day. Ultimately, he looked her in the eye, put his hand up, waved goodbye like a two year old, and told her to leave the store. Today I was in there and he saw a couple coming in, he said \""F&$@ no, I'm taking my break.\"" The guy that helped me today questioned everything I was saying. \""Well, did you measure it? I mean, take a ruler to it and measure it?\"" Yes, I told you it was a 9\"" cover I needed. He reassured me that I was wrong, and actually had me questioning myself. Imagine that - 2 Master's degrees, and I can't use a tape measure properly. The younger guy that works there is a really, really nice. So if you go in and have to wait in line to talk to him when the others are eating or talking shit about customers, it'd be worth the wait. He's knowledgeable and polite. While the other guys seem to know what they're talking about, they certainly have a lot to learn from their junior counterpart. I live about 2 blocks away from this place, but will make the trip to Leslie (and likely spend more money) just so I don't have to deal with these guys again. No point in giving my money to people who definitely don't appreciate it."

0,"This review is not about my stay at the Biltmore but about not staying here. I purchased a gift certificate at a baseball related charity function in Oct. When I went to redeem my gift certificate (which I wanted use during the baseball Spring training months) I was told the dates I had chosen were unavailable. OK, I understand as on my certificate it did say subject to availability, so I choose a couple of other dates. After a couple of phone calls I was finally told that all Spring training dates were blackout. My problem with all of this is that it took many phone messages and emails to finally have someone tell me this. The Director of Sales and Marketing contact person who was on my gift certificate NEVER returned an email or phone call and when asked if there were any other options none were offered. I would also like to add that I have a 2 night stay certificate and was looking to stay 2 additional nights at full price. Bottom line really bad bad customer service."

0,"First let me say i love Embassy Suites and hilton Hotels but my gripe is about the Hilton Honors Program. I booked several stays through Orbitz so i can book my flight and Hotel together and on those stays Hilton accpets my Honors number but when i review my account to see how many points i had i noticed on those 2 stays there were ZERO points. Come to find out that booking through another site Hilton won't honor those stays. This is crazy as most people don't ever reall book direct to a hotel when traveling on buisness. I had been a Marriott Rewards member for over 10 years and will be switching back because of this, Embassy Suites are nice and cost much more and for me to not get the points is a deal breaker for my dollars. Wish this policy would change and when i called she simply said sorry company policy and if you want the points you have to book seperately. Extremely dissappointed i must say!"
0,"I stayed at this hotel and it was nice. However, I left my sunglasses behind (they were a special gift from my younger sister) and I called on the same day to see if they had them. They said that they would call back with an update. But they never did. Just a note do not leave anything behind because you will not get it back or even a simple phone call."
0,"I travel a good deal.  This is the worst hotel experience, by far.\n\nThis is an older Embassy Suites but I thought that its location in the tony Biltmore area of Phoenix would assure that it's well-kept.  Incorrect assumption.  This is the filthiest hotel I've ever seen.\n\nI should have known I was in for utter disappointment when I arrived for my stay around 12:45 am.  I am dead tired and fumbling with two bags when I happen upon a security guard standing in front of the hotel taking a smoke.  Instead of holding the door for me, he watched me balance my bags and purse with an amused grin, as I struggled with the the hotel door.  Thanks for nothing.  I get to the front desk and the check-in process is fairly smooth.  I'm booked into a room that is on a far end of the hotel.  I hike over there and proceed to get ready for bed when more problems ensue. The bathroom wall has what appears to be a streak of blood running down it.  I was too grossed out to investigate further.  There is also a bent wire hanger on the picture frame over the toilet.  The wallpaper is peeling and the ceiling is showing signs of a bad leak from upstairs.  Really?  I am appalled at this point but since it's after 1 am, I reason that I can just get a little shut-eye and change rooms first thing in the morning.  My plans quickly changed when I turned down the bed covers to find lint and make-up on them.  I can't do this.  I call the front desk and request an immediate room change.  The lady I spoke too was extremely apologetic and offered to move me right away.  She said she'd send up a security guard to help with my bags and get me into a better room/area of the hotel.  You know where this is going, right?  Yes, approximately 10 minutes later the grinning smoker appears at the door.  He hands me a key for a room on the opposite side of the hotel and makes the assessment that I have a pretty good handle on my bags so he'll just point me in the direction of where I should go.  The new room looks exactly like the first one, albeit a little cleaner.  The bathroom looked acceptable and the bed covers were free of foreign substances.  It was past my bedtime, I needed sleep.\n\nWith a little rest and fresh eyes, the hotel didn't get any better for me.  I'm sure in its heyday this was THE place to stay.  Sadly, it is just neglected and doesn't warrant the nightly room charges (it's not cheap).  The common areas are filthy.  I promise that I'm not a germaphobe.  I really didn't want to touch anything in this hotel.  The elevator buttons and door handles were dirty.  I had to carry napkins with me so I wouldn't have to touch them.  The carpet in the lobby and elevators looked like a ton of toddlers had had their way with a box of Ritz crackers.  And, no, I didn't catch them on an off day.  It looked like this for my entire three-day stay.  I failed to mention the ceiling fan in my new and improved \""clean\"" room.  The dust hanging off of it was so thick.  It clearly hadn't been touched in ages.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel lobby also has an off-putting stench, probably due to the fountains/ponds inside?  I don't know but it's unpleasant.\n\nIf the filth wasn't bad enough, on the last day of my stay I was jarred from sleep at 4 am by a blaring fire alarm.  I pulled the curtain back and saw other guests milling about.  Apparently, there is no intercom system to let guests know what they should do.  When I saw another guest return to her room, I took the gamble that I'd burn in this cess pool and went back to bed.  It was a short-lived nap.  A few hours later, the alarm is blaring again!  I'm deliriously tired and in the process of the pulling on a pair of jeans to exit when housekeeping opens the door.  Really?  The alarm is going off,  it's still early in the a.m. and you're coming in the room to clean?  What in the hell?  What do you clean, anyway?  At this point, I knew it was time to part ways.  I quickly packed and made my exit.  Unbelievable and unforgivable.  Never again."
0,"Bed bugs! 2 of us in 2 different rooms, both fairly badly bitten.

I travel most of the year as my job requires. By far one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. I would post photos of the bites on my FACE, but being humiliated at work for a week was bad enough."
0,"Been coming here for several years, however the last visit I will ever make was this last trip in Oct. First room they tried to give us was so smelly due to cigarette smoke we couldn't even step in, second room was just \""ok\"" until that night we heard a loud \""gurgling\"" sound when all the plumbing backed up with filthy black \""goop\"" all over the sinks and tub. UGH!!!!  Really?? A/C does not work if you want it cooler, stay elsewhere. Also rooms have a terrible OLD musty smell. Popcorn ceilings are all buckling up and in need of repair.  Rooms were not cleaned properly, don't even think maids have a vacuum. Carpet in lobby and hallways FILTHY!!  Just all around dirty. The breakfast was ok, if you want to wait in line for 30 mins. Fish ponds were even dingy.  Sorry, this hotel it is dire need of HELP.    Maybe you guys need to call \""Anthony\"" from \""Hotel Impossible\"" as you do need ALL the help u can get! :(("
0,"Seven day stay between Christmas and New Year.   I cannot believe this is an Embassy Suite, it did not impress me one bit.  Dirty beyond belief.   I found dirt on the ceiling, dirt on the floor and DIRT IN THE SILVERWARE DISPENSER CONTAINERS @ BREAKFAST AREA.  \nI was with a group and the arrangements were made by someone else, but I certainly would not have stayed for seven nights if my wife had not insisted I shut up about it.  Management will be hearing from me and hopefully no one gets sick eating here cause this place does not pass the basic cleanliness test for any health department.  \n\n I have stayed in some of the creepiest hotels in America cause I am a cheapskate when I travel alone.  This matches some of the worst places I have ever stayed in for being dirty and in disrepair.  Towel rack off the wall, interior door off the hinge,  Mold/dirt on ceiling in room and in the big atrium.  (just look up when you are in the Atrium  and you cannot miss the big black marks on the ceiling around the air ducts.)  \n\nCarpets are filthy.  Seven days here and I did not see one vacuum being used.  The maids all had a small broom and dust pan for cleaning.   I have never reviewed a hotel room until this moment and now I will never stay in another hotel with out reading reviews.  \n\nPool was filthy and lots of missing tile, cracks and leaves in water.  I did swim one time, but couldn't bring myself to try it again.  Birds in the atrium while food was being served.  A dog was led through the atrium during breakfast.  How do they get away with this.\n\nFriendly staff and they jumped right on fixing the broken stuff, I give them credit for that.  but dirty silverware was the final straw for me.  \n\nI had two relatives who live in the valley and both said the same thing regarding this hotel after they stayed here in the last 16 months.  Wish they had said something to me earlier.  Hey Hilton, are you listening to this?"
0,"The Wrigley Mansion is one of a few historical venues in a city that does not value its past and history. That said, you would think that fact would guarantee a top quality meal and fine dining experience at Geordie's Restaurant. Regrettably, Geordie's turned out to be no better than any other overly-hyped but underwhelming restaurant one would find at a 4- or 5-star resort.\n\nI have lived in the Valley for nearly 10 years, and last night was the first time I had ever visited the Wrigley Mansion. I always felt somewhat guilty for never have visited, but I can say with near 100% certainty that my first visit is also my last. The service and wait staff performed well, but the food was the equivalent of one might get at Applebee's, and certainly not worth what I paid.\n\nI started off with the carpaccio, which was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. I have had some mediocre carpaccio before, but never this poorly prepared. I suspect a bad cut of beef. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries that arrived with excessive garlic. The fries themselves were overcooked and tasted like Jack In The Box fries. Generous amounts of catsup were required to make them somewhat edible. For the entr\u00e9e I tried the server-recommended lamb chop, which I requested to be prepared medium. When it arrived, it was clearly not medium. The meat was tough and lacked any flavor, and the au jus was entirely too salty.\n\nThe beverage service was quite prompt, however I think the bartender should go back to mixology school. The Manhattan I ordered had too much vermouth and hardly any bitters, while the lemon drop was neither sweet or bitter.\n\nThe purpose of the evening was to celebrate a friends birthday, so our dinner party had a whole room to ourselves. Given the size of the party, the wait staff did do an excellent job of making sure we were well served. Our glasses were never empty and the food did arrive promptly. Unfortunately, that alone could not make up for the poor food quality and exorbitant price."
0,"Wrigley For Halloween? - Save your money!\n \nWe decided to come here for Halloween and spend the pricey admittance fee because we had heard favorably about it from friends that had gone in prior years.  Bar style food was included,  free give-a-ways, lots of halloween like entertainment.    So we forked over the $50 a piece and thought this would be a lot of fun.  More like a ton of disappointment.\n\n$50 bought us entry into the mansion and nothing else.  Oh, did I mention we had to pay for parking too? It was collected as you drove into the property.  That wasn't mentioned anywhere.  Drinks were small, WEAK and overpriced. ($7.00)  Not very decorated at all for Halloween.   They were serving food... appetizers were $10 a piece.  \n\nWe overheard complaints from other party goers on how Wrigley had \""cheaped out this year\"". I had talked to a couple that had gone for the last 4 years and they also confirmed that this was not the Wrigley they had gone too also and they were also disappointed.\n\nSo my review.... I'll never go again.   Total waste of time and money."
0,Beautiful view is all they got going for them. We took our family from New York here. The view was fabulous and the story ends pretty much there if you want to hear good reviews. The food was horrible!!! We all got something different so four people can't be wrong. The server was the worst I have ever seen. Ok so if you know you are busy why don't you update your guests instead of ignoring them knowing that you are busy and won't be able to get to them as much as you would like. Our food took two hours to get to us. I was told it was because of the huge party upstairs. Hmmm well what about the two tables that walked in 45 minutes after us. And got their food 30 mintues before us. Yes that's because their server didn't suck and forget to ring in the food. Then the manager came over and said we will comp you a bottle of wine perfect thank you. But when we tell you how long the food has taken. He argued and said it has been only a hour. And I said yes it has that's when your server remembered to type in the order so that is the time you have on the ticket that gets printed to the kitchen. The table next to us was also pissed and yelling at the server. Get it together!! Your food sucks and so does your service. Well our server any way. Go for bar and views nothing else.
0,"My friends and I went to the Wrigley Mansion for a luch and tour special yesterday.   We ordered our food and the first course was really good.  It was a spinach & bleu cheese salad.   The second course was Croque Madame.   It looked wonderful, but on my first taste I almost hurled!  I am not a picky eater at all, but the ham was completely rancid.  I spit it into my napkin and my 4 friends were shocked because I never send food back and I'm the opposite of  a drama queen.  That's why they were so shocked.  The waiter asked if I wanted anything else and I politely declined.   I'd lost my appetite, of course.  My friends fish was almost raw, too.    So we decided to take the tour and have coffee & dessert afterwards.  The mansion was beautiful and the guide, Ashley,  was fabulous.  I was sad to see every single room was set up as a dining room.  There were no beds or dressers anywhere.  But the art, (They have a Renoir) , the chandeliers, the view and the grounds were stunning.  We went back to eat our creme brulee's and our old watered down ice teas, waters and crumbs were still sitting there.  The waiter didn't freshen up anything while we were on the hour tour.  And there were only 2 other tables of 2 there!    So we got our desserts and coffee.   It was good so far.   Then I asked for a coffee refill and I put in my cream & sugar and took a sip and the coffee was cold!!  I was so surprised that it was so cold that I spit it in my creme brulee' cup.  Again, I'm not a drama queen.  This was just so bad.  We told the waiter the coffee was cold & he was so surprised.  DUH!  He was nice but so inept.   We'll never go back, especially to eat!   I was the worst dining experience  that I've had.   They should at least give everybody a pack of Juicy Fruit for the road.  Anyway, it was such a disappointment, and I've wanted to go there since high school."
0,"I hate giving this place only one star, because I love the location and the history.

Perhaps they are catering to an older crowd that has dietary restrictions on flavor and spice, but their menu is dated - makes me think they haven't revamped it in 15-30 years. Their oso bucco portion was tiny and slimy maybe only 3oz and the risotto was bland. Had some cold shrimp spring roll? appetizer that tasted like they scraped it off the bottom of an aquarium. We went on a Saturday night expecting it to be packed, should have known the food was terrible. Please redo your menu!"
0,"I usually won't give a one-star review, but in extreme cases. I was horrifically disappointed with the food and the service. We were there on New Year's Eve, which should be a night in which they are on their A-game, but I guess they don't find that important. I ordered a steak, cooked medium. When I got the steak, it was cooked well done. It is very sad when a restaurant can't cook a steak. Then the service was disappointing as we hardly saw our waitress. I surely hope there is a new chef since I was there, because I think he worked at McDonald's before there."
0,"Had a deal, it was not worth it, it was  a ripoff.  First there are too many steep concrete\nsteps to walk up, with only one sided railing, cannot walk up with 2 people, and, then there are more concrete steps to restaurant.  Restaurant is not visible, it is all the way\na top, and, it is high.  This place is as old as it was built, plus the deal the food is rationed you are not getting good portions, there is no desert or drinks included, and there is an 18% gratuity plus.  This place is not accessible for the disabled or the\nhandicapped, it is really dangerous."
0,"Great location.  Great views.  Interesting Facility.  VERY marginal food.\nWe went there for my wife's birthday as someone bought us a gift certificate.  \nOur server was great.  He was a great blend of courteous, professional, conversational. \nBut the food was poor at best.  My wife's salad included old, rotted lettuce. The entrees were really second rate.  \nWe will not be going back!"
0,"I suddenly knew this was a mistake as soon as we started to scale the steep difficult steps and the handrail covered with a large amount of bird POOP. My stomach turned and I couldn't imagine why they don't have somebody to clean the handrail.\n\nWe were a few minutes early for our reservation so we walked around a bit. It is an interesting OLD House with narrow hallways and a small room with an old fashioned operators switchboard. It does have beautiful views. The house has a beautiful entrance door and interesting intricate ceilings but over all it really isn't so grand with old worn carpet and common tiles. I thought I'd see a bunch of marble or granite but I didn't.\n\nWe thought this was an interesting Choice for restaurant week because we wanted to see this place. Also this was one of the few places that gave you three courses without dessert. Also the $10 non member fee was waived for restaurant week.\n\nI can't say the food was completely awful but I wouldn't come back for it either even for free so I think that qualifies for the one star rating.\n\nWe asked about cocktails and our waiter said they were the last page of the wine menu but they weren't and only lasted the liquors. He returned and my husband asked for the cocktail menu we saw outside and the waiter brings us the cocktail menu. I decided on a drink but the waiter didn't return for a long period of time so we decided to just order dinner and skip the cocktails.\n\nOur waiter said the Sous Vide Chicken was stuffed with something green and he didn't know what it was but to him it was very salty. He also said the Carpaccio wasn't very good. So we decided to go with the other two starters.\n\nThe starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again. A not so great crab cake sitting on creamy peas with two refrigerated cold roasted tomatoes. The other was a few slices of eggplant with a little cheese.\n\nThe middle plates were not so seasoned escargots with a forgettable salad. The highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese. The other middle plate was not hot and not cold but unhealthy room temperature tomato soup with a over whipped cream laced with truffle aroma. (Aroma means perfume) (and over whipped means turned to butter). We both thought the tomato soup was the best of what we tried here. It tasted like good tomatoes that would be great on a pizza.\n\nFor dinner we tried the duck and the bronzini. Both were cooked just OK but neither seemed to have good seasoning or flavor however both of our vegetables were salted too heavy. I'd say so heavy I could tell what kind of salt they used and it wasn't good salt. The one thing that I could honestly say WAS terrible was the artichoke , anise sabayon. I tasted it and nearly barffed. I am without words to describe how it tasted but the texture was like hummus. Both plates had what they called polenta towers. They looked (see photo) happy to see us and I thought mine might squirt something when I went to eat it. But I was baffled when I tasted it because it wasn't like polenta. It was like corn muffin mix that was mixed with a farina kind of cereal. It was bready and lacked much of the corn taste and really tasted like cream of wheat cereal.\n\nI can almost say forgettable but I can't because I will never forget the bird poop or the polenta tower.\n\n1.5 stars almost 2 stars but with price factored in I feel one star\n\nSLIGHT UPDATE 9-11-13\nI read that they got a new chef since my review so hopefully they are better now."
0,"We wanted to make Thanksgiving special.  The Wrigley mansion is a beautiful house overlooking the city.  My date and I were seated at table 40/1 in the formal dining room.   The food on the buffet was excellent.  The buffet offered options of turkey, ham, prime rib, and lamb.   There was also an area where you can order omelets or pancakes.   Tons of food with very good quality.    On the other hand; the service was unbelievably poor.    We had to virtually send up a solar flare in the sky to get the server to stop and give us refills on water or champagne.    Our server Steve didn't have that many tables either and it was not crowded at the 3:30 PM seating in the formal dining room.    I did notice our server had a different level of attentiveness for our table in comparison to his others.   It was blantently obvious at one point he passed by our table and we both had dirty plates and I motioned for assistance he responded I'll be there in a sec; but a sec was minutes later.  Instead he utilized his time to fill up water glasses at adjacent tables marginally empty and chat with guest who had already eaten.   Perhaps his lackluster performance as a server hinged on the fact that gratuity was already included.  If this is the case he didn't earn one dime of it.  $189.45 for two people is a reasonable price for a Thanksgiving brunch if service is at least average.  This was not the case here and I admonish management for not monitoring poor performance of their servers.  The mansion is immaculate and I may come back for a random  tour and lunch; but for holiday buffet I will err on the side of caution because you never know what server you're going to get here.  Overall this is 5 star venue with 0 star servers."
0,"I hate saying negative things about people or businesses because you never know what's going on in their life to cause them to be rude to you, however Lori's Grooming has permanently scarred my dog. I used to bring my cocker spaniel here frequently it was close to my house and she would always get her in last minute. My dog was 5 when I started taking her to Lori so she had been to the groomer hundreds of times and never had an issue. After about the 6th or 7th time at Loris she would start to shake uncontrollably when we would even get close to the front door. Sometimes she would even poop and pee herself obviously completely terrified. This reaction was new she had never acted like this with any groomers and still, tho not as bad, has this reaction when we go to the groomers.\n\nI feel Lori had either been extremely aggressive to my dog or just treated her terribly, bad enough to cause her to react this way. Tho Lori was never a very pleasant woman I would have never expected her to harm my dog. Be weary of this groomer. Unfortunately there is no way to prove she did anything to my dog, if there were I would have her in jail, but you know your animal and she obviously was terrified of Lori. If you pet is like your child please watch that she is not being harmed.\n\nI give one star because she would always get her in last minute."
0,Worst experience ever. I have been sitting in the front of the restaraunt for 20 minutes waiting for our order.
0,"Wlaked into this place and the guy comes out right away, and asks what I need. I tell him, and right about then his cellphone rings. He spends the next 5 minutes on a personal call, without acknowledging me once (\""be right with you\"", \""sorry about this\"", etc). All I did was walk into his store and try to do business with him, so I can certainly see how a personal call should take precedence. This place must have all the work they can handle-- try someplace where they value your business."
0,"Very unprofessional and rude. Acted like he was doing me a favor to replace a water heater. Had enough and got someone else to do the job. As a small business owner, I know if I treated my clients like this, I would have no clients."
0,"My usual handyman was sick so he recommended Steve at A-Accent Plumbing to install a new sprayer head for my kitchen faucet. I had already purchased the part so it was (I thought) a simple matter of attaching it. The plumber arrived very promptly - the same day I called. He was finished in 30 minutes, charged me $98 for an hour's labor & left. I thought it was a lot but hey!  He came & fixed my problem quickly. Fast-forward 2 weeks. The sprayer head fell off in my hand. My handyman came to see what was wrong and told me it wasn't installed correctly & he would speak to Steve about the issue. Steve, however, was completely \""unresponsive\"" (handyman's words). No fix, no refund, no nothing. I will NEVER use this company again & will encourage anyone who asks to go elsewhere for their plumbing needs. This is the first negative review I have ever written."
0,"This KFC SUCKS! 2night the drive thru clerk asked,\""Like to try our grilled wings?\"" I said \""yes.\"" She said, \""sorry- we don't have any.\"" WTF?"
0,"I very rarely eat fast food, but I was craving some crunchy chicken goodness, with a biscuit and slaw. The only think awesome about the place? SPORKS (why haven't they ever become mainstream, the world may never know)! They were OUT of biscuits and dropped my change onto the pavement without offering to make it right. They may be right down the street from me... but I will be sure to stick to local mom and pop shops going forward."
0,"Avoid this location. My wife and I both ordered a meal that came with a cookie for desert. We got home and realized they didn't give us the Cooke. We returned since we were really feeling like desert and they said the were out and substituting a biscuit or side since they were out of cookies. We question how a biscuit is like a desert since we wanted something sweet and asked if instead of two cookies we could split a slice of pie. The manager quickly informed us that two cookies is $.99 and a pie is $1.99. I asked if she could just make the substitution since we had to drive all the way back and since it was their mistake to begin with and she refused. I just left because we didn't feel like more food, we wanted dessert. How is it that if you make a mistake and run out of desert and then just leave it out of the meal althogether you feel you don't have to substitute with something similar. What a waste of a trip. The one bright side was the person who helped us was very friendly. His name was William.  He should be promoted as I could tell he wanted to take care of us."
0,"I took my baby here based on reviews.  Well, it just goes to show that Yelp doesn't always work.  I gave my girl some med's. and she was having side effects ( loss of appetitite, diarrhea, lethargy), also she was bowled over by a larger puppy at the dog park and seemed sore.  The amazingly pompous Dr. Bishop ignored all of my concerns.  Instead (yet again, he's the SIXTH vet who's done this) he started hammering on about her cough and how it means she's in heart failure.  Is she on med's.?  No, but she had an echo cardiogram less than a year ago and she doesn't need med's.  I again voiced the concerns I came in about.  He said he knows nothing about the med's. I gave my dog (Really?  Corticosteroids, and a vet knows nothing about THAT?).   He didn't care about her symptoms and dismissed them other than \""feed her rice and beef or chicken for now\"".  Then went on about how he NEEDS to run a battery of tests on her and take numerous X-ray's of her.  I said \""No\"", he will not do that, I only allow trusted specialists, i.e. a heart specialist to do that, since reg. vet's tend to be wrong (SIX of them in my experience so far).  He got snippy and said he'd send me to a specialist he knows. Yeah, right.  Again, he wanted to run tests on her to see if she could handle his (extremely outdated) treatments WHEN (not IF) HIS specialist finds problems with her heart.  I told him she already had blood tests, etc. four months ago.  NO, they must have them done again.  Money grubber, anyone?  Then, he said she has blood in her eye and pointed to the WHITE film over it as proof.  I said nothing but I had her eyes examined only FOUR days before going to him, and the WHITE FILM IS A CATARACT. In addition, he never really noticed her, or looked her over, and was very unfriendly and cold toward her.  Even to the point that even though this frail, frightened, blind and tiny girl almost fell off his table while right next to him, he didn't bat an eye.  Couldn't be bothered with holding her or catching her.  Luckily his much nicer tech. did.  I can only imagine the office got friends and family to write good reviews.  He is now in my top three list of the worse vets I ever encountered.  Hey, if a vet doesn't even listen to why you're actually there, and doesn't know about the side effects of a common drug, what good can you say?  Also, tip to pet parents, he's also the third vet I've encountered who has a question on the form you fill out, that basically asks how much money you're willing to spend on your pet.  Wanna bet that's the first thing they look at?  Every vet I've encountered who has this question ended up being a rip off.  From now on I'll run out of the office as soon as I see that question."
0,"I flagged the \""doctors\"" reply.  It is filled with lies, as it would be.  I have nothing to gain by making false statements.  He has $$$$$  to lose if people heed my warning and avoid his practice.  I have proof from THREE other vets that his diagnosis was WRONG.  If my dog had blood in her eye, it would be there the next day, too.  I took her to a chiropractic  vet in AZ the next day.  After adjusting her, he looked in her eye with an instrument.  NO BLOOD.  \nPlus, Bishop  did not bother to look at my dog, or check her over in any way.  NOTHING.  NADA.   He just announced very DIRE supposed concerns that required IMMEDIATE and EXPENSIVE procedures in HIS OFFICE, without any initial exam, or even listening to me about her history. All of this based on the fact that she was coughing.  He completely ignored my every word.  It is true she was knocked by a bigger (not huge, about 10 lb.) dog.  Yet he ignored that, until his rebuttal now.  He did not look at her little back or legs, etc., to see if they were sore or bruised,.  After I took her to the chiropractor in AZ (who sadly isn't on Yelp, as he is expensive but SUPERB and worth every penny) she was much better.  I also was concerned about the Flovent she was on and the Dr. in CA (who also checked her eye WITH AN INSTRUMENT unlike Bishop) said she was having a reaction to it.  In Fact, Bishop said he knows NOTHING about Flovent and then ignored my concern about it.  So it's odd he brings it up now.  He just kept yelling how she's obviously in heart failure.    It nauseates me that some vets do this to loving pet parents, esp. when their baby is getting older and they get more concerned.  But as I said, as a rescuer, I'm a pro at this by now, and know when I'm being given a grotesque sales pitch.   I give good reviews when they're warranted.  I have NO reason not to. BTW, I'd been to the office of the \""specialist\"" he was going to refer me to (read my review on the Vet. Specialists in Gilbert).  NO THANKS.  And the other \""specialist\""  was at another office I'd been to.  They wanted to put my dog UNDER (yes, anesthesia) to take a STICKER out of her leg.  What?  \""Well, because poking with a needle, to pop it out hurts\"".  Oh, so when you give a shot to a dog, you put them under for that, too?  Obviously birds of a feather stick together."
0,"I live in the central phoenix area and this was the best reviewed office around so i decided to give them a shot. My 5mo old puppy had a bit of nasal discharge this morning and after reading up about it online, i decided to seek a professional opinion. This clinic opens at 7am, I called around 7:15 am and got through to their messaging service. The friendly operator said someone will get back with me shortly. An our and a half later, still no call so I brought my puppy in. The front desk and staff were very friendly and let me use a room to wait in due to the condition of my pup. The vet came to see me after 45 minutes of waiting and was surprisingly uninformational, took the pups temperature took a look at him and said \""well it could be anything really\"".\nI honestly got more information from reading webmd than from going to see Dr. Halver. He prescribed my pup $66 antibiotics and $45 nasal drops on top of a $57 exam fee. I would say comparatively this place is very expensive and I did not feel important to the doctor there. Will not be visiting this clinic again."
0,"It's upsetting booking an apt and being told one price for an exam and then being told in person that it's actually double. Because I have a lizard. They knew I had a lizard when I booked my apt but failed to communicate the correct price.  Then Melissa had the nerve to tell me in a snotty tone that I was free to pursue \""MORE AFFORDABLE\"" treatment for my pet and then call me \""rude\"" for sitting in their office and calling the vets near by to see if they had any openings left for today.  And \""wasting their time\""..... I think it's the other way around. When actually it was a wast of my time because I was lied to on the phone and cancelled my other appointment that I was no longer able to get back. Horrible customer service.  I will not be recommending or coming back."
0,Worst wait staff and management i have ever experienced in my life!!! Kinda feels like a retirement home.
0,The food was really bad.   And my son didn't touch his Cuz it was that yucky.   The waitress wasn't that friendly and didn't bother asking us if we wanted to try something else.  Since we barely ate any of it.   Good customer service is offering something else or at least a deduction for uneaten meals.   Will not go back.
0,"But the rating goes mainly for the staff. Been with the office close to 10 years, due to past good experiences even fired my specialists and relyed on Dr James and wife Dr Jacqueline Doris for my care.\nMissing test results from labwork dated 10-15-12 are however a bone of contentment with the staff, especially the office manager, who takes quieries through my electronic chart access as an insult(?). Is asking for the test results- all test results- not my patient right? should I not have been advised on later appointments what the results are?\nIf i had some ungodly illness, shouldn't I be informed to keep the rest of the world uninfected??"
0,"I love Dr. Shealey, she is awesome.  However, the \""referral coordinator\"" Dawn and \""aide\"" Mary are completely rude and condescending.  They do NOT want to help they just want to get you off the phone.  I had and appointment with the Dr. and asked for a referral to bariatrics, because I knew the program required an official referral from my PCP (my patient coordinator had even checked my benefits.  In the mail, Dawn sent me a letterhead stating \""your insurance does not require a referral.\""  I called them explaining that although upfront it does not generally require a referral, for this program, and according to the procedure code, it does.  She became very condescending and told me she'd been doing this 15 years and they \""don't do that\"" (give the referral I needed, even though Dr. Shealey had said it was a good idea and agreed to....) and continued to transfer me back to Mary who was also very rude and just said \""WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?  MAKE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT AND TALK TO HER!\""  They are just horrible!!!!!!!  Pray you never have to talk to anyone but the Drs. there...."
0,I was looking for a new doctor and came across Arcadia Family Clinic. I called to make my appointment on a Monday. They verified my insurance while I was on the phone and I was excited to hear there was an open appointment the next day! When I went for my appointment I had my insurance card and ID ready as they had asked the day before. When I was called up to the desk ( 10 min after arriving) I was told immediately that they don't take my insurance! I told the woman at the desk that they had just verified it the day before. She looked in a folder and said sorry we don't take this. I don't understand how I can sit on a phone call for 7 minutes the day before and be told to come in only to be turned away immediately! I wasted my time at this clinic and they weren't even apologetic about the situation. I hope the next doctor I try is at least compassionate!
0,"dr bowey, yells at me on my first visit with her, because my previous doctor was available that day. However when I made my appointment a month prior I was advised that 'my' doctor will have moved to a different location and not available at Arcadia anymore. I don't want to run around for possible bloodwork and requested to be placed with a Doctor available in my prefered timeslot. \nThen Dr Bowey writes me a script, but I just found out from the pharmacy that all request for refills are denied as ' unknown patient'- funny since I've been with that location almost 15 years. \nAfter-hour care was nice enough to write me a script, but for the wrong dosage...\n\nSo now i've been without bloodpressure meds for 3 (!) days and counting.\n\nThe answering machine states that Dr Bowey doesn't do refills without an appointment, but the lady made very clear that she will not see me as a patient- so what am I to do??\n\nToo bad I can't give less than 1 star for this specific doctor"

0,"Service-Brand disconnect @Biltmore. Others have commented on the beauty and layout of this store, it's true: very nice. But recent experience not so great. \n\nWent in to buy a beautiful Chan Luu scarf in orange I saw a week ago. Couldn't stop thinking about it: a good sign I should buy it. It was gone. Seeing my disappointment, the sales woman offered to get it from another store. Perfect. She took me back to the \""behind the wall\"" scruffy service area (wow, Saks, might need a paint job back there if you intend customers to see it), and proceeded to take my address info and credit card. At the end of the transaction, I asked her if she was sure she ordered the orange scarf. She assured me yes, although could not show me on the order that it was indeed the orange one. \""Well, it has to be the one they call 'melon.' There really was no other option.\"" Hmmm. Then, I noticed a $15 \""ground\"" charge. This was a shock. \""I'm paying $15 in shipping?\"" I asked. \""Yes, unless you use your Saks card, you pay shipping.\"" A) You've got to be kidding me, I would have gone down to Scottsdale Fashion Mall myself. B) You assess this charge without even letting a customer know that would be the case? C) $15 to ship a wispy scarf?  Not your best, Saks. Definitely a brand disconnect from a customer experience view."
0,Personally if I am shopping somewhere as high end as Saks Fifth Avenue where they cater to a higher end clientele I think I deserve good customer service. I came by here today to return a shirt that I had bought recently and received major attitude by the gentleman who helped me. He treated me as though I was an inconvenience to him. I then proceeded to go upstairs to purchase some jeans and the sales guy was rude and made me feel the same way! Horrible and seriously unacceptable and I don't plan on shopping here in the future and you shouldn't either.

0,"I am writing this review to help LV buyers to think before spending thousand of dollars for a Louis Vutton bags. Sure, Its a classy & beautiful bag, but is it worth it? Ever since I was a little girl I have always admired LV bags until this incident. Before you buy this bag, make sure 100% that this is the bag you really want.. \nI received a beautiful LV bag for christmas. I was excited and used it to go to the store for about 15min. I decided that I do not want such an expensive bag.  I repacked everything and gently put it in the box. The bag was purchased on Dec 23. After christmas I went to the store to return it. I was greeted by 2 sa, then she looked at my receipts. Then another sa inspected the bag. He asked if I used the bag? I was honest, I said I did but for only 15min. He replied \"" unfortunately because you used it all sales are final\"". At that, the other sa put my receipts down and walked away without a word. I was shocked, I could not believe it! The reciepts stated that I have 14 days to return. What can we do? I dont want this to happen to anyone. I have totally lost my desire to own any of this bags.Lesson learned, I will never ever walk in to the LV store again.

0,"I purchased a pair similar to these. After about two years of gentile use, the thong on the left sandal fell apart. Since Dillards won't accept returns items this old and because it appears to be an obvious defect, I wrote to Cole Haan for a replacement. All they could offer me was a 30% discount off of my next purchase. Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I really thought Cole Haan quality was superior and that stye would stand behind their products if something went wrong. Turns out I was wrong. Others need to consider this before paying a premium to purchase Cole Haan products."
0,"The summary is that I could have been better served and diagnosed by a blind monkey than I was by Dr. Lawrence Kramer and his staff.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I'm not normally one to be negative.  But I have never left a place of business feeling more disgusted, useless, and violated than I did today.  \n\nMy experience: I made an appointment at 11:15.  Showed up at 11:15.  Didn't get in until 12:00.  Then, my appointment with Dr. Lawrence Kramer was shorter than the time the nurse took to measure and weigh me. Dr. Lawrence Kramer cares only about getting you out as soon as you come in to make more $$$$ by seeing more patients.  \n\nAnd patient beware: he'll try to get you to buy more stuff in the short amount of time he'll spend with you.  First he tried to force a chest exam on me...then it was a flu shot.  And I'm supposed to trust this guy?  He doesn't even try to diagnose the problem, and then wants more $$$ by prescribing stuff that is totally unrealated to the reason why I'm there.  \n\nAfter my experience with Dr. Lawrence Kramer, I went outside and ran into one of the workers in the building.  I told her about my experience, and she asked about the doctor.  I said, 'I went to see Dr. Lawrence Kramer.'   She said, 'Go figure.  That doctor is the worst.  He only cares about the signing off on tickets.'\n\nEnough said.  Take your kids, your health problems, and your medical insurance far away from Dr. Kramer at the Biltmore Medical Center on Highland.  Hopefully the lull in his practice forces him to reevaluate how he treats his patients."
0,"I rarely give 1 star reviews, but in this case I had no choice. I needed an appointment on fairly short notice so when I found Dr. Kramer had an opening for the next day I jumped on it. I made my appointment online via Zoc Doc. I was also able to fill out all my paperwork online avoiding a long wait at the office. Arrive at 3:30 for my 3:45 appointment. The office was filled with screaming children. The receptionist needed my ID and insurance card. I had to fill out a quick consent form which was fine. \n\n45 minutes later I'm summoned back to Dr. Kramer office. I waited another 10 minutes in there before his PA arrived. She then proceeds to ask  me every single question that I already answered online which should have eliminated this long ass process. Finally Dr. Kramer arrives at 5:00. More questions, more examining. His conclusion was that I did not have a bacterial infection. I did however have a viral infection. He prescribed a Z pack. 4 days later and I feel exactly the same. I called his office yesterday and told them what is going on. I was then told that what he prescribed won't work because I did not have a bacterial infection and viral infections go away on it's on in about 6 weeks, but the Dr. needs to see you again. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????? I asked the lady what he was going to do different on my next visit that he didn't do on the first visit. No answer.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning to Dr. Kramer. If you simply want to give your money away I suggest an organization like PAWS (pets are worth saving) because Dr. Kramer ripped me off and had the nerve to try to do it a second time."

I hope nobody else has been duped.  Beware!  I feel cheated and very appalled that this happened.  This story isn't over, so let's see how much worse it can get..."
0,"It's been about 3 weeks since this incident happen, I wish I could say it improved, but it didn't, it got much worse.  After we finally got in touch with Mr. Olson, he apologized and tried to blame it on the supplier saying they mismarked the ring, even though the last time we had spoken with somoeone it was because of a \""bad employee\"".   They agreed to replace the ring from the supplier, yet last Friday,  they informed my husband they just got the materials and the ring would be done shortly ( they made the ring, big mistake).  The ring was such poor quality , that I actually laughed when I saw it.  Their were scorch marks around the crooked channel set diamonds.  The wave actually covered part of the diamond. I was livid!  I took the ring to another jeweler, because Mr. Olson had agreed to allow an outside appraisal event hough they did their own (that was a joke).  The other jeweler I took the ring to was appalled by the quality of the ring.  She said the scorch marks on the ring  were from them trying to solder the diamonds in.  She also saw bubbles in the platinum along with the crooked channel setting.  I took the ring back to Mr. Olson right after speaking with the other jeweler, and he didn't understand why I was so upset.  He finally admitted to seeing the wave in the ring and heard him discuss it with his jeweler about the quality.  He tried to tell me that they were rushed and then the reason they couldn't order another ring was because it was an \""Estate ring\"" (this was new)......Finally he offered me a refund \""Because I obviously can't make you happy\"", well no you can't if you provide poor service and poor quality materials.  Its extremely upsetting that we no longer have our rings that we made our vows with...That's something we can never get back.  \nFortunately, we went to Molina's this afternoon and purchased our new beautiful and symmetrical wedding bands.  Their service and quality were amazing and comforting.  I wish we would have purchased our bands here from the beginning (lesson learned). By the way, has I was talking with Mr. Olson, he had opened up a folder with our names on it,  he had a printed copy of my yelp review and stapled it to the folder...so  guess this is another one he can add!!!!"
0,"Groupon rip-off. Small salad, three extremely small plates of mediocre pasta desserts that cloyed the palate. All for an advertised value of $90. Will NEVER return."
0,Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.
0,"The only thing less fresh than their 1980's decor was the food on their buffet.\n\nWalk in and you will be greeted by an eccentric person in a leisure suit, you can either go in the glass doors with acrylic handles or in to the mirrored room with zebra booth and old conference table chairs. No this is not a gentlemen's club it is a a restaurant that just lacks windows. \n\nFor Mother's day they had a buffet only setup, and what mom does not love cold food that has been sitting out for an undetermined  amount of time. The croutons in the Cesar salad were soggy as were the crustinni under the bruchetta. The pasta was cool. Even worse the butter soaked farm raised salmon cubes were just luke warm. The vegetables were mush and again just luke warm. The mozzarella in the caprese on the buffet was not made in house as it was firm and flavorless. \n\n\nThe real amusing part was on the dessert section. There was a plate of items straight from Costco, lemon bites, cookies and cinnamon twists just as you would by at Costo, on a plate and picked over.  \n\nThis is one relic that is better left in the past, horribly dated decor, sub par food at high prices means this place should be avoided."
0,NASTY! Gordon Ramsay would have ripped this place apart. I'm imagining that's why there were only 6 people in this fairly large awkward restaurant on  a Friday night.  Completely outdated overpriced food. $26 for the grossest chicken Francese I have ever eaten. What a ripoff! Also their house wine is $10 a glass ( barefoot brand) will never return.
0,"I went there for Mother's Day, and after reading many of the reviews here, it was exactly as I expected it to be. Coming here was not my idea. It is sub-par, old school (cough-cough) Italian out of the 60's. Most places would have given a Mimosa with brunch or even a rose to mom. Not here. There was a large display of some stuff they called food, but it was gross. Believe me, folks, this is not Italian but some semblance of what they called Italian. I am ashamed for them. \n\nAs others suggested, the pasta was mush; there were breakfast buns on the dessert table, grizzled lamb, and butter knives for cutting meat, which could not cut through the ham! Someone mentioned the desserts were probably bought at Costo. I felt the same. This was all for the price of around $40 per person. Ugh! \n\nDid I mention the over-priced, watered down drinks? No real Italian would ever put cheddar cheese on an antipasto. Did I mention our food plates were piling up on our table, but no one came to take them away? Service was lacking for a place that didn't have to worry about serving food for the day. \n\nEvery item at the buffet table should have had a serving utensil but many had none. I was very uncomfortable having to pick with my hands. It was all poor quality food and poorly prepared. Not for foodies and especially not for real Italians!"
0,"Our reservation was set for 7:30pm on a Saturday, we arrived to a nearly empty establishment with outdated d\u00e9cor and senior citizen to match. That should've been red flag number one. We waited at the entrance for a few moments before we were greeted by whom I guess was the owner. He said he had been expecting us, sat us at our table and disappeared for the remainder of the evening.  Our waiter was odd; he seemed to be in a rush and irritated even though the place was empty. For starters we ordered the pasta trio sampler and the Oyster Rockefeller.  The only thing memorable about the sampler was the gnocchi which was as good as most yelpers mentioned. The Rockefeller may have been the worse I've ever had; the oysters were so tiny I could barely discern them in the heavily creamed spinach. I'm not sure how something so creamy can be so utterly bland and flat. For the entr\u00e9e I had the Salmon which again was drowned in a weird sauce that covered the entire plate. The salmon was moist but the sauce was putrid. It tasted at least 3 days old. The sides were cold oven roasted potatoes which again were covered in that odd sauce. For the finale, I tried the Cr\u00e8me Brulee, again that was a mistake. It was ice cold and had chunks of pineapples in it which is not normal nor was it ever mentioned. The top of the brulee was not properly browned and didn't crack when my spoon hit it. I look forward to cracking my Cr\u00e8me Brulee, darn! Needless to say I will never be back here again."
0,"Ive been having my car serviced here for 6 years.  The last time they failed to tighten any of the lug nuts on one of the wheels after a tire rotation.  i drove away and nearly crashed.  I had to call them to tell them to come out and tighten the wheel as it was barely on the car.  I never received an apology, an admission of guilt...when I called them the next day, they said they could perhaps give me a free oil change.  Really?!? My days with them are over.  They are careless and do not take ownership of their mistakes.  Zero customer service!"
0,"If I could give a negative star I would. Shoddy work, inept & rude. \nMy husband took his car for an alignment adjustment. When the technician pulled his car out of the bay he backed it in to another customer's truck, leaving our car with a nice dent in the rear quarter panel! Although apologetic, it was several days & multiple phone calls before they even agreed to pay for repairs. \nLet me pause here to tell you how terribly we were treated from here on out. From the rude cashier in the office, to the silent corporate office. They all made it abundantly clear that we were a bother.\nUpon delivering the 3 requested repair quotes, the cashier gal told my husband to go get a quote from a particular 4th repair shop, in Mesa, across town. When I returned with the quote (from said repair shop 20 miles from my house), I asked why their corporate office didn't tell us this in the 1st place? She said that it was her idea because she knew someone at this other shop. What? The repair quotes averaged about $2000 & 4 days for the repair. \nAbout 3 weeks later and many unreturned calls to their office, my husband finally hears from corporate. They will send a check (in a barely reasonable amount), and will not cover a rental car nor time or gas for running around collecting quotes, nor hassle. Wow! So, clearly customer service is NOT a priority for them.\nHere's the kicker: we had to take it to another shop to have the alignment fixed because they didn't do the initial work properly."
0,"Im not sure what the hell people are smoking before they come here to give this place anything more than a 0 star... I literally hated this place. I usually go to the one in Tempe, which is very nice.. Okay so this place blows... the staff is running around like animals not tending the guest and its just chaotic... so we start and the lane isnt work, its not starting the balls dont come back when we throw them and the gates are randomly coming down before we throw the ball, or before the ball hits the pins? WTF? The food is expensive... as expected since the others are.. but seriously we paid for unlimited bowling for 2 hours and stayed for like one hour. Also all the balls... well unless you have little kids thumbs, or giant hands, they wont fit the balls.. which in my opinion is like the # 1 thing when bowling... having a ball that fits... oh well. The lanes are oiled to hell and you feel like youll slip every time you go down to bowl.. thats awesome.. pay 15.00 to fit my fingers into smaller holes, break my neck while bowling, have the ball get blocked by a gate, and not get served? wow.. i know ill never go back to this one at least."
0,"Okay, I have lived in Phoenix and in LA. I have always thought LA was more expensive until my experience at Maroney's Cleaners. Holy Crap Ohla!!! I paid $7.65 for a pair of lined pants to get cleaned by them. Now, I have paid anywhere from $1.50 to $5.50 but are you kidding me $7.65. Then to top it off...I was a bit disappointed in the actual dry cleaning service because my pants were not perfect!!! So, after I was done throwing a temper-tantrum in the tahoe I then proceeded to call and text everyone I know (okay just kidding) about my frustrations. The drive up service is convenient however the price is NOT WORTH IT!!!"
0,Soooo expensive.  They come up with arbitrary charges that end up costing an arm and a leg.  They also ripped the seam on one of my shirts in the process of cleaning it.  Would NOT recommend.  There is a $2.25 dry cleaner right down the street on Indian School that I've started going to instead.
0,"Overpriced!\n\nThey don't clean your clothes any better than any other cleaners, but you pay for the convenience of the drive-up service.\n\nUnless there's some reason that you can't get out of your car, I'd advise driving past this place and taking the time to walk in somewhere else."
0,"Not impressed. Dropped a tablecloth for a work event off here and was told would take two weeks because of the size.  Seems a bit long but this is the first time I've left a non-clothing item anywhere so, ok. \nCalled day before expected date of completion to confirm and was told it would be ready at 5pm and I said I'd be by the next am. \nI roll in and it's not done!  Pointing fingers and asking who I spoke to?  Didn't think to ask unless I was told it wasn't going to be ready.  Woman was apologetic. Writing this review in the parking lot while they press it. It was just going to be washed in cold water, hung to dry and pressed. No cost taken off the $30."
0,So I dropped off tow shirts a few days ago for dry cleaning.\nI ask the guy how much and he said 6.95 and I have to pay when I pick em up.\nPicked up the shirts today and the total was $13.90\nThe 1st and last time I went to Maroney's.\nThose guys should be in the money laundry business IMHO.
0,"I went to Jerry's last night for dinner.  We always eat there and usually like the atmosphere.  This time there were protesters there with anti-Nazi signs.  They told me that a man was present signing books and speaking to a group of people.  His name is David Irving and he was invited to speak by the group about his beliefs that the Holocaust didn't happen.  And that Hitler never knew about the Jews being slaughtered.  This is sick and made me lose my appetite.  Why would a restaurant like Jerry's support a local Neo-Nazi group?  Apparently, they hold the monthly meetings of the group there as well.  I do not plan to return to this location for any meal in case I run across this type of hatred again.\n4.9.12 Since that time, I have been following the story of David Irving.  He has not returned to this restaurant again but went to a hotel near the airport maybe a year later.  It was guarded by the Phx police red squad.  At least the protesters wacked this mole back into his hole for now."
0,"just ew.\n\ndirty bathrooms.\nplastic-y vegetables.\nwatery gravy.\nbland mashed potatoes.\niceberg lettuce and pink tomato \""salad.\""\n\nthis is the taco bell of diners...the food is cheap for a reason. do yourself a favor and skip it. when denny's food looks fresh in comparison, you know you're in the wrong place.\n\n*sigh*\n\nlola"
0,"Ok.... This was an awful experience!!! A friend and I decided to check thus spot out because we pass it frequently, it was late, we were hungry and it was open. It's was fairly slow with 7 tables or so occupied, however, there was only one waitress. We noticed the food coming out pretty fast which was cool, however, the waitress was AWFUL.... so rude and unprofessional. We ordered a milk shake because they are suppose to be known for great milkshakes but was we was served was a watery mess. We explained we didn't want it and she told us we still would pay for them. After contesting, she grabbed the milkshakes, said something in spanish and walked off. Seconds later, she slams the cups in the sink and began yelling. Luckily, we already had our food!!! From that moment on she had the worst attitude and tossed the bill in the table and walked away!!!! The food was good but the service is the WORST!!!! Yikes!!!!!"
0,"First time trying the place. Had my doubts and my doubts were right. Cute place, cute menu but god awful food. Started off with potato crunchers (jalapeno like poppers) $4.99 those were good but the food didn't make up for the poppers. Ordered the honey fried chicken (8.99) which comes with: carrots, side salad (horrible), cornbread (inedible) and french fries (good). Husband had chix fried steak. BLECH!!! that's all I can say. I really liked the carrots and though they were the bet part of the meal. Let's just say don't waste your time."
0,"I'm reluctant to write a negative review as I understand how hard it is to run a business, but the service I received today was abysmal. I have a group of friends that eat their regularly so I've seen this place go up and down with quality. \n\nThe big issue is there's no attention to detail when the orders go back to the kitchen. They actually seem to have a tendency to do the exact opposite of what's requested. Don't get me wrong, when it's good it's good, but I've seen more food sent back to the kitchen at this restaurant than anywhere else. It's got to the point at times that I've seen the waiting staff actually argue with the cook.\n\nWhen I arrived tonight my hopes were high, as the manager was actually here for the first time in months. She was aware that our group had complaints and actually came to talk to us about issues the kitchen of been having. After what seemed to be a constructive talk we placed our orders with the waitress with confidence. Well, needless to say my food was incorrect again. Not only was it wrong, it almost seemed intentionally incorrect. When I express my dismay the manager went and brought the cook out which made me very uncomfortable. \n\nAt this point I was ready to cancel the order altogether, but they said they take the food back to correct it. What the manager brought to the table the second time was worse than the first. I wish I could say I couldn't believe it, but I've gotten quite used to this level of incompetence from this restaurant. I sent it back and told them to cancel the order altogether.\n\nThe only bright spot about this restaurant is the waiters and waitresses do seem to work hard, it's just the kitchen throws them under the bus with their incompetence and the management under staffs them so they always have too many tables.\n\nI guess the only thing left for me to do is try and convince the 15 top that comes to eat there on a weekly basis that we need to start going to another restaurant, but my friends are a little stuck in their ways.\n\nUgh!!!"
0,"Had to just walk out of here. They had a big party in the back room, and couldn't be bothered to help anyone else. \n\nWe sat for 10 minutes before the server came to take our order. She didn't say hi, didn't say there would be a delay. \n\nWaited 20 more before asking how much longer. She didn't know. The only cook wasn't talking to her. We got up and left. This was Saturday at dinner time. Lame!"
0,weve eaten here on many occassions but the last three times the sevice has been very bad along with the food. We order breakfast which is varly easy to prepare. The food takes over 40minutes to make and comes out cold and part of my omilet vegitables were raw. There was so many things wrong with the food that we will not go back again and I don't have the time to list them. It's perty sad when I at 65years of age can cook better then the cooks at JERRY'S . Do your self a faver don't go there or at lest till they get someone that COOK!!!!
0,"The service is APPALLING. We stood at the door for 5 minutes with waitresses walking past constantly and saying nothing. Finally when a waitress did acknowledge us, she waved to the dining room and just said \""where ever\"" and walked away. Not even a hello, or sorry to keep you waiting. THEN, we sat at our table for 5 minutes without anyone saying hello, while again waitresses walked past many times. Finally a lady got our drinks, and even though we were ready to order, told us she'd be right back. 10 minutes passed. Another server who literally just started (we saw her walk in and put her bag down) came over and asked if we were ready. Yeah. 10 minutes ago. No one apologized. No one cared. We were just an inconvenience. The food is good but the service is ALWAYS awful and it's just NOT worth it. Hire more servers!! Maybe then people will want to come back. - Sincerely, I'm usually a 30% tipper and today it's 5%."
0,"Gross. Gross. Gross. Pass this place. Service is awful and the food was just as bad. Greasy, low quality slop."
0,"My bf was visting from Colorado Springs and we were in the mood for seafood, yeah in Phoenix, but we decided to try this place anyway. What were we thinking? There was nothing wrong with service, the food was terrible. It's definitely not what you expect when you look the price, really pricey. We shared oysters for the appetizer. I ordered a clam chowder. It was fine, not outstanding but edible. My bf ordered a ceasar salad, the plate was warm, the romaine was wilted. He is not a picky person but he did not hesitate to send it back. I ordered the scallops which were ok, a little on the rubbery side and it came with brown risotto. It was all too dry, I had to get an extra glass of water to wash it all down. It sat like a lump in my stomach, leaving no room for desert. My bf chose the mussels in an herb de provance soup. It was a bunch mussles that looked like they were swimming in yellow water. The taste? None, it was tasteless and watered down, no butter, no white wine, nothing to make it taste good. The herbs did nothing for the dish.\nWould I go back to give it a second chance, nah, not for the price. The most unsatisfying place I have ever eaten."
0,"We have tried twice to eat here, and twice it has been closed. Yet every time I drive by it, the parking lot is packed. What restaurant doesn't serve dinner on Saturdays?"
0,"Mediocre food.  Mediocre service. Sometimes you can, indeed, judge a book by its cover, and this place proves it.  I was going to write a long, detailed discussion of everything that sucked about my lunch there today, but I'll let the fact that this is my first one-star review (and I've reviewed some real dives) speak for itself."
0,"So we finally ate here. The decor has not been updated since about 1967, and we were surrounded by overweight senior citizens reeking of cigarette smoke. The food was reminiscent of middle school cafeteria fare. \n\nThe waitresses were very friendly, and the prices were not bad. We were obviously not the target demographic, though. Won't be back. Too bad, because we can walk there..."
0,"Let me preface this review by saying two things: 1. if there was an option for negative stars, I'd give it and 2. I just ate there about 20 minutes ago and am still feeling pissed off. My husband and I were in the mood for a good breakfast this morning, so we got to thinking...Matt's? Matt's is always awesome, but we didn't feel like waiting out in the rain for over an hour. The Original Pancake House? It's a close second so we opted for that and headed out. Once we got there, we realized 350 other people had the same idea as us and the wait would be about an hour. Not feeling like waiting, we hopped back in the car and jumped on our phones to check out what Yelp thought would be good nearby. Linda's was one of the places that popped up along our drive and we had both passed it a few times, always talking about wanting to try it. We looked at the reviews and there were lots of good ones raving about the food (Really? Guy who said it was Matt's with pie? Really? I don't know where the hell you get off, but I'm holding you partially responsible for totally jacking up my Sunday breakfast). We got inside and the place is a real shithole. I don't mind, because I typically love eating at shady looking places and drinking in dive bars. It's like a real \""slice of life\"" type of thing and I find the experience usually excels where the decor is lacking. Everything was blue and mauve...I haven't seen this much mauve since the late 80's. And again, that would usually be fine, except in this case, it doesn't look like anyone has cleaned the place since then either. Everywhere I looked, things were grimy and just not...clean. We sat at the counter (first mistake) and both ordered the JJ's Special (second mistake). Sitting at the counter was like having a backstage pass to a Michael Bolton show...or some other really shitty person you would never want to see backstage. We could see the entire operation and hear the cook bitching the whole time. That's right, I said cook. Singular. One person working in the kitchen. She came out a few times to yell at our server, called Linda (I sincerely hope it was not the owner Linda). She looked like the grandma from Napolean Dynamite. For those of you that get the reference, enough said. We could hear the dinging of microwave ovens and the grumbling of Napolean Dynamite's grandma in the weeds with tickets that she couldn't read due to Linda's supposedly shitty handwriting. We waited over a half hour for our food. Granted, we didn't have to wait to sit but seriously, a half hour for eggs, bacon and pancakes. When the food came out I was already over it. I took one look at the plate and knew this was not going to be good. My \""over-easy\"" egg had totally runny whites and looked more like a sunny-side-up gone wrong. My bacon looked like it came from Fry's and the pancakes were the only edible thing on my plate. I don't know if they were edible because everything else was so totally shitty or if it was because I am 9 months pregnant and would have eaten shit cakes at that point. Nevertheless, the ambiance combined with the service and the food made for the absolute worst $28 I've ever spent on breakfast. $28 dollars!! For me and my husband to have pancakes, eggs, bacon and coffee. That did NOT include toast or potatoes and half the plate was inedible. It makes my blood boil just thinking of it and as I sit here writing, I am still starving. We should have just gone to the brass rail. Better service, better food quality (I am not joking) and it would have been $5.50 a person for the same meal. You fooled me once Linda. Shame on me. You won't be fooling me again!"
0,"They don't seem to care about our business. They botched our delivery because they thought they didn't have the stones, even though they did.  They were rude, unhelpful, and about an hour and a half late.  They didn't think any of this was a problem.\n\nWe'll try one other local place. We have about $10k in landscaping lined up, but if the local guys are all this indifferent to small orders, I won't trust them with the large ones. Marvel certainly isn't getting a second chance."
0,Not happy with Marvel....have to agree that they don't care about their customers.  I ordered 10 tons of rocks and scheduled a 7am delivery time.  It is now 11:30am and they still aren't here.  I lost half a day of work and have been paying workers who have been standing around all morning because the materials aren't here.  Very frustrated with this place and will never use them again!
0,The employees here need some serious training. They have no concept of customer service. They also have supply chain issues (always out of product and never know when it is coming in). I have tried Marvel a few times and each time the experience got worse. Will never go back now.
0,"Nice people, but when you take in 3 pairs of $150 jeans to have them shortened and they say yes we can keep the original hem apparently they think that means to cut off the original hem and stitch the alteration as close to they originally looked as possible. Everywhere else in the world that's called matching the stitch (which is usually cheaper) but not keeping the hem. Two totally different things and matching stitching isn't worth $10 per alteration. One last thing, they didn't even match the thread color and width well. Original is a faded yellow and they used a shiny bright yellow. Looks totally sloppy.\n\nThey refused a refund and said they would fix it at the same price with the actual hem... If we went through a box of a ton of alterations scraps and matched it. Total scam artists. Too bad cash was paid or they would be getting a challenge from my credit card. \n\nI found them by yelp and hopefully other people consider this review before giving these dishonest business people any money."
0,"Took in one pair of pants to have a small hole in the groin area fixed. They took an extra two days then stated, was way over priced, and the pants look awful. Actually had to take them some where else in order to get them to being wearable again, will never go back."
0,"Booo! \n\nI can't stand Sprint. Not to go all \""Consumer Reports\"" on Yelp, but my report is that Sprint is an unethical, slimey, seething parasite to our society.\n\nThey \""fine print\"" you to death, so that before you know it your once manageable phone bill now has ballooned beyond your most pessimistic expectations. \n\nThey change phone plans, so that you can't switch up or down for anytime minutes without taking a serious hit. \n\nOn top of that, they make you renew your contract for two years every time you need to adjust your plan. \n\nNightmarish - that's the word I was reaching for."
0,"I realize that most people who need a phone usually don't check reviews on Yelp, but for those that do, stay away from this location. These people are trained to tell bald face lies in order to make sales. The reason I say trained is because I've seen a pattern with the employees. I was told in March of 2011 that I should buy a 4G Samsung 1 because 4G would be coming out any day. A year and 1/2 later I dropped the phone and cracked the scree and still on contract I told them I did not want an upgraded Samsung III if they weren't coming out of 4G anytime soon, the the next employee sounded like he was giving me the same sale pitch the first one did, that 4G was coming out, giving me that nudge to spend more money than I wanted to.\n\nAlso I was sold a Sprint MIFI and I was told you could go anywhere at anytime and connect to the internet. After about 6 visits to this location for tech support, we end up resetting the thing each time, but if I'm in the field, and since that's required every single time I use it, I might as well just use my phone for internet and save 10-15 minutes. I paid $100 of this Piece of cr..p thing and $37 per month and they flat out refuse to let me out of the contract.\n\nI was being sarcastic when the manager after several tech support visits between my phones and MIFI asked me my name and I told him he should know it by now, and his response was that I should be thankful that at least someone was helping me.\n\nIt's damn near a monopoly, but not quite. There's still Verizon and T-Mobile, and god forbid running a business with Cricket, which is a small step down from Sprint."
0,"Don't bother scheduling your appointment in advance online(they never received my reservation even though I had a confirmation number.). Also make sure you give your name at \""check-in\"" to at least three different people to make sure you get on the list.  Worst customer service."
0,"How this store stays open, I have no idea. I went in to buy the iphone 6 16gb 5 weeks. The 16gb was actually in the store. I let the salse rep ANGEL talk me into the 64gb only because she said it was going to arrive in 3-4 DAYS! Well, she is a liar, this store is filled with a bunch of liars. I then tried to cancel my order and to make a long story short, they lied to me over the phone just to get me to come back in the store. This would not be such a big deal if ANGEL had been honest with me. The fact that ANGEL lied to get a sales is sleazy! Hey, SPRINT, you guys need to close this store. \n\nSeriously, do anything you can to not come into this specific store. I've used sprint for over 10 years and never had an issue until now."
0,"Went in to this place because I was told by Best Buy and other Sprint reps that I needed to go to an actual store for an upgrade. For whatever reason I couldn't do it at Best Buy, that's another issue for later. I go in to the store hoping just for an answer as to WTF is going on with my acct. Well, I got no answers. Instead I got the run around and what I could do which would end up costing me a lot more money. Yeah, no thanks. The Sprint service sucks too much for me to want to pay more. But these guys treated me like I had no idea what I was talking about. I hate when people act like I don't know what I'm saying. Anyways. WORST customer service because I have NO answers. Don't waste your time here... or with Sprint for that matter."
0,"Apparently the management of this store has no clue what customer service is all about. What's more is even though I was in the store requesting an exchange on day 14 they count the day I received the phone, even though late that Saturday evening and despite the fact there was a holiday during this period, as day one.\n\nTwo weeks ago today I decided to leave Verizon with whom I have been reasonably satisfied except for cost, and explore other options. I have had a cellphone for 28 years and have, at one time or another, been with all of the major carriers. Two Saturdays ago I went to T-Mobile, AT&T and finally Sprint. On my way to this store I read the Yelp! reviews and thought to myself \""they can't really be THAT bad, can they?\"" I've since discovered they are WORSE.\n\nInitially I was very satisfied with the sales process. I actually went online the day before and reserved phones, chose my plan, etc. I was a bit miffed that online I was told I qualified for three lines with no deposit but in store and after \""further review\"" that I could only get two lines with a $50 deposit for each. I couldn't understand why as Verizon required no deposit from me two years ago and if anything my credit has improved somewhat sice but whatever. (When I received a letter from Sprint a week later it stated the phone number I provided could not be verified in public records. Are you kidding me? Guess I should have used my landline number. Oh well live and learn.) Because of this SNAFU the sales associate had to basically redo everything in the system so my time spent online was for naught but you can't fault an employee for crappy systems.\n\nNext day when I unboxed the phone and after charging it (even though I was told they are shipped to the store fully charged) and giving it a test drive I noticed a faint crackling static noise while streaming videos on YouTube. Initially I dismissed this as possibly being a fault with the video or possibly bad data connection but several days later while messing with ringtone options the same crackling static noise was there. As this was an HTC One M8 Harman Kardon edition and the main selling point was the superior audio quality I assumed getting a quick like-for-like exchange wouldn't be an issue. Wow was I wrong.\n\nAfter a lengthy back and forth with two different associates, one of whom the same person who sold me the phone, I was told that because it was now, by their strictest application of their policy, outside the14 day return policy, my only option was a refurbished phone through the insurance company. Really? One day and as I mentioned  earlier one of those days was a holiday during which no business could be transacted. Also this came after I was told by a member of their tech department there was nothing wrong with the phone and it was only after I demonstrated using the ringtones that they begrudgingly admitted there was indeed an issue. When I asked if I could appeal to a manager they informed me they were both managers and that nothing more could be done. When pressed a bit more , however, the assistant store manager was summoned. At last, I thought, someone who is empowered to make a customer happy. Wrong, again.\n\nHe introduced himself as Chuck and initially was upbeat and positive. Progress perhaps. I introduced myself as Charlie, plead my case, and he proceeded to tap away at the computer terminal. Good sign. Then he asked to see my phone again. He then proceeded to tell me had the phone been in like new condition perhaps he could have given me some leeway but since there was a gouge on the back of the phone that walking out of the store with a replacement was not an option. I wish I could take and post a picture of this\""gouge\"" which is actually a minute abrasion of the plastic backing which you'd need a micrometer to measure. At this point in time and knowing he was fishing for any excuse not to help me I became exasperated. At the very same time Chuck became a first class prick. Very unprofessional.\n\nI intend to send an email to corporate but I'm sure it will only resort in positive feedback to the employees at this store for towing the company line. \""No waivers, no favors.\"" So now I don't even have the option of cancellation without massive contract break fees. Be on notice, Sprint and the employees of the Town and Country store, on Monday there will be a call made to the AZ Attorney General's office as well as the Better Business Bureau about your lousy intractable business practices."
0,My vehicle was damaged during the detail....the manager Keith promised to fix the damage-- a lie...the detail was $350   damage $490--  do not risk having my experience at this company.    Dishonest  for responsibility and overpriced for the quality of detail!
0,"Ive had aprox. 5 alignments done there over the past few years and always had good work done.  Joel is always very nice, however Ken  (the older gentleman) is usually in a bad mood and probably needs to retire. Last time I was there he was very short and rude. I don't know if he was having a really bad day or what, but I wont be going back."
0,"Food poisoning for two, please...\n\nI am really confused by all the 4-star and 5-star reviews for this place. The 4-star average Yelp rating was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.\n\nSo I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.\n\nThe first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...\n\n3 Cheese Plate\nChef's Pate\nCalamari\nCrispy Duck Breast\nCreme Brulee\n\nThe food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.\n\nThe fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... \n\nBy shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.\n\nAfter going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.O\n\nSo by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.\n\nWe drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. \n\nOnce inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.\n\nSometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged. The official diagnosis was acute food poisoning. We were never able to identify the specific meal at Sophie's which poisoned us, as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each.\n\nHowever - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was Sophie's, they remarked \""oh, that place!\"". We learned that the ER at John C. Lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by Sophie's. The hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against Sophie's with the AZ Department of Health Services. They told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases, then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak.\n\nThis all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place. I can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet, or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere, too weak to write a review.\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night. After this experience, we lost all desire to dine in Phoenix ever again. Thanks, Sophie's, for ruining our trip.\n\nFor the record, we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned. I highly recommend CIBO. Great food, without food poisoning."
0,"The place was pretty deserted...I discovered  why. The inside has a slightly funky odor, like spoiled cheese and cheap wine. The owner was a sour faced jerk who demanded to know what I wanted. I'm assuming he was the owner because he had a European accent and his clothes were better than mine. And he had an aura of arrogance and authority.\n\nThat's all it took for me to turn around and walk out the door. If all French bistros are like this one, then I'm steering clear of them in general. Sophie's really sucks."
0,"RUN!!! Not only am I being charged 4X what I was told... he hit a nerve and I cannot feel part of my face. I was told.. oooh no big deal, it will come back in 6 weeks. It has now been 4 months and I still do not have full feeling restored. I was sent to collections without even getting my last bill in the mail. Please save your FACE and yourself major aggravation."
0,"It's 2005 and I was referred to my normal dentist to Reed for some extra teeth that were under my gum line.  Nothing really affected me but Reed suggested that he remove 3 wisdom teeth and 2 extra teeth below my gum line on my right lower side of my jaw.  So a total of 5 teeth.\n\nLittle did I know he was going to CUT AWAY my gum line and expose the roots of my existing teeth that were FINE. \n\nHe claimed it would be fine and the gums would grow back, they never did. The exposed sections of the roots caused infection in my gums and I lost a molar and am probably going to lose another one this year.  \n\nI haven't been able to chew solid food on the right side of my mouth for the past 9 years.  ridiculous. \n\nI'm currently looking for an oral surgeon to hopefully rectify this HACK JOB that Reed left me with nearly 9 years ago.  Every day of my life I regret going to Reed and after showing the results to my regular dentist, he stopped referring patients to Reed.\n\nEven the desk attendants were pushy about the surgery saying I should have them all removed in one session vs having them done in two sessions.  Clearly this office is money hungry and they don't care about the patient's well being post surgery."
0,"As if dentist/oral surgeon visits weren't bad enough, this place is AWFUL. \n\nI had to go here to have the rest of my wisdom tooth extractions because they were heavily impacted and needed surgery, which my regular (and awesome) dentist, Dr. Steen, could not perform.\n\nFirst, imagine what you'd like a surgical center's office staff to be like. Sure, clinical, because they do the same thing every day. But how about professional? Professional would be nice. It was awful from the get-go. The front office lady looked very un-washed and her makeup looked a few days old. No \""Hello\"" \""How are you\"" or \""How may I assist you\"", she just looked at us when we walked in and waited for us to say something. Then, \""Sign in\"". \n\nThere were some problems with payment and she not only was unbudging, she was straight up snooty about it. She actually asked if I wanted to remove the anesthesia to bring the cost down.\n\nUM, I'M GETTING ORAL SURGERY HERE, LADY. SOME DOCTOR IS GOING TO BE DRILLING INTO MY FACE AND SPATTERING BLOOD EVERYWHERE. I THINK I'LL KEEP THE ANESTHESIA. \n\nDo I look like the guy from A Million Little Pieces?\n\nThe doctor himself was very arrogant and Tom Cruise-esque in Cocktail, rolled up sleeves and all. He had the audacity to call my other doctor (Dr. Steen, great guy, very gentle) names because my recovery time was longer. \""Yeah, I'm really good at this, so it'll take ten minutes, tops. And you'll barely have any residual pain.\"" Look where I am now, Dr. Day! At the same pain levels as when I was with Dr. Steen. Ass. \n\nDr. Day's little nurse techs strapped me down in the chair and started talking about another tech rather disparagingly, as if I wasn't there. Helloooo, I'm about 6 inches from your face and am not yet sedated. Could you hold off on the shop talk until I'm off in dreamy dream land? Kthx.\n\nI would suggest you ask for a different referral if your dentist's office tries to send you here. Dr. Day and his staff are competent at best, but so rude and unprofessional, I'd rather go to Mexico than have anything else here."
0,"I just deleted a huge diatribe that I started writing here in favor of keeping this short & to the point: \n1 -- Dr. Day comes off as cold, arrogant and I didn't get the slightest sense that he wanted to do anything more for me than submit my insurance claim and get money.  \n2 -- His staff is short, rude, and seemingly bothered by patients as opposed to wanting to help them.  \n\nI will never return to this office and I will never recommend Dr. Day or his staff to anyone.\n\nIf you need oral surgery, call Perfect Teeth (see my review) and ask for a caring professional like Dr. Salb."
0,"we ordered three entrees for delivery. it took about forty five minutes and then the delivery guy proceeded to argue with my boyfriend over how much he should tip him. after finally handing over the greasy box with our food in it, we were disgusted to see some form of batter and seeds that should have been my sesame chicken. it was ominously labeled \""HCl.\"" the food was disgusting and I can't believe how rude the delivery guy was. we paid 35 dollars for nothing but disappointment. buyer beware. we certainly won't be back here."
0,Stay away.  It is dreadful.  Starting with the greasy apps and on to the Thai Chicken made with frozen French fries.   when I asked the manager he said because fresh potatoes take to long to cook.  \nReally??
0,the chicken wings gave me food poisoning.  will avoid in the future.
0,"The pizza has really never been any good but at one time it was a pizza and wings combo at a decent price. At this point, it's just overpriced greasy food. Bummer."
0,"Delivery was quick. However the pizza was like cardboard with burned cheese, and bland. I ordered a 2 liter soda pop online, and was told by the delivery driver that they were out and would give me a credit for next time i ordered from them. That was unacceptable, as i am never ordering from them again. The delivery driver did not understand my frustration with that and was rude and condescending when i complained."
0,"One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had.\n\nSo, I called on a Tuesday to see if I could get some pants hemmed for a wedding rehearsal dinner. The dinner was out of town, and my flight left Wednesday night, so I knew I was asking for a really quick turnaround and I apologized for that at the start of the conversation. \n\nMe - \""I kinda need these pants ready by tomorrow, is that even possible?\""\nMean PCT lady - \""Well, It's possible, I guess\""\nMe - \""Ok cool, well I'm not trying to be a jerk, but since I'm leaving tomorrow night, I need a yes or no answer... if it's no, that's totally understandable\""\nPCT devil woman - \""...I said it was possible, thats the same as yes, right?\""\nMe - \""Well, not really, possible implies that there is a chance...\""\nPCT satan - (cuts me off) \""Ok well thank you, but I can only tell you it's possible, so maybe you should try somewhere else.\"" (hangs up on me).\n\nI call Brother's Tailors and Clothing, they were sooo awesome and friendly and they hemmed my pants that day! I was still kinda mad about how rude the PCT lady was, so I called back to ask for her manager. After a long conversation of me trying to explain how rude she was (she didn't get it) she ended the call with the statement that pretty much sums there lousy business: \""Well, we've been in business for over 50 years and if you don't like the way we do business you can go somewhere else.\""\n\nMEANEST LADY EVER!!!!!"
0,"This place is absolutely the worst.  If it were possible to give a lesser rating, I would.  My sister was getting married and she worked a deal with the owner for reduced alteration price for all the girls in the wedding party.  First of all, I was charged more than the agreed-to price.  I didn't want to make a big deal of it, so I just let it pass.  When I went to pick it up two weeks later, it was way too tight in the bust area.  At first, the tailor (I think her name was Stormy) refused to take the blame for the mistake.   Her response:  \""Something must have changed since you were here last.\""  Was she implying that I had somehow gained a bust size in two weeks?!?  When I came back a couple weeks later (I don't live in Phoenix but was travelling there often for wedding preparations), the dress was still too tight.  The zipper zipped all the way up, but it was still so tight that I couldn't even take a full breath.  Yet the same woman was there trying to convince me that it was fine.  I think she just wanted to get me the hell out of her shop.  I insisted she redo it again and when I went back a week later (2 days before the wedding), it finally fit, but there was still more trouble.  For one thing, Stormy nearlly gave me the wrong dress.  Second, and more seriously, she freaking lost one of the straps belonging to my dress!!!  When I asked her about it, her reply was \""I guess I can look for it.\""  She still hadn't found it a couple minutes later and probably would have left it at that if I hadn't pushed the issue.  Her solution was to tell me to take one of the straps off one of the other bridesmaids dresses.  Can you believe that?!?  The nerve of that woman.  COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY UNPROFESSIONAL!  She grudgingly agreed to make me a replacement strap. \n\nI should mention that during this entire ordeal I never once received an appology.  Stormy kept putting the blame on everything but her less-than-adequate sewing skills.  If I hadn't already paid the full amount, I would have refused to do so.\n\nI know I'm not an isolated incident because another girl in the party had the same problems only worse.  I had to come back 3 times but she came back 5 times.  She also didn't receive any kind of appology for the trouble.\n\nI can't and won't recommend this place, even to the truly desperate.  There's plenty of other tailors in Phoenix, do yourself a favor and try one of those."
0,"This place is old, furniture is ugly, rooms are dark and smelly. Add to that the manager was really rude... this was the worst part of the phoenix trip for me."
0,What a joke!  It is not your average Embassy Suites.  They should really make this a Motel 6.   This place is really old and dated.  Luckily I only had an one night stay that was paid by my company.  The free breakfast is not worth it.   The AC is super loud so bring your ear plugs.
0,"I arrived here on a Friday night. I booked a suite (not jr suite). I checked in and asked if the jr suite was big enough for me, husband, pack n play and a rollaway they said 'oh not really,' so I kept my suite. I walked into the suite and realized we basically booked a conference room with a room. We left got a meal and went back to the front desk to ask for a jr suite. The girl was so rude!\n\nThe first girl (who was training) wasn't sure of anything let alone the size and cost difference. So she told me to ask the manager girl. She acted like I was inconveniencing her! What the heck is your problem! I asked her if they had any other rooms and she said uh maybe. She then told me it was the same price and said 'anything else you want'. Hah! I was not pleased. \n\nThe room was fine. Only complaint is that it took about 5 minutes for the water to warm up in the shower. And why don't you have silverware in a kitchenette? Strange. \n\nIt is in a semi strange neighborhood. Not very nice. The free breakfast is always a plus. Probably won't be back. But decent."
0,We just returned from Embassy Suites 24th/Thomas . What a mess. Our room ( Suite # 331 ) was west facing and never cooled down below 80 degrees for two days despite the a/c unit running full blast for 48 hours.  Maintenance department was absolutely no help. Offered us two fans. This was the two most miserable day I have ever spent.  The west wall heated up around 1-2 pm and radiated extreme heat until well into the evening ( after midnite ). Avoid this Hotel except in in the winter.
0,"When someone makes a reservation for Embassy Suites you have a mental picture as to what to expect. Throw that out with regards to this property! Hilton should be embarrassed to put the Embassy Suites brand on this property, this is a overpriced Super 8 or Motel 6 at best and in the same part of town that you would expect to find the aforementioned. \n\nThe saying that you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig but all you have is a pig with a dress and lipstick is an accurate discription.     \n\nThe managers reception, really! Goldfish crackers, peanuts, and pretzels! Not impressed.     \n\nThe air conditioning in my room would make a huge noise everytime it would kick on waking me every hour.     \n\nI have stayed at many hotels in my life and this one will leave a lasting impression and not a good one."
0,You will freeze to death!  The heating didn't work.  We complained. They said it would get fixed. Still no heat in our room after two nights. Third night we demanded another room. The ssme issue in the new room.  No heat.  The nights get cold in the winter here. Don't stay in this hotel unless you are looking for freezing cold rooms! Terrible. The water is not hot either.  The interior is outdated.
0,All of can say is they are rude !! I had to pull teeth to have someone to help us...and then when she rang us up she didn't say a word and No thank you for shopping nothing... I love the store But hate the service
0,"wow. horrible experience here.  \""Tina\"" the bartender, rude, confrontational, a little bit scary.  sad, since we've been coming here for karaoke a lot recently, and its always been great,  until tonight.  we will be reversing the charges on our card and never returning."
0,"The employees at the Lincoln and Scottsdale store are rude and dishonest.  I took  photos of a kitchen table to the store to inquire regarding the store's interest in consignment..  I was told that the store would take the item. After loading the table into my  truck and delivering it to the store, an older employee (possibly the store manager) said that he was NOT interested in the table.  I showed him my photos and pointed out the individual who had told me to deliver the table.  He basically said \""too bad\"" and good bye.  I will never again attempt to utilize the \""services\"" of My Sister's Attic."
0,"I don't get it. I see all the buses and billboards, so they MUST do something right. I've given this locations a hand full of times, and no one has ever acknowledged my existence. It seems like a lot of super dated pieces... thrift store finds at boutique prices. I've not ever enjoyed my experience there, and don't know that I'll subject myself to this location again."
0,"at first I wanted to like this company. but then their quality really sucked. What I was expecting was their expertise but what I got was a console panel that pops inward. When I made the dude aware of it he walked straight out of the office with this annoyed expression whether to demonstrate how mad he was at the tech or by complaint. Either ways I was left without a word thinking wtf I'm I supposed to follow our what. Obviously I was because how would he be able to see what I'm talking about. Anyways he talks to the tech and then tells me that its made that way and if I want they can screw it in. Again wtf would you want a panel pooping inward ask the time. Give him a call to make an appointment he says. Fine. 2 days later I can't open the door from the inside. Fukk I thought the tech probably messed up in there too because I had speakers installed. Opened it up and sure enough the connector was broke and a poor attempt to fix it by filling holes and a zip tie. I feel that this is something you should mention to the owner if your going to drill into the plastic visible or not. I doubt anyone gets upgraded stereos because they don't give a shi! About their car. So drilling holes, at least give me a call. So instead of getting a professional installation I got some half as$ workmanship. I don't have the time to do an installation myself and that's why I took it to these guys, unfortunately. So why didn't I take it back for them to repair? Do you continually annoy your food server when they already give you bad vibes? I dont want spit in my food and didn't want more broken things in places I can't see. I don't want to have QC their work afterwards. So I did the repair myself. I've uploaded a picture of the broken piece.\n\nAnyways people might have been satisfied and maybe I was just unlucky but I'm not going back. I'm happy my door gave me signs of trouble before I dropped off my civic for a new stereo speakers and tinting. I pay experts to be good at their job otherwise I'd just hire a bum to take my money and break my $hit."
0,"This is update to review submitted in 2011.  Unfortunately apartment management and maintenance have deteriorated with changes to onsite staff.  Pool area is never cleaned, dumpsters have trash everywhere and are disgusting, all plants are dying because they're never watered, and most distressing, downstairs neighbor keeps two pit bull dogs on patio 24 hours a day and they poop and piss on concrete which draws flies and smells horrible.  Attempts to resolve this last issue were unsuccessful.  Probably will be moving out soon.  Very disappointing."
0,"Great cupcakes and cookies.  Unfortunately - worst customer service in the world.  It's a shame.  Twice now,  they have goofed up my cupcake order.  No apologies for the mistakes both times.  On one occasion, they completely forgot about the order.  I was told I would just have to buy items out of the case - which I did.  No problem.  However, there were not enough cupcakes to fill the order and I was charged the full order price.  When I pointed out that they had overcharged me by $9, the manager rolled her eyes at me.  Started slamming things around and told me sharply I would have to WAIT for the refund.   So you forget my order, don't apologize, overcharge for the replacement order, then have a hissyfit when I ask for the correct price. Wow. Unbelievable."
0,I dont get how this place has so many great reviews. Customer service was terrible.  I stopped in to discuss a cake for my housewarming.  I arrived about 45 minutes before closing time but felt like i had completely inconvenienced the woman by stepping through the door.  She seemed completely uninterested in listening to my ideas.  I had the distinct feeling that she just wanted me to leave and quit bothering her.  trying to salvation an unpleasant experience i bought a couple of cupcakes to take home.  They certainly didnt make up for rest of it.  Absolutely nothing special.
0,"Monkeys could do a better job.  The staff do not think about what they are doing or what is important to the car, only follow a checklist"
0,DANGER DO NOT GO TO THIS JIFFY LUBE!!!!!! This place is crazy and very scary. I was surrounded by really weird employees running around in a state of chaos. The manager is yelling at this kid with a bad attitude who's  rolling his eyes at the manager and scowling. I did not get my car vacuumed out which I thought was part of the service. Stay away from this creepy out of control business. I'll be calling Jiffylube. I deserve better.
0,"A group of us went there for the cafe and let the kids looks at the books.  I am just going to review the cafe.  We were all reviewing the menu, I have not been there in a LONG time.  She was very annoyed that we did not know what we wanted.  CHILL!  I ordered a medium green tea latte.  She was very rude and loud, DO YOU HAVE A BORDER'S CARD?  She prepared my drink.  It was so hot, I had to wait 5 full mins before drinking it.  When I picked the cup also thought it was very light.  The cup was only 3/4 filled? WTF?  The drink was good but the service and quantity in the cup was a totally disappointment."
0,"I hate to give a 1-star review, but Manuel's earned it. Having lived in Albuquerque for six years, I know how a chile relleno should look when it arrives at the table. Manuel's batter was heavy on the egg and what we found on the plate was, unfortunately, an omelet with green chile. Disgusting."
0,"Not sure what all the hype is about for this place.....Very average.... The food seemed similar to Del Taco, but on a real plate. The Fajitas was a joke....This place looks run down & old, which scares me a little bit to eat here. Canyon Cafe/Sam's Mexican Cafe at Arizona Center downtown....NOW we're talkin'!  ...Waaaaay better!"
0,"I grew up with Manuel's. We used to go every Sunday after church growing up and that was back when it was still on 32nd St. Since I got older, the price has gone way up and the quality of the food seemed to go way down. Salsa isn't spicy anymore. Used to be that the plate was super hot when it was brought out to us, not anymore. One of the last times my family and I went there for dinner they charged us a 16% gratuity! 16% is way too high for any gratuity but we were only 4 people!"
0,"Eight of us went to Manuel's today for lunch, and I can say that the service was the WORST I have ever seen in any restaurant.  \n\nSix of us got our meals at the same time, while the other two (who ordered the daily special) got theirs  EIGHT MINUTES AFTER the rest of us.  \n\nWe didn't see the server again until he brought our bill.  We had asked him for separate tickets...and only got one.  We never got a single refill on the iced teas that four of us paid $2.50 each for...ten bucks would buy a LOT of tea bags.\n\nAn 84-year-old woman in our party asked for her water in a styrofoam cup with a straw, which the server said he would bring her but he never did.\n\nThe food was unimpressive...greasy and fried.  I would go to Taco Bell before I went back to Manuel's, which is overpriced.  I wouldn't have minded the mediocre food, but the service sucks like an Electrolux."
0,WORST FOOD EVER. Don't waste a cent at this place. Staff was good and chips and salsa weren't bad but the entree was terrible. First you couldn't even tell what you were eating. Second the price was way to high for the quality of food. Third the food made me and my girlfriend sick all night and the next morning. Also you can eat at much better mexican food places for the same price. Blanco at the Biltmore for example.
0,Just one word of advice. \nMake sure your trunk is EMPTY and contains ZERO valuables before you drive your car into Lindstrom's. \nLocking it won't be enough.\nI'm just sayin.
0,"First time here and they locked the keys in the car.  Instead of calling a locksmith they spent 30 minutes trying to open the door. I finally tell them to not touch the car and to call someone.

0,"Gucci store at the Scottsdale Fashion Square. I just wanted to inform those out there that last week on 6/24/13 I walked into the Gucci store a gentleman was standing by the door about 10:30 am to 11:00 am and I didn't get not one Hello, smile or acknowledgement what so ever. Gucci needs to go back to basics \""Customer Service\"" goes a long way"
0,"Please Please Please Be More Customer Friendly.\n\nUnfortunately, this store cannot compare with those in nearby Las Vegas in service or variety. The sale associates (except for a nice, pretty brunette female) do not acknowledge you and they give off a vibe that you are bothering them. Rarely do they have my size shoe (Gucci men's 9) and they have about 1/3 of the typical Gucci inventory. If you ask about something they don't have, the associate doesn't offer alternatives or offers to have it shipped in for inspection. (LV does that without batting an eye). Security guards are stoic. They stare at you (I get it, it's their job) and if you say hello, they ignore you...they just stare. Makes me feel uncomfortable because I really want to be able to shop there. It is a shame because I would rather shop there vs lugging packages back from California or Vegas."
0,"If I could give them zero stars I would. Worst customer service experience of my life. They completely defrauded me. I got the wrong sized belt so I wanted to exchange it with one that was slightly bigger. Keep in mind that the item had been purchased the day before and had never been worn. The lady went to the back for like ten minutes - and when she came out she said she couldn't exchange my item because someone had put a hole in my belt to make it even smaller (which doesn't make sense because the belt was too small to begin with). Clearly, she went in the back and put a hole in it herself. Maybe this is how the corporate Gucci office tries to eliminate exchanges and returns."
0,"Soo.. Lets start from the very beginning. We had a very good friend pass away who loved Gucci (why I don't know) but he did. So for all of this we wanted to purchase bracelet for his girlfriend and several other people to remember him by. We started our search online and found what we wanted. Great! A cute little silver bracelet with a heart on it, it was a great gift and a great bracelet for each one of us to wear on our wrist to remember him by. We decided to go in to the store to see if they had any in stock. After circling the store several times FINALLY we got someone to help us who treated us like minions. Thanks. Turns out she looked in a few drawers and said she didn't have what we were looking for and to order it online. The next day (Wednesday) we went online and tried ordering - Not Easy - we were not able to add items to our cart - Again Annoying. After all of this we decided to call to order, we wanted to do rush delivery so we could get them on time so we had to get basically everyone they had in random sizes. Not a huge deal but it took about an hour on the phone with them for this process. They had to complete 3 separate orders and although we were paying $35 per order for next day delivery she couldn't guarantee it would arrive by Friday. What? We are paying for next day shipping and you don't know if it will be here 2 days later?  As I mentioned we did rush delivery and had them sent to the office because we knew that we would not be at home when fed ex came and had to sign. After I stressed the importance of this they sent some boxes to the office and some to the billing address, what is their problem! That being said we missed some of them so had to go to fed ex at 6pm on Friday when we needed them by 5pm and then we get them and may I mention they cancelled 4 bracelets last minute and refunded us - Not Ok. Now let's get to the real bad part. Over half of them came TARNISHED with spots all over them. Who goes to a luxury brand and wants defected bracelets - Amateur hour. Again we get back on the phone with customer service who hangs up on is when we tell her what's going on, call back and explains the story to someone else to tells us to chill out. WTF! At this point we don't want the merchandise, they are defective #1 and #2 they have been absolutely awful to us. Game over, don't want to deal with this any more. Next day, go in to store again to see what they can do, maybe clean them or return. They say NO you didn't buy from here so we can't help you with anything. I give Gucci the big FU and will absolutely never do business with you again."
0,"I used to like their food\nHonestly.\n\nIt was my one year anniversary.\nMe and me man went here to celebrate\n\nI had a lobster tail\nAnd a filet\n\nOn the way home, I got violently ill\nLike, within ten minutes of leaving this place.\nAnd no, I only had a few glasses of champagne :)\n\nI ended up going home, and laying on the floor for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etc\n\nAfter about an hour, I couldn't take it anymore\nI called 911\n\nThe paramedics showed up, I was naked and crying on the floor.\n\nIt was a VERY romantic anniversary, let me tell you.\n\nAfter a long night at Scottsdale Osborn hospital, it was determined that the lobster tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill.\n\nI'll never eat here again.\nSimply because I've never been so sick.\n\nIt's a shame though, because on the way down, the lobster tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious.\n\nHOWEVER\nI contacted Ruths Chris and they refunded my dinner amount, paid my hospital copay, and were SOOO nice and accomodating to my every demand.  Bravo.\n\nAlthough, Boo for almost killing me.\n\nEh, I'm torn."
0,"Do NOT go to this restaurant if you can't use stairs. The dining room has about a dozen stairs (for everyone) and does NOT have an elevator or wheel chair lift. The restaurant manager wanted to send our group OUTSIDE, and re-enter the dining room via the back door. In addition, the restaurant staff has no training on ADA compliance."
0,"Awful, awful customer service - so bad in fact that we were too thoroughly disgusted to stay for the meal. We came here on a Sunday afternoon, which was my first and last time.  I've been to other Houston's locations in California - and have had decent times there.  In fact, I love the thai steak salad.\n\n However, this time some 20 year old idiot host walked us to our table (and before we even sat down) and told us \""My mom taught me good manners, so I've always taken my hat off at the dinner table.\""  \n\nHuh?  First of all, I was dressed nicely in a button up shirt, and was wearing my favorite football team hat who had just won the championship the day before.  Secondly, I hadn't even sat down at the table yet, asswipe.  Thirdly, while I understand this isn't Applebees, this also isn't Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, douche bag.  And don't talk to me like I'm 7 years old.\n\nNo sooner had the idiot host left before we walked into the kitchen to get the manager  to bitch him out about his insulting employee.  The manager was pretty much dismissive.  Well, guess what - I'm pretty much dismissive about this poor excuse for a restaurant. \n\n1 STAR - not going back!!"
0,"I need to tell you about the worst hostess experience I've EVER had anywhere.  Ann was unable and unwilling to even pretend to try and accomodate our simple seating request to have our 2 parties sit near each other, even though I'd made my reservation 2 weeks in advance withthat specific request.  Her attitude was unacceptable."
0,found a cockroach in the bathroom....I just left.
0,"I have to say, wow how bad can you get.  Yes the building is pretty, but everything else is of the poorest quality.  The staff is inattentive, the food greatly over priced and poorer than fast food quality.  We ordered a \""Classic\"" California roll and were very surprised that is was not in fact a California roll (enough lemon flavored mayo to choke a horse).  Our entr\u00e9e which consisted of two salads took over half an hour to arrive, and seriously could have gotten larger fresher salads for half the price at Wendy's.  I ordered the Chicken Club salad, the mixed greens were wilted, the chicken sparse and mostly batter, two small cubes of avocado, and the bacon was leathery not crunchy.  My wifes salad had rotisserie chicken that was hastily pulled from the chicken and included connective tissue, fat and congealed blood.  While waiting for and eating our meal we observed two tables beside us have at least three employees stop by to chat for more than ten minutes at a time.  After our meal we sat and waited for 15 minutes for our server to come by with our check and then another 10 before we could flag down what looked like a manager to take our money.  It took another 10 minutes to get our change.  It was nice however to have the tip amounts printed on the receipt so that we knew what not to give.  I really liked Houston's the few times I was there, Hillstone I will not be returning to."
0,"Well... \n\nMy mom was still in town when I gave it another chance. She doesn't live in the states and she was so looking forward to having the salad! Can't say no to mom, right? \n\nSo mom picked up the salad to go and again... TINY. $15 for a side salad. (Please see picture of it next to a piece of paper and you'll see what I mean fellow Houston old timers.) \n\nThe great news was that we were able to ADD our own mixed greens to the salad to make it enough for one person + a bite for another person here and there. \n\nBut really? Who wants to add their own greens to a salad? Defeats one of the main reason for restaurants is that you don't have to do anything except eat and enjoy. \n\nJust not with Hillstone's Grilled Chicken Salad..."
0,"We may not have a lot of bragging rights here in Phoenix, but being able to sit on a patio in November and have a few cocktails is such a luxury, especially when you bring along out-of-town visitors.  My friend from Denver won't see a patio for months, so I was thrilled to introduce her to Hillstone.  Maybe it was the fact that we were just having cocktails and not ordering food that set the weird tone of the evening - or maybe the wait-staff at Hillstone just sucks.\n\nI'd been to Hillstone twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  I've always found them (Hillstone/Houston's) overpriced, but a nice night out.  The atmosphere is really nice, the food is not exactly innovative, but it's consistent.  I'm not going to get into a Houston's/Hillstone comparison here - the food is about the same as always, but the new location is very pretty.\n\nMy friends and I found a table on the patio and settled in for some drinks and girl-talk.  The fireplace was awesome and there are heaters placed here and there for us thin-blooded Zonies.  The waitress came along shortly to take our orders, and our Denver buddy got the first RULE of the evening.  She ordered a cocktail and asked for a double (Hey, we had some major catching up to do - we wanted a little alcohol to get us started.)  She was immediately informed by our sneery server that Hillstone does not serve doubles.  It's just not that sort of a place - they don't want to be known as a drinking establishment.  To break the awkward silence, I joked that maybe the server could bring my friend two drinks instead of a double, that got me nothing but an icy stare.  I ordered a diet coke and a shot of tequila.  I'm not a big drinker, but do like a little buzz now and then, so I get it quickly and then sip on my soda.  RULE#2 - I was told I could not drink my tequila all at once.  Hillstone does not allow \""shots\"", so I must sip my shot of Hornitas.  OK, I'm 53 years old and this person is actually instructing me how to drink my beverage?  Really?\n\nWhile we did enjoy our mandated cocktails and tried hard to follow the RULES at Hillstone, I'm afraid the tone of our much-anticipated evening just never really recovered.  It's a fun place, especially at night when the Cougars are out and on the hunt - great for people watching and relaxing, but I think the drink ordering moment proved so uncomfortable for our server that she left us high-and-dry for the rest of the evening.  We wondered if we were not Hillstone worthy as we searched for someone to bring us a coffee with Baileys.  We eventually flagged her down and got our beverages, but...it wasn't really fun to be there anymore.      \n\nHillstone staff please understand that your place of employment being kind of cool and pretty does not earn you the right to be jerks to your customers.  I won't be back.  Oh, and on a side note, Hillstone, the kitty litter floor on your patio is just weird.  I had to empty the sand out of my shoes several times.  \n\nI wish Hillstone would get it.  Such potential - such a disappointment."
0,"I have always enjoyed dining at Hillstone and Houstons prior to that for many years until this last weekend.  I am on a very strict diet because of numerous allergy issues, and can only eat fish and vegetables.  I ordered a fish sandwich and asked that it not have the thousand island dressing on the bun, as I am allergic to tomatoes.  I was told that the chef would not prepare it that way.  I was very disappointed and skipped dinner.  In our society with so many issues with allergies, I think Hillstone should make accommodations for its guests. I will not be eating at Hillstone again!"
0,"IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!!\nMy husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).\nThis is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. \n\nWe deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. \n\nWe were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. \nTo ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family."
0,"A friend from out of town wanted to try Hillstone since she loved Houston's. From the start I was unimpressed. After the hostess ignored us we seated ourselves at the bar and waited at least five minutes for one of the bar tenders to acknowledge our existence.  After placing our initial drink/appetizer order the service dropped off. On four occasions I waited an agonizingly long time for the bar tender to refill my empty iced tea glass. The appetizers we ordered were nothing special. The house salad and kale were edible but nothing to write home about and the soup of the day was something more like baked beans only not as good\n\nWe proceeded to place entree orders and my friend ordered her second vodka and grapefruit. More than 10 minutes later my friend still had yet to receive her drink and the bartender who took our orders had disappeared. We asked another bartender and he took my friend's drink order. After another five minutes he came back and told us she was cut off. Really, cut off after one drink? What I find absurd is that we were totally benign customers yet my friend was cut off after one lousy drink while the middle aged woman sitting next to us had exposed ass-crack and was served repeatedly during our 40 minute experience.\n\nThis place is run by corporate ass-hats and populated by pretentious yuppies. If you want to eat at a nice place go somewhere other than this corporate cesspool. I will never again grace the likes of this rubbish heap with my presence."
0,"Awful has a new name.  Hillstone.  Just awful; service food...the whole thing.  Food was cold and poor quality.  Service, they just didn't care.  A tab of $187 one would assume you would get mediocre service but nope. I recommend taking your money elsewhere."
0,"This has always been one of our go too restaurants.  On our last visit as we were enjoying the last bit of a bottle of wine.  Servers picked up 1/2 full water glasses, and swarmed our table, they wanted us out.  we were a party of 4 had enjoyed our dinner and we were just finishing up.  This was just flat out rude and very disappointing.  Since when should you feel rushed to finish your bottle of wine.  Not sure we will go back.  I expect great service.  There are plenty of great restaurants here in Scottsdale."
0,"It pains me to write this review as Hillstone, formerly Houston's, has been one of my favorite places to eat for the past 20 years. The food and service have always been delicious and dependable. However, my last visit left me and my boyfriend with such a sour taste in our mouths, I am unsure we will return. \n\nWe arrived on a busy Thursday evening, hoping to sit in the bar area. We enjoy the lively scene and people watching. We figured we'd have to wait a bit, which we have done on countless occasions. There was one seat available so I sat and we were greeted by \""Al.\"" Seemed like a nice enough guy, very friendly and quickly served us our first round of cocktails. We asked \""Al\"" to keep an eye out for us as we were wanting to have dinner at the bar, he said, \""We'll get you seated, no problem.\"" After my boyfriend ordered his second cocktail, we noticed \""Al\"" greeting two of his regular customers that had just walked into the bar area. He walked out from behind the bar and greeted them with handshakes. There was a small high top they sat down at, too small for dinner, but would do for drinks. As he walked back behind the bar to retrieve their bottle of wine, I saw him hold up two fingers to the other bartender. Within 5 minutes we noticed them sitting down at the other side of the bar where two people had just got up. After watching this all go down right in front of us, my boyfriend asked \""Al\"" for our bill. He had a surprised look on his face that we were leaving, since we told him we intended to have dinner. I told him we saw what transpired with his other preferred guests. He quickly apologized and offered to buy us our drinks. When my boyfriend declined and said we would take our business elsewhere, he came out from behind the bar and continued to apologize and offered to buy us dinner. We declined and left money on the bar for our drinks. How could we enjoy a meal after he made it clear the business of his regular customers was more important that ours? \n\nFortunately, we did end up having a lovely dinner down the road at Mastro's City Hall. The bar area was very full and we ordered a couple of drinks and waited for a spot to open up at the bar to eat. Our bartender \""Christian\"" looked out for us and we were seated after about 25 minutes. We enjoyed an amazing steak dinner and were treated with first class service by \""Christian.\"" We will be back to City Hall, not so sure about Hillstone. Truly a shame."
0,"So I decide to take my daughter here because she loves Houston's. I know they are owned by the same company but have different menu items. When we walk in I ask if there are any choices for kids and the hostess says yes a kids burger and a grilled cheese. Waitress comes over, not genuinely friendly, more like fake friendly. I ask about the kids burger since that's pretty much the only suitable option. She tells me that there's no difference btwn kids and regular burgers. Both $16. Ok I'll pass and order her a California roll. It was 5pc and very different tasting and still had imitation crab but still cost $13. I've never seen a Cali roll cast more than $8. And that's regular price, not $4 happy hour. \nI order the French dip which apparently is prime rib but mine was more fat then meat. Disgusting...had to return it. The only good part of the lunch was our appetizer, spinach dip. It's always a win. The mgr was mediocre and took off the Cali roll but acted like he just graduated with a hotel restaurant management degree and was not sure how to treat a customer. Honestly, he should've comped me and bought us dessert but knocking off an overpriced piece of sushi was better than nothing. Next time I'll go to the Henry. 100% better than this place"
0,I was terribly upset with this restaurant. Their prices are absurd for the casual dining experience which made their disinterest in pleasing their customers even more inexcusable. They serve a Caesar salad which is served as a whole leaf. I do not enjoy cutting it up at the table with lettuce sliding off the plate and messing the table area. I requested as I ordered it that it be cut before serving it. They refused saying it doesn't look as good. When I said that i didn't mind if the presentation was compromised and I would enjoy it more cut up. They again said no. They were too busy. Additionally they took some old standbys off the menu. High prices and no regard for customer satisfaction is a bad combination.
0,"how can I get my iPod fixed?  these little snots won't wait on me.  I have to go online to make an appointment, even though I went to the store. They only take appointments for two days ahead, but you have to go on line to do it--- WTF?  You have to make it online? \nAnd why are they dressed like little Steven Jobs clones?"
0,"For a long time when my mate and I walked past the store he would mention he would like an IPOD. So being the perfect mate I bought him one for his birthday. He opens it and said, why did you buy this I would never use it. I will spare you the rest of the conversation. So I go back to the store with the product in hand. I tell them I want to return this, I tell them why. They seem totally dumbfounded and find it very hard to accept that I indeed did not want the product. SO they ask a million question all assuming I did something to the product and rendered it unusable. Any fool can see it never came out of the box. So I repeat why I am returning it. Finally they say ok and tell me there is a restocking fee. I say OK as I had read the receipt. He said wait a minute. So I wait and he returns with what I assume is the manager. He starts his bull crap and literally yells at me about the fee and said I am going to have to pay it. I respond that yes I know of the fee as I told Him, point at the other employee. I have no problem with that, never did, never said I did. They finally took it and credited my card minus the fee all while they snarled at me. I guess I will never find out if I like Apple products as nothing on Gods green earth will ever induce me to buy from such imbecilic company."
0,"Not happy at all. My son bought his second Ipod a year ago. The first broke, and when we took it to the apple store, they said \""tough luck.\"" So, I told my son to make sure to take really good care of the new one. He did. For no reason, it stopped working. We sent it to be repaired and got it back saying \""water damage.\"" No way. So we went to the store and told them about it. The floor guy said to wait and he'd have a \""genius\"" look at it. He came back and said \""no water damage. Make an appt for tonight and they'll fix it.\"" Went back, saw a \""genius\"" and told him the story. Without looking at it, he said must be water damage. We said impossible. He said well, this square hole will be red if it's water damage...yup, water damage. I took the flashlight from his hand and looked. It was white. I know red from white, and this was white. Oh, he said, I meant that there's a little red line. No red line. Oh, I meant that there's a red corner. No red corner. He shows it to someone who glances and says yup, red. This is nuts. Talk about spitting in your face and saying it's raining. They insist it's red and there's water damage and won't look into why this well taken care of ipod won't work. Son not allowed to buy another one. MP3 next."
0,"Oh, how I dislike this store.  What does a girl have to do to get someone to find her a macbook battery?  Seriously.  How many people do I have to ask.  And, then, finally someone goes to look, only to come back saying that they don't have any.  The mac store has no macbook batteries?"
0,"THE RULES:\n\n1. To buy or be helped with anything, you must check in with an \""orange shirt\"" - this person has the clipboard and will write your name down with the reason for your visit. \n\n2a. If you have questions or want to buy something, you must then wait for a \""blue shirt\"" to come help you - expect at least a 5 minute wait\n\n2b. If you've made an appointment for the \""genius\"" bar, you must wait in back for your name to be YELLED out by a \""genius\"" in a black shirt - expect at least a 15 minute wait (If you haven't made an appointment for the \""genius\"" bar, you'll probably just get laughed at)\n\n3. If you want to purchase an item, a \""blue shirt\"" will check you out with their hand-held device, when available. (There is only one \""register,\"" a computer pos system located at the \""genius\"" bar, but it's use is \""not encouraged.\"") If you bring cash or want a bag, expect a longer check out because those are kept somewhere else, of course. Receipts can be emailed to you, printed out, or both.\n\n\nI wish I would've known these things before my last visit - I would've gone elsewhere or just gone online. Can't tell you how much I hated the experience. I guess the setup is good if you're someone who needs a lot of assistance, but for someone with a simple purchase or quick question, the hassles and hoops of this store isn't worth the inconvenience."
0,"The concept of the store is great, but horribly inefficient.  There are 6-10 employees there and not a single one of them could take MY MONEY!

0,"I've visited this location numerous times. While I understand you need an appointment to get any help at an apple store, this place is always mayhem. The staff member that assigins you an apple member is most likely told to lie to you in order to keep you waiting as long as possible - before you completely lose your patience.\nI got to the store at 10am on the dot expecting to simply buy an iPhone 4 and get on my way. The place wasn't busy at all, and I had no questions. Just charge my card $395 for the phone and mobile me, take my info and i'm gone, right? Not so fast.\nI walked out at 10:45. They said they would help me right away, and I stood waiting 25 minutes until I could be helped. Three times I was told \""someone will be right with you\"". The last guy that helped me was nice ,but that didn't makeup for the experience.\nIt's sad apple is such a profitable business with such awful, understaffed customer service. If there was another option out there that was comparable, it would be a no brainer to switch."

0,"The \""help\"" I received at this Apple store was laughable. I arrived for an intro class with a fully functional machine, took the \""class\"" which was pretty lame (most of what you learn can be done at home with simple exploration) and then wanted to get some quesstions answered about getting old e-mail from my previous machine. Our instructor told us to snag a guy on the floor to answer our questions (three of them). The advanced class is no longer offered, so much of what we had hoped to learn about using i-cloud and transmission from other devices, we will have to figure out on our own. We found a guy, but he was hostile and rude. He eventually walked away from us after giving us the incorrect information about e-mail retrieval and password resetting, leaving us with a machine that no longer functioned properly. We sought out the guy with the clipboard and he said there were no appointments available at the genius bar for 4 hours and that was at another store across town. We had traveled 50 minutes to get to this store from our home. We pointed out to him that is was HIS employee who screwed up the device. They REALLY didn't care about serving their customers. When a young woman arrived without an appointment, the clip board guy told her to wait a minute and they would see what they could do to help!! My husband and I are in our 60's and use computers and smart phones every day, but there seems to be an arrogance in this store if you are not the young, hip, techie person. My husband spent an hour or so on the phone with Apple tech support and got things straightened out. THEY were very helpful. This store does not have the \""Nordstrom\"" customer service ethic and  is not a place to go for help. Their focus is to demo, sell their devices and act like customer service is beneath them. Their \""coolness\"" is a turn-off and they act like they are doing you a great favor if they answer a question. It seems to us that Apple is selling more devices than they have the manpower to support in their stores. I will avoid these stores like the plague. All of this makes me wonder why I bought an Apple product in the first place."
0,Worst customer service! But they don't care! I even spoke to a manager and he would not exchange my defective device.  What happen to taking care of your customer?
0,I pre ordered the iPhone 6 and showed up after receiving an email stating I could stop by to pick it up any time that day. It was 7:30 and the line was out the door. I was told to come back tomorrow and that there's no way I was getting that phone prior to 9pm close. I've already paid for the phone and I showed them the email I'd received but to no avail. So I called the store on my way home explaining what'd happened and the kid looked up my name and said they shouldn't have had me wait in line and that I could come get it whenever. It turned my Friday night into a cluster and I'm disappointed in the way apple does business.  Seriously considering galaxy whatever and ditching the iPhone for good.
0,"I really wish I was able to give this store negative stars because the deserve it.  Every time I go to an Apple Store I feel like a head of cattle.  They honestly don't care about their customers even a little bit, it's all about good marketing to sell their products then when they malfunction they do everything they can to keep from fixing it because that would cost them money.  I have Apple plus, insurance that I paid for in the case that my phone needed fixed or replaced.  That was the case when I went here and not only did the jerk who was supposed to be helping me fail to do so he also made my phone worse.  Then he blamed me for the phone not working after his solution didn't work.  I truly loath Apple just based on its stores.  I wish I could leave them but I have so much sunk cost between the Mac book, TV, iPad, iPhone that I'm not better off leaving."
0,"This is by far the worst Apple Store I have ever been too. The customer service is AWFUL, I have never dealt with such unprofessional people. After being told my computer was broken, I waited 45 minutes even though I told them the exact computer I wanted to buy. I was willing to pay $2,000 upfront to get the computer I needed. When it came time to purchase it, I let them know I needed it ASAP since I had to make it to class. At this point, they told me it would be ANOTHER 30 minutes for me to even get the computer!!!! Not to mention, I dealt with a total witch while trying to explain I had been at the store already for 45 minutes waiting to get this computer. I will probably never return to this store, as I don't appreciate having eyes rolled at me and employees tell me I'm being unreasonable."
0,"This location is terrible. They did nothing but screw up multiple cars of mine. Now it's two years later, and the compressor they broke and replaced is broken again. \n\nDO NOT GO THERE!"
0,"Avoid this corrupt company... terrible! \nI sent my wife in for an oil change and to get the brakes looked at because they were squeeking.\nThey did the oil change and told her that the rotors would have to be ground down or replaced and the rear brakes needed to be cleaned, the bill would be about $400.00\nI said no, bought $18.00 brake pads from another company, and did the repair myself in about an hour\nWhen I looked at the rotors, they were LIKE GLASS, in immaculate condition, absolutely did not require any grinding/replacement...  (the vehicle is only a few years old, with low mileage) \nThey completely tried to take advantage of my wife, fabricated a completely false story about the vehicle to try to make a quick buck... they should be shut down... \nYou've been warned!!"
0,This place is aweful! I got my brakes done and just 4 months later they were toast. Called to have them fix and they refuse. They took my 400 and now won't honor fixing their crappy job.\nMy advice- avoid this place at all costs.
0,"So, this is a long story, but I'll do my best. Brought the girlfriend's Passat in to have the service light checked, a/c checked, and it was making a strange noise. Wheel bearings, ac leak fixed, oil changed and tires rotated. Pickup car, service light still on, and makes a different funny noise. Call up, they have us bring it back, apologizing for the light, and thinking they just need to balance the tires. I thought that was automatically done after a rotation, but hey, I'm no mechanic! Offered a free oil change on her truck as compensation, and since she had brought it in anyway for its own a/c issue, she was happy with that. \n\nThis ordeal lasted over a week, dealing with multiple employees and manager. The first guy that worked on the Passat apparently quit that day, the next guy had to leave because his wife had a baby, etc. \n\nEduardo told her that all her hoses needed replaced and several other things, before he gave her a diagnosis of the problem we brought it in for in the first place. At this point, we just want to pick it up. So we do, and now the airbag light is blinking. Manager (Seth) refused to speak to us and then we were hung up on. \n\nPretty ridiculous. Not sure if this is because we are women or what, but us being female shouldn't have anything to do with the fact they don't seem capable of fixing a problem without causing a new one. Francisco was the only person there worth talking to. He was great, but sadly there were too many other things wrong."
0,"If I could give this pharmacy zero stars I would have. \nMy husband went in to use their shipping services and the lady with short hair was completely rude.  She stated, \""that you are raping us of our shipping supplies\"". The term \""rape\"" was used. WOW! He was using USPS shipping material and shipping it from their store. USPS offers these flat rate shipping boxes as a means to ship priority. Meaning we are paying for the services. \nI would hope management of this pharmacy get extra help. With employees like these they may go out of business. \nI would NOT recommend their service to anyone. Do NOT come here if you are looking for customer service. \nI am appalled with her behavior and the pharmacy's service."
0,"Worst customers service. In general, the stores never have stock on hand that is on sale. You'd think they would have stock on hand and more, esp if it is on sale but no and even the first day of ads, they don't have items.The shelf space is very limited.Again, if you advertise something on sale, have it on hand for the customers...\nDon't waste your time with this store chain..Not worth it\"""

0,I must put my 2 cents worth in about Vincents.  I personally will never go to Vincents again.  We went one new year's eve for a friend's husband birthday.  He is French and they are from Florida--so I was trying to make it a special occassion.   I remember very little about the meal because the service was HORRIBLE.  Red wine came after salads had been served.  A white wine sat on our table unopened until we were able to flag someone down--the serving of the meal was uneven at best and then servers got switched mid meal.  For a dinner that cost more than $500--I certainly expected more.  When I called to complain--their offer to me was a glass of champagne and a dessert--to make up for an evening that was suppose to be special on several accounts and turned out to be a disaster.
0,"This place had a lot of hype...one of the best rated restaurants in town. We were extremely disappointed. The service was terrible, we sat for about 15 minutes before we even had a menu and were asked if we wanted a drink. When we did finally get the menus we were extremely disappointed with what was supposed to be an extensive wine list. The wine list turned out to be rather weak with a small selection from each region - even France wasn't well represented. \n\nAfter another 15 minutes of waiting without any contact from the non existent server we walked out...and walked down the road to Chelseas...which was solid."
0,"Apparently I was in the 'formal' Vincent's on Camelback' as opposed to Vincent's Market Bistro so I can't speak to the Bisto.  As for Vincent on Camelback we were very disappointed.  The menu and the staff were really over the top pretentious and the food was just ok.  The choices were extremely limited and very expensive.  For two meals with no drinks or dessert, the bill was over $120.  We got the (small) rack of lamb and some kind of tough wild boar dish with sauce that had a very odd flavor to it.  And not 'odd good.'  It came with a side of parsnip 'potatoes' that made me wish that they would have used real potatoes instead.  I get it. But what has the potato ever done to Vincent to deserve this?  One more thing. . . I forgot.  We ordered a bowl of lobster bisque. I told the waiter that there was no lobster in it. He said that's the way the chef makes it.  Huh?  Please.  Next time maybe I'll have chicken soup with no chicken in it.\n\nAvoid this restaurant.  I can't help but think that the people who left good reviews have had their brains fried by the 120 degree sun in Phoenix."
0,"Oh my! Restaurant week 2011 .  This meal was a disaster! Terrible service...totally non existent  service. No beverages offered and we had to ask for them . There was a 25 minute wait for a reserved table, whilst 10 empty tables needed to be cleared. Food incredibly lacking in flavor . Lobster was NOT served....it was langoustine.  Steaks mediochre to be kind.  Excessively salty salad...could not eat it. Pecan pie smothered in caramel sauce. Honestly good pie ruined!  ONE WAITER HUMMED LOUDLY FOR THE ENTIRE EVENING. He wasn't part of the entertainment. Will never waste money there again. So many great restaurants in town.....THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM."
0,"Unmitigated Disaster - We will never be back again, and I would have to recommend (after this experience) for no one to go there either.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were not so kindly greeted by a white haired woman at the front desk. Our reservation was for 7PM, and we got there at 6:55PM. The disgruntled lady tells us to sit in the lobby until it's closer to 7PM... Since when did showing up a few minutes early become a nuisance? Moving forward, we headed towards the lobby to find eight people also waiting to be seated. A little unusual for a Tuesday night, but no big deal - until twenty minutes passed until we were finally seated. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but a simple \""I'm sorry for the wait\"" would have gone a long way.\n\nThere were two dining areas and we were placed in the larger room. Several tables were available, so I didn't understand the long wait. Anyway, there's an old-fashioned quality to this place... not good or bad. The chairs were uncomfortable and the carpet looked unkempt, but we were there for the food. \n\nWe sampled the Duck Tamales.  Unfortunately, there was nothing special about this dish. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either.  That was the highlight of the evening\n\nWhile waiting for the main dishes to arrive, it got extremely cold in the restaurant. We hear the staff complaining about the temperature, and then we see another couple complaining to the host about how cold it was on their side of the room. \n\nFinally, dinner arrives... I ordered the wild boar cooked to medium rare. It tasted medium-well to well done. The waiter stated that this dish comes with five large medallions, but looking at the dish, there were thinly shaved bits of meat. This dish reminded me of the over-cooked roast beef that my dad used to make when we were kids (which I hated, by the way). \n\nMy wife ordered the braised short ribs which tasted like something that came out of a microwave. She tells me, \""For the price of this meal, I'd rather eat a microwaveable meal.\"" I tried a piece of the short ribs thinking it couldn't be that bad... WRONG. The short ribs were chewy, stringy, and although it was covered in sauce, it was DRY. We hardly put a dent in our meal. \n\nWhile waiting for our missing waiter, we noticed that the restaurant was starting to get really warm - similar to a gym. We both started laughing at how horrible everything had been. We were finally able to flag down the waiter for our check. He never once asked us how our meal was - even after seeing our plates were more than half full. \n\nAnyway, the moral of the story is: Don't waste your money here. Or perhaps call in advance to make sure Vincent is working. While waiting for our car, the valet guy said, \""Vincent is on vacation. His food is phenomenal, but when he's not here, we hear customer complaints.\"" Maybe this guy is right, and Vincent's food is out-of-this-world; however, based on the service alone, I will not even bother coming back. No second chances for this place - no thanks!"
0,"Ok...First off I have to say I don't usually judge a place off the reviews and like to give it a shot. Well this was a bad idea... especially on an anniversary dinner celebration. Please be advised that the bad reviews are indeed true. We have eaten the food through their catering and it is delicious, so this makes me think all the energy is expelled here alone? Like the other reviews had said this is a creepy outdated awkward place that doesn't have any background music playing at all. So yes the tables are very close together with no music so imagine how uncomfortable that will be. We immediately ordered martinis to try and ease the mood. My dirty martini was garnished with tiny olives on a sandwich pick for an upscale price. The server also spilled most of my wife's martini during her trip to the table saying how it was \""overfilled.\"" We received a basket of bread that was burnt and unappealing which ended our idea of a maybe hopeful outcome. We were both confused because the dinner menu was nothing like we had eaten through catering. The server informed us that we had probably meant to dine at the \""bistro,\"" and was happy to transfer us over next door. Feeling questionable that it would be any better we paid our tab and agreed to go take a table they were holding for us. \n\nWe then walked over to the bistro side of the restaurant only to be disappointed once again.  Packed in like a meat house and sat there for 15 minutes without being asked if we'd like a drink we decided to walk out. They have again an awkward system of seat yourself and apparently serve yourself as well? We were so confused by all the groups of people lining outside to get in this place. We were more than willing to give up our table to the next unfortunate guest. \n\nThe parking lot is also a joke like a previous person had reviewed. It is only valet and gets backed up by the cars coming in and the one attendant trying to run the place. Some lady thought I was a valet driver and proceeded to yell at me because I was standing around not helping her. \n\nWe are in our late 20's and knew we were in \""Snotsdale\"" all the way."

0,"We mistakenly chose to host an 65th wedding anniversary family celebration at Vincent's.   At the end of the meal, as we were trying to collect our uneaten desserts, Vincent became enraged by the delay to his waiters' ability to clear the table.  (We later surmised that the threat of overtime pay prompted this entirely inappropriate, frightening response.)  The alternative and civil approach would have been to help the guests while simultaneously clearing.  \nThe honorees, ages 87 and 88, had been loyal and frequent customers for over 30 years.  They were deeply shaken and frightened by Vincent's threatening loss of self control (which escalated to threats and his grabbing of my 87 year old mother's arm).  No member of my family will ever step foot near this establishment again.   Unfortunately, Vincent's inappropriate behavior trumped any value associated with food."
0,"I am amazed....the foregoing reviews cannot possibly be speaking of the restaurant we visited during restaurant week.  We had 7.30 pm reservations and arrived on time to find probably 12 guests standing around waiting for their tables....we joined them. My husband became bored and walked around the small place, counting 10 tables waiting to be cleared.  20 minutes later, no one had offered us a drink, no cocktail serving person was to be seen, but at last we were seated! 15 more minutes passed slowly by. No acknowledgement of our presence...no welcoming smiles,hellos,eye contact.....ah at last water was poured into our glasses.Yes, there is some liquid refreshment available in this arid place.....WATER! Still no acknowledgement. The water bearer was silent and did not look up from his task......hello here's the waiter asking us for our order......er,\""may we see the menu first?\"".\nDo you serve drinks in this restaurant?  May we order something to drink? Yes we had to ask.\n  Let's speak briefly about the food.  SALAD.......a salty undressed mess, Brie and figs......NO FIGS. Tomato leek tartlet....very good.  Filet steaks....tasteless. Lobster and pasta.....it wasn't lobster it was langoustine.....no flavor.  Salmon....ok. As for the desserts great pecan pie, ruined by pouring caramel sauce over it.  We all know that pecan pie is sweet enough, don't we?\n After all this, the final straw was the very annoying waiter, who hummed incessantly as he served.  In all fairness he was totally unaware of his habit, as was everyone else who worked there....otherwise surely he would have been told to STOP. No we will not be returning.  So many great restaurants in the camelback corridor....why would we?"
0,"Drea, thanks for posting your experience! I completely understand, as I had a very similar experience! I went this morning to use a $10 certificate that I had purchased for $4 through a daily deal.  I usually love discovering new places this way because it gives you a chance to spend less money at a new place and decide if you like it or not. And I've made the assumption that owners are happy to see customers with a coupon because it means the marketing they chose worked and new people are coming in.  You would THINK they would want to make a good first impression. But not the Coffee Lady! I came in and ordered an egg salad sandwich. She went to her fridge to get some egg salad and said \""The tuna and chicken are a lot more filling if you want that, but we are famous for our egg salad.\""  I wasn't sure if she wanted me to change my order, or if she was just making conversation, but it seemed like an odd statement to me and I started doubting my order, but I didn't say anything.  The next thing I heard was \""Ah, this is kind of skimpy, let me add another egg.\""  And when I looked over, I could see that the container she had pulled out with egg salad was nearly empty, which clearly meant she was using yesterday's leftovers (as it was 8 in the morning when I came in), and I was a bit disappointed that the egg salad isn't made fresh daily. She literally peeled and added an egg right into what was left. I was just surprised at how nonchalant she was. Then I ordered a latte, since I knew I had to use up my $10. The latte was good (nothing out of the ordinary) and she was very friendly to me while making my drink. But then it came time to pay...and when I pulled out my coupon she said \""Oh, one of THOSE....great, I have to start my day off with one of those, huh?\"" WOW! Talk about poor customer service. If you don't want to get new customers into your store at a discount, then why did you agree to the deal???  Her attitude was a total turn off...So then she added up my two items and said \""OK, you're just under $10 but you do have to pay tax, which is $.84 and that doesn't include a tip either, if you care.\""  (and this was as I was putting a cash tip in her jar, which she did NOT deserve, and I kicked myself for doing that, though CLEARLY she is hurting if she's that upset that I'm using a coupon, and VOICING that it doesn't include the tip). Then she had the gull to inquire if I lived nearby because she wanted me as a return customer. UNBELIEVABLE. I will NEVER go to this place again. Even if they HAD the best egg salad sandwiches or coffee in town, which they DON'T (and wouldn't you know, I ended up with an egg shell in my sandwich), I wouldn't go back.  \nI do not like to be negative and truly do have better things to do with my time, but I don't appreciate being treated badly or differently for trying a new place on a budget."
0,"My experience was nearly the exact same as the one Dana M described.  Absolutely terrible!  Except she went so far as to say that she had hoped people who used them would bring someone with them.  I was by myself....... and in restrospect, glad for it!  Wouldn't want to subject anyone to such unpleasantness.  OH, and dont' order the berry smoothie.  Mine went down the garbage disposal as it was undrinkable."
0,"I am shocked over these reviews. I'm going to have to assume its family or something. I was an unfortunate victim of this group of GPs for years. Because of the long list of the things I needed to see Dr. Lyndo for (no longer there) I felt like I couldn't go anywhere else.  I honestly felt trapped.\n\nThis is the wonderful help i've gotten.\nDr Daveys sat outside the examining room talking on the phone about his upcoming vacation for well over 15 minutes while I listened. It had only been an hour wait getting in to examination room.\n\nThe receptionist are the biggest bunch of rude obnoxious.......they have just about done everything but give me the finger. \n\nI can't tell you how many times my insurance company didn't ante up so they will call you up to the front of the waiting area and in front of EVERYONE ask about it and ask quite rudely. Then tell me they \""tried\"" to call  so I deserve being called up to the front of the class. So embarrassing, especially when your sick. They even called me up when my husband (who had a different insurance plan) had not paid. AND told me I couldn't see the DR because of it! Thats after I had waited fifteen minutes already. I have no idea what I was supposed to do. Go beat up his insurance company?\n\nThen there was the time I was prescribed medication that sent me to the ER. Wait no hold on there was the TWO times that medication was prescribed to me that sent me to the ER.\n\nAnd the time they told my son he had loose joints when in fact he had scoliosis. Where you get loose joints from curvature of the spine is anyone's guess. \n\nAnd then when Dr. Bauer accused me of being a smoker, when I told her I wasn't. She told me I was lying....because you know thats what I do. Lie to GP's....Its a bit of a sinful delight for me. I always hope it gets me improved care......oh wait. \n\nThe long waits where always enjoyable. If I got out of there in less than a hour it would have seemed nothing short of a miracle. You better plan on a lonnnnnng wait. They are making vacation plans after all. \n\nI could go on for days. This place is awful. **AWFUL***  Please, go somewhere, anywhere else.  The homeless guy on the corner would probably give you better care. He'd be cheaper thats for sure!"
0,"This place is getting seriously demoted. \n\nFor the second time, I have been turned away from my absolute fave cardio class because it has filled up to capacity 45 minutes before it starts. What? Really? Does this mean I have to speed up my after-work rush just to ensure I can write my name down on their sign-in sheet? That's bogus. \n\nWhat a fiasco. The last time the class filled up, I went up to see for myself. So many regulars, who said they signed up, were without spots. That's when one went down to get the sign-in sheet and an employee. Good for her. \n\nTotal chaos. When I asked the front desk what I needed to reserve my spot, chick-a-boo behind the counter had no clue. Then the guy who pulled out a binder really wasn't any better. I wanted to know the process. Don't just tell me to sign-up and pay a $1. I want to know how the system works, man! I said, \""Good to know for future reference,\"" then I left. It's also good to know that you MUST reserve a spot IN PERSON so they can take your dollar. I don't trust them. They'd probably lose my information and I'd get screwed over, again. \n\nI don't use the machines there because they're shitty. I go for the one or two cardio classes that I absolutely love - because of the instructors. Everything else creeps me out, even the female locker room. \n\nPlus, the one time I asked the front counter staff about a personal trainer, she had NO IDEA their names. I tried to describe the one I saw upstairs working out with a client. He was doing moves I used to do, ones that really focus on stability and strength. I thought, \""He looks like he knows his stuff, and I have free sessions here I still haven't used. Oh, why not?\"" Well, chick-a-boo had no clue. \""Go look over there at the board. They have their photos up.\"" That didn't help me, because I didn't really see the trainer on the board. Maybe he was new or he cut his hair. I don't know... How f'n annoying. It reminds me of when I first joined and asked for a trainer to give me a call. Nobody did. Suckas.\n\nI hate this place. I hate going here, but I can't resist because of the cardio classes I love so much. ARRRRGH. It just sucks squirrel nuts that I have to show up AT LEAST an hour before class just to get a spot!"
0,"some equipment just goes missing, too. my boyfriend says the scale in the mens locker room has been missing for 2 months, randomly. one day i noticed someone using the gym's jump ropes and decided the next day i would do that because it looked nice and intense. next day = all jump ropes gone! no reason... they never came back either so i just bought my own and bring it there. \n\ni asked the front desk about it, they said \""oh, we need a code to get in to the equipment rooms.\"" and i was like \""well, can you get it or ask someone to open it?\"" and the response was \""well, i dont really know which trainers are here right now, so i dont know.\"" and i was like \""nevermind\"" -- no point in pressuring an obviously unmotivated employee.\n\nalthough the skinny hispanic guy that looks like he thinks hip hop is super cool thats there in pre-6am hours is fabulous. he remembers your name, inquires as to why you are late, asks why your workout was so short today if you leave too early, etc. great guy. he's young, i dont know his name, but someone should notice that he's a great employee. hes the type of person that, at first glance, you would think he would be an idiot or lazy - but definitely not."

0,"If Kurt Cobain had been here in the summer time, he would have sang \""Smells Like Athlete's Foot.\"" Thank goodness, he lived in the Northwest.\n\nThis 24-Hour Fitness, especially the men's locker room, is disgusting. I took a shower once after a good workout and I had to count the years from my last tetanus shot. Filthy, shaky, rusty partitions in the shower. \n\nThe rest of the gym has an \""I love the 80's\"" vibe. It's one pastel short of a Richard Simmons' color scheme. There were gym rats who perspire so much at stationary bikes that sweat drips from the machine and forms a pool on the floor. If you have an over-active sweat glands, please have the courtesy to wipe. \n\nWorst of all, on my fourth (and last) visit, a petty thief broke my locker and stole all my cash. I reported the incident, filled up a form, and got valuable advice: \""Don't use combination lock, it's easy to break.\"" \n\nUmmm...really? When some gym members have bolt cutters instead of fitness gloves, it's time to move on to a different gym."
0,"Too bad there's not an option for no stars. The only thing more atrocious than the fungal smell and lack of working equipment at this gym is the customer service. Today I cancelled my entire family's membership because I've had enough. After touring three other local gyms - I'm willing to pay the extra money to switch to one that gives a crap about its customers. Having had my membership for 11 years it's a sad move, especially since I pay peanuts - but it's just NOT worth the headache of working out here. When the manager accused me of lying about my child's age, I went back home and brought back her birth certificate to prove I wasn't lying, and still I remained a customer. When the manager bitched at me about not answering the overhead page when it CLEARLY states on the app (in permanent marker) that they MUST call me on my cellular because I am hard of hearing and I run plugged into my iPhone, I stayed a member. Now they're saying I haven't paid up my account even though I have a RECEIPT in my possession from last week, when I paid in person. If this is how they treat loyalty, I'd hate to see how they piss on everyone else. Take my advice - pay the extra few bucks and switch to Gold's, LA, or ANYWHERE else."
0,This place is dump. The air filter above the pool has an inch of dust on it. The tow lights in the steam room do not even work. On e light fixture has been almost pulled off the wall. The Jacuzzi water is disgusting. \nThis company does not care at all several of us have told them several times to get it fixed. They just blow us off. Don't join this place!!! I would rather see them go out of business so  a good company would buy it.
0,"Old equipment that is usually broken. There is ALWAYS at least one broken machine, usually cardio. The place is very dirty and smelly. The AC never seems to be working. The front desk staff are usually to busy being on their cell phones or talking to other staff to acknowledge you.  I'm considering driving to 43 ave and bell. That is a nice one!"
0,"Location is the ONLY reason I go to this gym and I've been going to this location and others for the past five years.  This past fall, I had gone to the gym after a few months hiatus.  I was on the treadmill for 30 minutes then went back to my locker.  It was broken into.  My purse and phone were taken but not my car keys or Smart Water.  I guess the robber must have seen what I drove (hint: it's probably an inside job )  There were only 2 staff members on site, both young men-no women on staff (hint: hint: it's probably an inside job then) A police officer did come and I reported the robbery which was the 3rd in two weeks!  The next day, I spoke with the manager.  The same speech he's probably have told others, you can tell the bottom line is the only thing he cares about.  I lost everything plus a $100 bill which was my b-day money and I've spent over a few grand for membership.  I did receive a refund for 3 months but still REALLY!  'Well you shouldn't leave stuff in the locker.  These people go to gym to gym.  We have signs that tell you not to leave items in the lockers\""...ummm it was locked and I've been going here for over four years and have never had an issue until now. If you are having robberies, you NEED to tell people not just a sign!  Plus one of the staff told me they were having major issues this past fall...umm that's not someone from the outside that's a staff member doing the robberies!  I found out last week there were MORE robberies!  So if you are looking for a gym, move on and go somewhere else.  It's not the cleanest gym but I like the sauna and that's about it! And then I get a call that they found my purse and calendar in a locker.  The manager never followed up with me and when I got my items they were sfuffed in a drawer and the staff member didn't even seem to care.  I think it's time for a new staff and management!"
0,"Place is dated. There are always multiple machines broken and when machines break, they are not repaired for quite a long period of time.  Maintenance is clearly not a priority. I inquired as to why maintenance was not a priority but received no response.   Do not join unless you get tour with manager  and discuss maintenance with manager and get comfortable the situation will change.  You do get access at other clubs around country, so I am able to go to other 24 hour fitness facilities and have found other facilities much more acceptable."
0,"Carpet is torn up, locker rooms are in a sever need of a remodel from 1986. Equipment is old and there are always 5-7 machines broke. Seriously, this should be the crown jewel for Phoenix area 24 hour fitness gyms. Especially for the area. What a let down."
0,What a cluster and a fiasco to get I to a class...people have old passes and different passes which mess up the number of people for the class. 3 of is tried to go to cycle class and didn't get a bike even with a pass and our name on the list. This is the worst location in the valley. I drove 10 mikes to get here...thanks for nothing you guys! I'm sticking to scottsdale. Just wish they had more options for cycle...
0,Terrible service.   I signed up for a three day pass online then finally got a chance to try the gym.   They told me that the pass expired and offered a one day pass.   The whole point was to try the gym at the times I go to see how crowded etc before I joined.   I'd rather take my business somewhere else if you can't allow someone to try your gym twice one time in the am and one time after work to see how busy and the accessibility to the equipment.
0,"I was  a member here at this location ,..For about 5 months.  I Paid 400 for a personal trainor . I used just one session. Used only one.  And they refused to give me any money back. I did not like the customer service from the front desk people a lot of the time too.   I am now going to L.A. Fitness and it's much better.,,.,Better trainers and much cleaner and friendlier and more proffessional staffing.  I\nHated losing that four hundred dollars.   This life I guess ,... Lesson learned."
0,Worst possible gym ever. Staff is extremely unprofessional. and equiptment is dirty all the time. Trash is never taken out and sweat is never wiped up. Its a money scam dont expect to walk in without being harrassed for days via phone to join. Its a 24 hour fitness that isnt open 24hours. Nobody who works there is genuine. I say save your money and go to LA fitness or even a youfit. Nothing here is special its over priced mediocre.
0,"I defy anyone to find a civil, knowledgeable human being who works in this place. I'd rather be stuck in Newark Airport than shop here."
0,"I think the service at Lowe's is consistently so much better then Home Depot, but this Home Depot is the closest home improvement store to where I live.  I went in today asking if they had free standing fans.  The women pointed at one type of box fan on an end cap.  I asked her if there were any others and her response was, \""No, it is August, what do you expect?  You should have bought one in June.\""\nYou know what i expect?  I expect a store to stock the things they sell, and not give me attitude when they don't have what I need, but I guess that is to much to ask of Home Depot."
0,"Total lack of staffing you can walk all over this store and not find an employee. Its dirty, disorganized, and most the time you are left to having to use self checkout, the have virtually no carts or trollys. To top that off you get accosted by illegal immigrants as drive in to the parking lot and while leaving."
0,"I would much rather write a positive review than a negative one, but my experience here was beyond unacceptable, so I felt I had the responsibility to report. \nI recently rented a lawn mower from this store. The employe I dealt with told me the $75 deposit would be refunded with cash upon return. \nI returned to find a different employe who informed me that the policy was actually refunding my card at days end. \nI explained that I was told differently, he offered neither apology nor explanation, just told me to check back tomorrow. \nNo refund the next day. No refund the day after. In the meantime, I had a returned check at my bank due to funds not being there (thanks HD) and incurred a $35 fee. So I returned, was given the run around and demanded a manager. This guy was worse than his employees! Told me \""if you can't afford the deposit, maybe you should rent elsewhere!\"" He then promised to refund my card that day and I left. Well well well, imagine my surprise when checking my account the next morning, I discovered not a credit, but another $75 charge! And with this, another $35 back fee! \nNeedless to say, I angrily returned to speak with the HD manager, and he rudely informed me it was out of his hands and I had to call corporate headquarters. Thanks to the fraud department at my bank, I finally got my money back, but it took 4 weeks, and $70 in bank fees. The initial cost of rental was great, but due to misinformed employees and a careless manager, the experience cost me $70 extra, countless hours of my life, and a world of frustration. I have nothing positive to say about this place, and highly encourage anyone renting equipment to go anywhere else for higher quality products and customer service that would surely dwarf that of Home Depot"
0,"The customer service including that of the manager Jeff at this Home Depot is the worst I've every received.  I was contacted to pick up a door that I had ordered.  After waiting for an hour, the staff including the manager running the store finally figured out that the someone had set the door up front in customer service (where the rep who called me said it would be) dahhh.  When I commented on how ignorant everyone was the manager started threatening me and I thought I was going to have to call the police.  I have written a letter to corporate about this store and manager.  If you must shop at Home Depot make sure it isn't this one unless you are experienced in Martial Arts.  It truly is the ghetto and the staff reflect it."
0,"This review is just about the paint department, only.  The workers in that department there are phenomenal but the lack of staffing in the paint department is ridiculous.  You can count on them to do their best,  but it is hard to deal with.  I used to be in there a lot.  All of the workers bust their guts trying to get the orders out and correct.  They are exceptionally helpful and try their best.  Apparently, the management (or corporate) doesn't care, or doesn't want to retrain and hire more workers to cover the paint department, or doesn't want to pay, or doesn't care if they have workers comp claims or whatever.  That is a tough department with high volume.  If you go for paint, try for Friday nights or some other off time, due to the backlog.  Whenever possible,  I have moved my purchases over to another specialty paint store only due to the lack of staffing at Home Depot on Thomas Road."
0,"This store is swarmed with staff. Are they helpful? Nope. They ignore you even as you struggle to get large, awkward pieces of lumber onto your cart. I passed 10 associates and not one of them greeted me or asked if I needed help finding anything even as I was making my way up and down the same building material aisle obviously looking for something. I had my lumber cart full, but I decided to not purchase anything and left it for those lazy idiots to put back on the shelves. No customer service whatsoever. From now on, I will drive three times the distance to go to Lowes. I worked at Home Depot as a teenager and I remember managers would chew our asses if we didn't greet every customer and asked if they needed assistance. I guess standards for hiring have gone way downhill. I wasted an hour of my day."
0,"Deplorable customer service. Placed a 2K order for delivery and my order was missing 22!! Rolls of industrial tape. Brilliant delivery driver broke a pallet of cinder blocks THEN placed the pallet on a slope leaving it teetering precariously.  Really!?! Called to check on the tape, first guy did not call back, neither did second or third employee contacted. When I asked in exasperation if they could locate other stores where I would pick up the tape myself, they said they can't do it that way between stores explaining my only option was to get a refund and buy the tape again. What? Really, you can't call another store to verify home depot was already paid and hold the items for me to pick up at customer service? Oh, sorry, that would make sense.....\n\n\nI have bought blocks there before and once counted 9 employees waltz right by me while struggling to get the bricks off the high shelf only to be chastized for attemping to utilize their rolling ladder. Mind you, I am a small non-bodybuilder type lady. \n\nHopefully they will call me back today to resolve this problem, but as of now, even a 1 star review if far too generous. Its a shame; they lost any chance of my next order which would have been about another 3K in a week. Their loss is Lowe's gain."
0,One star for the massive headache I got after I ate the food... MSG?  Not sure.
0,this restaurant is not wheelchair accessible. I have no idea how the food is because there are 2 steps and no ramp.
0,Freaking out a little. Just got finished eating there. Hairs in the food and I saw a cockroach crawl across the kitchen floor. At least if I get sick tonight I will know why!
0,"Decided to try this place out on a Sunday night around 6:30. The restaurant was kind of busy but the two servers working should have been able to handle it. We stood at the host stand about 5 minutes before the cook told us to sit anywhere and handed us menus. \n\nIt took over 30 minutes for a server to come over and give us water. We put our order in because we were obviously ready( drinks, an appetizer, and entr\u00e9e's). The sever never came back while we were waiting for the food. However, all the food came out at a reasonable time for being down a cook (about 40 minutes). At this time we asked about our drink and the other server who brought the food said they were in process. \n\nHalf way through the food we finally got the drinks. So what about an hour and a half though the total time sitting down. \n\nNow the food. \n\nWe got the heaven rolls of something and they didn't have much flavor. It came with a peanut sauce and the tofu in the rolls were breaded in peanuts. So just too much peanuts not even other complimentary flavors. \n\nBoyfriend got the western burger with vegetables. The burger looked store bought and the sauce tasted store bought. The vegetables were steamed but did not have any flavor or seasoning on it at all. \n\nI got the steak and potatoes. Steak was store bought and the potatoes were simple like morning potatoes with peppers and onions. Anyone could make it. \n\nI've been a vegetarian for over six years and this is the worst place I have ever been. I literally made a yelp account to give this place a bad review. Now that I actually have an account I will review more places. Usually I amforgiving when it comes to local places but I will never eat here again."
0,"I arrived on time for my appointment and had to sit in the waiting room for over  a half hour with a blaring kids  movie playing on the waiting room television.  The waiting room was not very clean and the furniture was worn and outdated.  While I was waiting, people were being rushed out the door who had just had their Lasik procedure done.  The staff were walking them out telling them their aftercare plan in front of the whole waiting room.  When the \""sales girl\"" finally called me back into a room she did not apologize for the wait.  She only said, \""this is surgery day.  We are busy.  We tried calling to reschedule you (I received no such call). Then she made me look into a machine while she looked at my eyes for about ten seconds.  She then led me to her sales office to talk pricing. She gave a very lengthy sales pitch and did a poor job pretending to listen to my concerns. I am nervous about having this procedure done and she made me more nervous.  She made it seemed like I needed to have the procedure done ASAP before my eyes got worse.  Then she made a morbid comparison to Lasik being equivalent to cutting her finger off.  Then she pushed a finger down and modeled to me what her hand would like missing a finger.  She would not offer specifics on pricing and kept throwing out numbers and percentages.  She made me feel rushed and like I had to decide today if I was going to go with them for the procedure. She discouraged me from using another form of payment other than their financing and kept throwing percentage rates around as to why she was right.  I asked for documentation stating the pricing and discounts available to me and she declined to produce any such document stating, \""This is not like buying a car.  I am not giving you any written pricing.  Anyway, the pricing changes all the time.  These are your eyes we are talking about and you only have two (like I didn't know that).\""  She created a huge sense of urgency with getting the procedure done and kept repeating, \""You only have two eyes.\""  She kept telling me what \""most people\"" do, which is pay the day of the consultation and get the procedure done the following week.  She also told me she needed a $100 deposit before I left today if I decided to go with them.  I told her that her sales pitch was making me feel uncomfortable and rushed as I am in the early stages of exploring this procedure.  She became offended, defensive, and moody claiming it was not a sales pitch and that \""I only have two eyes.\"" She would not even continue the consultation and have my eyes tested to see if I was even a \""candidate\"" for Lasik without my committing to pay.  I then said that I felt their company was not a good fit for me and she led me out.  I do not recommend this company based on my consultation experience.  I would not trust them with the actual procedure because they seem very concerned with getting people in and out of there as fast as they can to make $$$! If you do get the procedure done at this place, you should not pay more than around $1500 per eye because that's the final price I was verbally quoted at my consultation.  But, like the \""sales lady\"" said...prices are always changing! This company needs to train their sales people on how to effectively communicate with clients, build trust, and be empathetic!! Oh, and give clients documents on pricing!"
0,"I had my LASIK consultation today.  I waited in the waiting room for about 30 minutes prior to being taken back by the \""Director of the Center\"".  She took me in a room and did a quick \""test\"" on my eyes and then brought me to another room, sat me down and asked if I had any questions about the procedure.  I said I had numerous questions, but would prefer to speak to the surgeon (No need asking them twice, since I really only cared about what the surgeon had to say).  She said asking her my questions/concerns was \""one in the same\"".  I think not.  That was the first red flag.  The second one came after she said I would not be meeting the surgeon at all prior to the day of surgery.  Who in their right mind agrees to an elective surgery without meeting the surgeon prior to the day of surgery?  I have never heard of such a thing!  I'm assuming after you pay in full you are then allowed to meet the surgeon.  The third and final red flag came after she said she would schedule me an appointment with the surgeon at another time and then revoked that offer, saying \""We just don't do that here.\""   I got up and left.  This place is obviously a LASIK factory mill and I'm not willing to put my eyes at risk to save a few bucks. Beware."
0,"Alex Optical at Christown/Spectrum has done a few of our glasses. This last time we asked them to do 4 pair of glasses - all but one had to be redone.  They even wanted to charge us for their mistakes.  They finally agreed to fix them for no fee, but why should I have to even ask.\n\nI will use Paris Optical, a little more expensive, but they guarantee their work and give you a free pair of lens within the year after ordering the glasses.  I scratch my glasses and this allows me to get all new lenses (same perscription) within the next year."
0,"This place was gross. The pizza was bland and had no flavor, the salads were the same, but drenched in dressing and soggy. The tables had residue on them, and I didn't want to eat on them. I definitely won't be going back."
0,Walked in on Saturday and walked out.
0,"If you have any other choice, do NOT use this company and that lady, they will lie on the paper and I end up lost my case, they stated on the court paper that they did serve the paper to my ex and even said they talked to her, but my ex had 7x24 camera and it did show they even showed up on that day/time on theri paper, in order to collect the money, they will LIE!!!!"
0,I HATE this complex! The management staff is very rude and treat residents like crap. Do yourself and find another place in the area. This place is a ripoff and overall pain. There's plenty of nice condos in the area just check padmapper or zillow. Save yourself and stay away!!!!!
0,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the food, as the overwhelming smell of sewage forced me to leave before I could order. We instead went next door to \""On the Grill\"""
0,"I been to this place twice as well as once at another location.  At this particular location the food is pretty good for lunch but the staff does not seem to be in any hurry.  When I go to the trouble to dive over to this place during a 1 hour lunch break, I really don't like waiting 15 minutes for what is more or less fast food.  The last time I was there I was kept waiting so long that I finally asked for a refund and left.  You'd think that if your chicken combo (first item on the list) is going to take more than 20 minutes to prepare that they might inform me of it, but instead they just left me standing there.  That won't happen again."
0,"I go to this location fairly regularly and have never had a problem. Store is clean, employees are friendly, food is consistent. What more could I ask for? \n\nUntil tonight. I get my order to go, the crispy shrimp plate. The girl working the register was really nice, and I was in and out quickly.\n\nI finally get home and open my container. THE END of my good, reliable Ono experience. My shrimp are blackish/greenish/brownish...plainly, not something I am even going to take a bite of. (Gross!!!)\n\nThe store was about to close and I wasn't going to be able to drive back in time, so I called the store feeling like I should give them a heads up. I don't know if these things could make a person sick or not. (I do know I won't be the one finding out.) \n\nThe girl that answers tells me, \""Yeah, that's how they've been turning out.\""  Well, gee, that's great. Thanks for selling me something you KNOW is sub-par and far from edible. \n\nI guess I'll be going to Pete's the next time I want some fried shrimp, and that's a shame. I really like Ono's mac salad and the katsu sauce with the shrimp.\n\nTo anyone else thinking about eating here -\n\nMaybe you should check your order before you leave. I'm sure this was a fluke and hopefully will be fixed soon, but I know how much I hate wasting money. And being hungry."
0,"This location was a joke...me and my girlfriend went here while we were waiting for her cars oil to be changed at the brake Masters down the street. You stand in line like at a cafeteria and the people behind the counter dishing out your not so fresh food can barely speak English, the tray I picked up was sticky and dirty and had some type of half dried syrup on it and it was disgusting.  They served us and did not even give us silverware, or chopsticks to eat with, and the general decor of this restaurant looks like a ghetto Chinese buffet in crack central.  The floors and restaurant in general were D.I.R.T.Y. like Christina Aguilara dirty back in the day before she was a mom!!!! The food tasted like it had been sitting in a pan for 3 hours, and I would NEVER go to this place again, I was surprised I didn't find a finger or a needle or a cockroach in my plate of mushroom chicken with vegetables."
0,"Gross, plain and simple!  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset.  What a waste of money!"
0,"I've never experienced this before, but I'm just going to let you be the judge:\n\nI am starting to watch/count my calorie load, especially when I am eating out.\n\nAmerican Chinese is famous for huge calorie loads in the sauces and fried treatments, so I thought I would split the middle and order a brown steamed rice with broccoli and beef.\n\nWell, I asked the young lady behind the counter for the calorie count chart and she quickly said she would have to ask someone. No problem and expected...but what happened next was not:\n\nShe walked to the back of the galley-style kitchen past the viewing, walkin freezer to find her manager. Outside of the freezer is the prep area with a large gray garbage can. She stood there, asking her question, HOLDING THE GARBAGE CAN. Then she and the manager walked back to me.  The manager came with the paper and placed it on the prep line. And she grabbed a bowl to serve me. WAAAAAAIT! \""Uh, excise me. Is that a garbage can?\"" I asked. She looked back and asked where. \""There...in front of the freezer...the big gray thing with the black garbage bag stretched around the rim.\"" \""Yes\"". I asked her if she realized that she stood there and grabbed the rim and talked to her manager. \""No,\"" she replied. \""My dear, I watched you and you not only grabbed the garbage can you just came and grabbed my bowl to serve me.\"" She put the bowl down and walked away, washed her hands and apologized.\n\nNeedless to say, I won't be coming back."
0,"My service was so aweful, I really thought I was being punked. I walked in to Panda Express and instead of being greeted, I was told that \""this is all that they've got\"" and they don't make anything else because they were closing soon. Excuuuuse me? Four-fifths of the food pans were all gone. A whole baseball team walked in after me and they were rudely discouraged from ordering, because all they had was out so they left. I insisted on speaking to a manager. I let him him know that his line expediter was expediting customers right out the door. He apologized and had his cook make my plate. At this point, the damage was already done."
0,Lately the quality of service at Panda has definitely deminished. I've have been a customer for a long time. When I ask for my plate to be made the way I like it I've been argued with by the employees. Most of the meat is made with alot of vegetables. Therefore when they serve you with the small entree that they give you for meat it seems to always be filled with more vegetables then meat. When I request for them to try not to give me so much vegetables I'm told that I will have a smaller portion of food not more meat. I simply don't understand why you would rather argue with your customer then to satisfy them. Obviously this company has become so big that the quantity of food left in there trays is more important then the quality of service they are giving.
0,Bean and cheese burrito was awful. The beans tasted like the canned beans you buy at the supermarket. \nOverpriced food.  Try Filiberto's instead. Some of them have daily specials running monday thru friday.

0,"Thought I should update my last experience concerning the volunteering situation at Ballet AZ.  I waited a couple of years and went back and offered my services.  Must have been my instincts because i delayed sending them the paperwork.  Just as well because I was told soon after they \""rescinding\"" their offer to have me do volunteer work with them???  This happened awhile back now, but last I heard the same people are handling that area so doubt if things have changed any.  \n\nYou be the judge"
0,"One of the few places in the area that will deliver.  I thought I would give it a shot.  I ordered a #2 12inch and a large coke.  With a 10% off coupon I had, the total was around $13.50 with tip everything came out to $16.00.  I begin thinking to myself, \""With a Subway and Dilly's Deli next to this place, they better step it up.\""  They said it would take 45 minutes... no problem.  The sandwich came early... great!\n\nThe hot sandwich I ordered was cold and the bottom bread was totally soggy.  My biggest peeve in this world is soggy bread.  The quality of ham is disgusting.  It's slimy and tastes like ham flavoring.  I am not a ham snob by any means, but this is not edible.   For a sandwich that costs this much, they need to use better product.  I was starving when I ordered it.  I ate a few bites and now it's going in the trash.  \n\nI predict that this place won't make it through the summer.  In the summer this place will have to rely on all the local business employees.  People like me who would order food everyday from the same place (if it's good) are the people they will have to rely on.  I know people in my office will never call this place again because they were grossed out by my sandwich and baffled by how much I spent on it.  \n\nI get a limited time to eat lunch...I don't have time to call and complain, have them remake it and try to eat it again.  I'll pretend I just drank a $16.00 soda."
0,"It was a frightening experience.     \n   \nI have been dealing with Jewel, for several years, and have always found her to be professional and knowledgeable.  \nI sent her an email, with a file, for some copies.  But when I arrived, at approximately 4:30, the woman behind the counter said that Jewel was not there, and that the copies were not made.  When the phone rang and she answered it, I left the room and went outside.  I cannot tolerate strong odors, and there was a strong odor of cigarette smoke, inside.  \n\nI contacted her from my cell phone, in my car, from the parking lot, asking whether she could find the file.  When I said that the smoke was a strong odor, she raised her voice, yelling at me, and demanded to know the exact time that the file was sent.  \nThe call ended abruptly when I heard the agitation in her voice, as she told me that I was rude, twice. \n\nAnd then, the door jerked open and she appeared.  If you have ever faced the sight of a huge woman, you will understand that the appearance is intimidating, especially when she is angry.  I am 120 pounds, and she is at least twice my size.    \n\nFortunately, I was with my husband, and she retreated back inside the shop.\n\nLater, after we had just left, she sent the following email:  \n\n\""As you can see I found the file you were requesting. I apologize if you think I was yelling at you.  However I was not.  If you would like to see the file I can print it out for you. If not then Jewel is here from 8am until 3pm.\""\n\nIt was too late, for this type of response.  It was a shame, because I have been dealing with Jewel, for years, and had always been satisfied, until now, a very disappointing experience."
0,"So 1 hour before closing the chairs were already up and the soda machine was already off. I ordered a tuna sandwich and went back home. I have to say that this was the most disgusting sandwich I have ever had. The bread was stale and the tuna was so salty, I ended up drinking a gallon of water. I just threw the sandwich away."
0,"I was visiting Phoenix a few weeks ago and I visited this bookstore. Although they have a nice selection and the prices are fair, I had a disturbing incident with a man I assume was one of the owners. I was looking at a group of books on the shelves and there happened to be a desk nearby which I stayed away from.\nI continued looking and the man came running over to me and told me in a very harsh tone that the books in that area were not to be looked at. The area I was in just looked like a regular part of the store and there was nothing stating that the section was off limits. The man was so rude and so hysterical that it completely embarrassed me and made me feel like I was doing something terribly wrong. I told the man that he should rope off any areas he didn't want the customers to look at and he agreed. But I left feeling very angry and embarrassed and didn't purchase the books that I had intended to buy."
0,I went to this location on 8/31 during their $1.31 scoop event and I have to say it was the worst experience I've ever had. There was a line out the door with only one employee working. It took over an hour to get a scoop of of Ice Cream and by the time I went to pay it was melted due to the long wait and lack of air conditioning. I will not be going back to this location anytime soon.
0,I have never been so disappointed in an oil change! First they took my car and told me they would contact me when it was ready so I was free to do some shopping in Costco next door.  They never called.  I walked back over to pick up my car to find they never touched it and refused to work on it.  They said they heard a noise in the engine and would not tell me what it was.  (I had it checked out at different place).  Sears told me my engine could blow up at any moment.  All that was wrong was the O2 sensor was broken (nothing to cause and engine to blow up).  These guys were just lazy and did not want to do any work.  They chose to scare me instead.  I will never go back to a Sears Auto Center for anything.
0,"These guys are crooks. Shop manager there said I needed a new tire and that another guy was going to come in an tell me about options available.

Guy B says oh you're just in luck I have XYZ Brand tire for $108 per tire... I drive a PT CRUISER! I could get all 4 tires BRAND NEW up the street at they're competitors shop without hassle for $75 more. Why the hell would i pay that for 1?! This place is a joke."
0,"I would never recommend this place to anyone. I was flat out lied too. They do not respect their customers and will tell you anything to take your money. If you are going here, bring someone that knows what they're talking about. Never go here if you don't know know about cars because they'll replace things that don't need to be replaced and do a horrible job doing so. I wish I could give them 0 stars."
0,"Stay far away from this company. You will waste countless hours on endless paperwork, forms, tests and still never get a straight answer about being able to go out and cover shifts. Been on the registry 5 weeks and not one shift. They use several different phone numbers from the west coast and southwest region and seem to pride themselves on it. The number you dial might be long distance, but the person you are talking to is probably sitting right inside the Phoenix Office. Also, their office is no longer on 44th st. It is on 30th st and Camelback."

0,"Leidan Mitchell Salon (the Indian School location) is about a 5 minute drive from my office. After three separate attempts at contacting the salon on three separate occasions with no answer or returned phone call, I decided it was best to stop in on a Saturday morning. \n\nI was looking to make a nail appointment and did not expect to be accommodated the same day (especially on a Saturday). However, the receptionist exclaimed \""of course we can fit you in, no problem\"". At that, I proceeded to sit in the center of the salon for 15 minutes. I watched the front desk girl approach multiple nail techs all of whom seemed to be busy and/or annoyed. The receptionist returned to let me know that, in fact, they did not have any openings. When I inquired when the next opening would be she took my number down and said someone would be in touch with me soon. \n\nAbout three weeks have gone by now, and I have yet to receive a phone call. When I called to follow up, again, there was no answer. When I expressed the difficulty I was experiencing in terms of getting in touch with someone the day I went into the salon - the receptionist gave me a confused look and did not even take the simple, logical step of confirming the number I was dialing (although this is the phone number listed on their website). \n\nAll in all, I was turned off by the simple lack of care I was shown as a new potential client. At the very least, a professional establishment in the customer service industry should have a scheduling system (whether paper or electronic) that allows them to easily relay openings to, and book appointments for, interested clients. They could not even offer that. \n\nNo establishment should ever leave a customer feeling that their business is not needed, but unfortunately Leidan Mitchell did just that."
0,"I went to Miriam to get a hair cut, and the first time was great. The second time was not. I showed her specific pictures of how I wanted my hair cut. She didn't cut it the way the pictures showed nor the way I wanted it. I thought I would give her one last chance to fix it, so I went back. I wish I wouldn't have. First of all, I had to wait over a hour for her to show up at the salon. She said she thought the appointment was for another day. It wasn't, I had the day and time on my voicemail. I know it wasn't the front desk's fault but they could have acted more Courteous.  Another stylist offered to do my hair. I wish I would have let her. When she finally showed up, she acted like it was more my fault and it was no big deal. She did say sorry but it seemed like, I'm sorry I had to come to work. I told her what the problem was with the cut and showed her again pictures of what I wanted. For me it's hard to tell in the salon sometimes how the cut has come out. Also, I didn't think I would have to pay the regular amount, because I had been in there a month or less. She took ten off because she was late. Then later when I had the chance I really looked at my hair. The layers were uneven. She had left a big chunk of hair longer than the other, etc. I'm having to grow my hair out before I can get it cut, so I'm really not happy! I've had other problems with Leidan Mitchell also."
0,"Would recommend to not offer a Groupon if you can't answer your phone or return a bloody text message. 3 attempts and nothing. Even went in there to make an appointment. Was given a card and told to call for an appointment. Sure, that worked,. This was counterproductive and a colossal waste of time!\n\nPerhaps you can extend some professionalism and honor your offer. Fortunately, Groupon credited my account. Buyer beware!"
0,"I love that they have more fruit aguas but they don't usually make them with mainly just the fresh fruit like other places (Los Reyes de La Torta has the best I think). I think it is a powder mix with some fruit cut up in it. \n\nBut I have tried them since I love fresh fruit and they are closer to me. Watch out to because several times when I have ordered items they charge you for the larger size. When I asked about this they tell me \""oh we only have large not small or medium\"" even though those sizes and their prices are listed on the menu. Shady!  This has happened to me at a couple of their different locations."
0,"I am an avid Chiptole fan, but never have I had as terrible service as I did today at this location. \n\nI used the online ordering method to order my food for my lunch. My email confirmation said that my food would be ready at 2:45. We arrived at 2:45 on the dot, ready to pick up our food. Upon telling the cashier that we ordered online, she argued with me saying there was no online order in her system. I then told her I had an email confirmation. She then \""went to the back\"" and appeared with none other than my order sheet that had not been fulfilled. She then handed it to the person at the beginning of the assembly line to start making it and asked me if I was ready to pay, after I had already told her I had paid for it online. \n\nThe person making our order made the first thing wrong and we asked him to correct it, that was actually the least of my concerns, that happens, I get that. So then we just asked him if it would be easier for us to just tell him what we ordered. They then went through the line to make our order but for some reason were moving at the slowest pace I have ever seen at any Chiptole location, there was no sense of urgency and I had placed my order over a half hour before arriving, mind you, there was no line, which is rare for any Chiptole, so it really made no sense that our service was this poor. \n\nWe asked the girl at the cashier what we could do differently so that this wouldn't happen again and her response was that sometimes their system doesn't link up to whatever system is in the back and that was why our order wasn't ready. We left at 3:07. \n\nSo an order I placed at 2:20, was supposed to be ready at 2:45, and we left at 3:07. That is 22 minutes for an order that was placed online. \n\nI will not be going to that Chiptole ever again. And will defintely think twice before ordering online with you guys, very disappointing. :("
0,"My husband and I are avid Chipotle fans... usually the service at most locations is good, sometimes great. THIS location on the other hand is TERRIBLE. I could write a book on the many occasions we have experienced atrocious customer service. I hope the owner of this location wises up and reads the reviews. A change in staff is necessary!! Food is still good, but if you're looking for good service.. Spend your money elsewhere."
0,"I am one of Chipotle's biggest customers and probably average about 2-3 visits per week.  I am usually impressed with their service and speed, but this particular Chipotle is the worst that I have ever been to and its unfortunately the closest to my house.  Their lines take forever, their employees are rude, they can never keep the food line stocked....I could go on and on.  I will drive out of my way just to not have to purchase from this store.  I have complained to Chipotle corporate about this store, however they seem to not yet have it figured out.  It needs new management."
0,"This location sucks. Didn't know you could desecrate chipotles perfection but you can. They run out of super basic things every time I'm there and just expect you to deal with it not even try to provide more or hustle. Last time I came in at a very normal dinner hour and they ran out of steak and the employee said to just order something else? Da fuq? \n\nThey run out of chips ON THE REG which I didn't know was possible. There will be 6 or more employees standing around doing nothing. Also the employees are pretty sassy 85 percent of the time (eye rolls etc). Like I get it, customer service is rough at times but chill out."
0,"Yesterday, not only did I receive the slowest service I've ever had at a Chipotle but one of the staff members, April, was extremely rude...she gets paid to take orders not the other way around"
0,"I will never come to this chipotle again.I had to watch 3 employees blow a condom up like a balloon, play with it like 13 year olds and then pop it making a loud bang so everyone could hear. Oh and the salsa looked and tasted old.\n\nWhat does the manager do? Goes up and gives then a little pat on the back and say \""don't do it again\"". He walked away laughing with employees. Any decent manager would of fired this employee on the spot.\n\nIt was disgusting. My Gf is writing to their corporate. N"
0,"Just moved back to this area and as a regular at Chipotle I may just quit going to any Chipotle after coming to this location. I gave it 4 tries, the rice is always dry, the portions served are tiny, the employee attitudes are the WORST and it's the slowest service I've ever seen. All 4 times. Horrible."
0,"This is the worst Chipotle location I've ever been to. They don't hold up to the standards set by Chipotle at all.  \n\n-People here move at a snail's pace. Im not saying they need to rush, but the way everything is set up should make for a smooth and quick experience.\n\n- If you tell them what you want they can only remember one thing you said. Example: \""Pico and hot salsa.\"" Then they just put Pico on and look at you. \""Sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.\"" Puts spur cream on and just looks at you. \n\n- Ordered tacos to go, when I get home with them, 5 minutes later, I have a pile of sour cream all over my \""tacos\"" which now resemble a casserole of some sort. I can't even figure out where one taco begins or ends. So appetizing for $8. \n\nIf I wanted crap I would go to Taco Bell. At least there a taco still looks like a taco and they keep the contents inside the tortilla."
0,"This place is a joke. The employees are slow as can be, they f*ck the portions up, they look at you like you're an idiot when you are ordering. I wouldn't give this place another shot unless someone else was paying for it. I feel this place should be shut down and a Filibertos or something of that nature should open up in its place. Hell I will just go to the Taco Bell that's in the same parking lot. \n\nThe one star is because they had air conditioning.\n\nManager should be fired."
0,Three weeks later and my machine has tension problems like never before. Guess where I won't be going to get it fixed?
0,"I took my old, fully metal, very reliable Viking machine in for one small repair, and it's not run well since.  It seems they used a substandard lubricant which gums up unless the machine is in a hot room!  The charge was exorbitant as well.  I will be looking for another repair company.  Sally's in Mesa had a wonderful woman named Kay who did the best repairs and whose charges were very reasonable.  Sigh~"
0,"Bad attitudes from the workers, the food is not that great to put up with the mood of this place. This isn't like the soup Nazi from Seinfeld. Sometimes the place is open and sometimes it is not which makes for crappy business."
0,"Came in with my son and nephew.  Asked if I could add Chicken to a salad and first I was told no, and then I was told that I could but it would be  an additional 5.99 if I wanted chicken.  I have no problem paying extra for an addition however 5.99 is quite excessive.  Well I orders a medium cheese pizza for the boys and I will eat when I get home.  The customer service here was terrible.  It is no wonder the place was empty.  We will not be back and I will spread the word about what a great experience we had."
0,"This place looks nice when you walk in, but don't expect any customer service. I've been in twice to use a computer during my work day and both times I've had both printer issues as well as employee incompetency issues. The people there don't seem to think they need to help you and would rather sit behind the counter chatting. When I finally got someone to come over to help they made the problem worse and ultimately resulted in taking an insane amount of time trying to get refunded for their mistakes which they wouldn't even apologize for. \nPs James, member since 06... you'd think you'd learn how this stuff works by now. Also, your a jerk."
0,Employees too concerned with chatting behind the counter other than offering to help you.
0,Go to UPS!! I came here because I had to turn in a assignment for school and my scanner wasn't working so I figured I could get them to scan a few papers and email them to me for a buck or two. They said they couldn't do that unlike a UPS store. My options were to either pay to use there over priced computers at like 70 cents a minute with a single page scanner or they could sell me a USB and put it on the overpriced 11$ USB.. From now on I will continue to give my business to UPS stores and plan better in the future so I don't end up having to use this late night crap store again
0,After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Don't waste your time here.
0,"I've gone to this salon several times, but this last time was a real cluster*$%^. I went in for my usual mani-pedi. TWO women worked on my hands and feet at the same time!!!!!! I was uncomfortable stretching across the giant pedicure chair so that the lady on my left could paint my fingernails over the side of the arm rest. Based on my previous encounters at this salon, and the fact that the woman doing my manicure had done a great job many times before, I let the weird tag-team of my nails go on. I smiled and acted nice, but the nail polish was old, clumpy and had hair in it... Worst manicure of my life, and the pedicure wasn't much better. This happened on a rainy Friday afternoon a couple of weeks ago and I was one of four clients at the time. Basically, those ladies shared me like I was a sandwich, each getting a somewhat small tip instead of one of them receiving the usual 20%. Moral of this story is that I won't ever be going back and I will not recommend them to anyone!"
0,"stopped here because i was in the area. boy was that a big mistake. i too had the guy, who i wonder why they let him touch people. he is horrible and the way he did the polish what a joke. \nbut the worst part was that after the pedicure from a cut that developed my foot got infected and couldnt work or barely walk for 4 days. \nnever again will i go back there. \n(giving one star is being nice)"
0,"My mom and I had gone there before for a pedicure and they did a decent job so today we thought we would go back again for a pedicure, never again. My mom had a guy and I had some lady, when we went to put our feet in the water and  we both had to say our water was way too hot and they needed to cool it down. Neither of the people we had were very friendly, we barely go a hello out o feither them and never once got their names, the most they spoke to us was when they wanted to be paid and I'm pretty sure the lady doesn't speak much English.\n\nIf you come in with a design idea, say from Pintrest, just forget asking them to do it. I showed the lady what design I wanted, it was something that I thought would be relatively simple, I just wanted the colors different from the photo, I had to explain exactly what I wanted, not a big deal but then she started doing it and it was already not looking right so I questioned it, and she seemed confused. The guy that was working on my moms toes had to tell her in another language what I wanted, she still fully didn't get it but she was trying. She was starting to finish up and asked me if I liked it, I did ask her to make one of the colors (the silver horizontal line going through all of my toes) more prominent, she did that, for the most part. Then she asked me if I liked it, it looked okay and she said she would fix it if I didn't like, I thought I could deal with it. Then I went to sit with my mom for our feet to dry and then we both got a closer look and they looked extremely sloppy. I probably could have done a better job. She asked if everything was okay and I told her they didn't look as good as I thought, the silver line I wanted was a big glob of glitter that was uneven. She said she would redo them, I ended up asking her to just do my toes one solid color. I told her at least three times which color I wanted and she picked up a different color and asked me if I wanted that one, the guy had to tell her which color I wanted. She kept apologizing to my mom and I. I went back to sit with my mom to dry my toes, no one ever said how long we needed to sit, or let us know when we could go they just walked off and left. I know they were busy but common courtesy goes along ways.\n\nI say they're fine if you want a basic pedicure with one color paint, if you want anything beyond that I would go elsewhere."
0,I have gotten my nails done here a few times. Medocre work. Last time I went there they quoted me ten dollars less then what I paid. I asked for for an extra gel coat for white color and the nail girl charged me for both a full acrylic amd a gel manicure after quoting me a different price. I just paid the bill and vowed to never be back.\n I had received a reference for another nail salon and when the nails started to come off prematurely I made an apmnt.  The technician advised that I requested they use the type of nails that were actuallybused. It turns out they used the wrong size bc they were to lazy to adjust the nails correctly.  \n Extremely disappointed. I WILL NEVER be back
0,"I went in to Paper Joy this past week and I have to say  it was the worst experience in my life.  I'm not sure if the owner saw us pull up in a beat up truck and me walk in with my mom and neice and nephew, and assumed we were poor and I was un-wed with two kids!!  Or if she is just this rude to everyone.  I walked into the small cramped space and was ignored, so I started looking around.  She has a few examples of invitations on her back wall, so I started to look at those, I was not impressed.  I finally went over to her desk and she finanlly asked if we needed help.  I told her I just got engaged and wanted to see some examples of invitations and save the dates, and she told me I had to make an appointment.  There wasn't anyone in the store, she was very rude, and I could tell she was passing judgment on us.  She must not have seen the rock on my finger! Sure my parent's don't have a lot of money, hence the beat up truck we pulled into the parking lot in.  But my paren't aren't paying for my wedding.  My fiance and myself are, we are getting married at the Waldorf Astoria in Chicago (I was visiting family in AZ and wanted to involve my Mom in some of the planning).  If she wasn't so judgemental and allowed us to look through some examples we may have used her, all though I wasn't impressed with the few examples she did have on her wall!  She has no idea what my budget was and if she did know I'm sure she would have treated us better, but to be honest I wouldn't want to give someone like that my buisness.  Make sure you make an appointment before stopping in this place, and make sure you are dressed to the nines so she doesn't think your money is worthless in her store.  BTW - her webiste says appointments are preferred, not necessary!  No thanks!"
0,"I decided to let some time pass before writing a review, but I find that even though several months have passed I am still disappointed.  I find that I am still very hurt by the way we were treated by Dr. Zacher's office.  My husband had gone in for his regularly scheduled cleaning.  The office wanted to take x-rays.  My husband was not having any dental issues or problems.  He was in for a regular cleaning.  He is in the medical profession and has done a lot of research about the overuse of dental x-rays.  He asked that he not have x-rays taken on this visit.   Dr. Zacher and his staff said that they could not clean his teeth without the x-rays so they couldn't help him any further and he left the office without the cleaning.  We never heard anything further on this matter.  A couple of months after this incident our daughter fell and injured her tooth.  When we were checking out, Rhonda said that since my husband had walked out on his visit that we would have to pay for his visit that day.  The total was well over $300.  I was standing at the desk, while Rhonda was saying rather loudly that since my husband walked out we had to pay.  It was very embarrassing since there was a family friend in line behind me.  I was so humiliated.  I didn't know what to say so I paid the bill.  I later inquired of several friends in the medical field about the industry standard for no show fees.  The typical fee for a no show visit is about $30.  They had never sent us a bill for the visit, but rather waited until I was in the office to embarrass me on the spot.  We are a family with seven children, one in college, and they saw no problem with being unfair and gouging us for the visit.  I have no problem with paying a REASONABLE fee for the visit.  My husband was not asked to pay a cancellation fee when he left, and we were never sent a bill in the mail.  They took great joy in embarrassing me in front of a family friend after coming in for an emergency visit. I am just so sad that after years of using Dr. Zacher, they would take advantage of our family like that."
0,This location is terrible. Save yourself a headache and go a mile down the road to the UPS store on 44th and Oak. I bought a box to ship my laptop in and they said I had to go put it together in the parking lot even though I bought it and was shipping it at their store.
0,"I first moved out here from across country back in May 2011. When I first arrived the apartment had new carpet and linoleum. The overall appearance of the apartment was ok aside from the stains in the bathtub and the counters seemed to literally becoming unglued in both the bathroom and kitchen. The living room ceiling fan did not work so I called maintenance and they came out promptly. I forgot my debit card on my end table and while they were in my apartment and I was at work and the guy (who was also the maintenance manager) decided to steal my card and also make purchases until my card was at zero balance. (There was only about $25 on it at the time but imagine if I had more). Of course the office manager at the time, Diane, denied up and down and that her guys \""would never do such a thing\"" the fact remains that they were there and it was gone. I guess it magically grew legs and walked out of my apartment and the fraudulent charges that I had to get reversed were a figment of my imagination.\n\nNeedless to say they did the job half fast and didn't even fix the fan. The guy simply hooked it up so that I could turn it off and on with the light switch but I still could not change the speed. He was supposed to come back but never did. A month later I called the office inquiring about my fan and then I scheduled an appointment for the guy to come out and he replaced my fan. I don't know why this wasn't done to begin with. This guy was supposedly the maintenance manager!\n\nThank GOD sh it for brains Vicki is no longer there. I did not want anyone in my apartment if I was not there and she gave them consent to enter my apartment. Everything this woman touched was wrong. She screwed up my move in papers multiple times. I told her multiple times I wanted the first two months rent included in the move in cost so I wouldn't have to worry about next months rent. Apparently to her a dog on the application is merely a suggestion she didn't realize I would be bringing a dog. What did she think? That I just put my dog on there for kicks and giggles?\n\nI swear Diane ripped me off. I'm not sure how she came up with the total that she came up with. I should have ONLY owed the $300 in pet deposits and two months of pet rent yet the number she was coming up with was at least $100 more. (I can't remember exact pricing since it has been almost two years.) Regardless, I do not feel that I should be responsible for their mistakes and should not have been held accountable but it is what it is.\n\nThey shut down the pool in August OF ALL TIMES!! The hottest, crappiest time of the year. It took them two weeks to even do anything. Then it took like a month for them to re-plaster. The pool sat there forever with the old plaster scrapped out and the new brown tile there. They didn't even take out the blue tile in the jacuzzi so now the pool is brown and the jacuzzi is blue. GHETTO!! (Times are an approximate. I can't remember exact time lengths.)\n\nI previously lived here before when it was under Equity and this place was SO much better!!! Ever since Lincoln took over the property went downhill. The grounds are poorly kept. They decided to repaint the buildings which looks as though its half done. They had to repaint a few places since they forgot to finish a wall or the paint bleed into the other color. The place looks now like a ghetto mexican village! They ripped out all of the grass on the property, which wasn't much to begin with and added bushes to \""cover up\"" what looked like a giant litterbox since they ripped out all the grass and put stone down. This is smack dab in the middle of the property. The curb is still there. Everything they do is half fast.\n\nThey didn't clean up the grounds for a long time. No cutting bushes back no cleaning up branches/leaves. It looked like a forest floor in the back with all the pine needles laying around. Recently they came and cut the trees. They didn't even bother to clean up after. They left it there for a week and then cleaned it up the following week. Really?? They couldn't clean it up right after they cut all the cr@p off??\n\nThere is new office staff and they seem very nice, very competent. I'm not sure about maintenance. There has only been one guy that I have been dealing with which I assume is not the thief. I would have hoped they fired his a ss. Anyway, this guy, I think his name is Cliff, he's very nice and he actually fixes things and doesn't do it half fast. When my air conditioner was dripping on the inside he came and fixed the shoddy job a previous guy did. All he did apparently was put some kind of grease to stop the leak instead of actually taking the time to do the job properly. \n\nI left a review before. I had no intentions of renewing my lease. However I had a financial situation and didn't have the money to move out of this hell hole. They raised my rent $50!! Which I couldn't afford to pay so I asked for it to be reduced and the office manager Diane yelled at me about my review"
0,"Worst leasing office! First of all they wrote the wrong rent amount on our lease. When my roommate and I went together to sign the lease there was a temp working. We initialed and signed. Then the office calls us back to say they gave us the wrong lease and to come back to sign new with correct amount which was $40 higher. Are you kidding me? We refused to sign new lease and this is there mistake. Called corporate office and they assured us that we are right about not having to sign a new lease. \n\nAmong other small issues about the apartment, They had an insect sprayer guy come to spray all apartments. A couple weeks later they called to confirm our \""bed bug treatment\"".. WTF! We said no one ever informed us the inspector found bed bugs! They said someone was suppose to call us. I was in Cali at this time freaking out! They were treating tomorrow. My roommate and I were furious no one notified us of this! They gave us a list of how to prepare for treatment. I came home that night late and trash bagged EVERTHING I own! We had to clean out kitchen cabinets and moved all furniture to center of rooms. I told them I know we don't have bed bugs since I have never been bitten! Next morning insect spray guy comes to our apartment that I had to take time off work to be there. I went to leasing office to ask if someone can help move my bed and they look at me confused stating \""he's only going to spray, not treat\"" I looked at inspector and he said he never said we had bed bugs! No no bed bugs... WTF 10xs.. The leasing office just look at me like Oh Well. I got no apology. I called corporate again. Nothing they can do. I had to get all my clothes out of trash bags and put everything back! \n\nLastly I was told I'd get my pet deposit and gate remote refunded at moving out. I only received one check in full for the remotes. I called and spoke to manger and she said she will mail the pet refund and also said our last water bill was taken out of this check. Fine. I never got a check! For months I called and manager tells me I was never due a refund for pet. Seriously! I called corporate again. Of course they don't deal with money issues.. \n\nThis place is has made me feel absolutely taken advantage of. It was incredibly stressful to feel like you have bed bugs and no one told you. Thankfully we didn't but thanks Ingleside for the suffering and not apologizing."
0,"DO NOT TAKE YOUR DOG HERE to be groomed unless you want him to come back cut up and bleeding.  I brought my shih-tzu here to be groomed by Sylvia and when I picked my dog up he was shaking and visibly upset.  When we got home, he wouldn't walk, run, play, or even go to the bathroom or eat and drink.  My dog is two years old, this is very out of character for him.  I knew something was wrong with his back leg because he wouldn't put weight on it, and upon closer inspection I noticed that the entire inside of his leg had been cut up by the clippers.  His skin was raw and bleeding, and there were other spots on his back that looked the same.  I immediately called Petsmart and they told me to come back and they would reimburse me.  I returned the next day and asked that they have their vet check him out as well, because the situation had not improved over night.  They agreed to refund me and have the Banfield vets look at him.  I ran home to get my dog, and brought him back.  When I arrived, I was told I would be next in line, right after the dog in front of me because he was an emergency.  Ok, not a problem.  Then another dog was seen and helped, then another dog, so I finally went up and asked how long I could anticipate to sit there waiting on a Sunday afternoon.  The woman couldn't give me an estimate and told me I would have to wait until all of the appointments were seen first.  I, once again, asked to speak with the manager, who does nothing for managing situations whatsoever, and he told me that because they are a separate business, they couldn't do anything about the wait.  Needless to say, I left.  For $56 + $10 in tip, I can find a groomer who will treat my dog correctly and humanely, and I will not have to worry about them coming home injured.  I will never return to Petsmart for grooming, nor will I set foot in this Petsmart for anything again.  There are quite a few other pet stores and groomers in the area and I'm sure their level of service will exceed Petsmart's lack in customer service tenfold."

(Still 1st class) \n\n\""So what's the problem\"" you ask? \n\nWell when you enter this restaurant with a reservation, a snooty hostess will guide to their rather cramped bar to wait for 1 - 1  1/2 hrs. to get your table!(OK it's a popular high end place, & you can practice your art of conversation over the loud volume of many other patrons waiting the same lousy treatment from the hostess....) Oh this is when sticker shock is about to hit you $30-$35 for a beer (a Guinness) & a glass of wine! \n\nYou finally get seated & the waiting staff is doing one hell of a job trying to sell you an expensive bottle of wine! (This part of the experience is very similar to buying Time Share!) \nSo you order another glass of wine & beer which makes you seem like a cheapskate, or get treated as such. \n\nNow the food does taste good, but with rather small portions & rather hefty sticker, it makes you masticate every bite & really taste your dish!

I have hoped for wonderful meals at this nice restaurant but everything I've tried has been a tremendous disappointment.  Anyone who thinks they are going to get decadent food at this extremely expensive hotel will be hugely disappointed.  F-.  Outrageously disappointing.  WTF."
0,This used to be my favorite restaurant for special occasions.  Such a dissapointment when we went there in July for our anniversary.  Service was just teriible.  So understaffed.  My fish was overcooked and no apology made when I had it sent back.  I used to just love this restaurant - all the history and fine service  Not anymore.  The matredee stood at his desk gossiping with 2 friends while we waited and waited to be acknowledged.  Sad......this used to be one of the best.
0,I went to this place for a special occasion.  The waiter was noticeably trying to run the bill up.  I kept trying to keep the bill down.  It was a very strange experience.  The fish was ok but very salty.  I would not go back under any circumstances.

0,"Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best, and their \""schmears\"" appear to be highly processed.  I've generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive, as has the service.  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry, and wanted a bagel (they're supposed be a bagel store after all!).  First, no salt bagels.  Aren't salt bagels one of the standards?  Second, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.  Whoever made the bagel didn't even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.  The other half was basically dry.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels, and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you."
0,"I LOVE Einstein bagels. A LOT. Bet bagels I have had. We live right by this location and go there often but today was my last time I will go to this specific one. It is so dirty. I will give them a break that yes it was Presidents' Day so they were probably busy ... But there was trash on every table, all over the floor, the coffee bar area was disgusting, and the last straw was the gross bathroom. You can tell it had not been cleaned in months. There was so much grime on the sink and the paper towel dispenser I was majorly grossed out. It makes me wonder how clean the kitchen area really was. My order was wrong which Happens no big deal... On top of that I have never had good customer service there- next time I will drive the extra 10 minutes out of my way to the location on Tatum and shea's- they're always friendly and it's very clean there."
0,"What ever happened to the Great Bagel place?  I love Bagels!!!  I had to go again to this place, and was hoping that something changed.\n\nSad to say it has not.  Dirty, not organized, bad & slow service.  Manager running around not paying attention to the store.\n\nCOME ON PEOPLE - this is not rocket science.\n\nPlease, please find a manager that can lead and train staff! oh and clean.\n\nI will not return!\n\nPlease yelpians, suggest a good bagel place for me."
0,A big fat FAIL to this Schlotzsky's location!!!! .\nI went to order something for my office and did so online. but for some reason the company they use for group orders some how some way got messed up. so Schlotzsy's never had my order. So after almost an hour of waiting I  called them and they  didn't even have my order. so they took it and an hour later we got the food. Then the next day I get a phone call saying i did something wrong and could i fix it so they can get there money. So i tried and it kept  kicking me  for some reason so now not only do they want there money they wont me to take time out of my work day to come down and pay for it at the store. Really!?!  I tell you customer care and service right out the window. I will never ever order from this location again!
0,"I dropped my mom off for a surgery appointment and was looking for something to eat at 9 am. Got a medium eggsky sandwich with sausage on sourdough. The sandwich was much larger than I expected it. They walked it out to my table, straight from the microwave. The bread was tasteless, spongey, no hint of flavor, reminded me of day old Pizza Hut breadsticks. Egg was overcooked. Hell it was probably precooked and came in a plastic bag anyway, sausage was bland. I honestly have never been to a Schlotsky's before, and I will never be returning. How the hell do people eat this."
0,"Well you've really out done yourself this time Great Clips on 44th & Thomas. Thanks for the usual shitty hair cut. This time the \""professional stylist\"" cut my hair with the wrong size clippers, but I guess I should expect that from one of the worst run franchises in America. Thanks assholes!"
0,"I believe her name is Shannon or Sharon not quite sure but if you can avoid her do so by all means she extremely rude. I should of known that by the way she checked me in typically you walk in they check you in ASAP I come in and wait at the counter for 2 minutes or so after she greets me waiting for her to check me in once checked in she tells me it'll be a moment or two so take a seat. After she cleans her area I'm called up next during the haircut she ask me what I do after telling her I work for a financial firm I can see her roll her eyes in the mirror. After a few minutes into the haircut I request she doesn't shave my beard jokingly I say for insulation purposes she follows up by asking if I want the hair in my ear shaved or should she leave it for insulation purposes. I also requested to not trim the hair on top of just the back and sides, did she listen? Of course not. \n\nThe absolute worse haircut I've had at this establishment."
0,"These girls that work there are so bitchy. They were so mean to my son. So unwelcoming! I will never ever bring my family there again! I thought they can manage a trim, a fade. It's not some high fashion salon! It's a cheap hair cut place! These girls need to go back to Cosmotology!"
0,"Called and specifically asked if they could guarantee delivery between specific times on Valentines Day, once assured I placed my order.  15hrs later I get a voicemail asking if I could move the delivery to today and if so they would throw in a box of chocolates free of charge.  After being put on hold for a total of 30min and hung up on twice they finally found my order and assured me that everything would be delivered today.  Well the flowers were delivered today but no chocolates along with misspelled  and misquoted words on the card.  When you charge $15 for delivery I'd expect some level of professionalism. I will NEVER order from here again.  STAY AWAY and order from 1-800-FLOWERS.  I had wanted to support a local business but in this instance I will stick with a national competitor."
0,Would five 0 stars if I could. They never delievered my flowers and never even called me to inform me of what happened. They were just going to keep my money. Will never use them again! Though i did get a full refund from them after I called 2 days later to see what the hell happened.
0,"Safeway grocery you suck. First we had to get the stupid shoppers card now this horrible Safeway phone APP. Are you kidding me? It is easier to log into my bank account than your ridiculous phone coupon app account at Safeway. \nFirst problem...The shopper card, the app and Safeway.com don't communicate with each other and the phone \""help-line\"" is patronizing and arrogant. Do I really need 3 accounts just to shop? I don't think so!\nNext, the twit in the produce department at the Indian School store had evidently gone to the same customer service training as the phone call center because she kept telling me to get help with \""one of our App specialists\"" at the front desk. News Flash for Safeway... If it takes an App specialist the software IS NOT READY for prime time. And I wanted lettuce for heaven's sake. I did not want a technology lesson from a grocery store clerk!!!!\nFurthermore, it takes a Captain Mid-Night decoder to figure out if the \""savings\"" are for members translate as, the stupid card... OR the APP only specials or just normal in-store savings. UGH. I don't need grocery shopping to be this complicated. I put my lettuce back on top of a case of cokes and walked out!!\nSafeway, you should stick with groceries and leave the internet experience and downloadable apps to someone that can develop them. I'll buy more and more from Amazon rather than this stupid place. If I wanted to shop with my phone, I'd already be going to Amazon at least they understand how to make customers happy. When I go into a bricks and mortar store, I just want to see the stuff and buy it. I don't want to have to drag a computer (phone) app with me! \nI'm so angry at Safeway that I'll be buying from Target."
0,"Welcome to crackville! My car got broken into 5 times over the 2 years I lived there. The owners are total jerks ... you can kiss your security deposit goodbye! My AC went out both summers I was there.\n\nStay away ... stay far, far away!"
0,"Unfortunately, I currently live here and would love to give the place great reviews but really it's just a mess.\n\nFirst, the rent is $922.30 for a spacious (900+ sq. ft.) 2-bedroom with utilities included. Sounds great, right? WRONG!\n\n$922.30 also includes roaches, maintenance that never fixes broken AC units, leaking ceilings, or cold shower faucets and instead says \""we'll see what happens,\"" a crazy black woman next door who is either a current or recovering meth/crack addict who likes to break into your apartment or start the building on fire, people who don't put their dogs on leashes or clean up their dog's poop, lots of noise from rowdy neighbors, phone calls to the police for domestic disturbance at 2am, a fake emergency maintenance number so you can never reach anyone, phone calls to the office that are not returned, stolen tires, and no one in the office when they say they will be there.\n\nThe $922.30 excludes washers and dryers in unit, guaranteed parking, lighting fixtures outside, guaranteed delivery of packages, a clean pool, AC in the laundry room, and working laundry washers and dryers.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm not renewing in November and will be lucky I only have to go month-to-month for December to hightail it out of here."
0,"It takes management several weeks to a month to finish or begin repair requests. When it does finally get done, it's sub-par. Children are very noisy and are allowed to go unattended. I don't know about the rest of the apartment complex but my neighbors are very rude and noisy. Several complaints have done no good. By account in any GOOD complex they would have been evicted a long time ago. It appears after only a few months of living here, that anyone can get away with anything here.\n\nPeople leave garbage around the complex, and the laundry room is terrible. Crummy washers and dryers, and they expect people to pay $1 each. Plus there are only 3 for the whole complex so sometimes you cannot get any laundry done. Walls are very thin. I know when living in apartments you are going to get some noise but this is ridiculous! Rent is high for these outdated (asbestos popcorn ceiling), old apartments. Which would explain the need for constant repairs. Bathroom is very tiny, allowing for very little movement. I don't know if they are trying to save money, but they are going about it the wrong way by cutting off the lights way too early so the complex is pitch black in the morning when I go to work. Arms outstretched is how big it is.\n\nRecently since I don't live here anymore, my brother and sister moved in and some pedophile tried to lure my sister back to his apartment! After calling the police it turns out he is related to the owners or some type of garbage like that.  We had extensive flood damage that destroyed thousands of dollars in furniture due to the upstairs neighbor having a washer when it is forbidden. Numerous times this happened where the water would come flooding down from the light alcove in the kitchen. Finally there was one huge flood where we had to move out for a couple of weeks until everything could dry and things could get put back into place and they FINALLY evicted the man after dealing with his crap for over a year. \n\nThe sauna does not work and the parking is extremely tiny with one one way in and out. Sometimes people will park in your space! The few things I liked were they were gay friendly apartments, behind Di Vito's restaurant, across the street from 7-Eleven and down the street from Savers. There is access to the Arcadia area but do yourself a favor and go a little bit further to rent, these apartments are a dump."
0,"More a business then a clinic.. a certain degree of care for the animals, but in my opinion and experience, it's all about the almighty dollar there.  I felt my pet was second over how much they could nickel and dime me for.  After $$$$ dollars spent, I went to another vet who put the animal first with the cost secondary.  Again, my opinion only, not my type of vet clinic."
0,They like to run expensive tests and we believe them to be dishonest. We had been going there for years but no more.
0,"DO NOT GET MARRIED HERE! This resort is beautiful from the outside, but start peeling back the layers and you will see an ugly company that will nickle and dime you at every turn. My wedding experience turned from one of joy and happiness to a feeling of dread and nausea at every turn with this company.  THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW UP FRONT: Expect to pay a 22% service charge that is TAXED with the sales tax + the regular sales tax on top of your bill. Also, plan to spend $100 per bartender and be expected to tip several key people during the reception, despite the service charge. Also, plan to pay $4.00 per every car that valets at your wedding. If you want a list of who actually used the valet, forget it. Expect to meet every deadline they give you with your payments, but do not expect such promptness from them. And if you use their \""preferred vendors,\"" remember who some of those vendors really work for at the end of the day... I have my contract on record for anyone who wants a glimpse at the \""whole picture.\"" Trust me when I say that the beautiful, sugary sweet image you get on your initial visit, will not depict the financial reality here."
0,"This review is exclusively for the T Cook's (if it is part of T Cook's) lounge area only as we did not stay in the hotel. I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, however, we feel that people need to hear about the experience we had here. In summary, we would not return due to their poor customer service and have shared the following experience w/ our friends and family.  My husband thought it would be nice for us to go out and do something special before NYE to help us decide if we should spend NYE there. He did a whole lot of internet research and found that according to the website, the Lounge area of this hotel had flamenco entertainment once a month.  He called to verify and to see if we needed reservations, the woman who answered was quite nice, he said, and confirmed the start time of the entertainment. How fun, we thought! We dressed for the occasion and were very excited to go to this Lounge; we went wednesday december 28, 2011 and arrived at 6pm. The grounds are absolutely beautiful-we were even more excited as we were pointed towards the back area to The Lounge.  First off, we walked in, there was no hostess/host, no one to greet us- not knowing if we were in the right place, we looked around and at that time a waitress (or maybe the bus girl?) practically ran past us, clearly not wanting to be side tracked.  My husband asked her if this was the place where they had the flamenco entertainment and as she was walking away/running away, she said that there wasn't any flamenco there and pointed to the bar and told us to ask the \""bar supervisor\"". My husband and I looked at each other wondering, huh? So we both walked over to the bar where there was a bartender and one of the waitresses, Kathryn and i think another bar person. We stood there waiting for them to agknowledge us, which they didn't, so after a few awkward seconds my  husband  asked them if this was the place, etc...Truly we felt like we were interrupting their conversation; we felt, at this point, very unwelcome and it hadn't even been 5 minutes since we arrived. We were pretty sure that we were in the wrong place and there's no flamenco entertainment here.  They all looked at each other to ask themselves, is there flamenco entertainment here? One said no, the other one had no idea and Kathryn the waitress said that they did but that it would be outside. All this while, no one was speaking to us, there were speaking amongst themselves. We found this to be extremely rude, impolite and uninviting. I think my husband asked if food was served there, Kathryn at this point said yes and informed us that there was also a restaurant down the hall (TCooks) that served food.  We felt pretty uninvited there, like she was shooing us away, actually now that i think about it, so we walked to TCooks and realized that we weren't in the mood for formal dining and returned grudgingly to The Lounge. We didn't get a 'welcome back' or any greeting that could turn the previous experience around but yet we decided to sit. The waitress Kathryn was dutifully pleasant while taking our order. The hors d'hoerves were good, but I have to mention this: when the \""bus girl'? I didn't get her name served us the food, not a word from her. My husband politely said, \""Thank you\"" as she served us the food and still not a word back from her. She's the one that nearly ran us over -i noted her above. All in all,  I'm not sure what was going on w/ their service staff,  I really feel they just didn't want to be there and secondly,  they have been inadequately trained in providing excellent customer service.\nRude, impolite, unwelcoming and not knowledgeable about entertainment provided there. Definately not a place we will return to-that includes the resort.   We did not stay for the originally much anticipated flamenco entertainment which ended up being inside and not outside like were told-we felt too unwelcomed."
0,"I stayed here for a conference. My diamond stud earrings went missing from the time my husband checked out to the time the room was cleaned. (He had seen them and forgot to grab them.) Estimated time of two hours in which the earrings were left unattended.\nHe texted me when I was in the conference when he remembered seeing the earrings and notified security. The security person was cooperative and searched to no avail.\nI sat in the lobby for the Phoenix police. I asked for a comment card. I was told a survey would be emailed to me.  No one from management met me. I am told that the employees are longstanding and have a lot to lose meaning their job if they stole the earrings. I asked if they polygraph employees. It is the police's decision apparently.\nMy biggest disappointment is that no one from the staff reached out. At least four employees knew of my situation, did not say my name or offer a sentence stating they were sorry about the situation. It was though I was the problem although I had not accused anyone of anything. I have to file a report for insurance. \nOne star goes to the security officer. He was professional, sensitive and empathetic to my situation."
0,"This resort is beautiful. The grounds, pool, fitness center, and other amenities are amazing. If you are from snowy Chicago, Wisconsin, Minnesota and you want to getaway to beautiful Scottsdale AZ and enjoy serenity and comfort, you should consider Royal Palms Resort and Spa. Unfortunately, I had a bad experience at TJ Cooks restaurant for lunch. I ordered the flat iron steak and eggs. Except for the hash browns, the rest of the dish was INEDIBLE. I could have eaten a better meal at Denny's for a fourth of the price. I also ordered the Panini, a dessert combo of peanut butter, chocolate and bananas sandwiched inside a panini bread. This was also disappointing. My wife ordered the eggs sardou. It was cold and had no flavor but the hash brown potatoes were great. I'm hoping they had a substitute cook that day and this isn't their normal standard of taste. Again, you shouldn't miss the Resort, but I had reservations about TJ Cooks."
0,"Guys. Seriously? This place is not living up to the hype. My husband and I went here for an overnight stay to celebrate the fact that it was our first time away from our kids, um ever in two years (no big deal) and it was a Father's Day gift. We had booked through hotels.com and relayed the importance of our visit in the reservation. I upgraded the room to a private casita and chose the option to pay at the time of the booking, as opposed to paying later. \nImagine my surprise when, upon check-in, I am confronted immediately with,\""we need a credit card for this reservation\"".  \""I thought I paid ahead, but ok....\""  The front desk attendant then informs us of the $30 resort fee and $15 overnight parking fee. Really? Y'all can't even spring for free parking for your patrons? At a so-called 4.5 star resort? Please. \nThe valet gave us a tour of the grounds and he was great. Informative, funny and honest. When we tipped him he made sure we knew that a tip was already included and wasn't necessary. We knew but he deserved the tip anyway, it was just nice of him to be honest.\n\nThe stay was nice, the room was fine and dinner was good-but for a $250 check for two people I was expecting more. But what was really great happened next. Once we got home a few days passed and I spoke to my mom. She said she was surprised she didn't hear from me for a big thank you. I asked why? Well it turned out my parents paid for our stay as a nice gesture since we never get out. Odd, I thought, considering the first thing the front desk attendant did was ask for a credit card when my parents sent their info in and wanted to pay for any other incidentals above and beyond the room. I called and talked to the front desk attendant and told her the deal. She didn't sympathize, she didn't apologize, she just transferred me to the accounting department to leave a message. The following day, Eric from accounting called me back. We figured out that my card wasn't charged but there was a $300 hold on my debit that would \""disappear in a week or so\"". Now, I don't have a lot of money, so for $300 to be tied up for a week was kind of a bummer. He keep repeating the same info about booking through hotels.com and how sometimes people who pay for rooms want to remain anonymous (I was asking why I wasn't told the room was paid for, why was I even asked to present a card when that part was handled?). He was droning on and I said, \""I don't care about that, what I care about is...\"" I couldn't finish my sentence because Eric from accounting interrupted me and said that if I didn't care what he was saying he couldn't help me any further. Then he HUNG UP ON ME! I mean come on! Where's the hospitality? I was furious. I wanted to be done with the shitty ordeal but my friend persuaded me to call again and let management know what happened. So I did. I told her that I didn't want anything from them, that I simply would never come back. She assured me that she would take this higher and have it corrected. With all the awesome deals in the valley during the summer why throw it away on this place? Spend your hard earned money some place else."
0,"Just read CP's review and I must add my ditto to the 1 star rating.  Of late, I have also been disappointed with the baked goods at La Grande.  Particularly the TC sweets.  After my last visit, where the coffee cake was dried out and what I thought to be \""old\"" and the 1/2 frozen cup cake, I said no more.  \nI didn't even try to return it, because I felt the superiority vibe of the place and figured they don't need me or my dollars.  The only item they offer that is unique is the english muffins.  Sorry not enough in my book to bother with."
0,"Like their competitor Sprinkles, Tammie Coe is just way to sweet for me. Their frosting is heavier and their is just something in their cupcakes that makes me wonder what is that? As much as my coworkers enjoy both Tammie Coe and Sprinkles, I pass everytime someone brings them in as I am just not a fan. For those that enjoy them, by all means I am not mad at ya. Just don't understand what all the fuss is about."
0,"In the world of cakes, there's somehow an unspoken rule that if it's pretty, it's okay to be subpar in taste and moistness. In my world, this does not compute. It needs to be as tasty as it is pretty. Period.\n\nSo I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake, but nothing more. Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it... that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so. If you like the taste of fondant... you've got to be kidding me--Yucky!\n\nSo take my review or leave it. I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second... less of course it's for a wedding, than it needs to be both EQUALLY. Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake? Not me. So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to me.\n\nNow, I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting. Frosting is secondary to me. So if you are more for frosting than for cake, ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine... no really, go ahead.\n\nIf there IS frosting--for me and others like me, a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting... then BRING IT ON! I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake, I won't make it a point to get an inside piece, or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cake.\n\nAnyway, Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me. If I have to partake in one of her treats, I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake.\n\nAs for MJ Bread, I have no complaints there... their breads really impressed. I can't remember which CenPho restaurant I had my first taste of MJ bread, but I remember being V E R Y impressed."
0,"Tammie Coe's work looks incredible. I wish I could review it based on flavor, but I cannot. Here's why: My mother-in-law, thrilled at expecting her first grandchild, ordered Tammie Coe cakes for my baby shower. When she went to pick them up...WHOOPS!! Tammie Coe forgot to make them. 30 guests, catered lunch, no desserts. She ended up giving us pre-made cakes out of her freezers, and we forgave...after all, mistakes happen, right? Even to very high-end bakers with huge followings and even huger price tags....right? Fast forward a few years to my sister's bridal shower. Sister's having a destination wedding in Switzerland, in a castle in the Alps. Hostess throwing the shower wants to go along with the theme and have 30 individual Swedish \""Princess Cakes\"" for dessert, which happen to be a favorite of the bride. We search high and low all around Phoenix to find someone other than IKEA who makes these unusual cakes (IKEA's are frozen, and who's got freezer space for 30 cakes??). But guess who makes them to order? Tammie Coe!!! She even remembers us from the baby shower a few years prior, and has the good sense to redden in the face over that embarrassing memory. We all share a good laugh over silly mixups, place the order, and pay nearly $300 for it. Shower day comes, we go to pick them up, these delicious, bride-requested, dream-wedding themed 30 cakes, and....WHOOOOOPS!!!! Tammie Coe forgot to make them. AGAIN. Seriously???? Yes, seriously. At this point, either Tammie Coe has some weird passive aggressive objection to my family's happy occasions, or she just sucks and can't get her business together. Note to Tammie Coe: if you're going to make a habit of forgetting to make pricey, occasion-driven baked goods, DON'T DO IT TWICE TO THE SAME FAMILY. Or maybe this is just how she rolls, and forgetting to follow through with orders is a common theme? Either way, bad business model. Ta ta, Tammie Coe. Never, never, ever again."
0,"Went to pick up a bouquet for my sister in law. As I was getting my son out of the car, he runs for a corvette parked a few spots over (a seriously rad looking one too). The owner comes out screaming \""you can't park here\"" and tells us to leave. I suppose he thought we were headed to the bar next door. I was about to tell him we were there to buy flowers, but he was so rude we just left instead."
0,"I've been in this salon several times over the past couple of years.  If it weren't for a good friend stylist who worked there I'd never have given it a chance. But over all the staff members there and the manager for that matter are as rude,  pretentious and second rate as they come. My stylist is worth every penny but  the Salon is way pricey for it's local.  If it's the Aveda products your after (You have good taste) you''d be doing yourself a favor by driving the extra two miles  to Salon Tru or Scottsdale Fashion  Square."
0,"We used to go this restaurant over two years ago and usually 2 to 3 times per week.  The service at dinner time is bad, bad, bad.  Poor management and only one waiter or waitress.  We try to go back once or twice a year, hoping it gets better.  I enjoy the food and it is in the neighborhood.  I can understand why they don't pack them in anymore.  Seems like corporate would look at these reviews and make sure the service is brought up to par!  Won't be returning for at least 2 more years.  And that is probably only a MAYBE!!!!"
0,Where does one begin?  Sat ourselves at a booth.  Had to wait 15 minutes for someone to ask us if we would like something to drink.  Took for ever to order food.  Food came out individually over the course of 10 minutes....  The food order was wrong and it did not taste that great.\n\nHere are a few things that you will experience when you go if you decided to go at all.\n\nWait 5 to 10 minutes to be seated......\nWait 5 to 10 minutes to get drinks ordered......\nWait 5 to 10 minutes to get food ordered.....\nWait 5 to 10 minutes before you get all of you food to the table....\n\nNot worth the experience...  Not worth the money....   OverEasy is far far better!
0,I refuse to eat at a restaurant where you stole 98% of your menu from another restaurant and just changed the names!  Shame.\n\nWish I could give zero stars
0,"We went to lunch here for the first time after passing by it 100s of times, we went on a tuesday afternoon at 12:30, it was busy but not too crowded. \n\nThis place is NOT vegan friendly in the least, all of the sandwiches have some sort of dairy in them as do the soups. You can make your own sandwiches but I can make a sandwich with cold veggies or sauteed veggies with mustard at home. I would suggest offering grilled zucchini/eggplant with a sauce that is dairy free. \n\nAll of the sandwiches are placed in sacks with plastic utensils and styrofoam cups, even if you eat in. This is not eco friendly, my pasta with marinara (which I can make at home) came in a nice plastic to-go container. While I realize this is not a restaurant per say, it would be nice if they had real forks/knives and plates if you plan to eat in and get something more ecofriendly than styrofoam. \n\nI did ask if they recycled before we left, and was told that the kitchen does, which is great! However, there is not a recycling container in the restaurant for the sacks/utensils or pasta to-go packages. \n\nI will not be returning to this non vegan friendly, non planet friendly sandwich shop and would not recommend it."
0,Someone in class suggested this place and it was such a let down. A large group of us went and many people liked their sandwiches but my turkey cranberry w/ stuffing sandwich was awful. The stuffing looked like dog food and it tasted like cardboard and fennel. The cranberry sauce tasted like it came from a can and there was nothing special about the bread. The upside is we got our orders fairly quickly and the atmosphere was alright for a quick lunch spot.
0,Absolutely terrible experience.  Two thumbs down.\n\nI have only heard good things about how great this place is. HA!\n\nOur office ordered about 20 sandwiches from them.  The hot sandwiches were luke warm.  The chip order was not delivered. The drink order apparently was forgotten as well.  An $8 Ceasar salad that you would think would fill the container was so small it would fit in a small bowl.\n\nNot recommended.  We will never order from there again and we have 350 people in our office.
0,"As a veteran of the strip club scene and former dancer at Heartbreakers, now Bombshells, I'm sending out a big \""Shame on you!\"" to the management at Bombshells! We rented a party bus for my best friends bachelor party and were told Bombshells was one of the clubs on the V.I.P. list. I called the club to alert of our arrival time to make sure we could get in. The person I spoke to was quite rude over the phone, but said they make decisions regarding admittance on a case by case basis. I told him we were a large group, would buy drinks, and as a former dancer, all my friends are schooled to pay the dancers well! When we got there, we were met at the door and told we would have to pay full cover and that they wouldn't do anything special for our bachelor. Lucky for us, our driver got a tip to go the the Hi-Liter, which turned out the be the best ever!! So, again, shame on you Bombshells! And to the girls who missed out on lots of money that night... go work at a real club! Peace"
0,"Coffee is fine, foo foo coffees are fine, pastries are fine, teas are fine, ambiance is pretty good with wireless and a nice selection of books to choose from, even location is pretty good. The problem, and it is a persistent problem with these people, is the service is terrible. Indifferent counter help on their best days, downright surly on their bad days. It's to the point where we won't even go in there anymore. Such potential...... lost to a crabby attitude towards the customers. If you want to own or work in a coffee shop then be ready to screw a smile on your face and show some positive energy."
0,"In a way I'm not surprised because the people working there was snooty all too often and, MJ's business hours were erratic at best. Worse; I stopped by there a couple of times since their 'Open' sign was lit but the place was closed."
0,"I have been to practically every spa and salon in the valley searching for a great nail salon.  My friend worked at the Village as a camp counselor and he suggested I check their salon out.  I was sadly disappointed.\n\nWhen I originally called to make an appointment the receptionist was rather rushed and sounded inconvenienced by my call.  I am an understanding person so I didn't really think much of it.  My friend and I went in on the day of our appointment and were still asked to wait for about 20 minutes because the nail tech hadn't come back.  Again, I am not really impatient or unreasonable so it didn't really bothered me.\n\nThe thing that pushed me over the edge was the nail tech.  My friend was getting a pricier manicure and the tech was very personable and friendly to her.  Because I had gotten my nails done only a week earlier I asked for an express manicure instead.  She rushed through and was extremely rude to me.  I definitely walked out with a bad taste in my mouth about the whole experience and was not happy when I still was paying a relatively high price for my manicure.\n\nMaybe I caught everyone on a bad day but I would suggest looking somewhere else unless you absolutely have to get your nails done um, at a health club?"
0,"this place is unbelievable.  i have been a member for 5-6 years; i was out of the country and thought my membership was on a 6 month hold; the emptied my locker and instead of trying to contact me or send my items to my US address THEY THREW EVERYTHING AWAY!!!!\n\ni lost $1,200 worth of things and the GM of the Camelback office offers me a waived re-instate fee that is $300 and NOTHING else even though I was on a 6 month freeze.\n\nthey threw my things out 4 weeks ago, i went in to find these facts out over 3 weeks ago, i waited patiently to hear from them, never did, so I called today and the guy who threw my things away said he was waiting to talk to the GM.  I told him it had been 3 weeks and you STILL haven't talked to the GM?!?!?!?!  he said no.  \n\navoid this place like the plague.  you can find as nice/nicer gyms at 1/10th the price."
0,I've had a pretty good experience at this club all the way up until about 2 months ago. I'm usually a visitor who pays for a day pass... I was interested in joining until Laura Gilbert (sales person) decided to send me an email black mailing me telling me that if I didn't join I couldn't pay for a daily pass... Making up some bull about policy that if I'm not with a member that I couldn't purchase a daily pass when clearly the policy is you pay $30 without a member and $20 if you come in with a member. It's a sad tactic from said sales rep.  I hope this gets back to her so she learns what customer service is and can't treat people like this.\n-RJ Morales
0,Enough is enough. We had our third appointment for our pup at 3pm on sat which was originally arranged on fri. They asked us if we can change the date. It was not a big deal until they stood us up. We were at the doorstep for 15 mins. Nobody was there. No phone call or a notice to inform us. And we were not the only client waiting outside. It was not cool outside in June. Bad business!!
0,"I took my cat for a nail trim and I showed her the best way to hold her.  The nurse while holding her told me off saying that if there were dogs there that would not be safe for the staff.  There were no pets there but with her holding my cat I said nothing.  She took my cat back to the room and I heard her meowing sort of normal but then I heard her screaming which is very unusual for her so I ran back there and saw one tech on the phone and the nurse with a towel over my cat.  My cat did not know I was there but the nurse said that I was upsetting my cat.  Again, I said nothing because my cat was in her care.  Dr. Cruz came was behind me and intervened so I felt more comfortable.  One male asst came back and told me that it was normal for a cat to act that way.  Then Dr. Cruz came and told me about cats meowing when they get a nail trim.  I have had my cat's nails trimmed for years and I know her normal meow but not screaming plus I saw the jar of stuff they use when they cut nails too short.  What I think happened was they cut her nails way too short and hurt her thus her screaming meows.  I am so upset that I subjected my cat in this manner.  Never again will I go there!"
0,"La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it can't be all of them.\n\nI love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.\n\nI'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos."
0,"I or someone I have been with has gotten food poisoning 3 times from this grocery/pizzeria.  That's 3 separate occasions, I have stopped going here at all!"
0,"Really LGO?! I quit going to my neighborhood spot because of all the \""affliction wearing douche's\"" that have over run every area of my neighborhood. A friend invited yesterday for lunch,so we jammed on our cruisers..well, you know the parking and it was a beautiful day yesterday. I was so craving the tuna melt sandwich have been salivating about it for months..months I tell you. I order from a chipper little gal...I asked if I could have it open faced. She didn't think it would be a problem...wrong answer! The kitchen obviously has never made an open faced before..oh yes they have and use to get it right..guess the new peeps from down south didn't get the how to memo. \nThe 1st time it came out with two slices of bread with a square of slightly melted cheddar laying there flat with a huge dollop of cold tuna on top...Really?? I took it back..a different girl said what's wrong with that? Apparently everything you nit wit! So, they remade it, check my photo..this is what I got back..except I added the zig zag of color just so I could choke it down. The \""manager type\"" person actually handed this to me and said, \""your remake\"" Really? But I was so hungry and frustrated, I took it..not even any fruit..so for $7.50 I got a plate of tuna poop. 3 bites later, it hit the trash receptacle. Don't ever expect anyone there to step up to the plate and offer you a refund or a do over..cuz it just ain't happening right. I was here a couple of months ago, ordered potato leek soup, came out curdled and cold..an employee walking by my table said, \""wow that doesn't look right, gross\"" wouldn't take it off the bill and was like, \""glad I'm not eating it\"". And I'm glad I'm not eating here anymore and that Bertha's and Acacia Cafe have moved into the neighborhood. The people watching may not be the same, but the food is great, service outstanding and even better prices. What a shame!"
0,"I've been here so many times and I always get frustrated. The food and service have always been decent but the parking and food pickup situation are the worst in the valley. Its open parking out front then valet in back. Ive lived in Arcadia for years and have gotten a spot out front once. The valets are great but if you're just running in for 5 mins it adds another ten to get your car back. \nWhat frustrates me more than anything is there lobby/order pickup area. First they have crammed so many shelves full of rare peanut butters, custom greeting cards, children's educational toys, and hand made wine bottle holders that there is literally one small area for everyone to make an elementary school style line weaving through all this junk. Second, after ordering your $10 sandwich you are forced to wait in a crush of people all clamoring for their food. On more than one occasion my food has been taken by a hungry soccer mom or avid bicyclist in spandex. Then off to the cafeteria style seating to find a table. \nMy problem is if your spending over $10 for their food items then they should give you a number to take to your table so its delivered, not fight cougars in a game of life and death for your meal. \nI'm over it."
0,I don't know why I continue to go here and expect things to change. I've had the pizza here once and it was great. Breakfast however is entirely different.  They can't cook eggs !!!  Always runny and under cooked. The place is usually freezing cold and I think the music is played so loudly that it will take your mind off your cold food. Really disappointed as I live only a block away.  They might want to send some of there cooks to the Breakfast Club for a refresher course.
0,"Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with \""it's just how we do things\"" and \""there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little\"". The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner \""really doesn't care\"". Hubris is so unappetizing. I think the food is great but, because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele, I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere."
0,"I like the food okay but the service--geez, very rude girl at bakery counter!  If I hadn't wanted the AZ cookie so badly I would've just walked out.  There's better (and closer) bakeries than this one."
0,"My first LGA experience...won't be back unless someone begs me. Omelette was served cold, too busy to care what the plate looked like and no silverware clean. The place was packed. Why?"

0,"I don't mind spending $30 for Latte's & breakfast for 2 with no service, but it's pathetic I can't ever seem to get my food to arrive hot!  The problems? Many!  We went there again on Sunday morning, November 24th.  The girl taking our order didn't even know what a basted egg was, so I had to order over-medium eggs. La Grande thinks it's cool to have their music blasting so loud you can't communicate with another person.  The bigger problem- counter workers yell out your name when the order is ready, but you can't hear your name being called because the music is so loud.... then they let your hot food sit on a counter with no heat lamps making zero attempt to find the customer.  If La Grande is going to keep the current system in place, which does not work (cold food and too-loud music), they will need to install an intercom speaker which cuts off the music when a customer's order is ready for pickup, so customers can hear their name being called.  By the time I found our food it was completely cold.  (btw, the food is never more than warm here). Upon complaining, a young woman offered to place the eggs, bacon & English muffins in the oven lol.  I refused & asked them to prepare the meals again.  Even after remaking our order, the over-medium eggs had runny whites, the scrambled eggs luke-warm at best & the English muffins were barely toasted (as usual) and barely hot enough to make butter melt.  The latte was plenty acceptable.  I openly told the counter worker, I've been coming to La Grande for many years, but have mostly stopped the past two years because the music is always ridiculously loud and the food is always cold. I expressed my disappointment in spending $30 for breakfast (which I have to pick up at a counter) and never being able to get a hot plate of food. Cold eggs, cold English muffins...YUKK!  I frequent their other restaurant Chelsea's, which does not appear to have any of these problems.  Additionally, what has happened to the \""Grocery Store\"" Part of La Grande Orange Grocery???? Most of the cool metal racks of gourmet food items have been replaced with garbage trinkets such as candles and t-shirts!!!  On top of that, the pastry case has gone way down hill since the exit of Tammy Coe's baked goods.  On this trip in, we wanted something from the pastry case, but saw nothing that even looked appealing, so we purchased nothing from the case!!!  The display tables offering merchandise are far too close to the ordering and food pick-up areas, creating an environment where the customers can barely move past each other within the establishment.  Recommendation- delete 20% of the trinket selling tables in favor of respecting your customers need to walk through the place!  This place has some problems that have been going on a very long time (cold food and too-loud music top the list of issues), plus many new problems.  The owner needs to revisit the concept of \""Restaurants 101\"".... Hot food and doing things which make sense,,,, and remember- just because profits are likely big RIGHT NOW does not mean you don't have problems!"
0,"One star for now. Why? Because, they just can't seem to get my drink right. I don't understand what's so hard about getting me a cup of nut mylk with ONE shot of espresso on top, layered. The excuses, \""our machine makes two espressos at a time.\"" That's nice dear, here is an idea, just put half of that? I mean it's incredible that the last EIGHT time I went there, they can't seem to get it right. Yesterday, she almost got it right, she put just half the espresso shot but then she mixed the whole drink and I told her that's not what I wanted and I wanted it layered and she said, \""what do you mean?\"" If that was a question, why didn't you ask me when I ordered. Didn't even offer to remake it and she just walked away. I'm sorry but for $6 a drink, get it right LGO."
0,"The  petco near me was out of my boys favorite off the rawhide bar so, I called this store and asked if they had a rawhide bar. Yes we do--  Hoped in the car to make the six mile drive\n\nExcuse me?  Where is your rawhide bar?  Oh I'm sorry we font have that anymore.  There are a few on the endcap over there.\n\nReally?  Excuse me, do you have a water bowl where my dog can get a drink?  Yes, in the back of the store by the restrooms.  Uh, theres no bowl back there.  Well, maybe thats because the water fountain is broke.  I will tell the mgr tomorrow. How does that help me now?\n\nHow much  did those rawhides weigh?  .93lbs.  Over on the other scale, it was less than .75.  Let me weigh it again--oops now its .95.

0,"You'd think with its proximity to the chi-chi yuppieville that is Arcadia, this Target would be... well... not so ghetto. This one is actually worse than the one at Christown (oh, excuse me, \""Spectrum\"") Mall, and that's saying something. We'll be saving this location for emergencies only."
0,"In our house this store is known as \""Ghetto Target\"". My wife and I feel subservient to this store for geographic purposes. We have come to know and, ultimately, endure our frequent shopping trips with continually lowered expectations of anything positive coming our way. The checkout staff is, to a person, rude, unprofessional and often seem just really, really dumb. \n\nMy favorite story from Ghetto Target is a few months ago when I purchased some laundry detergent, paper towels and a birthday card. Upon my exit , a security guard followed me out of the store and asked to see my receipt for the purchase. Surprised, I replied kindly, \""no you can't but thanks for asking\"". I kept walking to my car as the security guard \""ordered\"" me to stop, threatening to call police. I calmly told him I was okay with his plan to call the cops, got in my car and drove away with him standing in my rear view mirror, looking like a complete idiot. \n\nOf course, it's Target, so I still go back. Often. Maybe I'll  get a t-shirt that reads \""I survived Ghetto Target\""."
0,Office Max Sucks-7th ave+Camelback rd.. They now have a Ink Toner machine behind the counter to compete with Cartridge World so you can refill your printer ink for less then what hp wants (which is too much). Don't ever use this service. 3 x I have been in there to replace the cartridge after printing maybe 6-7 copies. Called the Manager (Shane) he said they never have any issues with the machine (maybe about 5% come back). He said I must be one of these 5%. Plus 1/2 the time you go in there it seems like nobody works there. It's worst then Home Depot where they scramble like cock roaches when they see a customer walking down the isle.\nHead my advice and use Cartridge World if your looking for toner refills.
0,"I walked into this nail salon hoping for a quick and decent manicure pedicure.  My nail technician, Cathy, was very sweet--however she rushed through everything.  She squirted cuticle remover all over my dress, slobbed it onto my hands and feet and never completely rinsed it off.  She didn't even bother with a top coat on my pedicure.\n\nHer tools were kept all jumbled together in a dirty plastic container--not once did I see her put anything into a disinfectant.  The woman next to me finished with her pedicure and they simply drained the bowl --nobody scrubbed it, or even rinsed it. \n\nI also thought they had a poor color selection at this place.  All outdated OPI shades.\n\nI wouldn't come here again."
0,"If I could give this place negative stars, I would.  \n\nThis place sucked.  All-around.  The only positive note I have is they had the most recent US Weekly.  Let me start from the beginning...\n\nI went here b/c I was driving home from work and decided that it had been at least 5 days since my last pedicure, my co-workers were extra bitchy today and I deserved 25 minutes of pampering.  So I stopped when I saw the first nail salon.  This strategy works 9/10, so don't fault me for that, trust me, it works.\n\nI walk in and they get me in right away.  I pick my color and sit down.  No massaging chair, no magazines (I had to ask for one) and nowhere to put my purse.  Whatever.  So, the girl comes along and does my pedicure...it's fine, not great, but not awful.  I was rather annoyed that she didn't even dry off my legs and just slapped on some cream.  Cream + watery legs = awkwardness in my opinion.\n\nSo, I'm heavily involved in reading my updates on The Jersey Shore and Brangelina when I happen to glance down and she's painting a white flower on my toes.  What?  No.  No, no no.  I do not want a flower.  So I made her take it off and re-paint my big toes.  Who does that?  You ask before you put something so painfully feminine on my feet.  Seriously.\n\nNow, this is where things take a turn for the worse.  I go to pay.  And let me tell you, I haven't paid more than $30 for a pedicure in this town...EVER.  So, they tell me it's going to be $45.  WHAT?  Was that OPI nailpolish made of gold?  Did I just blackout?  Whatever, I move on...nothing I can do now. I hand her my credit card.  She says \""no credit card, use ATM in the corner.\""  Uh, what?  So I realize they don't take credit cards or checks.  I have to go withdrawl cash from their mother f^$*^%& ATM machine in the corner that charges me $5 (on top of whatever my bank will charge me) so I can pay for my terrible pedicure.  \n\nThis place stinks...there's way too  much competition out there to charge and treat customers like this...DO NOT GO HERE.  Drive down 50 more feet for another salon."
0,"I went here on a Sunday afternoon at 1 PM to get a mani pedi before a trip.  I was promptly seated in a chair and then forgotten about for 30 minutes.  I am all about letting my feet soak but 30 minutes?  I was a prune by the time my nail tech got to me.  There were around 8 nail techs in the salon but they were all focused on 2 ladies and their 6 kids to wait on anyone else.  When my tech finally got to me, my pedicure lasted 15 minutes from start to final polish.  My tech didn't realize I wanted a manicure as well and took off to the next client.  I had to flag him back down and got a 5 min manicure.  He did do a great job on my buff but my cuticles were ragged and it was very haphazard.  They also only accept cash but have an ATM in the store incase all you have is a debit card.\n\nThe place was clean and had a lot of polish choices but definitely lacked on customer service.  If you are busy, take down my name and I will happily come back in an hour when you aren't as busy, don't let me sit with my feet in a bath for a half hour while you do polish changes on 5 yr olds."
0,"The most horrible pedi ever and it cost me $45 because I sat in the\"" special massage chair\"" wtf why didn't they inform me when I sat it their f^*&% special piece of crap chair. The pedei lasted 15 minutes and it looked horrible......very sloppy looking. I had my nails done there a couple of years ago and they were yellow! I should have known better but I was right by there so I went. My suggestion is to never step foot in this rat hole of a\"" business\"" the people and service suck. I give it negative 5 stars. Go to andys down the street, I've been going for years and they aren't expensive."
0,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry I am allergic to latex. This is what I had to keep on telling the nail tech when she was doing my feet. Walked in for a nice pedicure and I should have walked right out when I saw the look on her face when I told her I was allergic to latex.  But she said it's ok, it's  ok sit down, sit down.  I know there are other types of gloves..vinyl or non latex they need to buy at least one box because I know I'm not the only one who is allergic. Anyway..I was in and out in about 20 min. It was awful, 10 min soaking 10 for the pedicure. It was obvious she didnt want to touch my toes, which aren't that bad, without gloves. I wish she would have said no when I came in the door. Oh they don't take any cards just cash. Will not go back here even if it was free!"
0,"I was feeling eager for a gel manicure since I had just taken off my false acrylic nails.\nThey looked awful. \n\nIt was Saturday and felt the need to relax so I decided on a pedicure as well.\nI chose this place since it is close to my boyfriends house. \n\nI walked in and was greeted right away.\nFor a weekend, it was not packed at all.

0,"What is the first thing you think about when you get ready to get your Mani and Pedi? RELAXATION!!! Unfortunately, my experience was everything BUT that! I understand when you are tired at work, or even having a bad day, but your customers are NEVER suppose to feel unwanted. Soon my best friend and I walked in the door the atmosphere was not very good. It seemed to be tension. The lady who did my Pedi was TERRIBLE! She will NEVER get a tip from me nor EVER do my feet again. I wanted to take my feet out the water and leave, but I really needed my Pedi. She completely ignored how I asked for my feet to be done. My polish looks like I done it myself instead of going to get it professionally done! It was such a rush job! I'm not even going to get started on my Mani!!! GRRR! I'm so livid, even writing this review. I will never go back! They don't even deserve the 1 star that I just gave them. Just HORRIBLE! SMH!!!!!"
0,"Visiting Postino Wine Cafe makes me feel like I am in another city... an urban, metro, pedestrian city such as San Francisco. Its casual, yet sophisticated and quite enjoyable. I recently visited Postino with two friends and had the Bruschetta -- we selected the Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil, the Smoked Salmon and the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Thumbs up on all of these yummy appetizers! The clientele is a hip, diverse crowd reflective of its gentrified, charming neighborhood of mid-century ranch homes, and yet just a hop from the Biltmore and Arcadia neighborhoods. Ah... Phoenix is growing up! Wish I knew more about wines to tell you more about that. It appeared to be a nice selection and there were bottles you can buy to take home as well. Parking is a challenge, however I will definitely be back.\nhttp://www.postinowinecafe.com/\n\nUpdate: Postino's is one of many restaurants/bars in AZ that permits concealed weapons without permits and is noted on the Arizona State Rifle and Pistol Association in their CCW Cafe page: http://www.asrpa.com/ccwcafe.html For that reason I am reducing the previously 5-star rating to 1-star."
0,"I won't even venture to guess why so many people like this place. But a few notes: no, it is nothing like a European cafe; no, it is not an actual wine bar; yes the service absolutely sucks.\n\nWe came here for a friend's birthday party. Her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor. But before that, let's start with parking. \n\nYou can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit. Fine. I heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so, whatever. I head to the valet who asks me if I am dining at Postino's or La Grande Orange. I say Postino's and he says \""Ok, that's $3.\"" I asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant I was going to and they wouldn't answer. I asked if there was an ATM since I had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work. I got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes. Fantastic.\n\nWhen I get there, about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them. Finally, a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said \""Those are yours. Those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet. We told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there.\"" Ok, so now we only have two of our four tables. Great. Finally they seat us at our two tables. Another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo. She pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away. Upon her return I asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a Malbec. She argued with me about that for a few minutes until I pointed to the label. She said \""Oh\"" and walked away. I never did find out if we were supposed to have the Malbec.\n\nAt this point, the other two tables had been cleared. No one brought any other glasses or put the tables together, so we did it. Also, no one opened the other bottles, and yes they were screwtop, but still. So I opened them. Finally, everyone else arrived. We still only had 4 wine glasses. After trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded, rudely \""We don't have any more.\"" and walked away. I had to ask three different rude, uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still, not everyone ended up with a glass. \n\nSeriously? Anyway, the bruschetta came out. While the menu offers a lof of different ones, they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished. The fig, marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced. Dry, flavorless. Most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart. The bread was obviously just grocery store bread and I doubt anything is truly hand-made. The issue is, the quality of their ingredients sucks. They obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up. Everything, even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy. \n\nAnd as for a wine bar? Seriously. A joke. They have a half of a sheet of paper, one side, as their wine list. No flights, no tastings. But for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area, they'll continue to do just fine. I will never be back."
0,"I try to like you Postinos, I really do but you make it so hard.  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyed.\n\nThe parking lot disaster strikes again!  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces.  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spaces.\n\nOnce seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders.  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just \""you ready to order?\""\n\nWe ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.\n\nThe wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.\n\nYet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage.  I don't understand how I am the only one who keeps having horrible experiences here?"
0,"I totally 100% agree w Serianna T.\n\nI have felt the same way about the seating, and parking and mediocre foods... Postino and LGO are complete cluster F***s for anyone who plans on driving there. I also feel like the general atmosphere is trying so hard to be relaxed and casual that it is stressful for the guests."
0,Went yesterday for the first time. It gets one star because the food was yummy. Got the choose two- Nine Iron sandwich with Mediterranean salad. Very good. Lost a star because parking is horrible despite the free but really not free valet parking. Lost a star because I do not like eating up. Meaning the table was so low you have a lot of distance to the mouth and more opportunity to spill. Lost a star because I don't like eating in my living room. Why are restaurants now making their dining room a living room? If you want to do the sofa and chair thing do it outside. Not fond of high tops either. Lost a star because they opened the garage door. We chose to sit inside for a reason. They opened it and all of a sudden it was 60 degrees.
0,"Be warned gluten.... Went for happy hour expecting to have GF food. Postinos said they could do gluten-free before we were seated.\nCome to find out they could only do olives truly gf once they found out it was a true allergy. \nWe were told by several different people that many items were gluten free; such as the sandwiches, but upon further questions about the meats, cheeses, etcetera being GF, they took back their reassurances. Close call to being poisoned!"
0,"I scheduled a surgery for my dog to have some cysts removed. I was very worried as she is up there in age...to the point where I had to take work off. We arrived at the facility ahead of our appointment time. Nobody greated us or signed us in for over a half hour. Finally, once someone was at the desk, they said they have been trying to call me to reschedule as the vet in that day was a sub and not capable of performing the surgery. My phone was in my purse on silent as to be polite. I had called everyday that week prior basically to comfort my nerves and to find out what I should expect. Brittany is who I spoke with every time. She was nice but could provide no information. She said she would have the vet call me to answer my questions which never happened. I had no idea about cost. Will my pet be able to come home with me that day? Do you need bloodwork, etc? She said I would find all that out that day of the surgery. Unacceptable! Finally I get in with the vet. What a piece of work!!! She would not even touch my dog. Said her skin is disgusting and she smells. What vet in the world speaks about a pet as if it were an object? And to not even touch my dog??? Unreal!!! I will not be returning to ANY Banfield...EVER!!! Very sad considering I have been a customer for 10+ years. Guess your faculity is only good for vaccines. ABSOLUTELY nothing major. Oh and one last thing: the vet actually told me my dog would die on the table due to her heart murmur. I have since been to a REAL vet who confirmed this is not even true."
0,"I took my cat  to this hospital because he developed sudden symptoms that required that I see a Vet ASAP! The Vet determined that he was constipated after a pricey X-ray and told me to give him Miralax. The next day found my cat not eating and still not using the litter box. I went to the same Vet and she gave my cat an enema and sent me home with two pages of reading on Megacolon. By this time I had spent around five hundred dollars. This Vet was going to Canada for the holidays and told me if I had any more problems with my cat that one of the other Vet's would see him. She also wanted me to make a future appointment to discuss keeping my cat on laxatives for the rest of his life.  My cat was getting progressively sicker so I called on the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and see another Vet and was told that there was nothing else they could do for my cat and to take him to an emergency pet hospital.  Really, I had spent a lot of money for nothing.\n\nI found a Cat clinic in Scottsdale that saw my cat that day. The Vet could tell on examination that my cat had an anal sac infection without the X-rays because Banfield would not send them to her. My Vet took care of the problem and sent me home with some medication and two weeks later you would not know that my cat had been sick! \n\nI will never go to a Banfield Pet Hospital again! The Vet never even called to see how my cat was doing!  A very expensive lesson to learn!"
0,"This is by far the worst frys I have ever been in. I am a pretty dedicated frys shopper, however, this frys is gross and dirty. The checkout lines are always out of control long and getting through the parking lot without getting hit by a car or cart rolling by, is a miracle. Though it is my \""home\"" frys I will drive 4 miles out of my way to go to a different one."
0,"There's always parents @ this Frys, who make  their kids scream &cry. I shop here, ONLY cuz it's close & cheap.

Monday, I got a call from some1 in a Colorado area code, who claimed to be a \""doctor-in-association-w/Frys\"". He said I was positive for marijuana--I told him, yeah, I'm disabled & have a (legal) medical marijuana prescription for my Epilepsy in AZ. The Colorado-\""doctor\"" told me, I might not get hired by Frys, cuz they don't hire people w/this medical prescription!!  On Tuesday I still had No call back from Frys (eventho I was supposed to have worked Sun & Mon). I went to Frys & asked Holly, \""Oh, I don't have a job? Why didn't u call me?\"".  Holly, kept saying that I didn't pass some form of screening test.  How come this hiring manager said I WAS HIRED?!"
0,Overcrowded market. Nothing worth a crap. Overpriced with no real selection. \nDirty as well.
0,This place is a huge dissapoinment. You look at the menu and you get excited thinking. Oh this is going to be good!!!  Then the food comes and is wrong. Very wrong. \n\nThe rice is wet and salty. Too much cilantro all over the place. This is not Mexican is Cuban. Yes we use cilantro on our food but not to that level. \n\nRice should not be soup.  Bad cooking period.
0,"So this is heartbreaking.  I've been going to Havana cafe for years and over looked a lot as far as decor and service, but once the food goes... So do I.  A friend who used to live here, who was visiting, suggested Havana cafe for dinner since it was always great.  Our food was not good.  It was ok at BEST and our service was lack luster- snotty really.  Then they cleared our plates before we were done and started to vacuum while we were still eating. If we were the only people keeping them there late, which it was NOT LATE AT ALL (and we weren't the only patrons there)  I could understand, but overall the service was poor right out the gate and our food wasn't great, So we will not be going back, which breaks my heart. Since I've had many good experiences in the past. I always knew I was paying more, but I figured it was worth it, but I don't think $400 for 5 people was worth that kind of poor service.  ESPECIALLY since SO many places are closing up these days."
0,"Yelp alerted me that I have a review to complete, from nearly 2 years ago. \n\nI remember how I felt about this place back then, and still feel strongly about this place now. Recollections of how much I would not like to return to this place again. \n\nFind a place that serves Cuban-inspired food, or if there is a frozen aisle that does, heat it up in a microwave, transfer it onto a plate, and voila! Of course you'll remember to remove that non-microwaveable plastic film that Havana overlooked."
0,"I love cuban food!  And so I take every chance to eat it, so when I saw a cuban very close to our hotel in Scottsdale, I was there!  Unfortunately, the minute I walked in, I should have turned around and walked right back out again.  There was a distinct smell that wasn't clean and wasn't pleasant.  But my interest in  a good cuban meal got the better of me.  Big mistake.\n\nThe food was definitely sub-par.  I had the sampler, which included pollo cubano, ropa vieja, and masas de puerco.  Unfortunately, none of the dishes was particularly flavorful, and none were good renditions of the dish.  The pollo was bland other than an overly acidic sauce, the ropa vieja was just lacking in flavor and the vegetables and broth hadn't been blended together, and the masas weren't crispy in the least.  The whole meal was a huge let down."
0,"Havana Cafe refused my business today when I walked into their establishment wearing a trendy bluish, turquoise singlet. Apparently, this wannabe 4-star \""cafe\"", that resides in a plaza for God's sakes has a clothing rule that says men have to wear sleeves, but women do not. I challenged, Keith, the waiter/proprietor, that my date was also wearing a similar sleeveless top and he proceeded to tell me that men are not allowed to wear sleeveless tops, and that if I were to eat there I would have to wear one of his awful red Hawaiian print polos with bamboo images on it that was two sizes too big! WTF?! So you'd rather offend me and require me to wear some crap Hawaiian shirt that I'm swimming in?! Mind you, it's 113 degrees out! In what world is this more \""appropriate attire\"" than my tank and not outright sexual discrimination? For those of you who think this is a joke, it ACTUALLY HAPPENED!"
0,"\""My wife and I ate there a few weeks back, I thought the atmosphere was quaint and inviting however after we were sat it took quite some time before our waiter came back to us for anything. I found him to be unwelcoming and inattentive the 2 Hispanic helpers were much more courteous and attentive. The food was Ok  it wasn't horrible but i would not write home about it. It was my fist time there and maybe it was an off night but i would be reluctant to recommend the place to a friend or return simply because the service was horrible. I do how however like ambiance."
0,"I was raised in Miami with a Cuban mother so I think I have enough grounds to say that if you are looking for good Cuban food...this is not the place.  The food was tasteless, not authentic and way over priced. 3 croquetas (tiny ones and def not Cuabn) were $5.50  Dinner was $63 for my wife and I. we left hungry and dissapointed. :("
0,"Ah, the dreaded worst-experience of my life, horrible service, overcharged BIRTHDAY meal...that ended up in moderate-severe food poisoning.\n\nI'm talking the kind of food poisoning where at one point I desecrated the restrooms of a lovely restaurant in downtown Phoenix and ended up laying face down on the sidewalk...to where a homeless man asked me if I was ok.\n\nYeah.  It was that bad.  Food poisoning aside, it was STILL the worst meal of my life, and this WAS my favorite low-key restaurant in the valley.\n\nApparently my birthday fell on the last day of a groupon or livingsocial redemption.  Unlucky us, we paid full price (more than actually...since we were charged for the wrong items they brought out and subsequently took back), and were treated worse somehow than the coupon folks -- because it was a set menu and so the kitchen didn't want to make things not on THAT menu -- despite our paying full freaking price.\n\nFACT: When one is celebrating their birthday, they want a cocktail.  I wanted a cocktail.  Actually, I wanted three.  I got my first cocktail after I'd been there nearly an hour (oh yeah, the \""10 minute\"" wait I was told about was actually 40).  I didn't get a refill.  Or asked if I wanted a refill. Of that drink, or my water.  But I asked!  Oh, did I ask!   I drank my water and my dining companions.  And then eventually drank the melted ice from my un-refilled mojito. The 2 employees (great staffing job on a day you know will be busy with coupon redeemers!) were basically losing their minds, running around, and super stressed.  They had basically given up by the time we were eating. \n\nThat is why I feel like the food poisoning occurred from something truly awful. Like employees deliberately fucking with my food horrible.\n\nI'm not sure what they normally do when people have their birthday at a restaurant, but we weren't offered dessert menus, let alone a comped dessert.  They knew it was my birthday.  They knew at the beginning we were paying the full price.  And still...worst.service.ever.\n\n***I actually filled out a comment card back in November listing my email address and phone number, where I specifically requested to be contacted (again, this was before the food poisoning).  This review was written right after the visit, and I sort of \""sat\"" on it for literally over 6 months, in hopes someone would actually contact me.  I gave them the chance, I guess they really just don't give a shit."
0,"My wife and I went to Havana Caf\u00e9 on our 1st date.  Needless to say we love the place and it means something special to us.  We have been there many times.  The past 3 visits have gone downhill quickly.\n\n3 visits ago, the Paella was mediocre at best.  2 visits ago, the service was poor.  This last trip the service was horrid.  The food was good.   However we waited 20 minutes for our check.  There were 6 of us and they added an automatic 20% gratuity.  I understand that is the policy of most places.  But when the service is plain and simply bad that is just not ok.  To top it off, at 6pm on a Saturday evening, it wasn't just warm in the restaurant, it was flat out HOT.  I was sweating for the 2nd half of our dinner and throughout the time we waited to get our check.  The service and temperature made for a very bad experience.  \n\nI am very sad to say that we will not be back to Havana caf\u00e9."
0,"I have eaten here many times, the menu has changed, food is OK.  $1.95 for sour cream, REALLY???  Enough said!  I will not be back."
0,"This food was Horrible, very bland and dry I had the San Juan Combination. The Rice was dry no season or anthing. Puerto Rican Tamal was hard and dry it should have been moist and flavoral. Plantains was stiff as a rock and again no flavor. Mashed garlics plantains no flavor. My husband had Arroz con pollo the chicken was dry crispy and no flavor. Just save your money. This food had no Pizzazz or party in my mouth. The name sounds cool of the restaurant, but unfortunately so small and scrunched up. I would never recommend my friends or family at this place not even for appetizers and drinks."
0,"We went with a group of friends, and were very disappointed, I have been there before and I strongly recommended place, however food was terrible and overprice, I don't what had happened, service was poor, waited long for waitress to take order, or even take the drinks order, when she finally took order for food it took more than one hour wait for food to come  one at a time, 20% was added to bill, and this was not OK specially after poor service. Anyway will definitely won't EVER go back...."
0,"What a disappointment! I had been wanting to come here for months. The service was embarrassingly bad. Despite the empty tables, there were 3 different groups waiting at least 15\nminutes to be seated. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be looking around for their waiter/waitress and looking generally displeased. We requested one of the several tables outside and were told by the surly hostess that we couldn't...because the tables were dirty (and she didn't want to clean them, presumably?). Our drink order was taken and then a clueless waiter came back to re-take it. When he returned, he'd already forgotten my drink order and had to go back the bar to make it. We then saw two of the servers get into an argument in front of us. \n\nEvery table is supposed to get bread and we asked several people for ours when after 30 minutes, we still didn't have it. One waitress even told us, \""I'm sure it's baking right now.\"" No offer to check on it, no apologies, nothing. 30 minutes and 2 cocktails later, we looked at the group of disgruntled patrons and decided we would rather take our business elsewhere."
0,"Stopped in for a Bloody Mary on Sunday because Hazelwood's and Zipps were jam-packed.

0,"OMG!!  So this place is under new owners and this place SUCKS now!!  Ever since the new owners bought it this place has gone to HELL!  The food is frozen and not freshly cooked like it used to be.\n\nWe used to go here for $2 breakfast every Sat and Sun morning.  Our favorite bartender Tim is gone and our favorite cook is gone and our favorite waitress is gone and this place just sucks egg shells now!!\n\nThe owner thinks he can cook, so what does he do??? He puts the cook out on the floor to be a server!! WTH?!?  So bad for business.\n\nTruly wish the previous owners would come back."
0,"I would absolutely love to tell you that I discovered a gem on Thomas Road. I would love to be able to write how magnificent this place was but alas, I can't. I never got to taste anything. I never got to order anything. I walked into this dirt hole, holding my breath and tongue, and willing to order something in the hope that I could find some good Mexican food (good Mexican food is actually an oxymoron), anyway, I stood where it said \""order here.\"" I stood, and stood, I looked around, it appeared there was still business being conducted. A couple were eating in a booth. Hmmm....I stood. Waiting. No one came out from the back to acknowledge me, or take my order.\n\nNow this isn't Pizzeria Bianco where if you ignore me I will wait. If you spit on me I will wipe it off and take the abuse to be able to experience the pizza. No, this is a dirty, disgusting Mexican dump situated a few feet across from an hourly motel and down the street from a strip club. This place should be lucky anyone has walked in and kiss my feet. Well, I gave up, I started to walk out and just as I was heading to the door, some \""person\"" walked out from the back. I left.\n\nIf the service is that bad, I can't believe the food is going to sway me otherwise. In fact, I feel like I was saved from a case of botulism or diphtheria."
0,"Food is eh. Service is TERRIBLE! They are rude and don't care about customers. Asked if they had more carrots because they were out in the front the lady went in the back and came out 15 minutes later because another employee told her I was there. I asked again about the carrots and she just said \""we don't have any\"" she didn't even look!! Thanks for telling me and wasting my time! The armados a few blocks down is so much better!! I don't know how this place stays open for business."
0,"On 4/21/14 at around 7:43PM i tried to order two 99 cent burritos and add cheese. The cashier rung up the charge to a total of $7.  :(   The cashier is a moron who can't add math.    I informed him that it is Monday and on Monday there is 99 cent special for bean burritos.   He told me no, we no longer offer that.  Then i said\"" Just for today or for now on?   He said\"" Yes, no longer offer that for now on\"".    I looked at the table nearby and the 99 cent special is still on the coupon.    I walked out before i could start cussing him out.\n\n Description of cashier: Hispanic man Wearing a apron, hat and reading glasses hanging from his neck. No name tag on his shirt.\n\n  Very bad customer service..  This same Cashier 4 weeks ago overcharged me by $3. i asked for the correct change and he gave me $2 more back.  I was so pissed at this point i just left. \n\n\n I'm calling the manager of this restaurant to complain about this man. The manager should tell the man to change his ways or get fired.  Simple as that.\n\n As long as that cashier is still working at this restaurant i will not buy anything from them."
0,"Im very confused about all these good reviews.\n\nLast night my girlfriend brought me to Jt's, her boss said the wings were great. So I figured I'll try it.\nWhen we get there, the lot is filled, I figured this is a good sign. But that where the optimism ended.\nWe had to sit near the back, the smell and temperature were almost unbearable, but I figured I wanted to try the food. My girlfriend ordered wings, she wanted ranch, I only eat wings with Blue Cheese, then I get a burger and onion rings... And a coke. \n\nAfter a long wait, the server brought us our drinks, in a red solo cup, and my coke was not coke, but RC Cola... So far, its not going well. \nThe waitress comes back a little later to let us know, there's no more onion rings.\n\nAfter a long wait, we finally get the wings, as she sets them down, thats when she lets me know there's no more blue cheese. If I was by myself, I would have left at that point, I was also hungry. \n\nMy burger came, it was one of those pre made paddies you get at cosco, I lifted the bun and the whole patty fell apart. The cheese was some sort of burned shredded cheese. \n\nI counted the 'fries' I received with he burger, I counted 12 small pathetic fries. \n\nThese wings everyone talks about were burnt and dry, this confuses me the most. \nI mentioned to my girlfriend that I don't think her boss likes her, people must send patrons there when they dislike them. \n\nWith all the places in the valley to get really good wings, good service and other good dishes, I put this mystery of why people rave about this place up there with the mystery of the pyramids... \n\nUgh, I still cant get the image of that sorry burger out of my mind!"
0,"Uuugh!!!! What a rip off. I came in from out of town and hung out with my buddy Joe. He highly recommended JT's because of their awesome wings and tiny tacos. What he didn't know was that most of the positive reviews of this place on Yelp are ancient reviews from when Julio was still working there. This place had the kiss of death and was taken over by cheap, shady owners. The new owners want to cut cost but still cash in on the positive word of mouth about the food. They also raised the prices. So in essence, the new owners are producing a cr@p product and charging us more money! To add insult to injury they shorted us 2 chicken wings. Talk about trifflin'!! If they're shorting people wings, I'd hate to know what they're doing to their drinks. When we got them they were cold all the way down to the bones and stale like they had been made as a mistake earlier in the day, boxed up and given to us (short 2 wings!!!). The tacos were bland like they just cooked some ground beef without seasoning and threw it in the shell. I added the salsa to try to add some flavor to it but it didn't cut it. I'm sure MY taco has more flavor than this one did. Most of the wings and tacos are still in the fridge and will inevitably meet their fate at the bottom of the garbage can. In conclusion, if you want over priced, piece of cr@p wings that don't taste half as good as frozen ones and tacos that taste better when they come out of you than going in, go to JTs so they can pi$$ on you face and tell you it's raining!\n*Additionally, don't believe the review underneath mines. I'm almost 100% positive it was done by someone who works for them or has some sort of affiliation with this place. It's written like an advertisement. The wings look NOTHING like they do in that picture. This review would be VASTLY different if they did. Our wings were all limp and flaccid when they showed up to film. Nice try you guys. You make me sick."
0,"This place has gone down hill.  I have been here over the past few years and until today have had decent experiences.  I showed up to my appointment 10 minutes early and was required to fill out paperwork (is there a reason they don't keep a file for me?) but again, I was early so whatever.  I was done in 5 minutes but had to sit and listen to front desk staff discussing personal issues (babysitters' schedule, going to lunch, making fun of a poor lady who called for directions to the office two times, etc) until finally heading to the back around 9:20.  While waiting I couldn't help to notice that the place is dirty - trash on the floor,etc.\nI go to the first round of tests and Megan (I think that was her name) the tech was awesome.  Except when she had me remove my contacts in their bathroom --- to spare you I will just say that it was more of a mess than the waiting room.\nThe dr exam was also pleasant and quick.  My current contacts were discontinued so she recommended a new brand and even gave me a sample set to wear home with my new prescription.\nI went upfront to pay and was expecting my $20 co-pay as in years' past.  They charge me $60.  So of course I asked why and it was explained to me that this year they had given me a contact exam so that's why the additional charge.  What the?!  I've worn/renewed contacts for 4 years and have always gotten my exam from them.  In my opinion nothing has changed but I had no choice but to pay, obviously.  I called my insurance immediately to see if there was something that had changed with the plan and the agent said no and then asked if I order contacts through Nationwide or elsewhere.  I always do my exam at Nationwide where my exam is covered by medical insurance and order contacts/glasses at another place where my actual vision insurance is accepted.  Here's the kicker-- because there was no change, the insurance agent thinks Nationwide is charging more because I mentioned I wouldn't order though them.  Looking back, I'm not sure I was so honest in past years.  This makes me sick because I know I've been \""had\"".\nI should've run away from how dirty the place was anyhow because now I keep thinking about whether or not they sanitize anything that touched my face... *shudder*\nOn the up-side, this place is next to Wildflower for a good muffin & good cup of coffee."
0,"Worst place ever! First time I came here for my contact lens fitting appointment I had to wait 1 hr + and that was with an appointment. No apologies from the staff for the long wait either. Second time I went to finalize my prescription I told the doctor about how the contacts didn't feel right, I couldn't see very clearly. I've been wearing contacts for years. Discovered that on top of all the waiting the doctor and staff are incompetent because they incorrectly ordered my contacts for me and changed my -2.75 prescription to a +2.75.  Do not go here! They suck! This is for the location at 4280 E Indian School."
0,The Worst Customer Service Experience in a long time.  Long wait times while giving off lots of attitude while you wait.  Amazed at the consistency of the poor attitude of every single employee in the place.  Do yourself a favor and stay away!
0,"I purchased glasses on 5-3-13.  I am still waiting to receive the glasses that I paid for.  I paid on 5-3-13 and then waited.  After waiting two weeks I called to see when my glasses would be ready and was put on hold.  I was on hold forever when I was finally told that the factory had made an error with my prescription and that they had to be sent back.  I was told that they would rush the service and call me as soon as the glasses were ready.  I waited a week and called to see when the glasses would be ready and was told they just arrived.  I went in and picked them up.  I wore the glasses for two days when a friend informed me that the glasses were not darkening in the sun.  He showed me how the lenses did not change at all in the direct sun light.  I took the glasses back and the representative tried to convince me that the lenses were exactly what I had ordered.  When I asked her to step outside in the sunlight and show me she suddenly decided that maybe all I had was the anti-glare and the lenses were not correct.  She said she would correct the glasses and would do a rush service on the glasses. One week later I was called and told the glasses were ready.  When I went in to pick them up on my lunch I was so disappointed.  They were now trying to give me plain old glasses with the line across the lenses.  I did not want to try them on but the representative insisted.  I told her I was not blind that I could clearly see the line on the lenses so they could not be my glasses.  She insisted that I needed to try them on.  I told her that I want a refund and NO I am not trying the glasses on.  She said she would go get a manager.  I sat there for 15 minutes waiting.  I then met with Diana the Manager.  I was clear that I wanted a refund that I was patient and they had three chances to do my glasses and they could not get the job done.  I am going on vacation next week and I am going on vacation with my glasses and you have not been capable up to this point.  Diana then stated that she would  personally take care of my glasses and that they would be correct and that I would have them in time for my vacation.  She said she would give me a discount for the inconvenience I had been experiencing.  She looked me in the eye and gave me her word.  I looked her back in the eye and said if you do not get it right I will contact her corporate office and then I would find every review place I can to share my experience.  I picked the glasses up today.  I met with Diana and asked if she had checked them and is everything I paid for there and she said yes.  She put my lenses in the glasses and I tried them on.  The glasses seemed to be ok.  Things looked a little fuzzy and the ground appeared to be moving.  I was told there is an adjustment time and that it would clear up soon.  We went outside and I tried them on and they seemed to be more shaded than my old pair of glasses.  We went in and she did some more adjustments to the glasses and cleaned them.  I again asked her if all the features I paid for are on the glasses and she said yes.  She went outside again with the glasses while I was waiting and she checked them in the sun.  Diana said yes everything is on the glasses that you ordered.  I was running late on my lunch hour and was feeling rushed to get back to the office.  Diana refunded $39.99 on the glasses for the inconvenience I experienced.  When I got home tonight and stood out in the sun for five minutes, nothing happened.  The lenses do not darken at all.  The lenses do appear to have a thick anti-glare coating.  There definitely is no change to the lenses when standing in direct sunlight.  I will return tomorrow morning and get my refund.  I am concerned that they will make the refund difficult, but if a refund is not given then I would have to call their actions fraudulent. I had insurance that paid a portion of the bill.  The insurance company has also been charged for an item not received. If necessary I will be calling the fraud department at United Health Care. I have been deceived and feel like a foolish woman.  I am foolish to the tune of \n$ 793.90.  I will follow up this post with the results of my visit tomorrow where I intend to get a refund.\n5-5-2013 Went back this morning to return the glasses.  The representative put them under a special lite they had and presto the glasses got dark. We then went outside and the glasses were definitely darker.  I really felt like something was wrong because I had the glasses outside at home for an hour in and out of the sunlight and they never got dark like they did at the store. The glasses are still fuzzy when I try to read small print.  I am going to bring them to my eye doctor to have them checked to see if they have been made to the prescription that I was given. I also double checked my paperwork and noticed a $135.00 copay I was charged.  My benefits show that I have a $25.00 copay. I will be calling United Health Care Monday to verify my benefits."
0,"I purchased $ 793.00 glasses on 5-3-13.  I am on the fourth set of glasses which translates into 6 trips to Nationwide Vision Center.  Six trips for one item!  How many chances do you give a professional business to deliver on one $ 800.00 item?  Ok, maybe I assumed they were a professional business.  I have a simple bifocal subscription.  When I ordered I asked for glasses without the lines on the lenses.  I also asked for glasses that worked like sunglasses outside and regular glasses indoors.  I was given a bill and I paid my portion and was told I would be called when the glasses were ready.  I called two weeks after ordering my glasses and was told the factory made an error and the glasses were sent back to the factory.  A week later I called and the glasses were ready.  When I put the glasses on everything felt a little wobbly but I was told there is an adjustment period. I was not wearing the glasses for driving so it was a couple of days before I noticed there was not a sunglass effect standing in the sun.  Disappointed I took the glasses back.  The representative tried to convince me that the lenses were exactly what I had ordered.  When I asked her to step outside in the sunlight and show me she suddenly decided that maybe all I had was the anti-glare and the lenses were not correct.  She said she would correct the glasses and call me when they were ready. One week later I was called and told the glasses were ready.  When I went in to pick them up on my lunch hour I was once again let down.  They were now trying to give me plain old glasses with the line across the lenses.  I did not want to try them on but the representative insisted.  I told her I could clearly see the line on the lenses so they could not be my glasses.  She insisted that I needed to try them on.  I told her that I want a refund and NO I am not trying the glasses on.  She said she would get her manager.  I sat there for 15 minutes waiting.  I then met with Diana the Manager.  I clearly stated that I wanted a refund.  I was patient and they had three chances to correctly produce my glasses and they could not get the job done. Diana then stated that she would personally take care of my glasses and that they would be correct.  She said she would give me a discount for the inconvenience I had been experiencing.  She looked me in the eye and gave me her word.  I looked her in the eye and replied that I was a letter writer.  If the glasses were not correct I would contact Nationwide Vision Center corporate headquarters, Facebook and any forum available to express my dissatisfaction with Nationwide Vision Center product and service.  I picked up the glasses on 6-14-13.  I met with Diana and asked if she had checked the glasses and she said yes.  She put my lenses in the glasses and I tried them on.  The glasses seemed to be ok.  Things looked a little fuzzy and the ground appeared to be moving.  I was told again that there is an adjustment time and that it would clear up soon.  We went outside and they seemed to be more shaded than my old pair of glasses.  When we went inside again I asked her if all the features I ordered were on the glasses and she said yes.  She went outside again with the glasses while I was waiting and she checked them in the sun.  Diana stated again that the glasses were what I ordered.  I was running late on my lunch hour and was feeling rushed to get back to the office. When you go in to pick up glasses you should expect it to be an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes.  Diana discounted $39.99 on the glasses.  When I got home that night and stood out in the sun for five minutes, nothing happened.  The lenses did not darken.  The lenses have a purple/rose colored hue when I am indoors and outdoors. I did not detect a change to the lenses when standing in direct sunlight.  I will return tomorrow morning and get my refund. \nI went back the next morning (6-15-13) to return the glasses.  The representative put them under a special light they had and presto the glasses got very dark.  We then went outside and the glasses were definitely darker.  I asked the customer service representative why the glasses were a purple/rose hue outside in the sun and not grey.  I ordered gray and I had expected to see grey.  He said no that is the gray (yes the Emperor has clothes).  He then added that the lenses are effected by heat and the lenses will not get as dark outside in Phoenix as they would in Flagstaff.  He repeated it again that if I go to Flagstaff the glasses would be significantly darker.  I do not live in Flagstaff, I live in Phoenix and I purchased my glasses in Phoenix and I expect them to work in Phoenix.  The glasses are still fuzzy when I try to read small print.  I have not been able to darken the lenses to the level they did in the store with their special UV light.  I left the glasses out in the direct sun for 2 hours.  This is starting to feel like a bait and switch scam."
0,"Thanks for the service, or lack thereof. Customer service sucked. Not one person offered to help, and yes, it was slow."
0,Never again!!!!  The worst customer service and communication I've ever experienced. They should all be fired and start fresh or I can guarantee this location will be gone in less than a year. HORRIBLE!!
0,Went for lunch and was very disappointed. Restaurant smells musty and the food was awful. Service was very good.
0,"I had one hour for lunch, and had heard this was one of the best places in town. I expected the lunch combo would come with a cup of soup - but not here, even though lunch is hi-priced. The weather was cold, so I wanted soup. I ordered sizzling rice soup and some egg rolls. It took 45 minutes between the time I sat down and when I got my food! The soup was not sizzling, and had small round BURNT rice cakes floating in the cup. BURNT BLACK. I had ten minutes to eat and get back to the office, so I could not return my meal. I fished out the burnt pieces and ate quickly. Maybe this place had a good rep in the past, but I will never go back there!"
0,"WORST FOOD EVER!! \n\nI went there for their lunch specials and got the sweet and sour chicken. \n\nThe egg roll was great, but the sweet and sour chicken was horrible. The sauce had no flavor and ruined my entire dish. Depending on your liking, the there were very thick peices of chicken within the dish with very little breading. I personal enjoy breading with my sweet and sour chicken."
0,"I cannot in good faith recommend this restaurant.   This is definitely the low end of Chinese food for Phoenix.   Normally I'd try a place more than once, but, in this case... Not going to happen."
0,"Seriously, where's the flavor?  I went there for the first time yesterday and, based on previous review,s I was expecting something wonderful.  NOT!  First, I ordered wor wonton soup.  I had to add so much salt to get any flavor out of the broth.  Yes, there were plenty of vegetables and shrimp, but nothing had any flavor.  The \""wontons\"" were more like gnocchi.  Then came my chicken chow mein.  More bean sprouts than chicken and, again, needed so much salt.  UGH!  Needless to say I'll continue my search throughout the Valley for excellent Chinese food."
0,"It was the worst Chinese food I have ever had. I had the spicy beef with vegetables and my son had the Singapore noodles. My sauce was missing flavor as equally my veggies and beef were bland. Hospital food is better. The rice was cooked with too much water so it was mushy, so when I told the server he said he would get rice from a different pot. That means they have two types of rice and they serve the lowest quality first. The second bowl he brought was medium grade long grain rice. Don't eat here!"
0,"Over all, I will not be going back. The best apart of the whole dinner was that the entire staff was very kind, and friendly. But NOTHING else would bring me back. The prices are too high, since the food was NOT good. If the prices were lower, I would consider the old \""Well you get what you pay for!\"" saying, but I paid $6 for a small bowl of egg drop soup, and it was very watered down and needed seasoning. Then I paid $11 for some chicken chow mien, it was ok, but the chicken was either old, or stringy (or something, it wasn't very good). The restraunt itself was clean, but freezing. I think they had the ac on.... but since the evenings lately have been in the 30's* everyone was already cold. I looked around and everyone was eating with there jackets, sweaters and hats still on. I was wearing my sweater & scarf! My waiter was a very nice guy, but over all, the food was sub par, and over priced, while the dinning room was uncomfortably cold.I could go on but I hate that my review is this negative already, since I think they really are good people."
0,"STAY AWAY AND FOR GOODNESS SAKE, DON'T TAKE YOUR CHILDREN!!!  My daughter was misdiagnosed and spent two years on a medication she didn't need!  Words cannot describe how angry I was when I found this out through a reputable allergist.  I suspect that they are receiving kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies, because we spent hundreds of dollars on equipment and medications (which they provided directly).  The staff is ambivalent at best, downright hostile at worst.  And don't get me started on the excessive costs and all the hassle with the insurance!"
0,The WORST customer service experience I have ever had.\n They have no courtesy or manners what so ever.
0,"My first time here for lunch. I went with 2 other friends. \n\nWhat we had:\nAppetizer: artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips \nLunch: fish and chips, and their special of the day meatballs.\n\nWe got our appetizer and it was good. The fish and chips were a little on the greasy side, but what do you expect for fried fish and french fries. The meatballs... that's another story. They used a spice in it that had a very strong licorice taste (I think the spice is called anise). There were 4 meatballs for $7.95. I took a small bite off of one and almost gagged. I could not handle the licorice taste. I asked if I can substitute it for fish and chips and make it \""to go\"" as we were running out of time. When the check came, they did not take the meatballs off and asked the waitress about it. Come to find out that the OWNER said \""JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE IT, I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR IT!\"". I WAS SHOCKED!!!!  I told her, then I didn't want the fish and chips. I only ordered a higher price item as not to walk out with only a $30 bill.  \n\nWe ended up leaving paying $46, $8.00 for the meatballs that I only had 1 bite out of! It's a good thing I ate my share of the artichoke dip or I would have STARVED!\n\nI WILL NEVER BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!!"
0,"This review is about rude, rude Wally. First off, as my 80 year old mother and I were coming in slowly, he said \""hurry up, old lady.\""  The food was ok, frankly not one thing to talk about.  A $10 - $14 burgers and salad kind of joint.  My son ordered the halibut special. The bill for a plate with some rice, green beans, and a piece of halibut was $26.95!!!!! I told Wally I thought that was too expensive for a restaurant like his. His response was, \""I guess you haven't eaten in a restaurant lately.\"" well, Wally, no way am I stepping back in yours."
0,"The first time that I went into this place I thought that it was okay. I did not feel like it lived up to the rave reviews but it was good enough to bring me back to enjoy some food and drink with an old friend.  That time I had ordered their shrimp cocktail while I waited for my friend to arrive, I was starving! As I was eating, the owner (I assume) came up to introduce himself and asked if I live in the area (most of the patrons do)...as I turned back towards the bar to eat my very last jumbo shrimp, the Katie Perry look alike grabbed my food and dumped it in the trash! She never even asked if I was finished. I asked her if she decided that I was done eating and then she asked if I wanted another shrimp from the kitchen but I felt awkward at that point and told her no. She still brought me one lonely shrimp on a huge plate with no cocktail sauce. The sauce is what makes the shrimp cocktail. My friend and I then ordered their spinach dip.  The dip was brought out and as the plate was lowered to the bar, my chips were sliding off onto the bar and she just scooped them back on to the plate. I personally was not thrilled about that. I scooped some spinach up on to my dirty chip, blew on it a little and took a bite. This dip was the hottest (heat wise) thing that I have ever had in my mouth. I would compare it to biting the rack in a broiler.  I was never warned that they heat their dip up so hot. I guarantee the work of a microwave! I burned myself so bad that my mouth was peeling and bleeding. It took over a week of peroxide rinses, colloidal silver rinses and salt water rinses to heal my mouth. My mouth is actually scarred inside! This burned me so terribly that my teeth were sore, my jaw hurt and even my sinuses on that side of my mouth hurt. When I stopped in to tell the brunette bartender about my burn and I advised that they should warn people about how hot they make it, she replied with \""Well, don't scarf your food down, let it cool first.\"" Totally rude, offensive and bad customer service with a reply like that. That same night that I burned my mouth, my friend was using their hot sauce to spice up her chip and the bartender came over and started twisting the lid back on without asking if she was done and my friend had to stop her from taking it away. She clearly has issues with letting people finish their meal. When it came to the bill she had to ask us how many drinks we had because she wasn't keeping track... It seriously was not a lot of drinks to keep track of either. I think this place would be OK if it wasn't for this bartender. I did order a salad on a separate occasion (when I warned her about the hot dip) and that proved to be disappointing as well, way too much dressing and she kept giving me a hard time for not drinking during my work hour. Booooooo!!!"
0,"Stopped in during happy hour for a light bite and a drink. Sat at the bar and ordered a glass of their house Cab. With one other person at the bar, you'd think the service would be reasonable. The only other time I saw the bartender was when my glass was empty. I ordered another thinking she'd offer me a menu at least...never happened!! So I paid requested my bill and went somewhere else to eat. Btw, my bill for 2 glasses of \""house\"" wine during happy hour was more than $15!!! Other servers appeared to be much more customer-focused."
0,"Blindly went to Taylor's with a friend on Sunday (had I known where we were going I would have recommended someplace else). I decided to be open minded and give them another try. I ordered an iced tea and the waffle, he got the poached eggs with hollandaise and a coffee. The server took our orders and returned with an OJ for me, forgivable offense - she took it away and brought me back a an iced tea. \n\nThen the incredible wait began... An hour later we finally flagged someone down to inquire on our food. He said he would check for us.. We never saw him again. There was a party of 3 and a party of 6 next to us, they both ordered after us and were almost done with their meal... Both parties were complaining about missing items, I overheard a bagel, a side of fruit and a waitress had all disappeared. At this point I was ravenous and we again went to find our server.. She finally brought our food, and it was horrible. The waffle was dry and tasteless and the poached eggs were drenched in hollandaise, thick greasy hollandaise that looked and tasted like it had been sitting on the plate for ages. \n\nOur horrible breakfast experience lasted 1:40 minutes. Ridiculous. I will not be returning, 3 strikes Taylor's you're out. I left a Yelp card on the table, hopefully they read this an make some improvements."
0,Service was slow..staff was inattentive and nothing was done when we complained.won't be back.
0,"We used to go to Taylor Cafe all the time, but haven't been in a while.  Man, what a difference- and not in a good way.\n\nIt is unseasonably cool in Phoenix and Vincent's isn't having their brunch experience, so we decided to go back to Taylor Cafe.  There were several less than pleasant surprises.  First off, they no longer have a liquor license and thus no Mimosas or Bloody Marys.  That was a minor issue for us, but worth mentioning on a Saturday morning brunch.  I ordered a cup of coffee, some scrambled eggs with cheese for my hungry toddler, and we looked at the menu.  \n\nIt seemed to have gotten much larger and there were some new interesting items.  I loved the eggs benedict before, and ordered it again.  My husband ordered the crepes.  We anticipated our meals.\n\nMy daughter's eggs came out almost within seconds.  Shocked, I saw it wasn't just eggs, but hashbrowns and fruit.  It was also NOT warm.  That surprise was a $9 meal.\n\nWhile waiting for our meal, I drank most of my coffee.  The server asked if I'd like more coffee to heat up my cup.  He took my cup, which I though was odd, and brought it back with warm, steaming coffee.  Yay!  Upon getting the bill, I learned there was no such things as refills and I was charged for a second cup.  \n\nLastly, our food was delivered.  My eggs benedict was not warm...again!  What is with cool food?  There wasn't enough hollandaise sauce, and honestly, it just wasn't that tasty.  My husband thought his crepes were just ok- not bad, but not flavorful.  Our last surprise:  when the bill arrived and we spent $45 on at best a mediocre breakfast, we were less than pleased.\n\nThe only bright spot- our server was friendly and did his best.  \n\nWe will not go back.  This was just one disappointment after another."
0,"If your into over cooked eggs and your hash browns drowning in oil accompanied with a server with a chip on her shoulder, then this is the place for you.\nI will never return and i recommend you reconsider before going and dropping the money they are asking for this sub-par food. Go to Denny's, your food will be prepared much better and taste just as equal with probably better service. At you wont have toworry about your server reach over you and across the table to pick up your straw wrapper. I mean really! Ask me to hand it to you, DON'T reach across!"
0,"It's true...I have experienced better, much better.  I really want to like this place, but both times I've eaten here I have been unimpressed.  I ordered a veggie burrito with a side of fruit and some salsa.  Ugh, first off, the avocado that came with the dish was old, not old like it could have been made into some tasty guac...it was dark and tasted like it should have gone into a compost bin rather than my mouth.  Second, the fruit looked as though it had been cut (or taken out of it's package) many days prior to hitting my plate, so I didn't even bother eating it.  Lastly, the freaking salsa looked so pale and gross that I just gave up on the meal entirely.  I was really disappointed with their obvious lack of care when it came to the quality of food they were sending out.  In no way would I have ever sent any of that food out had it been my restaurant.  The server was nice enough and the coffee mug was huge, but I won't be back, sorry kids...I gave you a second try and you came up short again."
0,"It is were possible to give this restaurant zero stars, I would. I have been here 4 times in the past year in the hope that the service would improve.  I had first tried Taylor's several years ago and remember the food being good, but having very bad service. We recently moved close to the restaurant and are looking for a locally-owned breakfast place.  I am not usually such an optimist, but the local is right by our house. \n\nThe menu is very large and the food has always been fine, nothing great, but the service absolutely terrible.  Not bad, terrible. Every time. All four times.  The wait staff is incredibly slow to take orders, bring drinks and food, and worst of all, after serving food, never check back to see if you need anything or offer drink refills. \n\nI cannot tolerate such poor service and will not return.  Trust me, you can find a better breakfast or lunch place."
0,"spent nearly entire evening vomiting after ordering Taylor's Cafe \""Joe's special\"" (ground beef, spinach, onion, etc.) ...a dish I normally love there.  It's the only thing I ate all day, so I'm certain it was this dish.  Awful night.\nRichard"
0,"I lost the screw in my glasses.  I went to COSTCO and they could not fix them and gave me a card for this place.  He told me I needed a new arm because the hinge was cracked; however, I had already put in a temporary screw and did not see what he saw.  He wanted $38.00 to fix them.  I decided to get a second opinion and went around the corner to an optical shop and he said I only needed a screw and fixed them for nothing."
0,This guy totally bait and switched me. I went in and he told me 50 dollars and I thought that was high so I went and called my insurance to see if it would be cheaper to just get new frames. I went back in and said ok I will do it. Then I pulled out a 10% discount card and then he told me 69 but he will do it for 50. I thought that was pretty unethical.  I told him I would pay 45 which would be his orginal quote plus my 10% off. He refused.
0,"Worst. Buffet. Ever.\n\n'Nuff said. No...scratch that, I must vent. Or Yelp.\n\nWow, what a disaster. My workmate and I were craving a buffet today, and on the way into work I had passed the Golden Coin and thought it looked like any standard cheap buffet from the outside. But I was fooled, it's not just ANY cheap buffet, it's THE cheap buffet. \n\nWell, as Roger Daltrey says, \""I won't get fooled again!\""\n\nThe sign outside says $4.86 buffet, lunch or dinner. For less than a Lincoln, it's worth a try, right? (Wrong!) First of all, cash only, people, no plastic. And here's the ENTIRE buffet list:\n\nRice (of the brown fried variety, bland)\nLo Mein (I'm not sure what that taste is, but it ain't Lo Mein)\nEgg Rolls (small, cut in half, and awful. And there's that \""taste\"" again...)\nFried Chicken (the only food of redeeming quality)\nWings (again, bland, though decent in size)\nSweet and Sour Pork (I'll get to this in a second)\n\nYep, that's it. The whole buffet. And no refills on the sodas, either. Some greasy chinese crispy noodles. No soup. (Hey, no soup means not having to provide spoons!)\n\nThe fried chicken wasn't bad, but other than that, I wouldn't serve this food to prisoners. Except the ones on death row, and that's to save money on electricity.\n\nI'm not quite sure what the deal was with the Sweet and Sour Pork. The sauce was the consistency of water, the meat was......wait, I don't want to know. \n\nIf I could give it 1/1000th of a star, I'd do it. Steer clear, and your digestive system will thank you."
0,"Let's be fair to Mike Kwan here & make it clear that this is NOT the worst buffet in Phoenix, much less the world.  For that, you'd have to decide between Hong Kong Restaurant & New Sun Star Super Buffet at Central & Southern!\n\nThe problem here isn't that the food is bad, it's that they don't have anything!  It's a tiny place with just a few hot food choices for $4.86.  Now, I'm not going to complain about the price, but I want salad, so that was it for this place... won't see you there!\n\nIf you want \""cheap\"", whip over to Best Wok Buffet at McDowell & 51st Ave. instead.  It's much better, & it's only $4.25 for lunch, & $4.95 for dinner!"
0,"For some reason my parents loved the Golden Coin chain when I was a child, and this seems to be the only one left standing. Maybe it was better back then, I don't really know. First of all, I hate buffets with a fiery passion, but this is by far the worst one I've ever had the displeasure of being dragged to. The ambience of the restaurant makes you feel as if you're eating your last meal in prison before being sent off to the chair. The food was gross and the food options were miniscule. I only had a few bites because I didn't like it and I was worried I'd get sick, if you ever visit this dive trust me, you'll feel the same way. The booths are also extremely uncomfortable and the restaurant is tiny and crammed. Bottom line, they should have just let this buffet chain die."
0,"Walked in the other day. Looked at the dashboard size buffet of 8 maybe 10 items. One of those being fried chicken, which is probably better done across the street. Walked back out and will never return. The place is a rat hole! The building should be condemned."
0,"this place sucked u walk in cash only had to go to chevron and pull money out biggest mistake i should have stayed out so its $6.95 with a drink and you have to get ice tea to get refills all the good ones u have to pay (not that the others were any better) another $1.40 (retarded) the selection is 4 or 5 dishes which include chicken, fried rice, fried noodles, small freaken veggie egg rolls and some pepper chicken (WTF) seat selection is not bad but you see drunk indians go behind the gas station not to mention if you need the restroom its a door that goes outside to another door smh this is NOT place you wanna go sorry but i will never return"
0,"Wish I was able to give  1/2 of a Star! \n\nI don't know why the Yelper in me failed to check  out Golden Coin prior to giving it a shot.  However, I craved an all you can eat Chinese Buffet and went to Golden Coin because it was close to work. Probably the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to, I take that back  \""No Probably\"" about it, Golden Coin is the worst Chinese Buffet I have ever been to!   \n\n                                  Eight Items on the Buffet \n\nFried Wontons, Rice, Lo Mien, Vegetables, Chicken, Chicken Wings, Egg Rolls, & Sweet and Sour pork\n\n\nAs I took my first bite of rice a single thought ran through my head: \""How can a Chinese Restaurant not cook rice right\""?  If the rice wasn't bad enough the Lo Mien sure was, not sure how to describe that taste, but it's not Lo Mien, so I will stick with tasteless soggy noddles. The eggrolls were equally bad, small, cut in half, and horrible and once again a taste that is hard to describe, so lets go with tasteless again, after all it worked when describing the Lo Mien. Moving on to the sweet and sour pork, this dish consisted of  small,dried out,  hard pieces of what  I am assuming was pork covered in a reddish sauce that had the consistency of water.  Tasteless doesn't begin to describe that dish! The Wontons can best be described as greasy crispy noddles and don't even get me started on the chicken and wings. How in the world does Golden Coin prepare that stuff? It's awful. \n\nSo there yo have it, that's it. The entire Golden Coin Buffet. Don't think you can wash down a bad meal with soda....no refills on the sodas at Golden Coin!!!!"
0,"The food here is surprisingly better than i thought it would be, considering i rarely ever eat cheap food much less cheap all you can eat Chinese food. But do far the food is edible, i don't think I'm gonna get food poisoning, and it was after all cheap $7.40 for dinner with all your can eat and soda. \nI'm dropping stars because it seems impossible to get a refill on soda. So far it's been fifteen minutes and I thirsty as heck.  Is normally leave a tip, but I'm not happy with their service here"
0,"I have had numerous appointments here over the past 4 years to treat breakouts, and I am less than impressed with the PA's and tx methods. You never see a dermatologist...only a PA. They don't ask questions about your skin, their exam of your skin is bare minimum, and they prescribe topicals and send you out the door. No education about possible causes & possible preventatives (other than their topical meds). This past experience with PA Kenan was ridiculous. He wouldn't prescribe oral meds, stating my skin wasn't bad enough. Well, in my opinion it is bad, and topicals are not working, and how would he know anyway because I had make-up on and he barely looked at my face. He offered nothing in regards to treating the breakout problem other than prescribing topicals & referring me to their aestatician, which neither have worked for me! If you need acne help, go to a real derma, not a PA, and another clinic if you want treatment for acne."
0,"They were SO rude....Dr. Romine was nice enough to stop by and said \""anything you need make sure you contact us\"" but besides that they were just plain rude. Definitely not going back...."
0,"This office is very incompetent. I asked for an annual check up but the PA Molly who is very rude, said she was not told I wanted that and spent THREE MINUTES total with me, and left without ever asking me if I had any questions. She was concerned with staying on schedule (she was already late) rather than treating me. The room I waited in was FILTHY--dirty dressing gowns overflowing the wastebasket and on the floor."
0,"Beautiful new offices at 40th street and Campbell, but apparently their clocks don't work. Just sat there for 60 minutes past my 8:45 am appointment time, and no one saw me. Had to leave for a meeting. If I was in customer service there, I would remind the doctors that their customers' time is more valuable than their own."
0,"I saw Dr. Romine's office for a few years for acne maintenance. Eventually I decided to see one of her aestheticians for a light chemical peel.  This light peel ended up scabbing over most of my face mainly on the sides near my cheeks. I went back to  them after it started to get more severe and was told by Dr. Romine that I was actually lucky because I was getting the result of a more aggressive, more expensive peel. What I wasn't given was the proper instruction and/or topical treatment for this type of peel which has subsequently left me with the darkening and scarring of my face. I went back 6 or so months later with these same concerns and was told that I have a skin condition and that it was not caused by the peel. However, I know that it was.  Seeing as this is a dermatology office, I felt confident getting this type of procedure.  I understand that sometimes things don't go as planned, but not taking accountability for these things is a different story.  Maybe I could have taken some sort of legal action, which I did not,  but would like others to be aware before deciding to get a treatment like this from them."
0,"Wish I could review this place on service but I wasn't able to get one.  Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi, was told by the front nail tech to have a seat.  I get it, I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait.  My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me.  Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me.  You know your salon, you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time.  I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away  \n\nThe place in general was dirty, nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere.  I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy."
0,"I hate giving a bad review.  But I am PISSED and feel that I must due to the situation I'm going through presently.  I've been going to Andy's for off and on now for about 2 years (When I need a pedi last moment) and have not had any problems.  Then again, I really don't recall getting nicked or having a tech go overkill with the nippers.  \n\nFlash back to last Thursday.  I want to get a quick pedi before J and I headed to Vegas for the Labor Day weekend.  So, I head over to Andy's.  Everything is going well, until the tech starts trimming the cuticles and going after what she must think is a hangnail or something.  Next thing I know, a piece of skin is being what felt like ripped from the side of my toenail bed.  I'm not bleeding, so I think nothing of it.  \n\nThe rest of Thursday - toe is feeling so-so.  \nFriday - toe starts feeling a little sore.  \nSaturday - more soreness.  \nSunday, my toe is starting to full on hurt.  Got some redness going on.  Me not having any issues like this in the past, I don't think too much of it.  All week long, my flippin toe continues to hurt.  Even when I'm not walking.  So I decide that I need to do something.\n\nThis morning, I mention it to a coworker of mine who's dealt with nail fungus before from getting shoddy services at other establishments.  With my leg hiked up on my desk we take a closer look.  She then says to me, \""That looks a little green.\""  \nME - WHAT THE F_CK!??!  \nSure enough, right along the cuticle there's a small green patch.  She says that she's seen nailbeds turn green, but not the skin.  I'm pissed.  \n\nI was tempted to return to Andy's to ask them, \""WTF is this sh*t\"". But knowing that I had a regular nail appointment (for my gel nails, that i get at a regular salon up in N. Scottsdale), I decide to ask my nail gal about it.  \n\nSo I head on up to my appointment after work.  No sooner than I get back to my gel gals station, I tell her what's going on and ask her to have a look.  She gets down on her knees, looks at my toe, and immediately grabs some tool from her sanitizer container (the blue stuff).  A few presses of the tool and the next thing I know, puss is coming out from the side of my toe.  OMFingG.\n\nYUCK!!  GAG!!  My gal was super upset.  Upset at the fact that there are techs out there that are lazy and do not properly sanitize their tools and equipment.  \nWhich makes a bad name for everyone else who does do things by the book and follows State Board guidelines.  So now, I have to go and get my toe puss drained every day for the next week or so.  Toe Puss = FAIL\n\nIf I was a diabetic, I'd probably be having my toe amputated right about now.  Will I return to Andy's?  HELL TO THE F_CK NO!  \n\nAnd while its on my mind, let me make a call to the state board.\n\n(after thoughts) \nWhen I think about it, a lot of these chop shops do not properly disinfect their pedi bowls.  They're supposed to clean and disinfect the bowl and let circulate for 10 minutes.  I've seen this place, and other chop shops rinse with water, then wipe down with a kitchen type scrub sponge (sometimes spraying with a 409 type product), and then refill with water for the next customer.  \n\nFrom the EPA website on Disinfection for Foot Spa Basins - \nhttp://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/footspa_disinfection.htm\nAfter Each Client: (this can take place any time after the client's feet are out of the footbath, while feet are massaged, toes are painted, or other opportunities)\n\n1.Drain the water from the foot spa basin or bowl and remove any visible debris. \n2.Clean the surfaces of the foot spa with soap or detergent, rinse with clean water, and drain. \n3.After cleaning, disinfect* the surfaces with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant (for description) according to the manufacturer's directions on the label. Surfaces must remain wet with the disinfectant for 10 minutes or the time stated on the label, which may be shorter. \n* For whirlpool foot spas, air-jet basins, \""pipe-less\"" foot spas, and other circulating spas: It is best to disinfect by filling the basin with clean water, adding the appropriate amount of liquid disinfectant, and turning the unit on to circulate the disinfectant for the entire contact time. \n4.After disinfection, drain and rinse with clean water. \n\nNext time you get your mani-pedi (at any nail place), start to take notice of how they're disinfecting/cleaning."
0,This place just refused service. I have come here many times before! This time I had a hang nail that had bled but I informed them that it had not bled for 24 hours and that I have been keeping it properly cleaned for sanitation sake. They refused to fix the nail claiming that it was still bleeding. I told them that it had not been for a day but they argued with me saying that it would burn. I told them I have experiences far worse and that pain was not an issue. They made me wait 20 minutes and then refused service. I will NOT be coming back!!
0,"Can in on a whim and asked the cost of gel on the toe nails (I'm at the pool a lot). They said $15 more than the place I usually go to. I was in a rush and really needed to get both a fill and a pedicure, they refused the service despite my agreement to the ridiculous price."
0,It's official Andys nail has went down the drain. I have been coming here for 6 years and can say will never be back. There work has got so poor! I stopped getting my nails done there 2 years but loved the girls that did the pedis. All those girl are now gone and the people now just suck. Especially this dude they hired. Over priced for the less then mediocre work. Very unhappy walked out with toe nails crocked and only half painted nails( they didn't paint the whole nails)
0,"The Great Escape is Closed.  Now, unfortunately, it's the Little Woody.  Another pretentious take over."
0,"My only direct experience with these guys was when I ordered flowers for my wife's anniversary present.  My initial conversation with the owner was very promising, in which he said that he could gladly make it a small and simply elegant bouquet, featuring purple to match our wedding flower colors, and involving a lot of reassuring yeses (picturing head-nodding as well).  But instead, after charging about $60, they delivered a generic looking arrangement of white flowers that I probably could have found at Safeway for $15.  I love supporting local businesses -- only if they are reliable enough to deliver on promises.  Not sure about going back here again."
0,"I have used Fresh Cut Romance in the past and haven't ever had a problem with them...until last week.  I was out of town and tried ordering a bouquet for a friend who is losing her mother.  I ordered very early in the morning on Thursday and then received a message much later in the day saying there would be a $40 delivery charge to deliver to Gilbert.  I wasn't excited about the charge but at that point just wanted to have them delivered that day and didn't have time to order something else that would be delivered in time so I said okay only to then be told oh never mind, we can't deliver to that zip code.  I was asking them to be delivered to Gilbert...not central phoenix albeit but still not super far away.  If they don't deliver to this zip code there should probably be a list of zip codes they do deliver to or perhaps their staff should be aware of this when they call saying there would be a $40 charge to deliver.  Then, I find out the next day that they also called the girl I was trying to send the flowers to because they wanted to let her know I had ordered her flowers but that they were not going to deliver them because it was too far.  In my opinion, most of the fun of getting flowers is the surprise.  This was a very poor business decision and completely deflated my intention of doing something to put a smile on my friends face.  I will not use Fresh Cut Romance in the future."
0,"The office is very poorly run, wait times too long and highly disorganized.  Even after numerous phone calls to have my name and address removed from their records, they still continue to mail reminders to me and my dogs (one of my dogs passed away 2.5 years ago while under the care of Braecken).  I never even received a sympathy call after he passed.  Not the kind of vet's office I will ever take my remaining 3 rescues to."

0,I like dunkin'  but the service sucks ..  The cashier was rude but I would be too if I had that job. \n\n\n\n\nShe messed up on our order didn't go back to change it because it would've been a waste of time she probably would've messed up on that as well. \n\nJust left dunkin' 20min ago!
0,"Our chicken was so over cooked we could not eat most of it.  Our enchiladas were stone cold.  The  place was filthy,  greasy!  I was shocked , my Dad would not eat any of it.  I will never go back."
0,"Friends of ours invited us to meet them at this restaurant to celebrate a birthday.  Never having been there, I checked out their website, and found that it is one of a (small) chain of restaurants based in Chicago.  The menu looked interesting, and I tentatively chose an entree (Clams and Mussels alla Uncle Roy).  Upon arriving at the restaurant, I discovered that that dish was not on the menu.  I had chosen it because it was not tomato sauce or cream based.  The actual menu only has such main dishes.  In any case, I asked the waiter about the appetizer of  \""creamy mariniere\"" musselson the menu.  He didn't know, or couldn't explain, what \""mariniere\"" meant.  I guessed it was the standard dish, but boy was I wrong.  The mussels, very overcooked and chewy, came with a heavy tasteless cream sauce.  My main dish, the \""pescatore\"" came with exactly the same cream sauce.  And the mussels were likewise overcooked, but the clams were cooked so much that they were simply paste.  Inedible.  The wine we chose, Penfold's Bin #2 Syrah-Mourv\u00e8dre (a $10 bottle in the supermarkets), was priced at $30, an exhorbitant markup.  Nothing to recommend this restaurant -- oh, and did I mention the gruff and unhelpful waiter?"
0,"Don't use coupon!  You ate looked down upon and treated poorly. Waiters are not pleasant, choices are spaghetti dishes and chicken dishes without spaghetti! Food was tasty, however, not worth the abusive attitudes. Will not return."
0,Worst Italian food ever. Rude waiter. Decore very lame. Room full because of coupon customers. I don't know where other reviewers have gone but don't listen to them! Stay away.
0,"I don't know where to start.  There were 3 of us for dinner Friday 3/8/13.  We arrived timely for our reservation, after requesting drinks, the waiter announced that he had \""never heard of  that\""; having tomato juice on the side of a martini.  Ok, moving on, Carl asked for blue cheese dressing, and our curmudgeon waiter's response was \""are you crazy, you are in an italian restaurant, not french\"" ?  How do you, as a customer, process this?  Next, the food came, salad, with the house dressing, awful and sweet, the mussels not fresh and the baked clams were good, however, complete with a piece of rock salt in the dish.  Off to a really bad start.  One special ordered piece of fish (frozen at best) and the shrimp scampi-greasy on a bed of fetuccini alfredo, and chicken piccata-looked like it was removed from the Delta business class kitchen, and tasted the same.  I must say, it would be hard to find a worse meal in Phx, anywhere for that matter, and this is one of the only times in my life that I left a 10% tip based on really rude service.  We almost left after the cocktail debacle, but foolishly stayed for the rest of the abuse to follow.  This place is way past its prime."
0,"This place has the worst service. Don't expect your server to be pleasant at all. They look like they just hate serving people and that it's a bother. They seem to forget that it's our money that's keeping them employed. \n\nI requested another round of bread and that was almost 30 minutes ago. Our glasses are always empty, no one has checked on us and our entree is still MIA after almost an hour. We've been here over an hour and our water has been refreshed once without asking for it. \n\nWe weren't advised of the specials. I think our bread is burning in the oven, still no sign of it and I've seen several tables receive bread already. \n\nDon't ever come to this place I know I will never come back to this place ever again and definitely will make sure that this is not on the list of restaurants that we recommend."
0,"I took my car here for an advertised basic wash $8.99, I drive a 98 Jetta k2 model. Once I pull in they tell me they have to hand wash my car because I have a rack on top. Puzzled, because I have taken this car to\nDanny's, Olivia's and numerous other auto car washes and never had a problem, I inquire further. They then explain that my rack isn't factory so the hand wash will be $24.99.. Not factory? I ask.. the rack came with the car, it's a k2 model..That was the big selling point of these cars 10 years ago.. The guy continues to argue with me in a pretty hostile tone so I decide to go somewhere else. I drive less than 2 miles away and see another auto car wash, I pull in they give my ticket and wash my car in the machine for $11.99. I give Simoniz 1 star for having no idea what they are talking about and being rude in their ignorance."
0,"Every time I've been here, there is a problem. Today, I dropped my car off for an oil change and wash and asked them to call me when it was done. Two hours later (one hour at most was promised) I figured it should be done so I went to pick it up. I got there and payed with no event. It was when I drove down the street that I noticed the car hadn't even been washed! I returned and they said I needed to sign off on a waiver due to a loose piece of plastic under my bumper--no biggie but how was I supposed to know?!  In general, they don't embue trust to me and don't really seem to know what they're doing. \n\nThe manager explained that I needed to sign the waiver PRIOR to them washing my car. So here I sit waiting while they wash my car, yet still haven't signed said waiver?????  Told you, lots of excuses and false promises. I don't even trust they completed the services they signed off on."
0,"I decided to go and get my truck washed on Saturday at Simoniz.  First  professional carwash it has had in about 2 years.  For $5 you get a basic wash and towel dry. No vacuuming done. Most of the other Wash-n-Go places let you vacuume your vehicle, but I'd rather have my vehicle towel dried. \n\nI pull in and the assistant manager says their having a special $29.99 detail (which includes their $19.99 deluxe wash). We talk for a few minutes and I state I don't want the armerol or air freshener or any of that stuff done to the inside of the truck. I just wanted the seat vacuumed. He said he will do the deluxe wash and shampoo the seats (which requires a wet vac that sucks out 90% of the water.) for $29.99. I ask how long all of this will take and am told 25-30minutes, tops. SOLD! My truck is 15 years old and has 15 years work of grime in the cloth seats. \n\nI walk inside and watch them pull my truck up to the ramp thing. Then watch it go through the wash, making sure all the special lights go one for the different treatments. I proceed to head on down the the cashier and pay. $29.99 on the card. Apparently, I got a pretty good deal because the cashier said, \""WOW!\""   I know how to deal...whatever.\n\nI make my way outside, pull up a chair to the table out there, and watch my truck pulled around to the detail area. I wanted to keep an eye on things. I was pretty much staring at my truck the whole time. My truck proceeds to sit for about 15 minutes before anyone begins on the detail. \n\n45 minutes later, my truck is \""done\"". \n\nI first inspect the outside of the truck. I notice there is still some soot on the tailgate from when we went camping last. I ask him to clean it off. He wipes his finger over it as if it was damage. Then notices that its not, and wipes it off with a cleaner. \n\nI open up the passenger side door and have a look in. I notice that the seats still look a little dingy and the area between the driver and passenger side wasn't even touched. I point this out to the guy who was doing the detail work. He says sorry for missing it and proceeds to use some cleaning (degreaser) solution and rub it out. I immediately say, \""I was told that the seats would be shampooed and then a majority of the water vacuumed out. Was that not done?\"" And he couldn't lie stating he used the wet vac, because I never saw anything of that type rolled over to the truck. The guy tells me that that process would take a lot longer. \n\nUM HELLO...I FLIPPIN WANT WHAT I PAID FOR!!! I don't give a sh*t if you have to take the time to do the job correctly. I refrained from saying that though. \n\nThe detail guy goes and gets the assistant manager and brings him back and the asst. manager asks if everything is okay. HELL NO. Things are not okay! After explaining what the (Fail to) detail guy did, the asst. mgr apologized and proceeded to get another detail guy on the job. \n\nJust because I was pissed, I decided to talk to the manager too. He said, he'd make sure everything was done over again and correct. LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THE FIRST TIME AROUND! \n\nTime at Car Wash now - 1hr \n\nFrankie did an awesome job on detailing my truck. He wanted me to inspect both the outside and inside before leaving. Everything looked fantastic!! I had wished Frankie would have done the detailing the first time around. The manager gives me a free wash but only after I asked for some form of compensation. \n\nTime at Car Wash now - 1hr 40mins \n\nI get into the truck to leave and grab for my key. Hmm... Its not in the ignition. I holler over to Frankie a car away and ask if he'd seen my key. He walks over and says, \""Its not in the ignition??\"" I bit my tongue as a \""Here's your sign\"" comment was nano seconds from leaving my mouth. \n\nMy key is officially MIA. I wasn't about to say, oh its just the spare...dont worry about it. HELL NO! I have a habit of locking my keys in my truck, so I need the spare!! Next thing I know, I have 6 guys around my truck looking for my key. This is the WORST possible thing that could have happened after the failed shampoo seats incident. I was LIVID and everyone within ear shot knew it.\n\nFinally my key is located. The person who drove it from the line to the detail area put it in the cupholder. Why would someone remove the key from the ignition!? Why not just leave it there? \n\nThe other assistant manager is one of the guys looking for my key. After it is found, he apologizes and gives me a book of washes and a free hand wax. Says that from now on to ask for him personally when I come in and he'll make I'm taken care of when there. \n\n\""Warren\"" is all clean and shiny, but with the hassle that I went through...I don't even know if I want to use the free washes/wax. \n\nTime at Car Wash - 2hrs"
0,"This car wash is terrible, we paid for the works, they did not wipe the interior down. They left dirty spots all over the car the windows were not wiped down inside. To top it all off they never told us our car was done and left it sitting in the sun, it was like an oven when we got in. On the whole a really lousy job. Left no tip and would certainly not recommend."
0,"Would prefer to have my face gnawed off by rats than go here again. Quite possibly the worst experience of my life. Pulled in at 1058 told them I wanted everything, hand wash, wax, the works but I was on my way out of town so in a bit of a rush manager asked me if 30 minutes was ok I said yeah. 30 minutes later I went to check and found they hadn't started yet!! I got in my truck and left stopping out front for a refund."
0,"Complete and utter rip off!  I bought tires from them, had a flat and they were going to charge my $25 to fix it!  I called Discount Tire and they fixed it for free.  Imagine that, a company that will fix another company's problem and for no charge!  \n\nThe other problem I had with this place was that they wanted to charge me $125 to read the fault codes off of my truck when your local auto parts dealer will do this for free!  \n\nEverything about this place irks me and they prey on people who are not auto savvy and they have gotten away with it for so long.  Please stay away from this place as they are way too expensive and will probably be the place to sell you something you do not need if they have the chance."
0,Dont know why i came back to this location a second time! This place suckkss & lack major customer service. An hour & a half & still waiting...for an oil change & i even scheduled the appt online!!!
0,"Super disappointed in the phone mannerism of the staff. Can you say \""no thanks.\"" The story:\n\nI found myself in Phoenix, AZ with two bald tires and I really needed to get new ones. The person on the phone was a JERK. He didn't listen even though I told him that I had the tire size off of my tire. He said, \""It may not be the right size, just tell me what car you have you probably don't know what numbers I need.\"" Why? Because I have a va-jay jay? Really!\n\nHe also said that the last person could have used the wrong size... really? I also bought those at a Firestone in San Diego, CA. Nice... talk bad about the people in your network.. makes sense.\n\nSo, I went to a different store where they were awesome. The reviews on this site are spot on for this location. Maybe Firestone should take note that the person answering their phone is an IDIOT and do better."
0,"This place sucks!! I am from Chicago just recently sentenced to the valley, but I will tell you what, the food at this place is as authentic as a three dollar bill!! I mean they were rude, unfriendly, and their food reflected there attitude..it sucked! Owners let me tell you something just because you order a sign that say's \""Chicago style\"" and hang it outside doesn't mean that it is and you may be able to trick your Phoenix natives but true chicago folk should know the difference. The reality is that if you were on Clark st. Competing for business you'd last about 10 minutes before you went dark. Your food is bland and nasty. Your employees seem like extras from the movie \""coma\"" and look like they could use an FMLA day, and your place is unkempt and dirty. I pray that a white castle opens nearby and steals your handful of customers, it would not be hard. Next time I will take video of the place and the food as well as the staff and their attitude and post it on you tube for those who have any doubt. Finally, try using real Vienna giardinara peppers not your own creation because your way off. By the way, I will post a link to view your county health inspection for all to see!! Have a \nwindy city day buckaroo."
0,I am from Chicago and I feel places should be care full about trying to title there places with anything CHICAGO in AZ. Those are mighty big shoes to fill! With that said this place is totally over rated...I mean We got a hot dog served as a sandwich....NOT IN CHICAGO!!! For this I will stick to what the Valley is  known for and go to In and Out or Lenny's!!! Quit it!!!!!!!

0,"You have 100% lost my family's business! I would love to give 0 stars!! So much for trying to support local businesses. I bought $75 worth of Gardenia's for our backyard wedding. The woman was very helpful and even carried them to my car {great service when you are spending $$$$}. Not even 24 hours after planting them, into a pot with the same normal soil I have planted all of my other plants and dwarf trees in, they were wilted and dying. My husband took one of them back to the nursery and upon arriving an employee says \""well how'd you kill that plant\"" in an extremely rude tone. My fianc\u00e9 was so shocked he wasn't sure how to respond. He went on to tell the lady and the manager what had happened and their reply was simply \""you're fault, too bad\"". I can't believe that after spending $75 at this place that they wouldn't even offer to help fix the problem. My fianc\u00e9 asked if they had a guarantee similar to Home Depot who will replace the plant within 90 days of purchase. In a rude tone again she replies \""nope guess you better go to Home Depot\"". Really?!? All of these business owners who are begging for customers and promoting local business, but won't do ANYTHING to help customers out. I am utterly disappointed and will NEVER go back again!!! \n\nI also can't believe the other negative comments on here and absolutely no response from the owners!!  I hope everyone on my Facebook reads and shares this post."
0,"I've been a loyal customer here for years and even highly recommend this nursery to every gardener I meet in person or talk to online forums. But today they have totally changed that.\n\nI went over there to buy some giant timber bamboo. They had some in 3gallon sizes so I picked up two of them. One was marked $72.95 and one was $58.95. I asked the lady that was at the front about why one is priced more than the other, and she said because one was probably bought from a different vendor even though they were the exact same size! So then I asked if she can sell them both to me for $58.95, and told me that she can't do that. I was shocked! Any other store or nursery would have jumped on the opportunity to create a loyal customer in this situation before I had even asked if they can honor the lower marked price! This is just terrible customer service! \n\nI ended up forking up the money for both anyway since I really needed them for my backyard. But this is definitely the last time I'm ever giving them my business and won't be recommending them again to any people."
0,"Me want to likey likey but no can do. \n\nI'm disappointed in this place and the 4-star rating it got. How misleading. I should have known this place was no good when I didn't see a single Thai person in the joint. Don't tell me they were all in the back cooking either. Its like walking into a Mexican restaurant and all the wait staff were Chinese. Well... now its sounding like ChinoBandito. Anway--- I digress.\n\nI came in for lunch and the menu was expansive! I've never seen so many words that begin with K.  I wanted to try something different than my regular pad thai, curry, tom yum but I couldn't decide and went off something from their lunch menu. I think it was Thai bbq chicken with spicy sauce. I figured, I can't go wrong with that. Not traditional Thai but I couldn't make up my mind about the others. \n\nWell, they ran out. I wasn't sure if they ran out of Thai bbq or chicken. Apparently its bbq so I settled for the sesame chicken. Bad idea. When in Thai- I should probably order Thai... but... um.. how do you screw up sesame chicken? The Panda Express has mastered it! Now you!\n\nIt will be a while before I try this place out again but I just didn't expect them to not be able to cook. I will start at a one-star for now and promise to order an authentic dish next time so I can be a better judge.\n\nI did have the thai milk tea and that was good. So one-star for good tea!"
0,"This restaurant is mediocre Chinese type at best... Ordered the green curry and a red curry... The green curry was a lumpy, floating in grease mess.  The red was equally as greasy and neither had coconut milk in them??  I can't believe this place is still in business.  We did call as soon as the containers were opened to ask exactly WTH they were, and they were quick to offer a refund to our card (something tells me they get many similar calls)... Not authentic thai by far."
0,"I used to love this place but I suspect it has changed owners in the past few years.\nwe had a friend in town who fondly remembered a meal he once had there so we decided to try it again.. It was a pretty bad experience with bad service-they were unprepared for a busy Friday night. What a disaster! The food is ok ( too salty) but the presentation, lack of care is evident both in service and overall experience.\nSomeone at Thai Lahna needs to regroup and reorganize. I hope they get their act together because it is a great location and has been good in the past."
0,"When we first sat down, one of our party asked the server if they had sparkling water.  She, unfortunately, spoke very little English.  Rather than getting someone to help her with the question she didn't understand, she shoved the drink menu in his face and walked away.  WOW!\n\nWe made our order, beginning with Chicken Satay.  The response - we are out of chicken satay.  So, we decided to go with beef satay.  A few minutes later, she came back and said they were out of that also.  So, we decided on the egg roll.  We were very upset to see the table next to us receive an order of chicken satay.  What is going on here?\n\nNow, unlike every other decent restaurant on the planet, dishes do not arrive together at this restaurant.  My Phaht Thai (allegedly one of their specialties) arrived first.  I was about to dig in when they came and grabbed it away from me claiming it was for another table.  Then I watched as the dish that was on MY table was given directly to another diner.  No wonder this restaurant has so many Health Department violations.\n\nFinally, all the dishes arrived (one at a time) and we were able to eat.  The Thai Lahna Special Fried Rice (with chicken, beef, pork and shrimp) was the best thing we had - good flavor and tasty.  Not particularly generous with the meats, but for $9.95, we weren't expecting much.  The Kai Phaht Khahnah (Chicken stir-fried with broccoli in a light oyster flavored sauce) was the next best thing - the oyster sauce was really pretty good.  Everything else made us wonder if the chef could even find Thailand on a map.  The Phaht Thai was horrible.  It was basically rubber bands masquerading as noodles and bean sprouts with a couple small pieces of chicken and 2 shrimp.  The Vegetable Curry was unlike any curry I've ever seen.  The \""sauce\"" was so thin and runny, it was more like a soup than a sauce.\n\nAll in all, this was a terrible restaurant that I would highly NOT recommend.  The only thing good is the price.  Certainly not the food and DEFINITELY not the service."
0,"I have been a customer of Thai Lahna for 12 years.  The service I have received on my last three visits has been so bad, I now pledge to never return.  I don't make this decision lightly because they have pretty good food.  Last night I placed an order to go and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I arrived 25 minutes later and was told it would be ready in another 10 minutes.  After waiting another 30 minutes (a total of 55 minutes since I had placed the order), I asked to see the manager who had been in the kitchen this whole time.  I was told she would be right out.  I stood there at the cash register another 10 minutes; no manager.  I asked again to see the manager (my food order was still not ready).  From the kitchen I heard \""Tell him I am too busy!\""  That was the last straw.  I asked for a refund on my credit card.  Instead of a refund, they charged my card a second time.  While she was fixing that, my order finally came out.  I told them to keep the food and give me my money, which they finally did.  This is a place where management has completely lost touch with what service is all about.  The girl at the counter was trying desperately to help me.  If the manager had put forth even a half effort, I might have been able to shrug it off.  Her total dismissal of the customer prompts me to take my business elsewhere.  I would encourage you to do likewise."
0,"We used to love this place and get take-out from there 2+ times a month but something happened over the last 12 months and their philosophy on customer service became non-existant. \n\nMy girlfriend is vegan and we ordered (take out) pad thai without meat/egg. It had chicken, no biggie... We called them up and they told her that it did not have chicken in it and that we would have to take it back to prove they had prepared it wrong. When she brought it back, they hadn't even started cooking the food because they believed that she was lying. We swore we wouldn't go back... \n\nToday we thought we'd give it another go. I ordered chicken pad thai and wanted to replace the shrimp with veggies. After putting the phone down for minutes, I could hear her talking to the manager. They wanted me to get veggie pad thai and add chicken (Another $2). She told me that this is because they pre-prepare their food. \n\nWe've decided to just get thai from Sa-Bai and they will get our 2+ times a month thai fix."
0,"We used to go here a lot and service was always slow, but the other night service was horrible as we waited 5 minutes to be seated and another 10 minutes before leaving as we had not even received water or any interaction with our server... Very disappointed as their food was always good, but going to try something else next time."
0,"I love thai food and go to various thai restaurants weekly. I went here recently. Waited 10 minutes to be seated. Then waited another ten minutes before leaving. I overheard a \""to go\"" customer complain about the wait. She had been there for an hour! Very dated decor is another negative."
0,"Is the food here Thai or Chinese?? Where is the basil, an important ingredient in Thai cuisine, in their dishes?? And the fish sauce, another crucial ingredient that marks Thai flavors?? This could pass for Americanized Chinese food though but I'll pass on this place next time..."
0,"Been to many thai places, service at this one is rude and slow, more expensive then most other places and small portions, forget it, dont easte your money!"
0,"WORST THAI we've ever had. Greasy, gross, packaged mix flavors. And not Thai--it's bad Chinese food pretending to be Thai food.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n1) Mii Krobb (me grob as it's called at other Thai restaurants). This sticky yumminess is supposed to be created in a wok and the sauce cooked *with* the noodles. The crap they gave us was a bunch of short, pre-made crunchy rice noodles with red-dye #40 sweet/sour sauce DRIZZLED on it. Seriously????? Gross. We took one bite and no more. \n\n2) Phaht Thai (pad Thai at other Thai places): so gross we didn't finish it! Very greasy and tasted like the sauce was made from a packaged mix.\n\n3) Sweet n Sour Tofu: the tofu was disgusting--it's fried first, then dipped in batter and fried again. I took one bite and didn't eat any more. Massively greasy blob of gross. Sauce says it's homemade on the menu but it looks nuclear red and tastes packaged.\n\n4) Spicy Thai rice: again--\u00fcber greasy and also not flavorful.\n\nWe will never go back."
0,"Please make 0 stars an option Yelp!  Avoid BOB and STEVE at the Thomas/44th St. location at all costs! Got suckered into a Serta Perfect Sleeper here, and within a MONTH the nearly $1500.00 bed was sagging!  We didn't want to deal with it and are moving and called Bedmart about the warranty weeks ago.  They looked up our file, and said that an inspector would \""be in touch\"" to set up an appointment to inspect the bed.  I waited a week and called back but they said not to worry.  I called a week later, and they said they would \""look into it.\""  Called again and they said they'd look into it again, but go no return call.  Finally, I called again today, for the 4th time, and STEVE told me there was no way it would happen until next year (after we move).  \n\nThat's annoying, and bad service, sure, but the reason I'm writing this is that they were patronizing, rude, and just plain insulting.  When I said I was dissatisfied at having to wait a month, after we move, just for the initial appointment, STEVE spoke to me like he was doing me a favor to look into why we had not been contacted!  In fact, he actually said this!  He was vague about the whole thing and when I asked a question about it, he actually said he could fax my request to the \""factory today\"" or \""THROW IT IN THE TRASH!\""  \n\nBTW, the \""manager\"" Bob said the factory is actually closed, so faxing it was not a favor at all!  Either way, are they really doing me a favor to follow up on the bad service for the crappy product they sell?  No!  \n\nI called back and asked to speak to the store manager, who answered the phone and identified himself as BOB.  Without even giving me a chance to say hello, he gruffly said he had heard the whole conversation and was not going to allow abuse.  I explained that I was the abused one, and that unless I had been on speaker phone, he had only heard one side of the conversation.  He did not like facts, and was even more rude after I pointed this out.  Needless to say, he clearly did not care about customer service, talked over me and cut me off, and spoke to me like he was Donald Trump and I was his peon contestant.  He proceeded to tell me that there would be no inspection anytime soon, since the Serta factory was closed until the New Year. \n\nBut he offered a hollow favor...if I wanted, he would call me Monday, Xmas Eve.  Umm, hello, but you just told me the factory who sets up the inspection appointments, is closed for 10 days...so what new information would you have in 2 days?  BOB did not want to be bothered with facts, and just wanted to shove it to me, whether it made sense or not, so he kept repeating and belaboring this.  \n\n\""When does the factory open, I asked?\""  But BOB, who either made up the whole thing about the closure, or knew only half the facts, or just wanted to keep shoving it to me, wouldn't tell me.  \""When do you want me to call you back, since you want everything on your schedule,\"" he asked.  \""How about right when the factory re-opens.\""  \""How about we just have them call you to set up the appointment,\"" he said.  Um, but \""I already did that weeks ago, and they didn't set it up,\"" I pointed out.  (That's why I called 4 times.)  \""Whenever the factory opens, the next day would be fine,\"" I said.  Then BOB decided, even though I told him this would not work, he would not follow up on why they hadn't called and just start over.  In other words, throw the follow-up request in the trash!  No, I said, I don't want that.  \""That's what I'm doing,\"" and then hung up on me\n\nWe went to BedMart looking for a latex mattress that was firm.  But Bed Mart on 44th/Thomas convinced us that this spring bed would be great and would not sag.  They lied.  Then we call about the warranty because the bed is crap and they know it, we don't hear from them repeatedly.  Someone else at the 44th/Thomas location was supposed to follow up with me two days ago but never did (on my 3rd call).  Clearly, they want to get a bed sold, period.  If you have a problem, which eventually you will, they will tell you it is someone else fault, not return calls, patronizingly tell you that they are doing you a favor to follow up on your lack of service, and basically treat you like you are crap because you have a problem with the bed.  To top it all off, they will hang up on you and be rude.  Stay away from this location, from BedMart generally, and from Bob and Steve!"
0,"Some one told above thr should be 0 star option ... me too requesting for the same .I too give 0 stars to bed mart customer service....the one at northen phoenix....that sales guy(black) is  dumb , arrogunt and rude...it seams he is board with his job and does not Enteratain customers who are genuine...not a window shoppers.....when I asked that guy about cheaper \"" pillowtop king matress\"" as he shown me some xyz matress for \"" $4000 bucks\"" and said this is the one we have if you want cheaper than this go to  \""GOOD WILL\"" I thought of calling manager but I did'nt have time to mess to with that shit guy...\nI went to sears\"" they will show you what customer service is I got one \""Simmons Black Brooklyn Firm Pillowtop King mattress\""...awsome matress.\n\nJust fire that guy or else you guys have to shut your buiness.\nI would not recomend this shop."
0,Bedmart is a sleazy company.   Dishonest...   Pricing is horrible.   They try to rip you off...then start dropping the price when you show them that they are as twice as expensive as Ashley Furniture and Mega Furniture!!!!  For the exact same Simmons sleep set!!!!   Keep 1 hand on your money if you deal with this sleazy company.
0,"I agree with the 0 star rating. Ordered box spring for Cal King and received Regular king box spring instead.  It's their mistake but would not admit and charging another delivery fee to come pick them up. It is insane! Nothing is written as return policy.  I thought about exchanging but now, I just want them out of my house! Never ever going back."
0,"I entered the store and was not acknowledged. The party/wedding rental area was abandoned, save for a price list and a variety of wedding vendor business cards on a table. Walked around, nobody came in. Not really my job as the customer to go LOOKING for a warm body. Found the prices on the list to be higher, item for item, than any other rental company in the valley. This place was a total waste of my limited time."
0,"Do NOT expect timely service....or really any service at all.  Thankfully, due to them not getting me a quote because \""they are busy\"", I found Andrews Party Rentals and went with them for an event.  Also, as noted in other reviews, keep in mind that they will not actually bring the items to the location, but actually only dump them off curbside.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm not keen on dragging tables, linens, heaters, ,etc off of the curb and into the actual location of the event.  I gave them 1 star only because you have to in order to post a review."
0,"Called 5 days in advance to reserve 36\"" trencher. Went to pick up Saturday at 6:30 am. I was told the trencher was broke and at another store across town.  Would have been nice to know ahead of time. Counter person could not explain why I wasn't called. I used to rent from these guys but now not sure why I would do it again. Very disapointed."
0,"After being on hold for 20 minutes and being transferred to several people, someone finally offered to help me. I needed to rent tables, chairs, and more for a birthday party. Long story short- they have horrible customer service and I was told there is no guarantee on time of delivery. They were unable to work with me and could not offer a solution. If you are looking for a party rental company- call Michael at rentaffordable.com in Tempe. A-z is awful."
0,"I am very sad to be writing such a poor review for Desert View Animal Hospital. I have been taking my dog there for almost 4 years and the previous Vet was wonderful. Sadly she retired. I have been to see Dr Derksen 4 times now and I am not impressed. \n\nThe first few times I noticed how prone she was to push medication on the problems with my dog. I, also, noticed a significant increase in the price of the medications. I have no problem spending as much money as needed to help my dog. However, I am a nurse and I know some of the choices of medications could have been different, saved me money and still treated my dog. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, because I really like Denise at the front desk. She is the only staff member I recognize now. All the vet techs I knew and really liked no longer work there. The other good thing about this office is they always schedule me in a timely manner. I got in right away today. I enjoy the convenience factor, but now I am wondering if that is because they do not have a lot of clients!!  \n\nThe last visit was my last straw. When I got to the office the vet tech did not even say hello to me. She was very nice to Finn, but did not make eye contact with me once. \n\nWhen Dr Derksen came to assess Finn she did a focused assessment. Once she was done she prescribed an antibiotic and was literally trying to walk out of the room when I was still asking questions. She then said try this antibiotic and if that does not work we will test him for valley fever. My dog is very important to me and telling me he may have valley fever, but we will wait and see is completely unacceptable to me. The prescription she gave me was doxycycline. I am a nurse and I know this medication is extremely, extremely  expensive. When I went to fill it at Walgreens they told me it was going to be 500.00. I call the office back during regular business hours to speak with Dr Derksen, but she had left for the day. I was then told by the front desk about a pharmacy that is significantly cheaper. Why would they not provide that information when I was at the office? \n\nI then spoke with a family member who is a vet tech in another state and she said Amoxicillin will treat Finn the exact same and it is 8 dollars. My family member also said that all the Vets she works with knows that doxycycline is very expensive right now and Dr Derksen should have known that. Whether she knew about the cost difference and did not care or she is incompetent, I do not care. I will not be going back to see her again."
0,I had an amazing experience with the new veterinarian. Her name is  Pamela Boyd.She is amazing.She took care of my dog like Doctor Lieb.I recommend this veterinary to everybody who wants a vet who cares about the animals
0,"It pains me to write this review. I'm hurting. But, I must yelp the truth. \n\nLet's start with the positive because I want more than anything to feel good about Kachina Dry Cleaners. \n\nThe location is good (40th st and Indian School) and I love the kitsch of their name and the sign. It's so old Arizona that I wanted so much to love them.\n\nThe woman who (I think) owns the joint is SO SWEET. I just love her. She's always happy and you leave thinking that your clothes will be in the tenderest of care. I also have made up this story that she and her husband moved out here in 1950 and opened up this dry cleaners on the outskirts of Phoenix and her husband has passed away, but she carries on the business. (Understand that I've made all of that up in my head.)\n\nThere are two OTHER women there though that are the most unpleasant creatures I've ever come into contact with. \n\nI've tried. Seriously. I've often pulled up, sat in the car and screwed up every bit of nice I had in my body to try and get them (especially one) to smile back. But, no. I get a downright grimace, no eye contact and barely an utterance. Oh, I've tried!!!! \n\nPlus, they always need at least three days. \n\nThen, they lost my clothes once. Someone ELSE had picked up my clothes. \n\nBut, I kept going back because I just love the owner. \n\nSo, I'm sorry, Kachina Dry Cleaners lady. I love you. And I want to support you. \n\nBut, I can't."
0,"I was referred to Kachina Dry Cleaners by the gang at Park Avenue DC (my regular dry cleaners) on Indian School Rd. \n\nWhat a sad experience! The lady at the counter was so rude that after I dropped off my \""special\"" items a pair of newly purchased thermal drapery panels - I almost went back in and asked for them back. In hindsight, I should have followed my instincts!\n\nSince the items had to be \""sent out\"" and were over two weeks in the processing - I called three days past the promised date to be screamed at by the lady who answered the telephone. She yelled, \""did anyone call you?\"" When I replied \""no\"" but the ETA was three days ago ...she slams  down the telephone, returning 5 minutes later - saying, \""yeah they're here\"" and hangs up!\n\nMy husband picked the drape up the next day - the cost was twice what was quoted...the items were not pressed, still having the original wrinkles from the packaging AND they have glue-like spots all over them. These drapes were brand new and in perfect conditions sans the packaging wrinkles...\n\nThe customer service staff is terrible - and the dry cleaning services are worse. Do not use this dry cleaner for anything that you don't mind throwing away!"
0,"I really really wanted to love this place.  It comes highly recommended by so many people here on yelp plus it is located in a great spot.   I liked Dr Ryan right away on our first visit.  I was hesitant about her because she is so young but she won me over by the end of our visit.  I decided the 30 minute wait must have been just an emergency issue and chalked it off.  \n\nToday was my second visit when I brought our other dog in for his shots.\nI had requested Dr Ryan because she had been so good the first time.  When I had to change our appointment a week out I decided to wait a few days longer just so we could get her.  Well, again I was tapping my toes in the exam room.  This time for almost an hour.  I finally told them I had to leave and the staff offered me Dr Dutton who came in right away and gave  the shots.  \n\nMost places, would give you a break on the visit fee or write it off after making you wait almost an hour.  Not them.  Full price.  The fact that people work hard to get to their appointments on time seems to escape some establishments.  Blue Cross is apparently one of them.  Only one person stuck their head in to say she was running late.  Other than that I could have been running a prostitution ring out of that room and no one would have noticed.\n\nSorry Blue Cross...burn me once shame on you...burn me twice and shame on me.  I won't be returning.  You have nice vets but there are lots of good vets in the valley that will actually value my time and business."
0,"To update my major disappointment in the staff.. so about three or so months after our kitty passed, we got a reminder post card for him that it was time for shots. I called and explained that he had died. Now I've just gotten ANOTHER  reminder card, 5 or 6 months later.  Thank you, pathetic staff, for not  having either the brains or the common sense to ensure I don't get these little cards to remind me about losing my pet.  I would give them a zero if I could."
0,"My 2nd experience with this restaurant yesterday was NOT positive! A few weeks ago we heard that Don Jose's had reopened so my daughter & I went running over to try it out. The salsa was just as good as it was before but the cheese enchiladas were disappointing. The original Don Jose's cheese enchiladas were the BEST in the Valley. When I ordered a Togo for my husband I was told that they weren't doing \""To Go's\"" yet and I would have to put it in the Styrofoam Togo box MYSELF. Yikes! The owner maybe didn't think that there was a liability to his customers by doing that themselves as the plates were steaming hot and I could have burned myself! I scooped the food from the STEAMING plate being very careful not to burn myself. BAD IDEA! \n\nAnd then there was yesterday. We attempted to go again with some friends of the family. We all \""grew up\"" with Don Jose (including my Mom who ate there once a week when she worked at Anita's back in the day) and thought this would be a great restaurant to meet at. My sister, daughter & I were 45 minutes early to the restaurant . To our SHOCK the owner would not allow us to be seated because our \""party\"" was not all there. There would be 7 of us and he would not hear of it! Hum...there were two big tables sitting there empty. I told the owner that were were tired (just having finished the Willo Home Tour in downtown Phoenix and saving our appetite for Don Jose's) and would be ordering our drinks and a cheese crisp to hold us over until the rest of the girls came. Nope...would not let us be seated and were told \""that we had to think of him!\"" \n\nWe then went outside and called the rest of our party and told them that the NEW OWNER would not let us sit down 45 minutes early so we would be going to \""Manuel's\"" on 28th Street & Indian School to meet. There we WERE SEATED, spent $85 for the 7 of us PLUS $20 for additional takeout. Sorry NEW OWNER...you missed out on our patronage yesterday and forever! That negative voice and attitude better change because negative publicity travels quickly and in these challenging economic times that is financial suicide... no matter how you try to imatate something that can NOT be reinvented! \n\nTake it from a \""wise Latina\"" your customers ALWAYS come first!"
0,"Ok, I have to try to take this star rating of this place down a little. For the sake of those that pick a place based on the ratings, I think I owe it to them. \n\nI have lived by this place for years and always wondered why they hadn't torn it down because it was empty, and then one night the place was packed. I was very intrigued. And then when my husband described his receptionist declaring the reopening like it was a state holiday (with tears in her eyes) I thought \""I gotta get me some of that!\"" \n\nWe decided to go on an off hour on a Saturday and there was still a 45 minute wait. I liked the old inside, the no need to upgrade attitude was just my style. All of the anxiously waiting people and being right near the kitchen while waiting...I was screaming on the inside with excitement for the sure pleasure my taste buds were about to be hit with....and then we were seated. \n\nFirst, no alcohol. OK, this is a newly reopened place and may not have their license yet (darn I wanted a margarita!), oh well diet coke it is. They bring out a 6 oz cup of drink, a little syrup container of salsa (cute!) and a bowl of chips. I finished the drink in two sips, the salsa had no flavor, and I avoided the chips after the drink because I think the server was a blackbelt in avoiding interaction once the order was placed. \n\nThe food came (and finally a refill, which I should have asked for no ice because the ignoring annoyed me the most) and we began to chow down. My husband got the chili relleno and I got the cheese enchiladas. My first bite I thought \""hmmm this reminds me of that frozen crap my mom used to try to pass off on me\"" and I looked across the table to see my husband eyeing my food and his food barely touched. Now, my husband is an ex football player with a huge appetite that used to eat oysters out of a can in college, so that tells you something about his meal. Mine was edible and we shared with an overwhelming violated feeling . \n\nSurprisingly the server was very quick with the bill. I tried to talk my husband into not tipping but he is a gentleman. When I got home I began listing friends that I trusted their opinions to go and tell me that we are absolutely crazy (one of which likes Spam) and should give it another shot. The overall rating...bland, cheap and the salsa scared one of them (she described it like ketchup). \n\nBottom line, don't be fooled like me. The place is no good and should have stayed closed (and I really wanted to like it!)."

Save your money, T Bell is an upgrade compared to this joint."
0,"Good serves. But got bad serves from the owner (cashier). We had no idea it was Cash Only. We ate there before, but had no problems. Until we were ready to pay, he told us Cash Only & said there's an ATM machine. Which we had no problem using, because we didn't feel right leaving a good restaurant without paying. So after getting the money, he got mad because we didn't leave a TIP. We are good citizen and know hardship when it comes to having no money or not having enough money. So we always leave a TIP when we eat out, just that we had no money at that time, we only had a debit card. He should've asked nicely to leave a TIP. But he took $6 from us and said NEVER COME BACK!! Who does and says that??"
0,"Absolutely the worst service I have even had in my entire life.  I recently moved here from out of state and was referred to Dr. O'Clair by a coworker.  On my way to the appointment, my GPS took me in a round about way and I knew I would be late so I called ahead. The staff told me that it was not a problem.  I finally got to the office at 4:15 and was asked to sit down. After waiting for another 10 minutes, I was called up to the desk and told that I was MORE than 15 minutes late and had to reschedule my appointment. My appointment was at 4:00, so apparently they cannot tell time.  I explained that I called ahead, got lost and that I was a student who also worked part time so it was very hard for me to reschedule and  the doctor actually refused to see me. The staff was incredibly rude and should have told me not to come in the first place. I left the office in tears out of frustration and embarrassment from the way I was treated. It is clear that Dr. O'Clair has no respect for her patients...as if we have never waited 15 minutes for a doctor before."
0,"Haven't been to the doctor in 5 or 6 years, so I thought I would go and get checked out.  My insurance covers preventative care 100% and I have a large deductible for sick visits.  I went, had no health complaints, and the nurse told me I was the healthiest person she had seen all day.\n\nThe practice then billed a sick visit code to my insurance, which applied $130 to my deductible.  I called the billing number, explained the situation, and asked that they bill the prevantative visit code to my insurance.  The billing person told me the doctors pick the code, not the billing people, but he would check with the doctor and call me back the next day.\n\nHe never called.  I left two voicemails for the billing guy, which he never returned.\n\nI appealed to my insurance, who denied because the doctor used a sick visit code.\n\nSooo, my doctor is still sending me bills for the prevantative visit that is covered 100% by my insurance.  The office is yet to explain the \""problem of medium to high severity\"" described is the CPT code.  The only diagnosis billed is V70.0, adult well visit.\n\nThis post is probably more about the billing dept, but still makes me mad."
0,"They charge an annual administrative fee that is not covered by insurance.  Basically, it's like a credit card annual fee.  This year 2012 it's $60.  I'm not one to pay annual fees at my bank, on credit cards, and definitely don't want to start at my doctors office :(  It's up to you though."
0,"i've been seeing dr. goldman for more than 10 yrs..  very happy with him and his staff.  about a yr or so ago, i stopped going to him.  he charged an administrative fee of yearly $35 or something ridiculous for seeing him for paperwork, etc. processing.  Really?  even couldn't be grandfathered in after i complained for being a long standing patient.  he moved from 40th & bell to camelback and i continued to see him.  i didn't ask him for more gas??!!!  i continued to make the much longer trip & nvr complained.  this took the cake.  a drs. office charging an adm fee?  argh! i have since gotten a very nice doctor around the corner i'm happy with but decided since apparently i'm still good enough for their email list and had a yelp link, i'd give my 2 cents worth!!"
0,"Let me preface this review:\n\nI live a healthy lifestyle, exercise regularly, don't smoke and rarely drink.  \n\nI rarely go to the doctor and visiting this practice reminded me why. I came in because I've been having trouble sleeping. I made an appointment with KATE MONTGOMERY , RN, CS, FNP.\n\nAll I can say is WOW, I've never felt so judged in my life! She was down right rude! Canceled all my remaining appointments They also charge some BS annual fee not covered by insurance. \n\nI will finding another Doctor that is not so judgmental. If I were you, I would pass on this facility."
0,"Hi All, \nJust an update, 2/23/2013- I changed Drs because of the admin fee and the office is still trying to charge another \""administration fee\"".  Soooo that pretty much means there is a bi-annual admin fee charged.  Was forced to pay the first fee because I was a patient, trying to get the most recent fee charged last month removed since I'm not their patient- patient beware, it's like a bad late night infomercial, \""How do I cancel???!\""  grrrrr"
0,"Unfortunately, this administrative fee will prevent me from ever going back.  It's sad b/c I feel the care was really great."
0,"Well the administration fee is true and now I will not be going back.  You have got to be kidding me.  Like someone stated earlier, I pay a copay every time I go in there and they bill my insurance for anything additional they do.  This is total BS.  I thought I was going to the doctor not a gym.  The Doctors are good there, but it is soooo slow.  If you have a 10am appointment, don't expect to get in before at least 10:30am.\n\nI called and I was told this fee was to offset the cost of the Lab, EMR and Patient Portal cost.  I'm not sure what Lab they are referring to because every time I have blood drawn they send it off to some place called LabCorp.  Isn't this the cost of doing business?  So should I start deducting a set amount for the employees that work for me for the cost of internet and the payroll system we use?  I don't think so."
0,"I've been a patient of Dr. Wyse for several years. I have always booked my appointments first thing in the morning to avoid waiting in the 'little white room' too long. After the third time of waiting over an hour after arriving at 7:30 in the morning and nothing more than a \""i'm very booked\"" as an apology, I've decided it's best to move on and find a new family doctor. \n\nThere are some rare services or individuals that are worth the extra wait. This, unfortunately, is not one of them. I find it very arrogant when anyone feels their time is more important than yours."
0,"I have used yelp to find doctors in the past. I found a wonderful doctor through Yelp who unfortunately closed his practice. :(  I can't say strongly enough, use this Yelp review and find another doctor.  I wish I had read the reviews on this practice before I went for my first appointment. It would have saved me a lot of unnecessary stress."
0,"It took me several years to find a family doctor that I could truly trust. I found Dr. Goldman about 2.5 years ago after having a severe allergic reaction and he was able to help me pin-point the cause and put me on a path to recovery.  Dr. Goldman and his nurse Maddie are truly great!\nI am saddened to say I am now leaving this practice because of a silly Admin fee they have now introduced along with a calling list they put their patients on to receive recorded advertising messages of medical services they provide. Really, you want me to pay $49 a month so you can send me infomercial voicemails to spend more money at your practice?!?!  I am generally a healthy person and maybe visit the doctor once or twice a year.  They already bill my insurance up the wazoo and also charge me a co-pay every visit, is that not enough?   Maybe if this doctors office was a luxurious spa, with outstanding customer service, would I consider spending a yearly fee."
0,"This store NEVER has what I'm looking for (hiking pants, baseball cap, sports jersey, any type of college or professional team gear (I think they just have ASU stuff)etc.), everything looks picked over as if I have just missed the motherload of all sales on sporting schtuff. \n\nI have tried to give them business on 4 separate occasions and always leave empty handed.  \n\nAnother turnoff is that the people lurking around the inside and outside of the store kinda creep me out. It's almost like a Cabela's (they sell firearms, hunting knives, and whatnot) but lame.  Sorry, but I won't be back."
0,This place might well be cited for disturbing the peace. On week-end mornings one can often hear the throbbing bass beat inside of other nearby businesses and even out in the parking lot.  The ambience reminds me of a low-rider with one of those souped-up stereos that you can feel coming down the road long before you can hear it. Seems like I've been front and center at punk rock shows that had less prominent bass lines than this place has on Sunday mornings.
0,"Food poisoning alert. There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this un-fine dining establishment. First off, the cook looks like somebody off the street, at least wear an apron buddy. \n   Now we are watching the games there and it's about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started. Five minutes later, I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended. Lastly, another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins. This place is full of local drunks, but a good watering hole (yeah literally). Go here to drink and stay away from all food. Also, it was 8 bucks for one order of skins. Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches. It's another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene. Bad choice."
0,"Denny's + a local dive bar = The Ole Brass Rail\nThis place is nasty dog. Only had 1 beer here, but the poor ventilation left me smelling like greasy hash browns.  Was misled by the sign that indicated that this was a sports bar.   It's not, it's a sketchy dive bar in a sketchy area that for some reason specializes in breakfast food.  If you eat anything here, say your prayers before and after you eat."
0,"First off let me tell you that my husband and I have been making this a regular stop about 8-10 times a month. When we have to go to a couple stores and we we stop there first to have a meal because it is across the street.  One I had worked till 3:30am and had not woken till about 10:30 am and When my husband said we had to go to a couple stores I suggested a stop for something to eat at what had been one of my favorite places. Good food, mostly nice service friendly atmosphere and seemingly clean. My husband always orders for me so he asked what I wanted. I told him I would like coffee with my food because I was cold  then I might have something after eating. I ate my taco's my husband ate his breakfast.  When the second person came around he asked if he could get us anything else. I asked for a rum and coke. he said something to the effect of he wasn't serving anymore drinks that day. We actually thought he was joking then he brought us the bill. I asked him again for a drink and he said I looked drunk. Tired maybe but hadn't had anything to drink that day. I paid my check and told him that we would not be back. He said, \"" who cares\"". He heard my husband order coffee from the other barmaid with my meal. My husband always orders for me. Point is that although they stay busy most times they just lost over $200+ a month because of his behavior. Maybe they should think to ask the person they took over for what the story was. Did my shopping and now I will go spend my money somewhere else."
0,"Okay, here's the scoop. I went into Pruitt's in January, hot little Visa card in hand, ISO of a nice, big comfy sectional that they could deliver in two weeks (I had just moved into a new house). Salesperson Elaida (run if she comes up to you ... and: she has no last name on her card, I should have known ...) said 'No problem, they tell us we have to say three weeks, but it will be there in two!\"" Okay, sounds good. More than two but less than four grand later, said couch was paid for and supposedly on its way to my new home. (I think you know the rest, but I'll continue.) Two weeks later. Nothing. Three, nothing. I call. Oh, it had to be shipped. It will be there right away! Shipped? I call in mid-February. 'They ran out of fabric ... it will be there the first week of March!' They're making it? She said it was in stock. Well gang, it's the first week of March, so I call again today. Now it's looking like the end of March AT BEST because it is being MADE overseas (so much for the assurance that this was a stock item ... and it's being made in Taiwan). Long story short, Pruitt's kept my $$$ for 7 weeks ... did nothing ... never called ... and lied when I called them ... repeatedly. So I made them give me my money back this morning. Save yourself time and trouble!! I didn't even buy one of the (many) cheap couches they have and they still treated me this way. Shop elsewhere! Oh ... and if you know somewhere I can buy a nice, big comfy sectional ... let me know."
0,"Furniture is great and have used Pruitt's for over 10 years. We have purchased carpet twice from them and the first time we had shipping and production issues and had to be on cement floors for a month and finally I had to suggest us changing to a different color as it took that long for them to let me know what the issue was. We purchased carpet almost two years ago from them again on another home and I have had them out 3 times to re-stretch it, the manufacturer came out and said he was going to replace some of it as it seems it was a bad roll but that has never happened and no one ever follows-up I have to call every month to get an update. Now we are waiting on an independent inspector who was suppose to call us three weeks ago and still no word from them or Pruitts. Buy the furniture but not the carpet..."
0,I have been loyal to Pruitt's  for years but after this last ordeal will not shop there any longer.   I purchased a recliner that was a floor model and was wobbly.   I wa promised that it would be fixed before delivery' but it was delivered broken.    Then I scheduled a technician to come out and fix it.   He ended up taking it back to fix it and I cannot get it delivered because I work and cannot be home for delivery on their schedule.   They said if I return it they would charge a 20% restocking fee.   So I still do not have my recliner.\nWorst customer service ever.
0,"I purchased a $2500 sectional from them. It was beautiful and I was in love the minutes I saw the carmel colored beauty. Within six months a peice of the frame came loose and pertruded through the fabric in the back. I called them and they sent someonne out to repair it. within  6 months it was broken again. They refused to fix it stating that it was outside of the year. I understand that placed have to set a time limit, but the fact that it broke twice in such a short time is ridiculous! I still have furniture to buy for my home and they are not on the list of companies that I would ever do business with again. In my opinion a $75-$100 repair should be handled as a courtesy for my inconvenience but they would rather lose the business. I have purchased the sectional and a matress for one of my guest bedrooms, but nothing again!"
0,"No customer service! I have spent since September waiting for a replacement part on a sofa where the technician from Pruitt's said \""the leather is bad\"". I have been given the run around ever since. They've given me delivery dates of October, then beginning of December, then January. Here it is February and they claim to know nothing. They refused to provide me with the manufacturer phone number, owners number or email address. They claimed they don't have that information! Ha! I looked up the manufacturer myself and called them... Had the answer is 5 minutes that I've been waiting on for over a week. These people are uninterested in helping once they have your money. We've purchased lots of items from them in the last 10 years and their quality has gone way down as has their respect for the people who spend money there. Never again!! Please consider purchasing from another store who will care to treat their long time or any  customers well."
0,"I bought a sofa yesterday - but it wasn't from Pruitts.  I do thank them for having a large selection and being the only store I went to that had a sofa I wanted though.  Helped me to be able to find it online, shipped to my door for less than their price.\n\nThat said, if one of the seemingly 10,000 sales people there would have shown even the slightest interest in making the sale, I would have bought it there and been done.\n\nInstead we walked about 30% of the way through the first floor without anyone saying a word.  I stopped and asked a sales lady (and I am 110% positive she worked there as she was JUST helping someone else) if upstairs was more sofas.  She ignored me.  Flat out ignored.  Thinking perhaps she didn't hear, my husband said something to her about being too busy to acknowledge, and STILL she ignored us.  So we wandered up there on our own.\n\nAbout 80% of the way though the store, and after making eye contact with at least a dozen other sales people and smiling as I normally do, one finally decided to ask if we needed any help.  I said we were looking for small love-seats.  He pointed us to the direction of the entrance, where we had been, and said that was it.\n\nWell, so we went back to the entrance to the one sofa I initially saw and liked.   I was sitting on it, laying on it, taking pictures to send to a designer friend, measuring, etc in the same room about 10 feet away from FOUR sales men and not a single one asked if we needed help, had questions, etc.\n\nThere was also I rug I was keen on, except for the colors.  This was Hubby's conversation with the sales man closest to him:\nHubby: Hey, do you work here?\nSales Guy:  Yes\nH:  I have a question about this rug\nS:  Oh, we work in rooms.  I don't work in this room.  I don't know anything about it\nH:  OK, so you can't help me then?\nS:  Nope. \nAnd he walked away.  No offer of getting someone to help, or asking what the question was, NOTHING.\n\nSo - we walked out.  And I decided even if I couldn't find that sofa elsewhere, I wasn't buying it there.  And I won't be back."
0,"I'm a small business owner who is in a constant need of recliners. They were unwilling to help me find a good time for delivery, I'm also a mom, it's hard to find child care , or be on call for an entire day. I set my delivery up for a Saturday. I asked if there were any chance i could have a window of time allotted, even 4 hours. They said no and suggested I cancel my order. I said no no, I want my chairs please deliver them and I'll deal with whatever happens it'll be ok. So I called this am to ask when they'd come, she said you cancelled your order. I said , no I didn't cancel, there must be a miscommunication, She said no there's no miscommunication. I don't know where I come from the customer is always right. I should've cancelled my order there. But still i naively thought its ok, I'll get my chairs... It's 10pm. I have a child to get home to. What do they expect?  A person to wait and wait and wait and to be treated like dirt in the mean time. Next time ill pay more just to be treated like a human whose money means something real. Thanks Pam \n\n\nAs I write this it's 10pm on Saturday, my order is still not here."

0,"we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22..\nI have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon. The first time my mother went to pick up our order, she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress. The second time we ordered, I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu. I did not have my coupon handy, and when I was able to read it, it says specifically, \""Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree. Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree. Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES, BOWLS, SALADS, DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS.\"" So why, on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon, thus spending a small fortune on food, TWICE?!?!? Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future."
0,Was at one of your Phoenix locations and witness the most disgusting thing!!! Food was brought for take out and fell over the counter the employee scrapped it back with the lid and put it back in the bowel and set it aside ready for the customer to pick up. Will never eat there again!!!
0,"I don't consider myself a connoisseur of Asian cuisine, especially streamlined Asian-American cuisine that's one step above fast food, but I will say this. The caramel chicken takeout dish comes with a separate small container for the vegetable slaw that goes on top. There is absolutely no excuse for a piece of broken eggshell the size of a thumbnail finding its way into the slaw container. Not to mention there was raw egg goop still attached to it. This has been one of several issues I've recently had with this location's food and service. The previous two times, the pad thai I ordered contained NO tofu whatsoever, when I know that's part of the Pei Wei pad thai recipe, having ordered the exact same dish at other, more competent locations. As if to add insult to injury, when I called and spoke to the manager about the aforementioned eggshell incident, he claimed over the phone that he would refund what I paid for that meal and that the money would go back onto my credit card. Guess what never happened. And... Guess who's never going back to this sucktastic poophole ever again. Thanks a lot for your disgusting food preparation and deceitful management. If someone from Pei Wei company corporate is reading this, please do yourself and your customers a favor and FIRE the manager running this joint."
0,"Compared to other Pei Wei locations across the valley, this location is by far the worst. \n\nI've gotten takeout for lunch about five times, and each time has been worse than the last. Even after two of my coworkers ended up with violent food poisoning after eating the food here, it took finding an EGGSHELL with bits of raw egg in my Caramel Chicken to realize that something was seriously wrong with this joint. Not only was the food extraordinarily disgusting, as an added bonus, it contains pieces of kitchen garbage. \n\nWhen I called the manager to complain, he offered me a refund to my credit card over the phone, which never actually happened. \n\nThanks for the lies. Thanks for the disgusting food. And thanks for asking Yelp to take down my previous review."
0,"I used to like Pei Wei but something about their meat tastes different.  It does not taste right.  I tried it a few more times but haven't been back since and will definitely steer clear.  I told a manager right away and he made a new plate, but the new meat tasted just as strange.  I told him and the sweet fellow apologized although it was out of his control.  \n\n I hope this is not another case of quality suffering because of quantity.  Is it easier to buy from sloppy, poorly regulated slaughter houses and inject meat pieces with filler - creating a mystery meat that the masses will most likely still enjoy as long as there's a distracting sauce or glaze?"
0,My 12 year old daughter and I just returned from this location and we both got very sick.  She had the orange chicken and me the Pad Thai w chicken.  Gross
0,Won't come back here... These people are incompetent... Over two weeks for alterations that still haven't been done.. Made me wait Despite coming before a regular.... I'll give one star because at least the lady was nice
0,Worst service! Ordered a hot fudge banana shake and instead got a Sunday. Instead of being nice about it the girl told me I ordered it wrong but she would remake it for me.
0,"This location is convenient and that is why I gave it 1 star. Honestly every time I go here my order is wrong. I have come to the point where I make them repeat it back to me and they still mess the order up. I've even Gone to the point at the window to ask them if my order is correct they say \""yes of course\"" I will get it and check it and it's wrong. I understand it gets busy but that doesn't mean serve your customer whatever the hell you want. I have allergies to foods and if it wasn't for me checking everything I eat DQ may have landed me in the ER more then once."
0,"Terrible customer service! \n\nI was in the market for two Electra cruisers (total cost w/accessories $1000). Since I lived down the street I thought it would be convenient to have a bike shop so close by. On three separate occasions, I went in the Bike Barn:\n\n1.  Monday afternoon - was in the store over 20 minutes - nobody every spoke to me or offered any assistance.\n\n2.  Thursday afternoon - a young gentlemen approached me, started asking some questions about the cruisers, he pulled out his cell phone and started sending a text message\n\n3.  Sat morning - was approached by a middle aged woman, told her I was interested in the Electra's - pointed me to the opposite side of the store and then walked off.\n\nGreat location - crappy customer service."
0,"Wow. \nI called ahead to ask a few questions about what was going on with our bikes (we know how to fix up bikes for the most part but don't have a bunch of bicycle tools for when all the gear for your head tube is being funny, or your back hub is messed up). He told us to bring our bikes in for a free estimate and they'd more than likely be able to fix it without too much of a charge. I thought, hurray!\n\nMy girlfriend and I travelled by bus to get to this place (as we only have bikes). It took us about an hour (on a Sunday). We get there, he looks our bikes over, and says that it's going to cost $10 for a chain (reasonable) and $15 to put it on. Uhhhh, WHAT? You're telling me that you're going to charge me more than the actual chain to put it on, when if I had brought my little chain tool with me it would literally take me no more than five minutes to put the chain on? That was absolute BS.\n\nHe also said he was going to charge $25 to put a front brake on. Please tell me you are joking about that, too. I checked my watch to make sure it wasn't April 1st.\n\nThen after my girlfriend walked outside, I find out that they aren't even going to fix it today (when it in total would have taken them no more than 10 minutes). The hipsters response was, \""Uh, well I don't have the time to do it today. It's very labor intensive work.\"" It wasn't. At all. If I had the right bike tools it would have taken me about four seconds to rearrange the bolts for the front wheel.\n\nThey're rude. They're pretentious. And they think that I have no knowledge of bikes (simply because I brought the bicycle in), so they're incredible condescending. Not to mention up-charging the hell out of whatever they feel like.\n\nDon't go there. Ever.\n\nFind somewhere else to go.\n\nIf you really want an excellent deal and maybe learn a few things in the process, take your bike to Doug at Bikes International in Mesa. It's out of his home, but he took several classes on bicycle mechanics, worked in several bike shops, and now teaches classes on bicycle mechanics. For more info email him at bikesintl@netzero.com"
0,"Worst Bike Shop EVER!\nAfter being assured by the staff at \""Bike Barn\"" in Phoenix that they do ship recumbents and could pack ship the Bacchetta Strada plus some extra components to me for $60 plus shipping via Fed Ex to me here in San Francisco, I bought a bike from someone on Craigslist .  I then never heard from Bike Barn after they got my bike delivered to them with my information.  I called two days later and the Manager then told me that the guy who confirmed with me was new and they don't really do that for $60, it should be more, but they would figure something out when they get a box, but acted like they were gonna charge me more than they quoted.  Then the ASS. Manager called me a day later and said they were going to pack it all in a huge 7foot box and had determined with FedEx that it was gonna cost me $441 to San Francisco!  They gave me some attitude when I said that was utterly ridiculous, given that I shipped a trike from Florida to San Francisco for $150 total.  I could fly there, pick it up and fly it back for less!  They were unsympathetic and downright unhelpful when I suggested they pack it in two boxes and they just actually suggested I ship it via truck!  I then called Sun Cyclery (Bike Barn got a box from them) as I was clearly SOL with the knuckleheads at BB.\n\nThe difference in attitude and service was dramatic and amazing!  Joe at Sun Cyclery was friendly, polite and knowledgeable and said he had just shipped something similar to my bike for a LOT less than $441!  He explained that Bike Barn SHOULD KNOW BETTER than to ship it all in one gigantic box and that two boxes were required to keep it within FedEx shipping Requirements.  Joe went over and picked up the bike (after Bike Barn refused to drive it the 6 mi.)  He packed it and shipped it four days earlier than promised and for $227 total!  Not $501 total!\n\nJoe packed it securely using old inner tubes, which were inflated inside the box to keep it all snug and secure!  Creative attention to detail, friendly, polite and platinum quality service is what you get from Sun.  Avoid Bike Barn at all costs!  Go to Sun!"

0,"Customer service is shocking and I don't know how they've stayed in business.  I'm just getting into cycling for the first time since I was a kid, and should have checked this site before purchasing at the Bike Barn.  When I told the salesman that I was 'new' to modern cycling, his response was 'go borrow somebody else's bike'.  Way to get people into cycling and keep customers, eh?  I had already made the trip out there and purchased although shouldn't have - I truly wish another shop got my money.  He never offered to fit (which I later realized was very important)  or even ask my height, riding style, etc which has cost me some pretty stiff joints and a trip to the chiropractor.  I had to ask all the questions - he could care less.  When he was putting on some add-ons, I asked if I could watch and his response was to turn his back to me and completely covered what he was doing.   I'm sorry, Mr. Personality - I am new, trying to learn and tried to be a customer!  \n\nOn my first ride I realized that the brakes were not assembled correctly and had to take it to another shop to get them fixed - I couldn't stomach taking it back even though it was brand new.  I just took it in for its 'free tune up' and they were jerks then, too.  I picked it up (or rescued it, rather) tonight and they man who returned it was nice - I'll give him that, but short of Bike Barn being the only bunker during a nuclear fallout, I'll never return.   Better customer service can be found at the motor vehicle division in August.  They say that a person will tell 50 people about a bad experience, and here it is, as seen on Yahoo and Facebook as well.    Maybe they only like seasoned riders.  If you're not, save yourself the high blood pressure and go to any other store."
0,Brought my bike in to get it repaired and left with both tires flat told that they are dry rotted even though they are less than 2 months old.  I don't believe that my bike was stored in the correct way.  I recommend fixing your bike yourself if you have the tools or the ability which I should have done in the first place I guess
0,"I had experienced first hand why it's not a good idea to slide down a banister drunk, and cracked the crystal on my favorite watch. After finally getting around to getting it fixed, I contacted The Watch Repair Company:\n\n12/12/09: I call the shop asking about a price quote and ETA on when it would be fixed. I'm told it would be $20, and it would be finished Wednesday (12/16/09).\n\n12/23/09: Almost a week after I was told the watch would be fixed I call the shop. I am told that the watch is not finished but it would be the next day (12/24/09, a.k.a. Christmas Eve). Surprised that he would work on Christmas Eve, I am told the watch would be ready between 1-2pm. \n\n12/24/09 3:01 PM: I call the shop, and am told that he just needs to get the watch put back together but it would be ready by 4:30. Frustrated I let him know I would be there at that time.\n\nAfter The Watch Repair Company had fallen through twice, I was starting to get pretty frustrated with their complete lack of contact or clarity on when my watch would be fixed. The only guy that runs this place is almost completely impossible to understand, mumbling  in sort of a primitive way. No matter, I was especially excited to have my watch back.\n\n12/24/09 4:30 PM: I walk into the shop and let him know I am there to pick up my watch. He pulls it out of a sleeve mumbling \""I got it cleared on out, I can give you a call when the crystal comes in,\"" and hands me the same exact thing I had given him two weeks ago. The crystal was still cracked. After all that, nothing had been done. I am completely speechless, grab the watch, and head for the door. He mumbles \""There's no charge on that.\""\n\nI still have no Idea what to say. What a complete waste of time. I have absolutely no idea how this place is still in business."
0,SO this is another request for a half star system on yelp or negative star on yelp for places like this.\n\nOK...so I ordered pizza 11:28p.m.\nTold me it would be there in 35 minutes that equals 12:03a.m.\n\nActual delivery 12:38a.m.\n\nAN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI got bone out Barbecue Wings and Apple Pies! I know not the healthiest food in the world but fuck I was hungry and there commercial came on. The unfortunate part about those two items is that they were both cold.\n\nI know for a fact that if your pizza and order from Pizza Hut shows up 5 minutes after it promised time it is free. I asked for my free stuff from the manager on duty (GERALDO) aka deuschbag! He was like that is not a policy but I know it is in any event pizza hut is the most expensive pizza delivery place so I payed like $24.00 for cold food.\n\nDid you know that the drivers only get .97 cents out of that $2.50 delivery fee...sucks for them I usually tip fat...this guy got my change!!!\n\nThis sucked I am going to see if I can get another place to deliver to me.!!
0,"We were on hold for OVER 10 minutes and then hung up on us. By the time we got to the place, they hung up on us!! Went in and they said a 50 minute wait AND said that there would be a $1 PER TOPPING charge which is NOT what it said on the online special!! This place is a rip off!!"
0,Disappointed AGAIN! 3rd time in a row they have been 10 mins late and pizza has been warm. Not like the warm out of the oven but warm like sitting in a car. I used to order frequently but that will stop after these last visits.  Amazing that it takes an hour to deliver and I live 5 mins away.

He called me in to talk to me and tell me what needed to be fixed on the car, basically the upsell and I am okay with that because I generally do my own work and don't pay 15.00 for an air filter I can get at target for 1/5 of their price but I do understand what they are doing. Again I tried to present the coupon and he told me to hold on to. When he was done he gave me the total and it was $40.04, far from the $25.95 I was expecting. When I questioned him his reply was \"" I asked you if you wanted Valvoline oil and you said yes\"" I don't remember him asking him but here is what they did to me and you need to watch out if you come in with a coupon. Even though he knew I had the coupon which stipulated it had to be Shell oil he deliberately asked me if I wanted Valvoline oil. If he had asked me, \"" the coupon is for Shell oil, would you prefer valvoline\"" then I would have had the option to choose, not be duped into accepting something that was not part of the coupon. This is how they got around honoring the coupon. Very unethical way to do business and I intend on reaching out to Jiffy Lube corporate and see what their answer is. \n\nThis is the second time I used jiffy lube and both times have been a bad experience and looking at reviews, I guess I am not the only one who questions their practices. Obviously I won't be coming back here and I suggest you don't go there either."
0,"The man that did my locks was extremely unpleasant.   He acted like he did not want to be there and talked to me like I was stupid.  I can't stand that people that are that mean n miserable are dealing with the public.   There was another man that I got the time before who was very personable and really sweet.  So he's great.  But this guy working nights that's on call ,,, you don't want to get him."
0,"We live about 200 miles from Phoenix and do not have a Fertility Center in our area. My wife and I went to Dr. Gounala after a very bad experience with another fertility center in Phoenix. She and her staff seemed very caring and nice, she recommended that we have IVF with ICSI to improve our chances of conceiving. We were prepared to do this and everything seemed to be on course until they found that my Health Insurance would pay for some of the tests (Semen Analysis, Blood Work etc..) related to infertility. Then things changed. Dr. Gounala said that there were many \""PROBLEMS\"" we had to make trips to Phoenix about once or twice a week for a Semen Analysis or Blood Work? this went on for almost a 2 year period!! Before we were just about ready to give up we were refferred to a doctor in Tucson (which is about 300 miles from where we live) We scheduled an appointment and from the time we met with him until we were pregnant was a total of 4 MONTHS. He did not do a single semen analysis and very few tests on my wife. we now have a beautiful 2 month old baby girl... And did I mention the price was 50% of what SW fertility was going to charge us?? I would be very cautious of these fertility centers they are fully aware how despirate couples can be and how limited their options are....I have experienced it so I know they will use this to their advantage to bleed you dry!! IVF is enough of an emotional rollercoaster to go through with out having to worry about an unethical practice stringing you along to make some additional money...."
0,"I will keep this short and sweet. I never even met the doctor. The office staff was the rudest experience i have ever had. I have called for the past month trying to get results with no luck. No one returns my calls and the girls on the phone are rude and not friendly at all. The doctor may be good but for me, it's about the whole experience and this was an awful one!!!!!"
0,Closed!
0,"As Megan D. said, the staff will make you feel like a criminal. I went in the store with my girlfriend and the first thing we asked the manager was if we could take pictures. We told her if it was an issue we would leave our cameras in the car. She told us it was fine and we were there for an hour snapping away and having a grand time. As we made our way to the front she tells me that I am clogging the aisle and that she needs to see my ID. She told me that security told her to take it. I then asked where the security people are located and she said that they had left. Further into the conversation she said that the manager told her to take it. I asked who the manager was and she said there was no manager and proceeded to say security had asked for it. I called her out on the inconsistency of the story and she said she never said that she told me that a manager asked her to take the information. One of the employees finally took me to the side while she was helping a customer and told me that she was the manager and was concerned I was casing the place to later rob it. She accused me of taking pictures of the security system and being too detailed with my shots. I'm a photographer and all I was looking for was nice pictures. I insisted that she watch as I deleted all photos that I took, but she said all she needed was my information. Needless to say, I will not be coming back to this antique store. The items are priced too high and many things are not even antiques. This experience ruined a rather fun day up to that point."

0,The staff at this clinic are HORRIBLE. The receptionists ignore you. Dr. Clark's assistant did not wash her hands or wear gloves when giving me a shot. She even tried to wipe the blood away without protecting herself or me. Dr. Clark appears to be competent but basically he just sends you out to specialists since he can never see you when you are actually sick.
0,While dr Corcoran is nice and comforting getting into see one of the doctors is virtually impossible. I have never been able to get in to see a doctor or physicians assistant within48 hours and when you are sick that's essential. \nAdditionally the staff there act as if they are doing you a favor by taking your money. I have never witnessed such nonchalant behavior at a doctors office. Ridiculous
0,Just ordered food from here this evening for delivery. I have NO idea how this place gets 4 1/2 stars on here.  It was the worst chinese food I have ever eaten.  We ordered sesame chix which was soggy and gross. The eggrolls were overpriced and are more like a spring roll. the lomein is okay but will never get food from here again.
0,"Ordered the takeout combination special for four.  It was awful.  The chicken wings were raw, not just under cooked.  We stopped to  alert the management.  They refused to reverse the charges even though we dropped off their food to show them. The ridiculous reply was. \""You bit into the wings, so no refund.\""  Although we order take-out 3 to 4 times a week, we will never go back."
0,"Since I was 8 years old I have been coming here. I am 24 now. That's sixteen years as a customer. We order about 4 times a year for the past few years.\n\nLet me detail some changes. Instead of serving their food in the take out boxes many people associate with Chinese they changed this procedure about a year ago. Now they come on cheap plastic plates with a top that can be sealed. Why does this matter? The volume of food you get in these plates is less than what it used to be. So I let that go, I kept ordering. My orders usually end up about 45-50 bucks.\n\nYesterday, I had my worst service and food that I have ever received. I MADE a yelp account because I am so pissed off. The Teriyaki chicken was hard, rock hard. It tasted like 2 day old leftovers. The kind that were left under a lamp. The PuPu Platter which costs 9.50 a piece contained jack sh1t. I ordered TWO of them , that is 19 dollars of Pu Pu Platter and the result I took a picture of because I couldn't believe it. \n\nThis is what 19 dollars looks like : http://i.imgur.com/TZhEuV5.jpg\n\nI called back, and was told this was a normal portion. Lol. \n\nI have been going here for years, and they finally lost me as a customer yesterday. I can say for certainty that I will never order from this place again, and neither should you. \n\nAs an aside I added up 50 an order 5 times a year for 16 years, me and my family have probably spent around 4000 dollars at this one place throughout that time.\n\nBye bye."
0,"Okay used to be a 5 quickly turned into a 1 star all because of one night my family & I had been screwed over by this place.. If you have a family of 4 or more be prepared to wait wait wait and watch everyone else eat & leave before you even get the sight of food. I really enjoyed getting the hot tea they bring to your table before your meal I didn't even receive that we got one pot for 8 people including children.. two people were served food after 2 hours I honestly question myself why we waited so long waited some more, two people in our family finished their meal and the rest of us were still waiting. Did not even refill water, told the server continuously that other guests were eating and leaving before we even got a plate of something...we decided to leave we expressed our frustration to the \""owner\"" if that's what she even was and we refused to pay for nothing we received, we stormed out of there and she had the nerve to run out and record all of our license plates.. are you flipping kidding me.. no one was kidding when they told us \""all they care about is, you got your food right?\"" The two out of eight people that came to dinner came back to the restaurant asked for them to please throw out the license plate numbers they \""sightly\"" discounted the bill for the two plates & we now vow to never return to this crap hole of a restaurant. I will miss that lemon chicken but im sure there is another restaurant out there that would gladly appreciate our money than this place...\n\noh & I went into labor a few hours after this to top it all off. thanks little shanghai, thanks for sending me into labor...."
0,Over prices for quality! No lobster in seafood platter. Pushy and rude waitress. Owner picked his nose behind the bar before making a Mai tai! Seriously.
0,I keep giving them chances and they continue to fail. All my husbands shirts are ALWAYS wrinkled and with stains on them. This shouldn't be the case because I'm paying for my clothes to be cleaned and ironed! I tried to address the issue the first time this happened and one of the girls there was really rude. I honestly don't plan on coming back ever. Really bad customer service and they don't do what a dry cleaner is suppose to do.
0,"If you like your service poor and your food with hair cooked in it, you've found the right place. Nummy!\n\nI let the hair thing go ONCE. After all it's not as bad as MY cooking, but the second time it happened I let them know they had permanently lost my business. \n\nTheir food is below greasy spoon quality as they do things to meat (at least I THINK it's meat) that are unholy. Like cooking their hair in your food and using salt by the pound on any dish. \n\nI used to love Kyoto bowl back in the nineties, but  I can see why so many of them are closing now. Bad food, bad service. Steer clear."
0,"This place is nasty, the spring roll tasted liked it had been frozen for 50 years.  The  beef broccoli tasted like  dead cats.  The shrimp was stinky, like it was not washed, the chicken strips were tiny and had no flavor at all."
0,"looks dirty and my simple to make teriyaki chicken bowl was drowned in the watered down sauce, but I was HUNGRY. So I ate it. mid way through I almost choked on a very sharp chicken bone and all for the low price of almost ten bucks for a bowl and small drink? The staff can barely speak English... dont think I will return."
0,This place serves a poor excuse for japanese food. I dont understand how they keep their doors open with the product they serve. Nothing on the menu is worth trying. \n\nThe man behind the counter is unfriendly and gave me a annoyed look when i asked for wasabi.
0,"This place is a train wreck in a refrigerator. Its very cold (which is to be expected) but also extremely dilapidated. The ceiling is falling in, its old and worn, and worst of all, there is NO ONE to control the children.  The children (which are more like teenagers) are running a muck, creating cracks in the ice and throwing it at other people. \n\nI don't like the ice throwing, and I don't like cold ceilings falling in. When asked if you should go to Arcadia say, \""No!\"""
0,DONT COME HERE! Groupon users beware! I saw a sweet deal on groupon (15$ for four people for open skate) that was only a sweet deal online. The skates were so worn our feet had bruises on them afterwards. The lady who helped us with our skate size gave us all a size up even when we asked for a smaller size! It was so uncomfortable and very difficult to skate it in. As we managed to make the best of it  but could not bare we headed off the ice and a hockey coach saw our shoes were to big and mentioned next time we should get smaller skates on our way out. We also got off the ice because they rushed us off by starting to cleaning the ice 20 minutes before our time was up. Oh yeah It's also very hidden and hard to find.
0,"Awful. Just awful. We spent the majority of our visit trying to find a pair of skates that fit, which never happened. After coming to terms with the fact that these decrepit old skates were never going to fit properly we hit the \""ice\"". I say it that way because this was more like lumpy bumpy broken glass. The zamboni didn't make an appearance until free skate was over and it was time for us to leave. The blades on the skates were so dull that when paired with the ice rink that was mostly snow cone by now it was near impossible to skate. So my feet are wrecked and I skated for a probable collective fifteen minutes. Run down dirty old facility that obviously isn't very well up kept. Had it not been for the groupon we'd have never come and we won't be returning. #myfeethurt #ghettoice"
0,I contacted them to replace the springs on my  leather couch. At first they seemed really helpful and interested in the work. I talked to the owner who was supposed to call me back to schedule when to come look at the couch and take it to their shop. That phone call never happened. I even called and left a message with the receptionist and he never called back. So the next day I called again and talked to him. He didn't care at all that he didn't call me back. He flatly told me that he was busy and that I was 1 of 20 people he needed to call or that had called him. Great that he is that busy but if he continues to disregard potential customers like he did me he won't be busy for much longer.
0,"If I could give zero stars, I would.\n\nThis guy is a joke.  I have been waiting to have my expensive leather sectional repaired for a very small stain since MAY 21st.  My couch is under warranty, and both the company and I have had no luck in getting Fred to call us back.  The repair is covered, and the guy should get paid.  So why am I getting the run-around?\n\nI initially called to inquire about their services, and was told I would receive a call the next day to set up an appointment for Fred to come out to my home.  One week, then two weeks go by - so I called and was told \""oh, I thought you were already set up?\""  So by this time, he was booked out for 2 weeks.  So I waited a total of 4 weeks before he came out to look at the piece.\n\nFred was over an hour late for our \""appointment\"" and seemed rushed and irritated when he was here.  He wanted to take the piece of my sectional back to his shop to fix it, although previously he told me he could fix it on site.  He kept going back and forth on what he wanted to do.  In addition, he couldn't give me an estimate but told me that it would probably be more than what my warranty would allow.  When I balked at this, he finally decided to not take my furniture (I wouldn't have allowed him anyway considering I probably wouldn't get it back for another 4 weeks).  He told me that I would receive a call the next day with the estimate.  Not surprisingly, AGAIN the call never came.  This was JUNE 25th.\n\nI called my furniture company's warranty line and explained the situation.  They called Leather Like New directly and also never received a call back, and I have since been looking for other services as now it is JULY 29th and my piece is still stained.  I am so frustrated.\n\nFred's excuse over and over was that he is \""busy.\""  I am a professional and we are all busy!  Customer service here is horrible; I felt pushed off, and honestly lied to about when I would get calls back.  I have called and left messages about my dissatisfaction.  I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY CALLS OR EXPRESSIONS OF REMORSE IN REGARDS TO HOW I HAVE BEEN TREATED.  Fred will not be busy for long.  I will never be recommending his services, or lack thereof for that matter.  If you want to be treated appropriately and with respect, and to have something done in a timely manner, please look elsewhere."
0,"Pretentious and overrated.\n\nThis is the kind of restaurant for people who a) miss New York, or b) don't know what they're talking about.  This is the kind of restaurant where you'll pay $200 for $100 worth of food.  It's not that it's bad, it's that it's pretentious.  To pay this kind of money is a strip shopping center is...overrated.\n\nYes, the owner-hostess it's just not worth it.  Very snooty to other patrons she deemed unworthy, save the money, go elsewhere."
0,"We had a private party scheduled for the 3-course chef tasting dinner.  The room was not ready, the menu was not as we discussed (there were meat dishes and we had a few vegetarians), the A/V equipment didn't work.   One of the guests also got a cup of coffee that tasted like chicken broth...the owner came back with some excuse for this, but the issue was not corrected.  We all had been looking forward to this dinner for some time now since we heard good things about this restaurant - this bad experience was enough for me not to return."
0,This place sucks. Food was average and we had to wait an hour even though we had a reservation. My americano tasted like warm soy sauce and they blamed it on the RO system. The owner made all sorts of excuses and took a whopping $50 off our $1100 bill. We won't be back!
0,"Pros: cute \nNice wAit staff\n\n\nCons: price 35+ per plate\nTaste: bland and under done meat cooked wrong\nLighting: very dark \nCold plates and food.\nWhen two plates were taken back for taste they showed up anyway on our bill\nWhen we had an issue with our food the manager only came to the table once, the chef never came out, the food was solid OK if we were at applebees this would still only be three stars\n\nSave e $$"
0,"The worst ever!  Our food was cold and tasteless. A group of us were celebrating our daughters graduation from law school.  There were 8 of us and the restaurant was not busy.  All of our food was served cold, obviously it had sat in the kitchen.  We sent back two meals and they brought tasteless pasta dishes and kept the two expensive meals on the bill. They left the table with our  dirty dishes sitting in front of us for 40 minutes.  Once we were not happy our server disappeared as did the other staff. Due to our daughters tears when we complained, as it was her choice of restaurant and she felt responsible, we let it go and paid our bill.  I wrote them after and have gotten NO response from them.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS RESTAURANT!!!!"
0,"We have just finished a dinner at the Citizen Public House and were still not just feeling like going home yet. Maybe grabbing another drink and a little bite to eat before we go home. It was after 9pm Saturday night. We naturally strolled around Marcellino's on our way back to garage and I said: \""What about trying this before we go?!\"" Told the hostess we are looking for a drink and maybe a little bite to eat and we would not mind sitting at the bar. She told us nothing is available for another 45 mins, and she asked if we are going to eat food...?! We said we have already finished our dinner but would not mind to taste a bit of their cuisine and inquired about sitting on a patio or at the bar. There were 3 or more 2-place seats at the bar while we were not offered either one of these. With quite a sarcastic voice she told us: WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY. We have decided to follow her suggestion and left the restaurant -  which made us happy."
0,The worst experience in my life. The menu is not clear and the waitress did a horrible job describing the ingredients.
0,we went to Marcellino since it was recommended to us as one of the finest restaurants in Scottsdale. Not so. It probably is the worst food I have ever tasted. The mozzarella was very rubbery like the one bought from a supermarket. Their signature pasta was thick and bland. The pork medallion was totally inedible and the only good item in our order was the wine.\nAt some point the chef/owner came to talk and would no go away till we started to get up. This was definitely frendliness bordering on harassment.
0,"I was so disappointed by the food.  Very bland. .. no flavor.   I had the pork medallions and not only were they overcooked,  but almost not edible...no spices.  My husband had the seafood pasta.. again,  horrid with no flavor. . He had to add salt and a lot of cheese just to get it down.\n\nBread seemed old and the spread they served with it was also tasteless...we asked for butter and it tasted funny... something was just not right. \n\nUpside was the wine. . Very good. \n\nNeedless to say we won't be back."
0,"the really bad italian restaurant in Scottsdale, The chef is snubbing that he do not allow any people to change the side of the plate because he want you to force to buy extra pasta for $16.00 dollars. Please take care when you order the extra ugly and not flavors pasta it is expensive, the any dessert is over $ 15.00 and the bad Espresso is $ 5.00 dollars, I ate on the best Italian  restaurant in Dubai,London,Germany,Italy.But i never ate crap like this i  do not recommended this restaurant. I prefer Tomaso or Tutti santi by Nina ."
0,"You can't fake diarrhea. \n\nThese f*rs gave me VEAL parmigiana when I'd ordered CHICKEN. Until then, I'd never eaten veal and had no desire ever to do so. \n\nI was so upset and the best both the waiter and manager could do was apologize, say they'd take it off the bill (they better!!! I had two bites!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), then launch an explanation as to how, on a busy night, the kitchen could make a mistake. \n\nI don't care WHY it happened. That's the restaurant's business. I care THAT IT HAPPENED. Unconscionable.  \n\nTo top it off, I had total food poisoning that night and the following morning. Yes, I was completely nauseated that I'd consumed veal, but this wasn't psychosomatic. \n\nLike I said, you can't fake diarrhea."
0,"My main course of the tortellini was delicious, that being said, everything else was bad. I think it was because they did not seem to want our large party if 11, that on multiple times they let us know was an inconvenience (the restaurant was only 1/3 full), and when our napkins were mildew smellingand we politely asked for new ones, they treated us like we were rude, smelling the napkin and saying the entire bag came back from the laundry like this (hello, why would you out them on thetable then!) We also asked for new glasses because the store the napkins in the glasses. It was just horrible after that. The bread I was excited about was cold, wrong meals and drinks were brought with no apology. There was a good 30 minutes we saw noone, and we went through 4 different waiters. \nThey over charged the gratuity and when we showed them the math they denied it only after asking for the manager they wrote in a new price. I will never go back. Even after all that we were standing out front at the benches saying our goodbyes when 2 different waiters came out and walked around the group. They seemed like they were trying to get us leave but I can't be positive."
0,"I was staying at the Pointe Hilton and figured to give this place a try after reading all the great reviews and seeing it was close.  I had the Chicken Al Momento , with salad and a cup of cream of  mushroom soup .  The salad was a balsamic vinigerette and it was pretty lame. It only came with one small tomato slice and no onions or pepperincinis like you get at many Italian Restaurants. The soup was ok and the Chicken Al Momento was ok , but it was served on a very small bed of spaghetti , I mean a box of pasta is about a buck and a half , put some more on the plate. The menu at this Phoenix location was very limited and being from Chicago I had higher expectations."

With that said If you have to go here then go but...\n\nA little over a year ago I had to go to the ER and after waiting for over two hours when there was no body in front of me and it was early and not busy I finally got seen by a doctor for like two minutes who was rude and then I never saw him again. \n\nI had a lady come in and mop my room while the nurse was putting in an IV in my arm!!! Uhhh, hello, do you think could have maybe come back a little later?\n\nI had another nurse who was there to take my blood pressure info just leave the machine on and it beeped for the next 15 mins until finally in all my pain (I later found out I had a kidney stone) I got up and asked someone to turn it off. \n\nMy nurse wouldn't give me any information about what the tests I was getting were for. The room was 71 degrees and I had to ask 3 different people for a warm blanket even AFTER my boyfriend called the nurses station from work to get them to bring me one. \n\nThe place seemed dirty and unsanitary, I mean I guess it was due to all the construction they had to wheel me through but even that was ridiculous. Oh yeah I almost forgot to mention the left over sticky things, the ones that they use to connect your heart to machines, in my gown that I noticed. I was never hooked to a heart machine... That means they were who ever had the gown on before I did. That's gross!.\n\nThen I had to deal with all the payment info and not one person I talked to yet has been helpful. They all seem to be \""busy\"" and rude and they act like I'm bugging them for calling the 800 number to get my payments squared away. Ugh! \n\nNow, I have to deal with the billing folks again. Why, you ask? Oh because they decided not to send me my last bill and even after talking to mulitple people asking them to send me a bill to my new address and them agreeing to. I guess it was just easier to put my bill into collections. Thanks JCL! You guys are swell folks. So today I call in asking to see if we can get this fixed. That I WANT to pay my bill. That I had no intention of not paying it. That there was no reason for it to go into collections. Pat (the lady I spoke to) was no help, so I asked to talk to a supervisor or manager. She put me on hold for about 8 mins and then some how the phone call got disconnected (nice). So I called back, she didn't answer so I left a message. That was at 8am it's now 6pm and no phone call back. Geez that's great customer service.\n\nIf you have to go then go but if you can hold out for a better hospital then I recommend the extra driving in the end it will be less of a headache."
0,"My husbands back went out, so bad to the point he couldn't  stand on his own and would cry trying to sit up. He had gone to a chiropractor yesterday and they said he needed an MRI to confirm the severity.unfortunately he could physically get to a radiologist in time.   I decide to  take my husband to the ER because he coolant even go potty with out my help, I was really worried about him. \n\nFrom the moment i walked in , I asked the ER administrator for assistance getting my husband out of the car and I get this crazy nurse who is yelling at me that she is busy and doesn't have time. I felt like she was telling me to o away. So I asked if there was another hospital close by. Immediately they get two staff members to help.\n\nAfter being checked in and a nurse practitioner starts ridiculing my husband for coming to an emergency room for back pain and requesting an MRI. Every question my husband answered came with a sneer response back from the nurse. Finally I was livid at that point and asked his boss the RN, if we are wasting their time being here. I called another hospital that knew about the situation and welcomed us. \n\nEvery person we encountered was just miserable and it showed well. Never again. I will give my business with arrowhead health from here on out."
0,"Some of the rudest, uncaring most unprofessional people i have ever seen in my life. I can't believe they call themselves professionals. My husband has severe stomach pains every day, and this hospital is the closest from our home so we usually come here. That, and they know him well from being there so often. He actually had a nurse (brandi) tell him \""why are you moving around so much, it can't hurt that bad\"" Can you believe that! And \""no one can die from pain\"" WHAT! They won't admit him because according to their standard ER tests he's in perfect health. They honestly think of him as someone who's only there to get his \""fix\"". I hear then laughing, socializing, and planning their weekends in the hallways. Meanwhile, my husband is laying there dying and screaming in pain. I wish i could give them a negative rating. DON'T COME HERE, GO ANYWHERE ELSE!\nOn the other hand, if you have a sick child, Mendys place is amazing!"

0,"I was having chest pains and not feeling well at all and had my husband drive me to the hospital on 7/28/13.  I provided my insurance information and waited in the waiting area.  Two men came out and gave me an EKG right there and told me my heart was normal and I could wait.  After about 40 minutes I was taken to a room.  My nurse was fantastic.  She kept me informed.  The doctor sucked!  He was confused and seemed to be walking in circles.  The nurse had taken blood, then gave me 4 asprin and then they were going to take my blood again in 2 hours.  During this time the doctor popped in and said \""you ready to go\"".  The nurse said, no we're waiting 2 hours for more blood.  After laying there for 5 hours, the doctor came in and said they found nothing and follow up with my physician.  I wasn't happy and I was still feeling terrible.  Then imagine my surprise when I received a bill from the doctor for $1557 because he was out of network and my insurance didn't cover it.  I was pissed!  I called the hospital and ripped them.  They claim that I signed a document that disclosed this information.  I explained I had been to this hospital at least 4 times over the 12 year period I've lived in the neighborhood.  The rep told me I should have asked if the doctor was a contractor and asked for a different doctor.  I won't be paying this doctor.  And I'm filing a complaint with my insurance company against this medical group for false advertising."

When we questioned why we have not been seen yet,  was advised that those people were sicker than my son. The people that were brought back looked perfectly fine, none were in pain or looked injured. My opinion is the type of insurance they have, depends on the type of care you get here. People are leaving before being seen because people who came after are being seen before them.  This is pathetic way of treating people. The only reason we are here is because my son's doctor told him to come if his headache got worse.   So just remember if you get sick and can't get into your doctor till the next day. DONT come here,  you have a better chance waiting for your doctor.  You could drop dead in the waiting room."
0,"Very disappointed in the customer service with this hospital!!  Please make sure you check your bill before paying it!  They charged me $201 for an IV which I didn't get.  I spent countless hours telling customer service that I didn't receive any needles in my arm.  Then she told me that an audit was run on my account and that my last medication was indeed an injection!!  Again, I told them I didn't receive any needles in my arm and that all medication was given orally.  After several weeks with countless emails and phone conversations the director finally spoke with the nurse who admitted to making an error.  I wish all of this could have been resolved from day 1."
0,"The service was horrible, the breakfast menu only had 4 basic ingredients, and the employees could not understand what we were asking, most likely due to a language barrier. The eggs and bacon were just bad. I would rather have gone to mcdonalds honestly. The food was put in styrofoam boxes even though we planned on dining in. I was hoping to have a nice morning breakfast with my boyfriend, but this place just did not live up to the appearance given by the website. \n\nI will give them that their frappes were good, but that was about it. They were about the same price as starbucks. \n\nOverall, it was a horrible experience. If your in the area and want breakfast just go get an egg mcmuffin at mcdonalds down the street, it has more flavor and they have better coffee."
0,I usually don't complain about Panda Express for yet the food is great and somewhat cheap. However this visit was disappointing. When my boyfriend and I walked in right from the start there was not enough food out and what was there was old and you can tell it must have been sitting  out there for some time. When we got our order the Orange chicken tasted dried out. Overall the food was old. Very disappointed.
0,"What a let down! Pizza was 15min late from the 40-45m pickup wait, staff was blah, and when I got home to try the pizza... Totally let down... And ps - the angry crayon written signs all over the place are soooo tacky."
0,"We always try to find a local business to support and found good reviews on yelp for Pat's Pizza Plus. Geez. I have no idea where the good reviews came from. The pizza had zero sauce on it, it was lukewarm upon pick-up and the salad was being stored on top of the pizza so it was lukewarm as well. We won't be trying this place again. We'll stick with Spinato's!"
0,"Meh.pizza was super greasy,cheese was gummy,crust was bland. $60 bucks for 2 pizzas and 24 wings not a good deal at all. Pat's seems to be a staple in the neighborhood but there are wayyyyy better places within a 1 mile radius. Since stumpy's was closed on Sunday we had to resort to Pat's. Never again!"
0,"10/15/2013: Not going back. Ever. \n\nHere's how I rate a pizza: is it better the 2nd day?  Well, I've got good news and bad news.  First, the bad news:\n\nI've visited Pat's Pizza about 20 times in the past year (12 St and Glendale Ave, Phoenix) and the food is good.  Not great, good.  A good value, or so I thought.  But CERTAINLY NOT BETTER THE 2ND DAY!\n\nBut that's not the bad news. The bad news is, I called in an order one night a few weeks ago, and they emphasized that they close at 9 and that I'd have to absolutely be there by 9.  No problem.  But then the guy, with the broad bitching in the background (and I'm not joking), reiterated - AGAIN! That I HAD to be there by 9pm.\n\n I got there at precisely 8:54pm, but was horrified to realize, in my haste to \""get there by 9pm-NO LATER!, I'd forgotten my wallet.  Sheesh.  Wasn't intentional.\n\nBut you should have seen, actually seen, the look of horror and disgust on the faces of these two schlubs.  After numerous visits, this guy knew me; the point is, I'm not hustling anyone, if I say I'll come back, I will.\n\nThere was not a hint of empathy, \""it's ok, catch me later\"", nothing.  Nothing for a regular customer, which is what I was.  I looked at the guy and said something like, \""Well, if I HAD to be here by 9, I guess there's no chance I can go home and get my wallet\"".  Again, looks of disgust.  Silence.  Disgusted slience.   So I said, \""It's ok.  It's my mistake.  And I'll never come back\"".  And I left.\n\nBut the good news is, because Pat's wouldn't trust me, allow me to pay later for the pizza, I was forced to find a new place...and I did!\n\nThat's how I found Raffaele's Pizzeria, 7019 N 19th Ave (NE corner, 19th Avenue and Glendale). This is terrific pizza and it's better the 2nd day.  I'll write a separate review for Raffaele's but know that now, for sure, I really never will go back to Pat's.  Assholes just had to get out of there by 9...\n\nWay to go Pat's.  How many customers do you have that come in 20 times in 6 months?  I hope you're happy.  I hope you're happy with that horrible woman who looked so disgusted that night.  I hope you're married to that horrible woman.\n\nI just wonder what they did with my pizza..."
0,R.I.P. Pats Pizza. So sad we have lost our neighborhood eatery to self demise. After eating from Pats for years with an occasional disappointment my last 3 delivery orders have been inedible. Good Bye and RIP.
0,"Decent pizza and wings, not enough though to go back for a second time and deal with their award winning customer service. They nickel and dime you for any little request, I'm surprised he doesn't charge for the use of napkins.... Maybe that's next."
0,"WORST SERVICE EVER!\n\nThe service is OK in the store, but NEVER call them for a repair! You probably will find  something better in Craiglist. Repair department is really unprofessional and unfriendly, their priority is send you a bill instead of customer satisfaction. You will find other reviews here stating the same, so save some time and money and call somebody else for repairs and try Costco or Online stores for supplies."
0,"The only reason I go to Bashas is for the convenience. First of all make sure you have some extra time to run an errand there since you will be waiting in the checkout line. The checkout clerks are maybe a little outdated like the store itself. Oh and make sure you check expiration dates on the products. I bought some crackers for work and they were 6 months past the expiration date. Don't forget your Bashas card if you have one, they won't give you a courtesy swipe. 1 star because i can't give 0."
0,"Ugh. I don't like giving a tough review, but this is a store that needs to address a couple things.\n\n1. The Service: Long lines and unpleasant cashiers. \n2. Outdated Store: This wouldn't be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising.\n3. Produce: Maybe in this store they should just no offer produce. The little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought. \n\nI think just a couple things that wouldn't cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me. Not there right now."
0,These people are phone spammers WHO WILL NOT STOP! They call several times a day from three different numbers all with the same area code and prefix but the last four numbers fall into three repeat patterns. The calls always come through as Adobe Carpet Cleaning. Based on the harassment from these people I will never be a customer. I don't care if their service is the best on earth and free. They have harassed me for three months and will not stop calling in spite of numerous requests to be taken off their call list.
0,"This company constantly harasses us by calling every week. We have told them to stop. 6027491677 is the number they call from. Their way of gaining customers is horrible. I honestly would get service from them when I need it, but now that they have bullied us with phone calls, I want nothing to do with their company."
0,Bad company. Do not use. Check negative reviews on BBB site and here on YELP.    Phone spammers of the worst kind. Also asked them to stop calling and they wont. What a way to upset potential customers. I will post my negative experience with them everywhere I can because of their bad practices.
0,"DO NOT USE. Unrelenting phone solicitation even after being told multiple times to stop, to put us on their OWN do not call list.  A complaint with the Federal Trade Commisssion is being filed, especially since our number has been on the list for over 31 days.  I encourage anyone who has had the same experience to do the same.  Go to the National Do Not Call Registry and file a complaint"
0,"Adobe Carpet Cleaning is UNETHICAL and you should NEVER do business with them. We're on the FCC's \""Do Not Call\"" list, but Adobe Carpet Cleaning repeatedly breaks the law by calling us several times a week. They have done this for months even though we have politely asked them to stop, then angrily asked them to stop, then yelled at them to stop. Sometimes, they've called us three times a day, even harassing our young kids.\n\nNEVER USE ADOBE CARPET CLEANING."
0,"They said hey you've got 30 days to call to get your carpet recleaned, but guess what??? Nope these people suck in scheduling, communication and cleaning the carpet. Mine is still dirty and stinky. \nI do not recommend them!"
0,"I should have read these reviews prior to hiring Adobe!  What a waste of money!  30 day guarantee forget that!  They called me to sell me their services after I was already displeased with the quality of their work from the week before. When I explained that I wasn't pleased the salesman was very polite and said that he was going to transfer me to a manager so that they can make things right.  When I spoke to the manager I explained to her that I was not happy with the work and that they didn't need to call me to sell me anything.  Instead of trying to resolve the cleaning issue she said, \""I'll take you off the calling list.\""  Then hung up."
0,"Hm, I sort of feel bad giving these guys such a low rating since they were rated so highly by the other reviewers. But honestly, I can't say I had a good experience there.\n\nI went to these guys based on a personal referral from a friend and b/c of the positive Yelp reviews.  I should have known better, since there were only 3 reviews, and my friend was new to Phoenix and went here because it was close to her home.\n\nAnyways, I have an older car and the check engine light came on.  I made an appointment, and when I show up, these guys wanted to charge me $98 to just diagnose the problem!!  I mean, most other shops do it for $20 or for free.  At that point, I didn't have much choice because I had already made elaborate arrangements for a friend to pick me up and I was getting worried about the check engine light.\n\nLong story short, they wanted to charge me a total of $750+ for repairs, labor, and parts.  I think their labor costs are way overpriced because I looked at what they wanted to charge for parts and it seemed more or less reasonable.  I buckled at the amount (mostly because I didn't have the cash) and because I wanted to get a second opinion after I learned that the check engine light costs $98 to check out. (I've since been to a Midas by my house who diagnosed the Check Engine light for FREE. And I've seen other places that do it for $20...still a chunk of cash compared to FREE but measly change compared to $98). \n\nNot knowing where to find a reliable mechanic for a second opinion, I took it to the dealership. I know that dealers usually charge higher prices that shops, so I was prepared for the worst.  But at least I wanted to know if the repairs suggested by Kelly Clark were legitimately needed.  Well, it turns out the repairs were really needed, but the shocker came when they quoted me a price of $550 for repair, parts, and labor.   That's a $200 price difference!!!!!  And I got the quote from a dealership too, who I know is probably charging more than normal. \n\nBottom line: Kelly Clark quoted me $750+ for repairs that my dealership did for $550."
0,"I read a review of how great they were. I took my truck there. EEKS, me thinks never again! I had an 8 am appointment for an oil change and head light problem. I waited for 2 hours and they didn't address the initial problem (the head light) until I reminded them at the time of payment. I clearly explained that I received a citation for having a head light out and I needed that looked at first. They reconnected the wire that had shaken loose and were shady in writing it on the receipt. I asked the guy to clarify on the receipt what was done and he blew me off by saying, we didn't do a repair. He refused to make that clarification on the receipt. This caused a problem when I went to the Paradise Valley court to prove I had the head light problem corrected. They are extremely overpriced and don't care about the customer."
0,Went on their website and requested a callback 3 days ago. Still waiting for them to call.
0,"I love Yelp cause I can share my many experiences with you and the world. So today, in desperate need of a margarita, I decided to stop here with a couple of friends for a pitcher and some guacamole. After a few margaritas, I found their \""healthy\"" menu and decided to order their  \""vegan\"" veggie burrito. Problem was there was nothing vegan about it. After several bites of the burrito, I found a large piece of burnt steak inside. NASTY! If that wasn't enough, after consuming nearly half of the black beans it was served with, I found pieces of pork in the beans. That explains why they were so salty. I presented all of this to the manager who was kind enough to take most of everything, minus the booze, off of the bill. Revolting."
0,I have been a Carlos'Briens fan for many years and having not been there for a while my better half and I decided to grab a quick bite at the bar last night. I really have nothing good to say about any part of our visit. Having been in the restaurant business myself I can be pretty forgiving when it is obvious that the place is understaffed and I am willing to be patient as long as it is acknowledged that I am sitting there waiting...instead we literally waited (at the bar) for 15 minutes without either one of the bartenders making so much as eye contact. I finally had to wave my arms before somebody said Hi. I was not the only one having this problem as both people to either side on me had been waiting longer than we had and a couple of the tables gave up and left. We finally placed our order of queso dip and a chimichanga with a bartender that was less than thrilled. The queso was really bad and chimi was mediocore at best. Nobody ever asked if there was an issue with the queso as the bowl was literally untouched. On the upside the chips and salsa are still good. We paid our tab and bailed. I made a quick stop to the restroom only to find it out of soap with the trashcan overflowing and paper towels all over the floor. All and all a very disappointing trip. Carlos O'Briens needs to make a serious effort to get their restaurant back to what it used to be.
0,"My husband and I ate at Carlos O'Brien's last night; to our dismay, the food was inedible.  It was a disappointing evening since we do not go out to dinner very often since the recession.\n\nI ordered the Carlos Carnitas Dinner.  The pork tasted dried, rubbery, and days old.  Between us, we ate three bites of it and put it aside.  My husband's dinner, Pollo Fundido, was not any better.  The pollo fundido was over salted and made with poor quality ingredients; the chicken appeared to have come from a can versus fresh, and the cheese tasted processed versus real.  We only ate a couple of bites of it and sadly called it a night, going home to eat bowls of cereal for dinner instead."
0,"Has been years that haven't been there and I am still pissed at how poorly we were treated there. Maybe it has changed but I will never step foot there ever again. Food was OK I guess but the service was horrible. If you like your food to be thrown in your face by the waitress and you have to clean up HER mess, you should go there. Oh, and bring your own utensils since they don't seem to be willing to provide them. The manager couldn't have cared less, the staff just seemed to be going thru the motions. Horrible experience."
0,"This is strictly a \""produce as much as possible\"" for the masses.  The food used to be good.  it is now made with cheap ingredients and tastes like oil.  It is pretty bad and the salsa has taken a real dive too.  It used to be fun and enjoyable.  Now it seems like an overpriced fast food place.  Don't go!"
0,"I've lived in the Valley for 20 years and never ate here until a couple of months ago, despite it being highly recommended by a lot of people.\n\nI think I have to rethink my opinion on the people that recommended it....YUCK!!!!!! The food has no flavor and everything is covered in shredded iceberg lettuce and \""mexican cheese blend.\""\n\nPlus the restaurant looks and feels like it hasn't been cleaned or changed since 1984.  I actually didn't want to touch anything.  \n\nShut this place down.  You're done."
0,My wife and I stopped in for dinner and margaritas. We were seated right away and served chips and salsa  from there we sat and waited and waited for our waitress to show up.  We ordered food and drinks together because we weren't sure how long it would take her to return. Good thing because she didn't come back until food was ready. \nI ordered the pollo fundido. The chicken had NO flavor and the cream cheese on the top was so thick you couldn't taste anything but cream cheese.  We will NEVER return!!!
0,Full plate of not so tasty and unrecognizeable food. \ntacos were soaked in grease.  Phoenix just doesnt know how to do Mexican food....:-)
0,"Went there with friends. Had the pollo fundido. It was good. Problem was there was a table of 20 somethings near us. They were very drunk, and the waiter continued to serve them. They were obnoxious, yelling f bombs constantly. My friend's wife eventually became irritated with constant barrage of expletives. At this point, I asked them to kindly cut back on the f-bombs. You would have thought I insulted their mothers by their response. immediately, the 4 guys became belligerent and threatened to kick our asses. One guy even asked the waiter if he could beat me up. He said that he knew the owner and he could do whatever he wanted. At this point, we decided to leave with our meals unfinished. I didn't take my family out to fight with 4 drunks. I spoke to the manager. He did apologize, and admitted that they WERE REGULARS. Apparently, he did speak to them, as they were leaving while we paid our bill at the front register. The manager didn't offer to comp us anything for our troubles. At least it wasn't boring. If you like to fight with drunks, maybe they will be when you go!"
0,"Awful! My Mom and I decided to stop in and each have a taco with an iced tea. I ordered lemon with my tea. My tea was served with a lemon as requested but it had a long dark hair wrapped around the lemon. I told the server and he had the nerve to bring me another one, also with a lemon (it should have at least been on the side after that!). After that, our tacos were not so appetizing! The kicker? Our server still charged us for my beverage! We went to pay our bill and had to actually get the manager to take off the tea from our bill. The manager offered no apologies and seemed to smirking about it. All's he said was \""These guys no better than that\""! Too bad because my boyfriend loves this place. Accidents happen but it is how it was handled......never again!"
0,"Terrible. Long wait, food was a mess and unappealing. One of the worst places I've been."
0,"Let me share my Spinato's experience with you.\n\nI have had their pizza a few times, but the last time was the last. And I mean it. The last experience was with their food I ordered \""Traditional Vegetarian\"", with added pepperoncini. Got home, no pepperoncini. Oh well, no big deal. Started eating it and discovered a strange flavor. Kinda like dog treats. Went to kitchen to inspect pizza. Well, low and behold, under the inch or so of cheez (I don't think its real cheese) was PEPPERONI on the \""Traditional Vegetarian\"". UHM OK?! Verified the receipt and it was entered correctly! This household doesn't eat animals. I'm sorry, between the overly sweetened sauce, too much cheese, undercooked crust and the mixup I will never again waste my money here.\n\nPlease, if you want pizza, do not come here."
0,"This is a terrible place to try to take a large group.  The food is mediocre at best.  But they run the place poorly.\n\nWe called ahead to see if they could seat a party of 8.  They told us that they could not take our name over the phone, instead we had to show up to put our names in.  My wife went ahead and reserved the table.  She was told it would be 45 minutes.  She came home and we began getting the kids ready.  We showed up 15 minutes before we were told, but they had already given the table away.  We were told that it would be another half hour before we could be seated.  \n\nUnfortunately, their waiting area is very packed and does not hold 8 comfortably.   We left, I will never go back.  It should not be a hassle to take your family out to eat.  The main reason for eating out is to avoid hassle.  Spinato's does a good job of making life difficult."
0,"this was the first time in this place, we wanted pizza and stopped here.\nthe pizza:\nthe crust had to be frozen,barely cooked and so disgustingly saggy in oil.\nthe sauce was the most horrifying experience in my life, so gross,sweeten with sugar, it must be because they are definitely using can pizza sauce .\nthe cheese was not cheese, it tasted like rubber,i picked up the stupidly cut small square and the whatever was came off all together..rubber!\nwe order half spinach and half pepperoni, it was so damn oily, the spinach was very salty and the pepperoni (very little) probably the cheapest brand you can get.\ni was very surprise how busy they were, i just can not  understand why a person that like good food (like me) would come back in here.\nthis was the most disgusting PIZZA THAT I EVER TRIED IN MY LIFE..frozen pizza from walmart is 100% times better.\nand the damn thing (i can't call it pizza anymore) was $22 for a 16\"".\nwaist of money,time and my stomach hurt like hell.\nTERRIBLE!\nDo not go!"

0,"I had to purchase one item, and found out the closed a few minutes earlier than advertised. Not cool."
0,"This is the single worst restaurant I've ever been to, anywhere. From the looks of the other reviews, I must have caught them on a bad night, but I swear to God, the tacos I had there tasted like spoiled meat. My friend and I couldn't stomach more than one bite each and were not satisfied by the restaurants lack of concern over our complaints. \n\nWe were made to pay for inedible food and no attempt was made to make things right... And for the record, I've got no problems with 'real' Mexican food-- street vendors and the worst Mexican joints I've been to from LA to Ensenada to Cozumel, are all better than this place."
0,"What a cute place!!\nThat is about the only positive thing about Aunt Chilada's, unfortunately.  The food is not even mediocre IT SUCKS!!  Started with the nearly inedible chips and the dressed-up-ketchup salsa all the way through dessert was downright misery!  And the service sucks too :("

0,"As an (inexplicably) popular Phoenix destination, I've dined here over the years and been reasonably satisfied.  Service is tolerable, speed is tolerable, ambiance is tolerable.  It's a little overpriced for the quality but I was able to swallow it.\n\nUntil tonight.  My group was seated out at a patio table which had the umbrella still on it so we were sitting in shadows.  We asked for a candle for some light- \""We're out of candles, I guess we're not doing candles on the tables anymore.\""  The guy graciously removed the umbrella from the table which helped a bit.\n\nIt was downhill from there.  Slow service on drinks, constant creepy lurking interruptions from the waiter, condescending comments during 2/3rds of the tables orders.  Snooty oblivious help from the woman who brought out our orders.  (If the people you're sending out with food can't answer simple questions with anything better than a blank stare, *MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T BE CARRYING OUT THE FOOD*)\n\nContinually empty water glasses and slow service to the end, I left satisfied only in the knowledge that I will never patronize this restaurant again."
0,"Bad, just bad.\nFood is underwhelming. My friend did not like her wine after one sip and asked the waiter to exchange it for something else. He actually balked and said he would have to check with the manager before he could do that. What???Are you kidding me? Big mistake. Then I tasted my incredibly weak margherita, all sweet, horrible. Yea, they sell you an 18oz. drink, but whats the point if it sucks. Decided not to deal with the bartender directly instead of flustering our waiter again. Walked up to the bar and in a very calm, and nice way explained to the bartender that I was underwhelmed with my drink, that it was too sweet and I could not taste a hint of tequila. Well I guess tha was an insult, and instead of dealing with me as a customer, she told me that she made the drink and there was basically nothing wrong with it and nothing she could do. Really?\nThis is the type of badly run, corporate restaurant I cannot stand. No owners to deal with, no one that cares, just crappy service and a culture that forgets about the customer. Owners need to go into a Houston's and see how a large corporate restaurant should be run."
0,"I just left this restaurant 15 minutes ago and decided to sign up for Yelp to write this review. \n\nListen, Aunt Chilada's, before tonight... was a mediocre restaurant near where my boyfriend works. We'd sometimes go there for lunch if we needed a quick bite, and the salsa was good. So it was there to fill our need if we really had nowhere else to go. That being said, tonight was a disaster.\n\nI'm sure it's because they had a few large groups of people who'd already sat down before us in the banquet room, wherever that is. But we waited for over an hour for our food. When it arrived, my burrito had cheese in it (I am lactose intolerant and asked for none). The waiter was courteous and zipped back to get me my correct order, but came back a mere ten seconds later with a cold burrito. Really? I know I've already waited, but at least give it to me warm.\n\nAll in all, the server generally ignored us because the table to our left was angry they weren't getting any food, and the table to the right of us had a solid 30 people in it. So, I get it in a sense. But it would've been nice to have them tell us straight out that they had a 46 person table on the other side of the restuarant that just ordered, and that the giant party to our right hadn't gotten their food yet either. It would've saved me a lot of time. Definitely was not worth the money, and never will return again."
0,"I give this place one star, begrudgingly. The only good thing about this place was the ambiance and the service at the bar. I am appalled by the service we had at the table. I have never been treated so badly. We had a party of 6, and we chose a table on the patio. The patio was really cool and full of party goers, mostly large groups of people. We sat for about an hour and a half without a server, so we got our drinks from the bar.  No big deal.Finally we decided we wanted some food, so a member of our group flagged down a waitress. Big mistake! The server, Cindy, was the WORST! She was so rude. She explained that no one knew whose table ours was, so no one waited on us. My sister tried to order and she snapped at her, \""I am waiting until everyone is ready to order!\"" I suggested maybe we should order from the bar and then she snapped at me, \""You cannot order from the bar! You have to order from me.\"" We ordered our food and, after several eye rolls, Cindy left our table. I seriously should have talked to a manager because she was so rude to our party. She continually rolled her eyes when we ordered drinks. The food came and it was awful. I ordered the shrimp tacos. They were completely dry and almost inedible.  I will never go back to this establishment. I cannot believe the treatment we received. This woman should not be in the service industry. I would think, in this economy, there are plenty if servers who would have wanted to wait on a party like ours. We spent $200 at table, not even counting the drinks we got at the bar. We are all upper middle class people; there was no reason Cindy would have thought we would not have tipped her well. I always give servers the benefit of the doubt; I was a server for 10 years, so I understand they have bad days. But this behavior was inexcusable and shocking. Cindy was the rudest server I have EVER had. I cannot even explain it in words. It wasn't what she said, it was the condescending tone, eye rolling, and abrupt responses."
0,Been going to Aunt Chilada's for over 10 years now and I'm sad to see the quality of the food and service declining.  I had my wedding reception on the patio 11 years ago and could not have been happier.  Went for dinner last weekend for my wife's birthday and don't know if I'll ever go back.  Our group waited over an hour for our meals to arrive and during that time our waitress only came to the table once to take drink orders.  No one should have to leave their table and go to the bar to order a drink.  The one time our waitress did come by she said there was a mix up with our order.  When it finally arrived 3 of us asked for side of sour cream.  Unfortunately it never came.  Luckily for our waitress we had a large group so gratuity was automatically added to our bill.  Otherwise she would not have seen much.
0,"Nasty. Terrible service, hotel food. Save your money or go to via de los Santos up the road!"
0,"Ate dinner here a week ago.  They advertised a free buffet for happy hour but turns out it is nothing more than chips and salsa.   They also have a fruit platter but who is going to eat that with the cantaloupe killing so many people. When we saw the \""Buffet\"" we decided to try dinner.  Did not like the food. Just a tiny step above fast food.  The side dish was sone kind of noodles but they were cut up in about 1 inch pieces.  The beans were mashed and I almost gagged on them.  The chile relleno was the best part of the meal but still not up to par with the Barrio Cafe,  I do not plan on going back here again.  Can't believe their quality of food since they are located in a high class neighborhood.\nTheir adsvertising photos below are terrible.  Photgrapher used very bad lighting and it shows."
0,"We went with family who go here on a regular basis and were underwhelmed. While I see the appeal of the all you can eat Happy Hour, the rest of the experience left a lot to be desired.  If all you want is a couple of drinks and a couple of small plates of free mediocre tacos - then by all means, knock yourself out.\n\nWe wanted an actual dinner so we went to the other side of the restaurant to get a real table away from the happy hour crowd. And there we sat, with nothing but chips and salsa, for at least 25 minutes. Two different servers took orders and attended to other tables within view and not one person even acknowledged our existence. When we attempted to get their attention, we were ignored. We finally got up and left and went elsewhere.  Based on the menu options and the quality of the food at Happy Hour, I'm willing to bet there are probably a dozen other Mexican restaurants in the area that offer better food and service."
0,"What the hell?  I have never experienced a restaurant go down the toilet so fast.  Its like a bad night in mexico.  Service sucked, but the food sucked more.  if by chance you want the blandest food this side of england, this place is for you, but if you want any form of mexican fare, you'd be better off going to taco smell, and I am no fan of fast food, whether it be from north of the border or farther north of the border.  I used to be a big fan of the Aunt, but I can confidently say I will never, ever give this place another try, it was really that bad."
0,"This place has gone so downhill. If I hadnt gotten my chips, salsa & water immediately, I wouldve walked out. Margaritas are always awesome. But the service and food is straight up AWFUL. Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If you're looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either...."
0,"This is a difficult one, because I use to love Aunt Chilada's.  So here's what happened yesterday.  My family decided after much talk that we wanted mexican food, so I suggested AC, because even though I haven't been there in like 3 years, I us to love the food and service.  When we arrived around 3pm, we notice that there were hardly anyone there, my husband thought that was strange.  We decided to sit inside because the outside looked pretty lonely.  The guy at the door directed us to the right of the restaurant, there were one group of two ladies, that were leaving and us... so we wait, and wait, and wait... then a group of about 4 people sat down, and we still waiting... I notice that we didn't even have water, we looked around and there were two girls sitting to what it looks like the back area, complaining and talking, I know cause they were loud.  Out of know where comes this waiter and completely bypass us and went straight to the table that came after us... My husband looked at me got up and we left... that's when the waiter said hi... it was so bad.  What I also noticed is how dirty this place is, the fixture have pounds of dust, everything is dusty and looks dingy, so my though was, what is going on here, my husband responded, if this place looks this bad, I wonder about kitchen... sad, so sad, WHAT HAPPENED TO AUNT CHILADAS...WE ARE NEVER COMING BACK.  Down the street is Los Reyes de la Torta, is on a little strip mall, but the place is clean, service is impeccable and food was amazing... at least something good came out of all this."
0,"This place is horrible unless all you want to do is drink alcohol.\nNothing but poor service and poorly cooked food. We were not greeted upon entering and had to tell them that we wanted to be seated. We were then brought to a dining room that had ball of the ambience of a school hall with plastic table clothes included. Our server was not even closely familiar with the food or food preparation. When asked how the fideo was prepared, she said, \""they cook it\"".  Thanks captain obvious. My husband asked if there was anything spicy and she said the steak and jalape\u00f1o fajitas were. He then asked if anything else was and she said \""Well, the steak and jalape\u00f1o fajitas are\"".....she does not belong waiting on people. \nSo the food. The food is microwaved!! Soggy, gross enchilada, mushy and dry tamale, lackluster salsa, fideo that had been in a steam pan since yesterday. The highlight was the almost average fajitas. \nNo bueno !"
0,"This place....Oh My.....\nWell if you're a vegetarian...RUN. \nI got stuck at this place due to a corporate event my company hosted there. \nLet me say, how excited I was at the idea of Mexican food at the Christmas party. Then my vegetarian instinct kicked in when I got there....hmm....lets check for lard.\nI asked the waitress who was going around...slowly I add but it was a busy night so maybe the service is faster when there isn't a huge event going on. (I'm thinking understaffed?....hoping?) Anyway, I was then informed that they cook their beans with bacon. What? Yes. Bacon. So there went the idea of a burrito, a tostada. Depressing. I ended up eating the very \""ehh\"" chips (deep fried tasting and thicker than the typical chip. I'd venture to guess possibly flour chips?) \nI'm not a big drinker so the allure isn't there for the bar aspect. \nI will honestly never be back and from what the people who actually did eat there said I didn't miss anything."
0,"Terrible experience, don't sit on the patio. We waited at least 25 minutes after being seated for lunch.  Nobody ever came to our table.  Finally somebody showed up and went to 2 other tables who had showed up 5 minutes or more after us.  She didn't have the courtesy of saying \""I'll be right there\"". The place was slow so there was no excuse.  Not sure if the food was any good. We walked out."
0,"The atmosphere is decent, but the food is absolutely terrible.  It is nothing but chewy meat covered in cheap cheese and grease.   The quesadillas are served in a pool of grease and the nachos are some of the worst in Phoenix,  The quality is an insult to the prices charged and an affront to good Mexican food.  Stick with the beer."
0,"OMG. Worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my 50 years of existence. Here's the experience went\n\n1. Right out of the gate...Our hostess who seated us told us the fruit and chocolate fountain were included with the meal. My girlfriend grabbed two pieces of melon and two strawberries.When our waitress did finally decide to show up 10 minutes later we both ordered a cup of Albondigas soup without rice. She made a snotty remark that we should get the bowl of soup because the cups were small. She then barked at us that if we don't order an entree that we would have to pay $8 for the four pieces of fruit. I said whoa, hold on. We are ordering entrees. She replied that a lot of people come in just for soup. All of this is going on while my girlfriend and I are still reading the menu to decide what we wanted. I want to know what other people just ordering soup has to do with us.\n\n2. After 30 minutes the entrees arrived. I complained that it took way too long and the waitress said they had a large party and that is why the food took so long. Mind you I ordered 2 enchiladas and my girlfriend ordered a gound beef tostada and it took 30 minutes...no shit. How hard is that to make? I told her that we are just important as any other customer in the restaurant. She sent the manager over and he said the same thing. Large party sorry. I told him I don't care about the large party. Not our problem. That was it...he walked away. I looked around and the place was practically empty.\n\n3. I ordered beans and rice with my meal. The waitress didn't even have enough courtesy to listen to me. She brought me fideo (mexican pasta) instead of rice.She also brought fideo and beans for my girlfriend who ordered her tostada ala carte.and charged us for it. When my girlfriend ordered just the tostada the snotty bitch complained that my girlfriend wasn't ordering more.\n\n4. After trying to eat what was very poorly made food (we couldn't eat it because it was horrible) we went to pay the bill and noticed extra charges. We complained again. This time the manager did not come to talk to us. He told her to tell us the meal was comped. Since we couldn't eat that crap, that was fine with me. My girlfriend was going to taste my enchiladas and without asking one of the bussers took my plate away.\n\n5. Finally I asked to speak with the manager and a waiter called him (Marty) and the manager turned around and yelled across the bar that he was too busy. He LITERALLY yelled it. Then he noticed me standing there and said Oh, I'm sorry. I replied no I'm sorry that you are too busy. I told him I would never return. That was the last straw.\n\nThe waitress was a snotty bitch and never checked on us once except to give us the check. We had to ask other wait staff to get our waitress more than twice. If you are smart you will not waste your time or money at Aunt Chiladas. Over rated and over priced. This place should be out of business.\n\nOh and the Chocolate fountain is disgusting. I've seen people pick up the fruit with their fingers and cough and sneeze in it."
0,"Somewhere between BAD & BLAH...\n\ndescribes the bland food our group had here. The setting is very nice & the margaritas are good but that's it. The food was very bland, lukewarm, just disappointing. Usually so-so Mexican food can be made more tolerable with some salsa but even the salsa here doesn't help. \n\nAlso, if there are unruly children using the bocce ball court crashing the balls into the wooden frame like when we were there, it makes the lovely outdoor patio a much less desirable place to be.\n\nDefinitely will not go here again."
0,So dissatisfied we went to Denny's afterwards.  Sour cream and lime extra charge for your tacos?  Not going to eat here again.
0,"Have been there many times over the years and always thought it was decent food and a cool place. Went with my daughter for dinner recently and it was the WORST Mexican food I have had for ages, No chips were serve or offered. My chimichanga tortilla had the consistency of wallboard. My daughter's chile relleno was all coating and no filling, I can't remember now what else she had, but it was equally awful.  Her beans tasted old and sour. The pasta dish they serve instead of rice was bland and really not improved by the stale frozen peas. I also paid $2 for less than a spoonful of guacamole on my chimi.\nI had a reasonably ok impression of the place before--cool environment, if a little run down, nice location and outside amenities, fair Arizona/Americanized Mex food. Nothing spectacular. Wow. what a let down. It may have been a bad night, but when EVERYTHING is TERRIBLE, I'm not moved to shrug it off and try again. The beer was fine, but for $40, I would rather go to one of the -Bertos's drive throughs. I'd get MUCH better food and a lot f it.\nMay you have better luck, but in the area, you are better off with El Bravo or even Ajo Als.   \nBased on my last meal, I would give this place NO stars if possible."
0,"Pathetic translation for a restaurant.  People heed to the Yelp stars! Waited 35 min for food, we walked out. The service was so so bad.  The salsa was horrible, tasted like a can of El Pato chile.  The waiter was perspiring and kept wiping his face with hands & touching everything! Disgusting! Hostess were high school rejects lacking customer service.  The restaurant is dark the ceilings are filthy.  We never got  passed the chips & salsa.  Thank God we walked out when we did! Will never return.  I give it 1 star for diet Pepsi. There is an abundance of excellent restaurants in area."
0,The worst service they attended the Anglo first I was there with the family and the customers that were eating were starring at us and talking shit behind our backs so uncomfortable never going to this place again first and last
0,"Good service and God awful food!!! One star b/c of great service brought it up... And could not go lower. \n\nOMG the food was horrible and lacked taste at best.  The guac was worse than what comes from a bag!! \n\nWe had a table of 8, service was great! Food weak bland, lacked interest or taste. The only dish that appeared worth ordering was the street tacos. \n\nThe jalape\u00f1o steak fajitas were tough as leather and well tastes the same. \n\nHow does a place like this survive in Phoenix?  Oh must be east coast tourist, well thank goodness for them. \n\nThat is all."
0,"Disappointed in the food. The items we ordered were flavorless. Our orders were brought out wrong. Our server was seriously super slow. On the flip side the place is rather nice with a huge outdoor patio. Unfortunately, I do not foresee myself returning here."
0,"I was here a good 10 years ago.  Service and food was great back then.  My how things go bad so quickly!  First thing that set me off was nothing has changed in 10 years and it looks like a few things need repaired.  The wait was about a half hour.  My son almost fell after sitting in a broken chair.  Finally we were seated.  The homemade chips were good but the bottom ones were store bought.  The old put the store bought chips on the bottom trick.  I should have walked then but everyone was tired of waiting and hungry.  My son is a picky eater to say least.  I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my kid.  I specifically told the waitress, NO ONIONS, NO TOMATOES, and NOTHING BUT CHEESE.  I even told her if he finds one it will cause an incident.  She seemed to understand. The food I ordered was OK.  I had to use my salsa to make it a little hotter.  I can eat fire so this is no surprise.  My son's cheese quesadilla had tomatoes in it.  At first I told him it was just one and I picked it off.  Then he kept finding them in every slice.  I called the waitress over and explained.   She apologized and took the plate back.  A few min. went by and the waitress had the NERVE to come out and ask if it was just one.  I had already told her it had tomatoes all over in it.  At this time I felt humiliated by her actions and told her just bring a cheese crisp and I'll pay the difference.  It took a while for that to get to our table but all was OK.  While we ate a waiter dropped a napkin bringing food to another table.  When he came back I thought he'd pick it up after almost tripping on it himself.  Nope, he left it there so someone else could trip on it.  He came back a few minutes later so I flagged him down and let him know about the napkin.  Instead of saying \""oh I'll pick it up right away.\""  The African American waiter boomed in a very loud voice how sorry he was and it would never happen again.  He was loud enough for everyone to hear in the room.  Again, I felt humiliated.  I guess not wanting the restaurant to get sued because some waiter won't pick up a napkin was asking too much.  The waitress did comp my sons food.  I will never go back.  At one time that area had some very nice places.  The area had CLASS.  That's not the case anymore.  5/10/14"
0,"Attitude from the hostess\nOlives in the salsa\nDrinks not refilled!\nFood took 30 minutes to come out on a slow night.\nServer neglected us the entire time\nWe asked for the manager.. after waiting 10 minutes we decided to just pay and leave\nAnother 10 minutes for our check to come back.

0,"My friend Katy and I walked into Aunt Chilada's restaurant At Squaw Peak on 6/28/2014 to have a awesome dinner. The place had a few parties going on, but as usual it seemed under staffed. So my friend and I sat down and we were given chips and salsa and a bottle of water. About 5-10 minutes later a family came in with small children and after about 5 more minutes or so all of sudden a waiter comes out and looked me right in the eye and went to the other table and took their order. Turned around and went back in to the kitchen. Of course this pissed me off. We got up and hostess saw me I explained what happen she said it was her fault. That did not make it OK. The waiter should have said something to us and didn't. So we left Aunt Chilada's in discuss and went down the road to Ajo Al's for a awesome meal and great service.."
0,"Disappointed. Food was awful, not good at all. Tried it once and probably will not come back again. I will go else where for real quality food. Service was blah. Overall, not a good experience. No thank you!"
0,"my friend and I went to dinner tonight and it was great; they had a live band in the bar, \""The Real Thing\"", who were amazing; the reason for the one star was because of a waitress who ruined our night!  We were in the bar at least 20 minutes when we finally waived the waitress down (who passed by us at least six or seven times ignoring that we were even there), and ordered drinks. The waitress, Jessica, was totally rude and seemed to be irritated with us before we even ordered. She was obviously having a bad night and took it out on us.  What's happening to common courtesy and customer service?? Jessica shouldn't be in this position if she is going to have such a disrespectful attitude toward the general public, leave it at home..."
0,HAPPY HOUR SERVICES SUCKS! been here two hours and yet to see a waitress at our table (3 top)
0,"We had the nachos which were good, they were suppose to have chicken but I think we got one piece of chicken.  The beans were bad, they tasted as though they had just opened the can and poured them on the nachos.  I asked the waitress for some flour tortillas because I believe that flour tortillas tell you a lot about a Mexican restaurant especially those who claim they are authentic, homemade.  Their flour tortillas were AWFUL!!! She gave me like 3 or 4, they were all stuck to each other and these flour tortillas were not homemade.  I have bought some from the store that were way better. Don't bother with this place."
0,Myself & family had horrible experience at this establishment. Bad service's not enough waiter/waitress. The food is no where nearly as good as Tempe location. This place is mostly enjoyed by non-locals that don't know Mexican Food. The employees pay better attention to non-locals (folks that are staying at The Point). I rather go to Tempe location which is much better. Never coming back to this establishment. Not recommended.
0,"A terrible HH!! We brought 20 people for a pre-homecoming party... All purchased alcoholic beverages- some ppl multiple beverages .. Food consisted of three banquet trays( one nacho, one enchilada, one chingalinga) HH was suppose to last until 6.30 food stopped at 5.45. Servers kept pushing he expensive stuff . We will head somewhere else with our dollars .. Great example of sad hour ... Nothing happy her"
0,"Be very careful - watch your wallet and don't listen to the waitress - she will tell you they have $3 specials and then charge you $7!!\nFood was so-so, I did like the fried flour tortilla chips.  But the red chile burritos are beef and not pork.  They don't serve rice, the pasta like side with carrots and peas is marginal at best.\nBut its the bait and switch happy hour menu you have to be careful of.  They offer a $3 house margarita, but will charge you $7 saying you ordered a \""BIG\"" margarita.  Save your money and go to Carlos O'Briens, Macayos or Top Shelf."

0,"I wanted to transfer two of my dog's RXs from another store to CVS for the $25 promotion they offered with these transfers. The pharmacy assistant refused to honor it at the pharmacy because I didn't bring the coupon. I asked the manager if they would honor the gift card without the coupon and he said, sure, \""Tell the pharmacist I said it was fine.\"" I did, then the pharmacist stalked over and chewed out the manager and came back and said, \""He shouldn't have told you that!\"" \n\nCustomer service rule #1 violated: Don't argue in front of customers.\n\n#2: Don't be rude to customers.  \n\nMy other prescriptions will remain at Walgreens."
0,"Never never never utilize this place for meds.\nThe pharmacy staff is completely useless.\nMeds never on time even though promised.\nPersonal information sheet left on pick up counter  for anyone to see or walk away with.\nThe joke of a pharmacy tech who couldn't be bothered with you as she chats on personal calls in front of you instead of addressing your needs.\nMy experiences here have been so over the top negative that I had to pull my prescription out and contact both corporate as well as Sankyo(the drug company that makes my one hypertensive medication)to complain about the myriad of issues including blatant HIPPA violations that were the norm for this location.\nAside from the pharmacy,a good deal of the staff seem to be very much on the tweaky side of the fence...\nThe store manager is pleasant enough,but if he can't clean house of the current staff,it would be in his best interest to get the hell out of that location."
0,"My Girlfriend had a kidney stone - this location is 100 yds from John C. Lincoln hospital. She is a tough girl and SELDOM shows pain - this kidney stone had her getting up at 2 am, didn't wake me until 5 am when she said \""Honey I think you need to take me to the hospital.\""\nShe was in severe pain. Hospital gave her Morphine and Toradol for pain. Sent her home w/ 5 prescriptions. We sat first in line at 7:55 am at drive thru waiting for them to open. I told the pharmacist \""She is having a kidney stone and needs the meds for pain as soon as possible if you could. Thank you.\""\n2 HOURS Later they call.\nI ask (after paying the $135 cash) \""Do you prioritize orders for people depending on acute pain situations.\"" \nStandard pat 'corporate clone robot' heartless insensitive answer from the first person. Pharmacist comes over (the person we had spoken with and that had 'helped' us at 8:05 btw opening 5 min late may not be a 'big deal' to them, but when you are sitting there waiting with your girlfriend having a kidney stone, those 5 minutes feel bad), I'm still polite and asking sincerely, he says \""I was the only person here this morning, I have to do them in order as we receive them, I had kids who needed antibiotics.\"" Well HIRE someone else then! Let's see antibiotics vs. Acute Pain...hmmm...could perhaps the antibiotic wait the extra hour instead of us? Does that take a 'smarter than a 5th grader' to figure out!? apparently so at least for CVS and their stellar employees.\nOK - so NO nuance of prioritizing depending on need. Got it.\nNo sensitivity to client spending money for 5 prescriptions. Got it.\nAre you listening Corporate CVS? I'm not really blaming the 'programmed robot clones' but rather upper management for not having the in sight to install some 'CARE' in their purported HealthCARE!\nWill not use CVS again. \nWalgreens here we come, we'll try anywhere else."

0,"Bank of Wasting My Time is what their name should be changed to. I recently opened an account online with Bank of America. After nearly completing the application, my computer timed out. I didn't want to resubmit the application and have my credit pulled again, so I called their online technical support to see if they could verify that my account application had been received. But due to their crappy system restrictions, I was told that I would need to wait three hours before they could tell me if the application had been completed or not. \n\nThe following day, I received an email stating that my account application had been approved, and documentation would be sent to me that I would need to return. I don't live at the physical address provided (in the process of moving), and they wouldn't accept a PO BOX, so I wasn't able to pick up the paperwork until about a week later. \n\nGoing through all of the mail items (5 separate pieces of mail!), I found the signature card letter, debit card, debit card instructions, debit card pin number, and then a letter stating that the entire account had been closed. \n\nI called customer service to find out why the account had been closed, and the girl on the phone (who sounded like she had marbles in her mouth and was incapable of properly reading the script that was no-doubt right in front of her) told me that the account was in the process of being closed and nothing could be done. I asked why the account was being closed, and she told me that it was due to suspicious activity. I asked her to tell me what the suspicious activity was, considering I hadn't even signed the paperwork for the account yet, and there wasn't any money in the account. She told me that it was suspicious I hadn't returned the paperwork right away. It had only been a week since the application had been submitted online, and somehow that was suspicious??? \n\nI asked to speak with a manager, and have currently been holding for 50 minutes.

0,I wish I could do negative stars. They are crooks! And liars! They will rape you any chance they can get and their customer service is a complete joke. Their website has incorrect information posted and everything I have ever tried to do with BofA has been a night mare. I wouldn't wish this bank on my worst enemy!
0,"Worst Bank of America! Came here today to get something notarized. I was the only other customer besides two who were already with a teller. There were two other employees on the side having a side conversation. When the first customer left, I went up to the window and the lady told me her computer just went down. All I wanted to was ask a question, but she told me to get back in line and wait until the next teller was done. Well, after waiting for another 5 minutes, the next teller (a man) was done, and I said I wanted to get a document notarized. His response, \""I'm sorry, but you'll have to ask the two over there.\"" The \""two\"" (a lady and a man) he meant were the other two employees who were having a side conversation. Well, I went up to the lady and she told me Philip was the only one certified to notarized and apparently NOW he is with a customer. Of course, after spending 20 minutes there I'm not going to wait. I rather drive to another B of A branch tomorrow to get speedier and better service."

0,I was at coffee shop this am asking for an iced vanilla latte which was listed 2nd on their wall menu for $3.55.  Gal told me it was not what I wanted and that the person I was getting it for would not like.  Told me it was only milk and vanilla and I could make at home.  She went to make laughing at me.

0,"Do not go to this nail shop. My friend and I went there for the the first time this weekend. It took more than three hours for us to get gel manicures and regular pedicures. My friend's nails were so bad that she had the lady redo several of them while we were there. Then her nails chipped the next day so she had to go back. Now three days after my gel manicure my nails are chipping so I'm going back to get them first. Also, I got polka dots on two of my nails and the lady charged me $5 for them. I've never been charged by any other shop when I got polka dots on only two nails."
0,"The portions are too small, the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box, the serving tray is right from a mall food court, and the menu selection is drastically reduced.  You can't really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers.  The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun, but gimmicky.  The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part, but you do leave wanting more...\n\nI won't be returning to this location."
0,"Notice the word \""market\"" over the door, it is NOT a good thing. My family was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of food that was served. The portions were smaller, the lettuce wraps tasted like burnt oil, the king pao chicken was mystery meat that included something pointy. This is decidedly NOT pei wei junior, it is much lower on the quality scale."
0,Had the Korean Lettuce Wraps and an Asian Chicken Salad on 06/02. The lettuce wraps were good but the Asian Chicken Salad had a long hair in it. I sent it back and another salad was given to me without dressing. I thought I was imagining things so I had my friend taste it. He agreed there was no dressing. I got a refund and went to Paradise Bakery down the street. I really like Pei Wei but I will never go back to this location. It seems like they just don't care.
0,"Let me first start off with the fact that I literally just left this establishment. I always love take out from pei Wei so this has nothing to do with the food. It is all service. For one the building smelled like sewage which i understand can happen due to location but it took my appetite away. Second, I walked in and two young girls were standing at the counter. One was changing a roll of receipt paper a foot away from me and completely ignored me. Then turned her back to the line. The other girl was talking to a customer for about a minute  and the customer left. She then looks up at me, doesn't say a word, and proceeds to turn her back to me and text on her cell phone in plain sight for several minutes. This whole time, neither girl acknowledges me whatsoever but I am clearly standing at the counter waiting to be helped. A young man comes and asks the girls if I have been helped and without looking up the both respond no. He helps me and is friendly and fast so I am not completely furious. I still tipped the staff because I work in the industry, but I will never return to this location if this is how they are trained and managed."
0,"Never go to a place like his for shots. They try to sneak in an extra $60 fee for an \""exam\"", plus you still get to pay for the shot after that. You can get the same shots from Maricopa County for $20. Call 602.506.7387 for more information.\n\nhttp://www.maricopa.gov/pets/vaccinations.aspx"
0,"Completely inedible.  Some people say the price is right, but I say you get what you pay for.  I would have rather been served dog food... at least then I would have known what it was.  Servers couldn't even open bottles of wine.  I certainly wouldn't use this company."
0,"I have used Dad's for two events, a 25th Anniversary and my own wedding. First event food was inconsistant, dry and unappetizing, service was amazing. My wedding just the opposite food was great service was a mess. Servers were late, out of uniform, in dirty clothing, standing out front smoking and drinking. Did not follow direction. A nightmare. There were major fails in both events, but the worst part is how unresponsive the management was to concerns/complaints. It was like we have your money so we don't care. I felt totally blown off and will tell anyone who will listen about my experience. I would not use them again for any reason. You really do get what you pay for in this case. Spend a little extra and use a quality caterer who will respond to your concerns and ensure that your event is what you want it to be. Don't take a chance here."
0,"Terrible experience with Dr Lersch and referral specialist. First time visit with Dr Lersch for 11 year old check up was okay. Everything since then, including spending hours on the phone following up on a referral, false promises to send to referral dr.s and finally a decision Dr Lersch would not support a referral to a speech therapist even though he diagnosed him as tongue tied. What a run around!"
0,"I don't write low reviews lightly. Today was the third time in a year I have received incredibly poor service from this store. The first time I was told they were reserving an item for an employee, so my purchase wasn't for sale. The second time, I was told there was so much interest that they were going to reprice it. (Read, they wanted more money.) Today I went in and I was once again told an item wasn't for sale, despite the fact it was on the floor and as far away from the back storage area as possible. After I left I was mad enough to call. When I talked to a manager he told me the item made it on to the floor by accident and they reserve some items for an appraiser who will buy nicer items. Seriously? Great customer service there. I told him, \""You are a charity thrift store and not acting very honorably or with charity.\"" I told him that if an item was on the floor and I was willing to pay, a good business sucks it up and makes the sale. Obviously I am done with this place. \n\nToo bad, because I have been shopping here for years before these last three shitty experiences and I would rather give my money to a charity thrift store than some other  thrift store out for the bottom line....like SVDP has become."
0,I was extremely disappointed by the rude treatment I received.  I would not recommend this shop to anyone.  As a matter of fact I got a Yelp account for the sole purpose of rating this shop.
0,"I came here with a group of 12 on Saturday morning for breakfast. We all arrived at separate times and agreed that the signs directing you to the restaurant were confusing. All of us got lost, but the detours enabled us to tour the beautiful resort. The Pointe Tapatio is gorgeous, wonderful cliffs, great design... Now if only the restaurant could improve..\n\nOnce we were all seated we waited (and waited and waited) to order. The server appeared to take our drink order, perhaps not realizing we had been sitting there for over half an hour and were prepared to order food as well. When he finally returned we were salivating hyenas, yet still more than half the table were unhappy with the meal placed before them.\n\nWhile we waited an eternity for our food to arrive I looked around the restaurant and noticed how dirty it was. There were 3 separate tables where it looked as though they spilled a pitcher of ice on the floor and didn't bother cleaning it up. We actually saw a busser carrying a tray full of glasses with OJ spilling all over the floor, we called it out to our server but he was nonplussed and took no action.\n\nOn to the food:\nMy personal experience was the best. I ordered an egg, ham and cheese bagel, they brought it out cold with the cheese unmelted. I asked the waiter to have the cooks throw it under the broiler, he rolled his eyes and took my plate. When he brought it back it was still cold and instead of melting the cheese they removed it.. Message here.. If you complain \""No cheese for you!\"" At this point my party had finished eating so I ate the cold $12 bagel. \n\nPointe in Thyme was a major bummer and very overpriced, I will not return nor recommend it to others."
0,"I wish I could give it no stars. I had lunch there, and the service was terrible. I don't think I ever got a refill on my drink. Also, I went with 6 people and not one person liked their overprice food. The fish tasted like it had been soaked in grease and had no flavor, the soup tasted like someone just threw tomatoes in the blender and there was just nothing good about the place. Skip it, even if you have a free voucher from the hotel."
0,"Meh, for sure. Since we were staying at the hotel we thought we'd pop over for a drink and light app. What a weird space! Here we are, in the middle of a desert with gorgeous views, land, and sky to see, and this dungeon is what we have available to us.\n\nService was fine. The bartendress was nice. The food selection sucked, and our cheese platter was sub-par. What a waste of space."
0,"We have been coming here for years, loved the food and the ambience...until tonight. This was suppose to be a special night out for our daughter before she headed off to college. We decided to sit in the bar area..bad idea if you want to be served food quickly. We ordered our dinner at 6:00....at 6:35 our waitress came by to apologize for how long it was taking...apparently there was a private party with 60 people in the area next to us and the food was taking a while. That was a little hard to believe as there was a family of 5 sitting in the restaurant area who got bread and were served long before us...and we didn't get any bread. Our food finally arrived at 6:45. My daughter and I ordered the salmon, my husband-the steak. The salmon was supposed to have a citrus marinade..no citrus flavor was to be found, and it was very dry. My husband's steak was so over done and dry, he didn't even want to bring the leftover home to our dog. We expressed our disappointment to the waitress-who was very nice and apologized..she mentioned the chef is new and we are not the first people to complain about the food. We did get a small discount for the meal, but unfortunately, will not be back."
0,Horrible service! Our waiter took 25 minutes to greet us and the busser apologized 3 times.  The busser was great but you could tell very frustrated.  I tipped the bus boy $20 just to make a point to the waiter and manger that the bus boy needs to replace the waiter.  Steak fries came and were uncooked.  Kathy the manager was very nice as well and could tell I was disappointed in the place.  Spend the extra money and eat at the restaurant up top of the resort.  The only reason we came here was because we were with kids and thought this would be more appropriate.
0,"Simply put, this placed sucked. My husband took me there for my birthday and we were really looking forward to it but came away SO disappointed.  First, in a restaurant full of available tables (it was nearly empty), they sat us next to the loudest table in the world.  When I politely asked if they could move us, they happily accommodated us - and moved us one table over from the loudest table in the world.  They knew it was my birthday and said nothing; we sat for 15 minutes, put in drink orders and an appetizer order (we had studied the menu at home and knew what we wanted because we were starving), and we STILL had no menues, and probably would have sat there all night waiting if I hadn't finally asked for some.  We inquired about the 5-course tasting menu, and our waiter admitted he knew nothing about it and said he had to go ask the chef.  No problem, we understand - what we DIDN'T understand was why, when he returned, he still couldn't tell us a stinkin' thing about the 5-course tasting menu - he literally named only 3 or 4 of the ingredients for a few of the courses, and then said \""Uh, I can't tell you anything more, I know know how anything is prepared.\""  When I inquired what the \""salad\"" was comprised of, he he said \""some lettuce.\""  Gee, thanks for the detail.  Finally, the food was really salty!  I'd seriously give this place 0 stars if that were possible. My husband chose this place based on the mostly positive reviews but I guess we are the exception. \n\n  I will, however, say that the view was amazing and it's not as though the people were't kind because they were. But for the $, we'd have been better off just going to Mastro's."
0,This confirms my opinion that restaurants that claim to have a great view rarely have good food but are always overpriced.  This one is also old and run down.
0,The view for this place is nice and their food tasted not too bad but the price just doesn't justify what you get. They have some of the smallest portions I have ever seen for a pretty penny. The waiter I had was a bit of a prick and I was forced to pay him basically a 40% tip. I dined in a party of 6 and they add a service charge on top of a 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. It's ridiculous and so not worth going to. I'm from LA so seeing overly priced food with so so service doesn't get high marks from me. I won't be coming back. You're really just paying for the view. I am so disappointed with this place.
0,"I have been to Different Pointe of View with my family for Easter years ago.  Last night was my first time back to the restaurant and could not have been more disappointed.  In walking into the restaurant you are greeted by a very musty, nasty smell.  The upkeep of the interior could use some work.  The view, as always, is beautiful but that is about it.  The food was mediocre but priced at fine dining prices.  Would not go back. Almost forgot, while waiting for our car I noticed the menu posted in a case outside.  The case had a Yelp sticker on it.  How tacky for a fine dining restaurant."
0,"Great view, but disappointing food and service. \nEverything was overdressed, EXTREMELY salty and lacked a \""fresh\"" quality. The service was poor, and our fast-talking server was almost impossible to follow. I asked a question and ended up more confused after his answer.\n\nThe braised artichokes were extremely over-dressed, or over-marinated, and overcooked to the point they were pretty mushy. The salad was salty and overdressed, also mushy. The salad is called an heirloom tomato salad, but the paper thin slices are nearly tasteless (except for the salty dressing sprinkled over). The rest of the salad consisted of some soggy greens, feta bits, chopped olives and some mushy marinated peppers (i think). \n\nIt was fun to try something new, but we won't be returning."
0,"Adam took me to \""a different point of view\"" to celebrate my birthday. Super nice. Beautiful view. \n\nWe get there and there are about 3 weddings going on. Enter the lobby and they tell us we can wait for our table in lobby. We see some people with drinks but don't see a bar. So I ask hostess if there is a bar. \""Not tonight because there is a wedding just go wait in lobby \"" That's kinda strange we think to ourselves, but  then it gets even weirder. As we are sitting in lobby as older couple sits down next to us and a server came and welcomed them and brought them each a glass of wine. We were completely ignored. \n\nWe were lead to our table (which was not a window view as Adam requested). We notice some waitstaff taking a rug and putting it over something right next to us. At that point we realize that they are using the rug to cover up vomit. \n\nAfter a few minutes we notice there were a lot of high school kids having dinner before prom. One of the tables of them right next to us was so drunk the girl threw up! I immediately get up to tell the hostess I want to be moved and notice a vomit trail all the way to the bathroom. \n\nWe were relocated to a table in the very back of restaurant. Service was slow and inattentive. The guy knew I was gluten free because I had a few questions. Dinner was good. \n\nAfter dinner. Waiter brought by dessert menus. We wanted to order something but he never came back. 10 minutes later he came back over and asked us what we wanted. I replied \""we would have ordered something 5 minutes ago but now we will just take our check. \"". \n\nThey knew it was my birthday because Adam had written it on opentable. The guy came back with a birthday dessert and slammed it on the table with zero comments. No candles. Nothing. And it was the most gluten containing dessert option they has. Let me say that the people across from us got candles and a different dessert that I could have eaten. \n\nTook 20 more minutes after this for us to finally get our check. \n\nHorrible experience for such a special occasion."
0,"I would give zero stars if possible. Four mix-ups before we could even make it to the table. Staff was rude, unhelpful and uninformed. We flew in from Detroit and made reservations over a week in advance to ensure a memorable evening. It was memorable, but definitely not a positive one. We will not be back. I recommend going to Top of the Rock instead."
0,you go there thinking you will get a good deal but believe me you can do better at Home Depot I bought 3 gas stoves for $349 each plus delivery found better ones at Home Depot for $329 I had already purchased the $349 so it was too late but guess what I'll be at home depot next time.
0,"Horrible experience. The manager and technician could not get their prices right on how much it would cost to diagnose and repair our microwave. First it was $40.00 to diagnose than changed to $45.00 same story with the cost of repair and part. After they had the microwave for 4 days and still had not looked at it we gave up and decided to pick our microwave up. They couldn't find the microwave, couldn't find the technician, didn't remember where they put the darn thing. I would not recommend these people at all. BTW we ended up ordering the part from appliancepartspro who was fantastic and fixed it ourselves. Lesson learned."
0,"If I could give negative stars I would. I live in a rental property and the property management company has contracted this company to the repairs on appliances in my home. The first time the gentleman came out, he chose not to fix the main problem with one of my appliances. Now they want me to take a second day off of work so that they can come back and fix it. I do not want to waste my vacation on a company that can't fix something the first time. I already used one day why do you get two? I feel is though B&B thinks that since they can get double the service fee for making two visits that's wonderful for their business. What about the consumer?  I am going to try telling my boss tomorrow that I'm going to show up to work within a 4 hour window. I wonder how long he will let me keep my job. The customer service was horrible. The initial service that they provided when they were in my home the first time was horrible. Hence the reason for the need for a second visit. The lack of flexibility and understanding in regards to people's lives was absolutely horrible. I will never use this company and will do my best to ensure that absolutely everywhere I go everyone knows not to use them as well."

0,"i should have walked out the moment i walked in.\n\nduck taped massage chairs??? \n\ncreepy chairs lined agains the wall with fans at the feet? \n\nwe were told pedicures were $20 but they failed to mention the ridiculous $2 upcharge if you pay with a debit or credit card. \n\nit was so hot in there, too. they need to turn on the ac. \n\nit was awful. never again."
0,"Words could not even express how angry I was after I left this place.  My friend and I went there to get pedicures done a couple of weeks back. (I knew if I wrote this review right away, it would have been right down nasty)\n\nFirst off, we are told to sit in the chairs to soak our feet while waiting for a nail tech to assist us.  Jill got her lady first, and I am just sitting there....waiting....getting waterlogged.  Then I realize that this lady is going to do MY feet AFTER Jill's...even though there were other tech's available.  I look over at Jill while I am waiting and she is in pain.  She is not enjoying this one bit.\n\nNow...here we go about my feet.  Now...not to be disgusting, but my feet get dry.  The tech offers to remove the dead skin from my heels and said she will give me the sponge as a gift.  Ummm...thanks!  No word on charging me...but what should I expect?  My massage was very short...and she also hurt my feet while clipping and filing.  She had no TLC in her what's so ever.  When she was scrubbing my feet she yelled at me...\""Give me your hand...give me your hand...and feel!\""  Lady, I know what my feet feel like thank you very much.  No need to remind me on how my feet are.  I already know.\n\nSo when we are going up to pay....she said that mine was $10 more than my friends....I am like...whatever.  Where is my spongey thing you promised. \""I give!\""  No lady, you didn't give.  \""Oh, I will get it.\""  Yeah...thanks for it....from the effing garbage.\n\nI will go back to my normal place....where they treat me nice (to my face) and give me TLC on my feet."
0,"This place is one of the WORST nail salons I have been to. Horrible color selection, rude staff and plain and simple junk job.  The owner Wendy did my girlfriend pedicure and cut her skin, when she said it hurt she squirted a mystery potion on which stung but hopefully disinfected...gross.  i wanted to go somewhere else and have a new pedicure done when I left!  Not to mention they changed the prices last minute.  Dont waste your time or money on this dump.  Horrible. Horrible. Horrible."
0,"This was my \""secret nail spot\"" for 2 years.... I went there and received good service.  My pedicure always looked nice and lasted a long time.  The scrub and massage was always decent.  I never had to make an appointment, and I never waited longer than 15 min.\n\nThings started to change.  I noticed that my 15 min wait had become 30 or 40 min.  Last time she made me wait an hour and a half.  I only stayed to see how long it would really be instead of the 15 min she had told me. \n\nThe quality of the service also declined.  My polish stopped lasting as long, and it often looked sloppy.  She would try to charge me ridiculous amounts for the design on my big to that had always been free.\n\nNeedles to say, I have found a place that appreciates my regular business.  I won't be going back to Wendy."
0,"Will never use Wendy's Nails.  I had been going to Wendy's for about two years.  I asked for Shellac nails, a relatively new product because it was not supposed to damage nails.  They assured me it was the real Shellac, but after my nails were ruined ( breaking, peeling), they admitted it was a knock off, and they had never been trained, nor did they have the real product.\n\nI went back for a pedicure. What a horrible experience!  Half way through my pedicure a doctor's wife came in and said that she was in a hurry.  My nail tech (Ann)\nstopped doing my pedicure and started working on her so she could have a mani and pedi at the same time.  Finally she came back and did a very poor job, even forgot to cut and file my right foot.  \n\nI don't think that one's profession or marriage should make any difference in the service one receives at a nail salon.  I am a doctor - I didn't feel it was necessary to let my nail tech know what my profession is so perhaps I would get better service."
0,I usually go to Biagio nails but they were booked so I decided to give Wendy's nails a try. I will never go back. It was night and day between the two places. My nails tech was continually trying to up sell me without telling me the price of anything. I am all about paying extra for a good experience however this was not. I asked for the sugar scrub and calluse remover. After she busted out this weeks newspaper to put under my feet...??? She went and got this cucumber lotion and was making a big deal about how good it smelled. Anyways she gave my my pedicure when I went to pay they said they only accepted cash tips. I ran to walgreens next door to get some cash. When I returned to give the nail tech my tip the man at the front desk told me he needed to charge me $10 on my card. When I asked why my nail tech came over and said it was because I got the calluse remover and the cucumber lotion...I agreed that I got the calluse remover and agreed to pay the as advertised price of $5 more however i explained I asked for the sugar scrub and did not receive that. All she kept talking about was the cucumber lotion. I told\nher I didn't ask for the cucumber lotion she went and got that and I would have been fine with the lotion that was included. Again she never said the cucumber lotion was extra and I didn't receive the sugar scrub like I asked. I felt like she was just trying to get more money out of me and was not being honest. The massage was short and not relaxing. I will never return to Wendy's nails again. Next time I will wait until I can get into Biagio!
0,"Those of us who spend their hard earned money on staying pretty by getting nail services, know that it's important to spend your money at a good quality place. The only good, pleasant nail tech is Don. He is pleasant and does a great job. Everyone else is rude and too fast when they do your nails. \n\nThe owner Wendy is completely rude and treats you like crap. I was sitting in the chair waiting for Don to arrive and she told her staff to ask me to move so people wouldn't think there was a wait.  Then she went on to talk about me and another lady in the shop which made it very awkward. She is a horrible business owner. They rush you out and don't do a good job. \n\nI would suggest to try another nail salon!"
0,I honestly wish I could give 0 stars! This place was horrible.\n\nI went in for a fill and they wanted to charge me $25 dollars just for a damn fill!!\nThe owner i'm assuming told me they charge clients more if it takes longer to do their nails! What in the flying F?! I didn't even get my nails painted there. I begrudgingly paid the $25 dollars and went else where to get my nails finished.\n\nI honestly cannot believe this place or the fact they charge such a ridiculous price!\nAny other nail salon i have been to a full set cost 25 or more a a fill is at most 20 dollars including a style!\n\n\nNEVER EVER GO HERE!! You have seriously been warned!
0,"I am really surprised that Salon Surreal has received such positive reviews. I mean, *really* surprised. I went (on these Yelp recommendations) and immediately wanted to call Tabitha for a salon takeover. \n\nI went in for a manicure/pedicure and was able to get in the same day. Parking was a bit of a struggle on a weekday afternoon but not too bad. When I walked in I was greeted by a full wall of products. That's all you see. Just this huge wall of products. \n\nI think Huey Lewis and the News was on the sound system, too. \n\nI went to check in and there were lots of young girls--none of them with fabulous haircuts--standing around the front desk. They checked me in and I waited for my nail tech, who showed up and gave me the weakest handshake ever. I almost laughed and could barely hear her. She was perfectly nice and polite, but it was just awkward. \n\nShe took me back and gave me a class of water, which was nice, and then started on my hands. I didn't have much to say to her (and couldn't hear her over the N'Sync song on the stereo) so I just looked around as she clipped my cuticles. The place is a cluttered mess. I couldn't believe it. There's just stuff everywhere. Photos, pieces of paper, knick-knacks, stacks of towels, old chairs and nail accessories. Clutter clutter clutter. And on top of the clutter was lots of dust. It was gross. \n\nThe decor is this weird early 90s red/black/contemporary thing going on. Oh and did I mention the music? Yeah. I admit that bad music stresses me out--I'm just that kind of person--but this was so bad that if I heard it at a bar or a coffee shop I'd turn around and walk out. And it wasn't even \""dentist's office\"" bad. It was worse than what you'd hear at Applebee's. \n\nMy pedicure was better because I could just sit there and let her do her thing and bury my head in a magazine. There were a lot of staff standing around still, too. One had a laptop open.\n\nI suppose the most non-relaxing thing I experienced was the smells. This salon uses Creative nails and the lotions and accessories all reek of fake fruits and flowers. It was nauseating. \n\nWhen I left I went back to use the restroom and passed by the huge washing room and several dozen lockers where I suppose the staff keeps their stuff? It all just screamed \""factory\"" to me. The bathroom, too, was this weird mish-mosh of contemporary (not modern) and Tuscan. \n\nThere is nothing soothing about this salon. And as a new client I was shocked they didn't offer me a discount. Instead, I paid $90 after tip for my mani/pedi. And sure enough, my cuticles were ragged and unfinished and after a week my toenail polish is chipping. \n\nOn Newbury Street in Boston I paid $45 for a pedicure that lasted me 3 weeks. If you like the kind of salon that's calm, relaxing, serene, and upscale, this is not your place. If you like fun and action and don't care so much if you have to go back every week because everyone there is so much fun, then this is your place. Personally, I like calm and quiet and quality."
0,"I've always felt like the superficiality of this place makes me feel unwanted, the only reason I go is because of my fantastic stylist, who has since moved to another salon. With that said, I'm glad I don't have to shlep down the 51 to a salon full of self-absorbed people."
0,I had some red haired younger girl that had piercings. I told her that I wanted my hair a little bit darker for the fall. She assured me it wouldn't be too drastic at all. I have naturally light blonde hair.\n\nI left the salon with almost black hair. What a waste of $200 and a few hours. \n\nMy hair was also very greasy when I left.\n\nSo I am currently at another salon getting a color correction. Thanks for nothing.
0,"This is the worst, most unorganized pharmacy I have ever felt with. My prescription was simple and found at most every big name pharmacy (CVS, Frys, etc). I was in a rush and had to get to work and I was told I could come pick up my script quickly and easily on my way. I waited over an hour and no one could adequately explain to me why. They were rude, slow, and there was even one pharmacist who continually took breaks to eat some sandwich in the back rather than simply refill my prescription. I was absolutely disgusted with the lack of professionalism displayed here. I forbid anyone to waste their time here at this location."
0,"I see a theme here.  They completely mess up, then send someone ELSE back to fix the problem.      I was told that I would receive a call before the tech's arrival.  I did not.  When the tech finally arrived, late, I asked him to wait 5 minutes while I finished a phone call.  The Tech was aggressive, & refused to wait.  After I agreed to open the garage door the tech insisted that I move the vehicle there in.  I said that I would.  About a minute later the Tech knocked loudly on my inner garage door.  As I answered the Tech became belligerent & angry when I informed him that I needed 3 more minutes on the phone.  The Tech very rudely informed me that my request for a few minutes was unacceptable.  I asked the Tech to leave.  The tech approached me, I began to shut the garage door, he stopped, turned around & began to pick up his tools stating that I would still be billed.  I told the Tech that there was no way that I would pay for this.  He left.  Good thing I didn't have to shoot him.  My experience on the phone with them wasn't so great either.  RUN AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!- even if the owners or have some good employee(s), the fact that they would hire such a person speaks volumes.

0,Poor customer service.  We have a home warranty.  The chain broke on our garage door and was hanging from the opener.  Called Hung Rite and was told someone would call us this morning between 7:30-8:00.  No call.  We called them and then were told it would be 2 days before they could get here.  Are you kidding me!!
0,"I don't know folks. I see a lot of good reviews of this place here on Yelp but my experience at this restaurant was just awful! This is your typical mom and pop place. Normally these types of places are great. Not so with this one. We walked in and were seated promptly. We had a couple of questions about the menu and our food server could not answer any of them. One of the questions was \""do you have margaritas\""? She was so clueless she didn't even know if they served margaritas or not!!! Every question we asked she kept having to run into the kitchen to have answered. Finally an older lady had to come out and help her. The older lady told us our food server had only been there a week. You're there a week and don't know what type of drinks you serve among other things? The items we ordered were guacamole cheese crisp, shredded beef burrito enchilada style (red sauce) and machaca burrito with green sauce. The cheese crisp was cold and the tortilla they used had the consistency of pop tarts. Hard, greasy, horrible. It was the worst cheese crisp I've ever had. The shredded beef burrito was only filled about a quarter of the way and the beef was extremely dry and flavorless.  It makes me nauseous thinking about it it was that bad.  The machaca burrito was made using ground beef with spices. Not your typical machaca. We thought we were given an incorrect order but the food server advised us this is how they make their machaca. It is dried then ground. I would not visit here again. I've eaten at better Taco Bells.   Do not eat at this restaurant."
0,"I decided to use City Wide because of their lower price.  Well I should have known better.  I was using another company for my pest control but thought I would give it a chance since I was trying to save a little cash.  One night inside my house, I almost stepped on a scorpion and I never had problems with scorpions with the other company.  Two days later, I found yet another scorpion in my house. I called City Wide the next day and told them I found two scorpions in my house.  The customer rep was extremely rude and condescending with me.  She told me I could up my coverage but it would cost a lot more.  Also, they would charge me another $25 fee on top of my monthly charge since they had just been out to my house to spray.  I DO NOT recommend City Wide and would suggest to seek other companies unless you want bugs, critters and scorpions living with you in your house.  Because City Wide was not spraying the right stuff, I'm now behind the eight ball and dealing with a pest issue!!"
0,"I liked that they offer respray if you find critters within 21 days of spray, but after 3 months of service, have had to have re-sprays EACH month. Paying extra to treat for scorpions and there are now scorpions galore and worse than prior to exterminating...\n\nAnd to make matters worse, they give a 2-3 hour window to be home and twice now, have not met that window or bothered to call to let me know they were not going to make their time slot, leaving to to reschedule and play the \""wait around for the bug guy\"" all over again.\n\nDo yourself a favor and find a more reliable company."
0,"My home warranty company assigned them to look into my A/C issues. My experience began with them calling me on Thursday night saying that they would be out on Friday. Someone would call me between 6:30 - 7:30 AM to schedule a block of time for the visit. \n\n8:00 AM Friday morning and I haven't heard from anyone. I called them and they seemed annoyed that I was bothering them with such pesky things as scheduling an A/C repair. Just because it's 115 degrees outside, I have an 18 month old daughter, a pregnant wife and my A/C isn't working doesn't mean I have an emergency. \n\nThey gave me a window from 10 AM - 2 PM. @:20 PM I call the office. Again they seemed bothered by my call. The lady puts me on hold while she calls the repairman.\n\nWhen she comes back on the line she wants me to feel assured that he is still going to make it to my house today. He was in Sun City......I live in Scottsdale. Why did I wait around for 4 hours for them to tell me not to worry he will only be another 2 hours or so?\n\nI can't give you a review on their service because I called another A/C repair company."
0,"My warranty company sent them to my home to replace a valve on my evaporative cooler. A guy shows up and starts working on my AC unit. Claimed there was a clog in the valve. Funny, 'cause the AC was working just fine. I directed him to the evaporative unit and he then said he would be back the next day with the part. I called the next day to find out about what time he would come and I was told they didn't know he was coming back. He did show up, tinkered on the roof a bit, came down and shoved his paper work at me, and I signed. I tried out the unit later in the evening, let it run about 40 min., turned it off and found the problem had not been solved (water continues to run after unit is turned off. Simple valve replacement.) Not only was the evap not fixed, but when I got up the next morning water was running out of the vent in my kitchen! I called and got a very rude Ken on the line who said gruffly, he would have to take care of it himself. It never happened. Ken did show up after I put a stop payment on the check I gave them. He did stop the water from running out of the kitchen vent, but never did fix the evaporative cooler. I had the same conversation with Ken 4 times. I couldn't figure out if it was Ground Hog day or just like two parrots having a conversation. It has been 28 days and I have gotten nowhere with these people. They never initiated a phone call to me, except to find out why the check was returned. Like the previous reviewer, I was surprised at how annoyed they seemed each time I called. Well, Now I am annoyed and I am DONE!!!"
0,"Hello, I have a rental home and my home warranty used Lee Collins. They came out to fix it a few times over the summer and then finally said it was not worth fixing and they Home warranty gave me a $500.00 credit towards a new one. I had Lee install a new Trane 3 ton for around $3,500. It never worked correctly and my renter always complained about her high bill and no cold AC. Finally a new tech from another AZ company realized it was installed wrong. The air duct returns. So thats why the bill has been high and no cold AC with brand new unit. I'm not sure they know what they are doing. Sorry Lee but all true."
0,"This company put the wrong size fan motor in our air conditioner because he didn't want to drive across town to get the correct one. Lazy, crooked and awful. I would never do business with these people again!"

0,"This has got to be the worst Streets of NY in town. I ordered mozzarella sticks and they not only looked disgusting, but they tasted just as bad. They were either extremely freezer burnt or the breading was not supposed to be on a mozzarella stick. The pizza was jusok but not great. The cheese ravioli with meat sauce looked like it had dog food for meat sauce. I feel sick just thinking about what I just ate. I think they just ruined Streets of NY for me for life, thanks a lot."
0,Bad service. Out of wings... Really? Cold pizza & flat soda. Dirty bathrooms with bugs all over the floors. I sent my food back and didn't eat a thing. Very disappointed and unhappy.
0,"Ordered pizza from here tonight and decided to call after an hour and a half had passed by.  The girl on the phone was rude and said the pizza was already out for delivery (we live 4 minutes away) then proceeded to hang up on us mid-sentence.  We called back ten minutes later after the food had still not arrived and talked to the same girl who proceeded to put us on hold for 3 minutes.  She said she would cancel and refund the order.  I then asked nicely, \""no apology or anything?\"" to which she responded saying oh yeah, I'm sorry but it wasn't my fault.  Not sure how the food is, but the service is lackluster."
0,"Went to central care care for a diagnostic. They gave me a long list of of over priced repairs, so I decided not to go on my weekend outing, for fear of my car breaking down. I took it to a trusted mechanic for a second opinion, that is closed on weekends, where I found out that the so called things that needed to be fixed were inaccurate. One item specifically, was my radiator hose, which the trusted mechanic showed me had a lot of give left it in, not the dry, almost cracking story I was told at Central Car Car. Do yourself a favor and save your money, wait for that M-F shop."
0,"I have been going to Du Nails for the past 6 months. Tiffany has been my nail technician. During this time I have always set up my appointments in advance. Last month the owner \""Du\"" overbooked Tiffany and made me wait 30 minutes. I thought that since it was the first time no problem. 3 weeks ago I came in for my appointment and he had over booked Tiffany again and after waiting 45 minutes I was asked to wait an additional 30 minutes. I could not wait so I rescheduled the appointment. On Saturday, May 10th I had an appointment with Tiffany for 1:00pm. When I arrived at the salon the owner \""Du\"" was rude and said, \""You early, I have you down for 2:00pm\"".  I showed him my appointment card that had my appointment scheduled for 1:00pm. He had overbooked Tiffany again. Instead of apologizing he told me that he could possible squeeze me in at 1:45pm. I replied no and I left the salon. I will not be returning. I recommend that if you want good service that you choose another salon. They are not running a professional business. I got the distinct impression that they could care less whether or not I was a customer."
0,Not a good experience. At least I got a refund after the issue.
0,"I worked about 20 yards away from Tony's for about a year, so I've experienced a lot of what they have to offer.  I am writing this review because I am utterly shocked that anybody would rate this above 1 or 2 stars.  \n\nThey don't bother to turn on the lights in the back of the store most days.  The canned foods in the grocery area are dusty.  I ate here probably half a dozen times, and each time the sandwich had an odd whang to it that I can't identify.  It wasn't *bad* per se, but I quickly learned to spend another 2 dollars for Subway down the street.\n\nI ended up coming here for sodas and candy because it was so close to where I worked, until I caught on that I had to check the expiration date on all the items.  I am sure that the expired sodas and candy bars weren't dangerous, but I sure got a nasty tasing one from time to time.\n\nAlso, the prices randomly change based on who is ringing you up.  \n\nIt's an OK stop if you're hard up for cash and have a hankering for a sandwich with a weird taste, and don't mind rummaging through foodstuffs to find fresh items.  But certainly never go out of your way to eat here."
0,"Aside for the enthusiasm that the owner has for the store that place was complete crap. \nI ordered spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread and salad. the salad was bag greens and 3 cherry tomatoes with a little tiny packet of ranch.\nThe spaghetti was overcooked in a half inch of water, the sauce had no flavor once so ever, and it came with one, smaller than a cue ball, meatball, almost flavorless meatball. more like a mush ball\nThe garlic bread was awesome\n\nI also purchased a small jar of pesto recommended by the owner. I opened it just to put on my pasta because it had no flavor. I don't even think I'm going to eat the pesto as it wasn't that good either. \nThere was what appears to be a homeless man rubbing through the trash looking for food. He was more than happy to eat my leftovers that I was unhappy with. \n\nPerhaps next time I should get a sub.\n\nThe pesto was tossed out after the weekend...99 percent full."
0,Stopped in to browse & was saying what a great store they had.  I hike often & have horses so I could have spent a lot of $ there. Have a friend looking for a kayak & asked a simple question about the used kayaks @ the front  ... The sales guy gave me a very condescending answer & chuckled. I will never go back & will spread the word!!   Thx
0,"AZ Hiking Shack did not adequately stand behind their product, in my view.  \n   I bought a backpack at the AZ Hiking shack and the pack messed with my back really badly, causing me to have to go to a physical therapist, it seems, for months of therapy. Early on in this re-healing, I went to take the pack back to get a refund. They would not stand behind the product and give me a full refund. \n   The pack was in great shape. I had cleaned it by using a dry terry cloth to take off a little dust, and visually, I could not tell it had been used. I brought all the tag material that came with the pack too. I had spent $269.00 plus tax for the pack and all they would give me is $100.00. I could not believe this! I appealed to the owner and he upped it to $125.00. I told him this was outrageous, that REI or Summit Hut would stand behind their products, and that I would have expected them to also. \n\n   I would never shop there again, with this poor service."
0,I went there this weekend to compare quality and price to moon valley nursery-I am not impressed at all first off they said they wouldn't price match second of all there trees were at best sub par-so i went to moon valley nursery in avondale and got a ton of trees for the price of just a couple of trees at Whitfill trees plus the Whitfill nursery warranty isn't good. I would definitely recommend going to Moon Valley if you need trees
0,"WARNING do not go here!!!! I bought $150.00 dollars of plants here about 2 weeks ago and one of the plants had a pod on it that I didn't see and it opened and now the plant is infested with bugs. I put this plant and some pansies i bought there in my atrium where I have no other plants and now I have bugs everywhere. \nWhen I called the nursery and told them what happened they said oh well! All the other nurseries guarantee their plants this place sells you diseased plants on purpose knowing you will be stuck with them. I used to go there all the time, I will never go back!!!!! Beware!!!!!"
0,"This review is specifically for their (supposed) landscape planning service.  Whitfill claims to do free landscape planning, but apparently not! The owner, Bryan, came to our house, a new build, in early September to look at the backyard and discuss what we'd like to do with the expanse of dirt.  Per his request, I sent him a plot plan (mid-September).  I followed up weekly with phone calls, in which he kept saying that he was out of town and would do the plan as soon as he got back, or he was just about to start the plan.  It became pretty clear he had no intention of doing a plan, even after I pointed out that we couldn't start buying plants until we knew what we were doing.  But I kept calling every week just to see if he'd ever admit that he wasn't going to do the plan.  Two months later:  no plan.  Buh bye, Whitfill.  Or should I say WhitFAIL?"
0,"Dr. Babcock is very unprofessional and only cares about your money, not your pet! I took my sick dog (chihuahua-dachsund mix) in yesterday because his symptoms were: not eating or drinking, fever, lethargic, and muscle contractions/shivering. I met with Dr. Babcock and felt uncomfortable almost right away with him. He called my dog a \""she\"" at first and said my dog might have parvo. I informed him that my dog (who is 2 years old) has already had parvo vaccinations, but Babcock still ran a test to make sure I wasn't lying. Sure enough, the parvo test came back negative. Then, he asked me what my money situation was, which I thought was completely unprofessional. He said some of his patients will spend thousands of dollars without question to help their sick animals but others cannot afford that much so there are other options. I told him I did not have thousands of dollars to throw down and he told me my other option would be to run an urinalysis, blood test, IV fluid, and antibiotic shot because my dog was in \""serious condition.\"" He said he was unable to give me any diagnosis until he ran some tests. All of my dog's tests came back negative. Later that day, Dr. Babcock followed up with me and I asked him if I should try giving my dog any food. He said no, that it would just make things worse. Well I later gave my dog some chicken soup and he ate all of it! And was fine afterwards. Dr. Babcock claimed that he thought my dog had an intestinal parasite which is why he didn't think I should give him food. Okay, if my dog had a fucking parasite, then he'd be throwing up! My boyfriend took my dog to a different vet today and they said he had a slipped disc in his neck from playing too much with other dogs. Why wasn't Dr. Stupidcock able to diagnose something like that??? Oh and the total amount I spent yesterday at Palo Verde was: $513.00. If you love your pet and want an honest diagnosis, do NOT go see Dr. Babcock!"
0,"This is the worst service ever. I went in with a complaint of animal that couldnt walk and was in pain. Ross Babcock is old and should retire. Just like the previous person he proceeded to do a physical exam to see if anything was broken, good thing nothing was broken. During his doing the exam the animal whimpered but Babcock was to deaf to hear it. He proceeded to talk down to me and tell me nothing was wrong with his he wasnt in pain and there is no pain medications to give this animal and did more tests. Come to find out this is what happens in the end stages of animals life.. I am sad my animal died the next day so if you worried about your animal RUN FAR AWAY FROM HERE!!!!!"
0,"My dog ended up here after being hit by a car (I was on vacation and someone was watching my dog for me) , because it was the closest option.\nLong story short , I felt ripped off.\n\nThe review by Mike W. is very familiar to me. I was misled , and  they were performing procedures just to increase the final bill. After 2 weeks in their \""care\""  my dogs condition deteriorated and my dog had to be put down. \n\nI do not want to relive the experience emotionally so I'm keeping this short."
0,"This place is horrible!!! I got my dog from a shelter, took him here for his first vet visit and was told he needed all of this work done. I walked out of there paying $600 for medication, plus all the \""work\"" he needed done was going to cost over $1,000. I was freaking out and it just didn't seem right. I met this guy at a dog park and told him about it, and he said he took his dog there too and said that place is horrible. He recommended me to another place. After taking him here I was told he didn't need any of that work done. \n\nI would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. They were VERY impersonal and all they cared about was my money. I'm a person who goes off the vibe I feel when I first walk into a place. If I'm not comfortable there must be a reason. Sure enough, there was! This place is HORRIBLE!!!"
0,"I so wish I would have read Yelp before taking my dog here. They are horrible !!!  I called when my dog landed wrong on her leg and was limping. When I called I was quoted 66.58 for the exam and 114.00 if xrays were needed. The tech was awful. It appeared as though she has no idea what she was  doing. The doctor examined her pulled extremely hard on her shoulder to get her to yelp. He said she needed xrays. The tech said it was going to be 215.00. I explained to her that I was quoted differently , but they would not honor the quote. It took over 25 minuets to take them. The doctor came in and told me( with props) that he screened her for valley fever by looking at her bones. I did not bring her in for screenings . I took her there for a potential injury. Had I been told that he was doing the xray for another reason, I would have not said yes. He went on to try to sell me everything from 400.00 tests ( insisting that many dogs in Arizona get valley fever and need to be screened) to counseling because my dog is overweight and I need to be trained on how to feed her. So insulting !!!! He said he was giving me medication. He did not ask if I wanted it , nor did he tell me it was over 50.00. It turned out to be pain medication she did not need, nor did I use it.  The only pain she was in at the office is when he pulled on her until she was in discomfort.  They have no interest in the well being of an animal , just the well being of their cash register. I intend to follow up with a complaint to the BBB. I hope to recoup some of my money for charges( xrays) that were not necessary for her diagnosis. Shame on them for feeding off a pet owner's concern to make a buck !!!"
0,"Horrible hospital, very impersonal! The doctor only cares about money and is rude! I would never ever recommend this place to anyone! If you don't like your job, get another one! Some of us actually care about our pets and want them to live happily and healthy!"
0,Used to be a great dive to shoot pool/darts. Now over priced and boring. Might as well be a Starbucks. Bartenders are usually out smoking so be sure to time it right unless you want to wait for a drink.
0,"I thought Gallagher's was a sports bar?  I had planned to meet a couple of friends and watch a rare ASU baseball broadcast on national TV.  I arrive first, and have to practically beg to have the game put on one of the many TVs present.  (I'm sure none of the other 3 people in the bar were watching Jeapardy).  Another patron (one of 3 already there) had asked previously, he told me later, only to be shot down by the manager.  So then I asked if I could actually listen to the game, too?  No such luck.  Did I mention this was the home-town ASU baseball team, nationally ranked, fighting for their post-season?  And a sports bar opts to play 80's hits, instead?  I quickly called BS on that, and as soon as the rest of my party arrived, we left.  If you want a \""sports bar\"" near Squaw Peak, I suggest trying 16th St. Sports Bar n Grill, instead.\n\nI've been to many Suns games and other events at Gallagher's, so I assumed they would have a local sports team on tv with audio.    The food is OK, the prices are a bit steep for pub-grub.  When I was there, a Monday during happy hour, there were about equal number of wait staff to patrons, and it still took 10 minutes to get a drink.\n\nI'm very disappointed in the service, and the lack of understanding by the management.   The food isn't enough to get me back, and the prices are higher then average.  I'd give it less then one star, if I could."
0,"Had a really bad experience. Went with a group of 5 for dinner, service was poor, the food wasn't very good either. We spent most of our time waiting. Our appetizer was the last thing brought out, no apology, no discount, no customer service."
0,"So this is my first review because it is hard for me to review restaurants. Having worked in the industry for years i am a little more forgiving than most. So we ordered calamari, it came out black but being adventurous i tried it thinking it was a different kind of breading. Boy was i wrong! It was completely burnt. So we sent it back our other food came out and then the new calamari came out.  Much better this time until we got down to the plate. It was the old plate, same lettuce same number lemons we squeezed on the batch. As some one who has cooked for a living i want to know how lazy a person has to be to do that. Probably won't be going back for a while if at all."
0,"What a horrible experience!!!!!\n\nSo I went to meet with a friend who was in town for her PHD program at Grand Canyon University.  She and several of her classmates decided to head to this hell hole for a friend's marriage proposal get together.  Since I worked all day, rushed home to wash up, and then headed straight there, I was hot and starving. \n\nThey are overly disorganized.  My friend and her classmates reserved a certain amount of tables, and yet they were not already prepared for us.  We had to wait for them to finish putting the tables together.  Strike 1\n\nHappy Hour had just finished and I was not in the mood to pay full price for a drink from such an establishment, so I had one of the cheap Moose Beer cans for $3.00, it was rather tasty, surprisingly.\n\nSo, the service here is very very very very slow!!!!!! I ordered the barbeque-bacon turkey burger, and it literally took an hour to come out! It did not look appealing and so I spoke with the manager, who was not very customer service driven.  Strike 2\n\nWhen we were served our food, the silverware did not come along with it as well.  Strike 3\nSince, I have worked in the restaurant industry and I wrote food and wine reviews and blogs, I know what is supposed to happy when a client is not happy with the service, or the food.  Apparently the manager did not know, he then took the food away and said that he would take it off of the bill.  He was supposed to leave the food, let me finally eat it, and then still take it off of the bill.  My friend had to go and hunt him down with my food and so he brought it back out.  But, I was so annoyed that I left it sitting right there, to prove a point that I was not that hungry to eat their trash food after waiting an hour and then having it taken away!!!\n\nThe waitress was frazzled, the manager was incompetent, and the sound system was horrible for karaoke.  They need to close down, re-train everyone, and hire more staff!!"
0,"The only good thing about this place (other than it is walking distance to a resort that I frequent) are the waitresses and bartenders, who are cute and friendly. Otherwise the place pretty much sux. The food is mediocre at best. The vibe is lame. The worst part is that they do karaoke there alot, and it is loud and obnoxious. This place has pretty much run it's course. Time for it to close and re-open as something else. Hopefully under new ownership. And minus the karaoke."
0,"The food is poorly prepared, over cooked and hard fried.  Service was shameful.  I was by myself and practically ignored.  Go somewhere else.  The prices aren't that great.  There are plenty of better establishments for drinks and appetizers."
0,Normally I love this place but today management failed. They were understaffed to a criminal degree which is bad for employees and patrons. Its not like the Derby came as a surprise.\n\nNever coming back for a special event here. I did go to the 7th St and Union Hills location for Preakness and had a MUCH better experience. Get your act together on 16th St and I could be persuaded to try again.
0,"Went here tonight, will never be back.\n\nThe food is typical bar food, nothing too extraordinary, I already knew what to expect from previous visits. But the service was beyond bad.\n\nJust an obvious example of poor training and poor management. Our poor server was obviously sent out to the wolves and had never served before.. (mind you she had 2 tables.) \n\nThe most annoying part, was that the manager literally went to the table in the middle of the restaurant, SAT down with them, and explained that this server was new and had messed up stuff earlier.. I could hear the entire conversation. How unprofessional can you be? I understand we were at a \""sports bar\"" but to throw your own employess under the bus is just messed up. \n\nNot only that but why couldnt they maybe come around to every single table (3) and see if they needed anything? Or maybe HELPED out your servers rather than needing them to go and find you while you are outside smoking? Ridiculous.\n\nId like to be able to say \""Oh it was a busy night I understand.\"" But this was obsurd, at one point I even went to the bartender to ask for my sons water (The server brought out all the alcoholic beverages BEFORE bringing my sons water) And the bartender gave me a look like I was asking for her to do backflips, told me she didn't have \""To go cups\"" and rolled her eyes.\n\nThis place obviously doesn't work as a team, and it shows..\nNever mind the crappy food, dont go here just plain and simple because the service absolutely sucks and the management and other employess obviously do not care how their restaurant is portrayed."
0,"Best waste of a Saturday night, the fact that the place was empty should have really sent the red flags flying! Meal made it to the table before the appetizer, soup and salad and yet the nonchalant attitude regarding the issue really baffled me (this is not a new place of business) anyway, don't waste your time and money here!\nIt is too bad that there are no zero stars options."

My parents just love this place and think it's the best Chinese in town*.\n\nEverything tasted totally \""off\""... even the fried rice, which quizzically had none of the ingredients I'm used to it having. The water tasted dirty and I saw 2 NASCAR t-shirts while I was here (these set my \""check engine\"" light on immediately).\n\n\n*This both confuses and comforts me... I can finally put to rest dreams of my parents reverting back to their free-wheeling, adventurous, hippie personality types they once graced this world with.

0,"Too bad that my first review on Yelp is a negative one :( . I went to Super Dragon today. I ordered Kung Poa chicken, and I could not eat it. The chicken tasted really really bad, as if they re heated it (the taste of left over chicken), also the rice comes on the side in a pot that you scoop from and it will go to other guests after you finish. well who knows if the guest before you did scoop properly with out making a mess, without coughing, sneezing or even laughing over the rice pot while scooping?

0,"I will never use GrubHub or eat at Stumpy's again after my last experience. The order took about 30 minutes longer than expected. When it did finally arrive, it was cold and we were missing about 1/3 of the items we ordered. I even pre-tipped them a 30% tip in the hopes that it would arrive a little quicker. Nope. I emailed GrubHub, they said they spoke with Stumpy's and the missing items were on their way. Well nothing ever showed up, the restaurant never refunded our money for the missing items and GrubHub shrugged it off with a \""we're sorry, here's $5 off your next order\"" canned reply. That was a fraction of the value of the items we were shorted. This fly-by-night service is DOA in my book. I'll use other local delivery services going forward and steer clear of shady-Stumpy's. I cannot believe they would say they delivered items when they did not - TWICE!!! The whole experience was pathetic and disappointing."

This program is very helpful for the feral cat population and only a select group of vets and clinics will even spay/neuter feral cats.  We have been using Altered Tails and although they do have their shortcomings for the most part they do a great job. \n\nWe trapped two cats on Wednesday night.  One of them turned out to be a friendly stray cat with an injury to his back leg.  Although I know AT doesn't treat  injuries we went ahead and took him in to be neutered along with the other feral cat we caught and made an appointment with Dr Clark to have him examined. Altered Tails called me after the surgery and explained that the cat had a reaction to anesthesia and he was freaking out and biting at his incision.  They put him back under, repaired the damage and put an e-collar on him. I was happy that they informed me of what happened and gave me instructions to keep a close eye on him.\n\nI knew before I even walked into Dr. Clark's office that the incision wasn't looking great but did not blame Altered Tails because I knew what had happened.  But as soon as I got there Dr Clark seemed annoyed I took the him to Altered Tails and basically called them a chop shop.  Which is very offensive considering the work they do for animals.  And it made me feel like he thought I was a bad or cheap person for taking him there.  We have 6 indoor cats and care for 2 small feral colonies. We spend a lot of our time and money caring for not only our own cats but for many lost, abandoned and feral cats each year. We spend at least 5K+ annually caring for animals so I wouldn't think anyone would consider that cheap or unkind.  But that's exactly how I was made to feel.  \n\nDr. Clark didn't even bother giving him a full exam (although I was charged for one) he took about 10 seconds and looked at his neuter incision and injured leg. He gave me an antibiotic and seemed to want to get me out of his office as quickly as possible.  I asked if he could help me put his e-collar back on because he had gotten it off in the carrier.  His reply \""it's pretty straight forward\"" and sent me on my way.  \n\nI'm so disappointed that I thought we had finally found a great vet and he turned out to be this way.  We will now be on the search for a new vet. I hope no one else has to experience this type of treatment when they are only trying to go out of their way to help homeless animals."
0,"Open Road Tours nearly ruined our vacation!  We booked our Grand Canyon tour several weeks in advance, but they called to cancel LAST MINUTE (literally 5pm on the Sunday before our Monday tour).  The customer service rep cited weather issues and told us that given their 25 years of experience, there would be fog in the canyon and it really wouldn't be worth the trip up there.\n\nAfter about an hour of wallowing in dejection, we optimistically decided to just try calling around to see if any other tour companies were operating.  Every single tour company we called (we went to tripadvisor and started with the highest rated) was still operating tours to the Grand Canyon but many of them were full.  We finally managed to snag the last 2 spots with another company and there were absolutely NO visibility issues at all.  In fact, the day was extremely clear and the Grand Canyon was spectacular.\n\nOpen Road Tours was extremely unprofessional in not helping us find an alternate way to see the Grand Canyon after we expressed that it was our whole purpose in visiting Phoenix and the day we booked was the only day we could go.  Rather than call peers to secure us spots, they told us there was nothing they could do unless we wanted to book on another day (impossible since we were leaving the next day).  Given that there were absolutely no actual weather issues, and they had actually already attempted to reschedule the tour prior to the \""weather cancellation\"" due to insufficient bookings on Monday, the entire experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nPARTING THOUGHT: Why take a chance with your vacation and book with an unreliable tour company when there are so many excellent options in the area?"
0,"This guy has a lot of good vehicles cheaper than most dealers and private parties however my experience with him was TERRIBLE. I live up north in Cave Creek and he had a car I really liked so I called him to setup an appointment to see it and test drive it. He was VERY reluctant to let me test drive it and VERY demanding of immediate cash (he repeated this to me about 5 times). Anyway I managed to convince him to let me test drive the car without actually handing him a large sum of cash. So I venture down 30+ minutes in Phoenix traffic and am able to look at the car but when I go to ask to test drive it.. NO! Again he was going on and on about having cash in hand up front before i can even drive the car. Now i respect why he is doing that.. however.. who on EARTH wants to pay for something without testing/using it? Maybe it's me.. but I see a vehicle, especially one that I'm going to pay $6,000 or more on an investment.\n\nSo if you are the type who loves just randomly giving money away for something without using it or verifying it suits your needs.. feel free to give this guy a call.. he has plenty of good deals.. but if your like me and want to ensure you know what your getting.. look elsewhere."
0,"I purchased a BMW in back in 06, the car was described as if it were in great condition.  This was certainly not the case, many thousands of dollars in repairs needed, basically $4,000+ for a car that will not run correctly and it's been sitting ever since then.  Seriously, beware of Arizona Wholesale Auto and Truck; the quality of their goods wasn't as advertised at all and it was many thousands of dollars wasted for a car that will not run."
0,"Alan was unprofessional, uncooperative and downright mean.  Not sure what's up but I would avoid him at all costs."

0,"This place has to be some of the worst Chinese food in my life.  Seriously, I am wondering if it is some kind of joke.  I ordered delivery from this restaurant, the delivery was executed by a courier service, the order took roughly one hour.  I ordered vegetarian spring rolls, and a green vegetable stir fry.  We are used to seeing spring rolls delivered in what our Asian grocery stores sells as, \""spring roll wrappers,\"" made from rice paper.  I did not intend to order fried, greasy mess rolls.  These were friend in either old oil or oil that was far too hot, they were significantly darkened.  Judging by the amount of residual oil, the oil was old and not up to temp.  According to the menu description of the green vegetable stir fry, \""the name says it all.\""  We'll, that's clearly a lie because the name didn't tell me it would be awful.  The dish as delivered was a limp pile of bok choy (wouldn't have ordered if it were only bok choy)...seriously...no scallions, onion, carrot, or any other veg besides the bok choy. The veg was limp and gross, topped in bits of garlic with absolutely no flavor.  There was a little sauce, I am not sure what it was made from and I am a very serious cook, my guess would be oil, freezer concentrate and some boxed thickener.  These were seriously not seasoned at all and my toothpaste packs a better flavor.  On the side were fried rice and low mein noodles, it's just slightly weird to get rice AND noodles, both of which were dreadful.  The rice was unseasoned and lacked vegetables, the noodles had no hint of flavor and no crispness in the veg that might give it some texture.  Nothing was seasoned or flavorful- I poured everything they sent me to try to help it out, this went badly.  There was a tempura shrimp and crab Rangoon on the side, I didn't eat it because I am a vegetarian, but they looked and smelled awful, it wouldn't surprise me if someone became ill after eating them.  The Rangoon was definitely previously frozen, and the shrimp probably made it from the freezer with no pit stops to the fryer judging by the coating.  I literally thought this might have been a joke when my fortune cookie ( generic made by the Kari-Out-Co) lacked fortunes, and I am not making that up.  \n\nThis place definitely needs a health inspection, and probably needs to be closed.  I really feel bad if locals eat here, please try Chinese food in coastal California, Houston or northeastern cities because you will easily see the difference. Overall, this was just epically bad. They don't deserve the one star, consider this the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy."
0,"They charge 20% more for the same tires and even their warranties if you buy directly from the store. Go online and you'll save a couple HUNDRED dollars. Literally, it was about $25/extra per tire and $5/extra per warranty.\n\nAlso, they didn't bother to clean the inside of the wheels before sealing on the new tires. We had to constantly pump up the tire until we had time to take it back to the shop to be fixed. Which is when they admitted (and never even apologized) that it was their fault. It also took 3 hours for them to fix it...\n\nLastly, for all you clueless shoppers, they WILL put on the warranties without ASKING, DESCRIBING, or even MENTIONING it to you. I went to pay the bill and sign the paper, then looked at them and asked, \""when were you going to tell me about this extra $100 for warranties????\""\n\nThey had no answer, and just looked at me knowing I just caught them red handed. THAT'S when they decided to tell me about the warranty. Really? So, you charge someone for something, take their money, and THEN try to convince them it's a good deal??\n\nThe guys seemed nice, but I'm also a DIY mechanic and originally went to school to become a mechanic. I know how the business works and all the scams they run to charge people money. This franchise is no different than all the other franchise stores... \n\n\nRUN from the place unless you don't care about your money. Which, in that case... please message me, I have some Nigerian investments for you."
0,"I did not have a good experience at Big Bell Kia.  They could not locate the vehicle I wanted locally, nor could they get a VIN number for the vehicle I wanted out of state.  I did not need the actual vehicle right away, but I did need to complete the transaction right away, to ensure that I could use the Cash for Clunkers program.\n\nI was in the dealership for 4 hours on 7/26/09 working with Nate, the salesperson, and JJ the finance guy.  To be totally fair, I did test drive three models of vehicles, so take that into consideration to the time frame.\n\nInterestingly, Big Bell Kia (Which is rather small actually) initially told me that I should hurry up and buy the car because the Cash for Clunkers would end in a matter of days.  Later when they could not find the car I wanted, they changed their statement to I had \""plenty of time.\""   I really didn't appreciate the attempted manipulation.\n\nBig Bell Kia said that they could get the car at the Tucson Desert Kia dealership, but the dealer wouldn't call them back with the VIN.  I managed to get in touch with this dealer and was told that they did not have this vehicle. \n\nI did manage to find 2 of the specific make, model and color in the Phoenix Metro, which leads me to believe that Big Bell Kia was either being intentionally deceptive, or completely incompetent.\n\nWhen I went back into Big Bell Kia to get my deposit back, I was made to wait 30 minutes while the sales people had a pow-wow in someones office.  I watched the entire thing.  I don't know what they were talking about, but it takes one minute to run a credit card.\n\nThen I was accosted by the owner.  She started out saying that she was \""disappointed that they didn't get my business, and what could they do to earn it back.\""  I said have the car in the parking lot, or have a VIN to complete the transaction.\n\nAfter that the owner got REALLY NASTY.  I told her that the matter was closed and I was done with the discussion, she kept being nasty, and I had to walk away.\n\nThe cherry on the crap Sundae of Big Bell Kia was when Nate, the salesman I worked with (who was initially quite pleasant and easy to work with) called me the next morning 7/28/09 and was equally hostile with me.  \n\nNate said that he spent the day driving to get my car.  I know this is not true for a fact, because Nate told me yesterday 7/27/09, that he was still trying to locate my car.  at 2:00 PM yesterday 7/27/09, when I called him, he was still in the office.  When he called me 7/28/09 he then claimed that he missed spending a day with his kids because of me.  I told him on 7/26/09 that it was not necessary to skip a day with his kids, just to locate my vehicle, get the VIN, and complete the sale.\n\nI actually told him to spend the day with his kids, and not to worry about getting the car to Phoenix, but just to get the VIN number so that the sale could be complete.  I told him that I was willing to wait a few days for the car, if my clunker was processed.\n\nI bought the car at a different dealership, for $500 less than Big Bell Kia and in just over two hours.\n\nTake this and all other reviews with a grain of salt, there are three sides to every story, but this was my experience and I would not recommend Big Bell Kia due to the inappropriate nature of the owner and employees."
0,"I went to Big Bell Kia on 3/18/11 because I saw an internet advertisement for a good deal on a Sedona minivan. The picture on the advertisement just showed a generic picture; not the specific van that I wanted. Oh well. I got there and spoke with Bait-and-switch artist/car-salesman Tony Sol. He tried to sell me a bunch of different minivans without first checking if this one was still there. Then he checked around and found the \""someone else had taken it home to see if they wanted to buy it.\"" Then they dug out a handful more minivans that weren't nearly as good a deal as the one on the internet, so I left and Tony told me to call the next day to see if it was back yet.\n\nI called the next day and talked to a random guy at the dealer who \""verified\"" that it was still there. I called the day after that and asked Tony specifically if the vehicle was there and again it was confirmed that the vehicle was on the lot. I showed up about two hours later and Tony was busy so I went to go look for it while I waited. It wasn't anywhere to be found. When Tony finally was available we walked around and still couldn't find it. Tony suggested that it was in the service shop, which was closed on Sunday, and apparently nobody in the entire building had a key to the service shop, (which is probably a huge fire hazard, by the way.)\n\nI called back the next day and Tony keeps swearing that he'd seen it on the lot on Saturday, but still there's no sign of the vehicle.\n\nSalesman Tony Sol and his dealership are apparently a team of bait-and-switch con artists. Steer clear."
0,"Changed hands from Big Bell Road Kia to Earnhardt Kia from a Friday to a Monday with no warning. All new staff and no records from the previous owners. Had an appointment to take our new car in on the 23rd of August for some problems that Big Bell Road Kia had agreed to fix. Service had no record of our appointment, nor what was to be fixed, after some discourse they said they would take care of us, parts would be ordered, things would be scheduled and we would get a call. Two and a half weeks later and nothing has been done and the Manager is claiming they no nothing about it, and it was like we were never there on the 23rd. I am sure we are not the only people in this situation over the transition with this dealership. Now we are left with a messed up new car and no way to get it fixed, unless we go somewhere else and pay out of pocket."
0,"Horrible horrible horrible! Worst nail place EVER. My manicure was SOOO bad. I had a fill done & then a manicure. I was rushed, they look DISGUSTING. THEY WERE RUDE AS WELL. I asked her fix my nails and she gave me attitude? They're so unprofessional I will never recommend this place. I had to get them fixed the next day at a different place. I will never go there again. I feel bad that I even took my friend there. They got done with her nails in 10 minutes. Can you only imagine how horrible her nails look?"
0,"I went in there, as a first time customer.  Decent gel manicure.\n\nWhen I went to pay, she claimed that she was having trouble with the machine, brought me out a garbled-looking receipt, where I couldn't make out any numbers, yet the line to sign was clear,  and that she needed to re-do my charge card.  I was having the feeling that I was going to be double-billed, and said to her, I better not be double-charged, which is exactly what happened.  I went in there with both of my receipts (the garbled one, and the 'clear' one), and told them that it had shown up on my credit card statement as a 'double billing', exactly how I thought it would be.  They asked me to provide them with a bank statement - which I did, with all the personal information blacked out.  What a pain in the butt to get a refund!!   When I presented all of that, I was told the manager wasn't in, and she was the only one that could issue me a refund.  And to come back (like I've got all the time in the world, to do that!).\n\nForget that - I called my credit card company, and they took off one of the charges!!\n\nI WILL NEVER go back there again, for the poor way that I was treated, when it was their mistake.\n\nI don't care about their spa pedicure prices or anything else.  You only have one chance to make a good 'first' impression -- major FAIL!!"
0,This walgreens is the closest to my place and this review is based on their pharmacy.  It is the absolute worst place to go and I seriously recommend this place to no one ever. It started Wednesday when I drop my prescription off at 9 in the morning and they told me it would be ready by 11. I never heard of any place taking 2 hours to fill a prescription I wasn't in the mood to drive around looking for place to fill it quicker so I said Ok I'll be back. I ran some errands and at 12 noon I went to go get my prescription there was 5 cars waiting outside so I went inside and there was a line of 6 people.  Never had I seen a place so packed for prescriptions so I waited and as I get to the Counter and give my name they said it would be another hour or so. I explained I had to get to work and that I was told to pick up at 11 and it was 12 and the pharmacist named Frank said he would get on top of it and it would be 10 to 15 minutes well he was getting tugged around everywhere as pharmacists usually do but as soon as he got to my script he would type for literally 20 seconds before someone said something that called for a pharmacist to explain what medications were for and have you taken this before and blah..blah.. blah after 30 minutes he finally gets me my prescription and I vowed to never go back they didn't care and probably hoped I was serious being that they have no shortage of customers. That was Wednesday mind you and today my girlfriend took our son to urgent care and he needed medicine for his ear infection and also his rash I was at work but she told me that the same thing happened to her except they forgot to fill the rash creme and told her it would be another hour she was livid because they told her 2 hours and she actually waited 3 hours before she went back because she had to get my son down for a nap being that he was fussy and tired and the same thing happened and they didn't have the prescription ready. We will NEVER return to this walgreens. I will drive an extra few miles to cvs or any other place besides walgreens. I highly recommend no one goes here but if you don't take my word for it I guarantee you will be highly disappointed.
0,"Stay far away from this pharmacy! Especially if you're a woman who has been picking up her controlled prescriptions from Walgreens for years as the so-called pharmacy manager is a super crazy religious zealot and woman hater & refused to fill my rx like I just crawled in off the streets with no prior history. Idiot. I am oh so hopeful that someone deflates his puffed up ego soon. You are not God, John Sears, you're just am ugly man with a teeny tiny penis...or so I imagine.\nP.S. Your staff is terrified of you and your tyrannical nature, I almost pity them...\n\nGuess what? CVS not only had no problems filling my scripts (I'm now a die hard convert, especially as Walgreens' inventory is always short) but they also shared their outrahed dismay with me & happily provided me with the contact info to whom I report the High & Mighty, albeit reckless & lazy, John Sears for professional misconduct. If you've had a similar experience with this hideous man, send me a note. I'm happy to share the info as he and many other Walgreens pharmacists are barely any better & also believe that they know better than my own physician...its getting scarry out there!"

No.. we think your an immature slob.. and what the h is that burping sound from the supply room.. Oh wow! ITs a burping coworker.. fantastic"
0,The reviews on here are fake and written by the owners... The food here is not good at all and the staff are idiots. Never coming here again... Ever.
0,The crispy duck was aweful dry and all bones chopped up with little meat. The plum sauce was not helping. And the server argued with me that the crabmeat in the crab sauce was real when it was actually overpriced disgusting canned corn chowder with imitation crab. I should of listened to my fiance when he said this place was horrible. Yuck never again.
0,We decided to try this placed based on the good reviews here. It was awful. We ordered a few items from the menu for take out and we were truly disappointed.  The sauce did not come on the chicken and the chicken was EXTREMELY dry. We couldn't eat any of it.  Total waste of money.
0,"I'm sorry but this place was awful. My boyfriend and I were very hopeful reading the reviews of others before we decided to try it out. First of all, the decor is awful and in desperate need of an update... From the pepto bismol walls to the green booths it's just not good... Food wise, we had the dinner combo of sizzling rice soup, pu pu platter (which tasted just like it sounds), and the flamingo chicken for the entree... It also came with fried rice and some other small shrimp dish which turned into a disgusting gelatinous goo (see uploaded picture)... The chicken had a nasty oily flavor to it like it had been fried too long and just doused in sauce to mask the flavor. The only decent thing we had was the fried rice which the rice was over cooked but ok... Service was mediocre... Our drinks NEVER got refilled and nothing but a sorry when they noticed we didn't eat hardly any of the food. $40 bucks later we left disappointed and disgusted. Never coming here again."
0,"Our regular Chinese place was closed for the weekend, so my boyfriend, room mate and I tried Flamingo Fallace.. Literally wish I went to sleep for the night instead. First I specifically ordered cream cheese crab puffs and when I noticed I received just regular fried wontons I became annoyed. And after I tried my orange chicken I was less than happy. My boyfriend's chicken fried rice tasted as if it had been sitting for hours.. Definitely not fresh, or remotely close. My roommates sesame chicken tasted & looked the same, awful. When I brought the food back 3 asian women were waiting to confront me, heated more than I was. I started to explain that the food was terrible and i'd like a full refund. One woman became defensive and interrupted me before I could even tell her what was wrong. She would not listen to me because i \""didn't even try the rice\"" as if the old fried rice was about to change my mind on a $45 order of shit. I was appalled with how this woman talked to me and how she tried to make ME feel bad because I didn't like the food. Even after only eating 1/5 of my orange chicken I was sick through out the night and the next morning with diarrhea and nausea. Sorry if it's too much info but I thought I'd be honest and save you the pain and suffering of eating this terrible food. Do yourself a favor and try somewhere else. Noodles & Rice is way cheaper and a million times better. YOU ARE WELCOME!"
0,"Anyone who rates this 4 stars is an idiot. I probably would have given it 2 stars based on the fact, that they serve the exact same generic Chinese as everyone else. But then add in the \""cheap factor\"". I ordered a ton of food, and your delivery driver (whom I tipped) doesn't even give a single packet of soy sauce!!! Really??? Well on the plus side, I won't throw my money down the toilet with this company again"
0,"Mediocre would be the apt word to describe food at Flamingo Palace. I'm baffled as to why this place has glowing reviews.  Tried the Twice Cooked Pork, Flamingo Special Chicken, Szechwan Chicken (it's Flamingo Special Chicken with a different sauce) and some Chicken Fried Rice on different occasions, and all four were average -nothing great.  In fact, I would get my money's worth at Pei Wei or Panda Express. This place should be avoided at all costs."
0,Well I tried this place for the 1st time.. and I have to say.. crab puff.. good... dumplings.. good.. eggrolls.. not so good.. \n$37 take out order including tip NOT WORTH IT.. \nI couldn't even eat the szechaun shrimp and scallops.. HORRIBLE.. I had 2 bites and I was nervous to eat the rest cause there was a funny taste.. nothing like szechaun I have ever had ever.. no veggies.. just juice and prob 10 shrimp and 6 scallops in a big container of juice. \nSooo I guess I will continue to search for a good chinese restaurant in phoenix.
0,I liked the food the two times I've eaten there. I tried to order food to go. I am only one person so I don't want to order $20.00 worth of food. Why can't I just order what I want??? I would of picked it up but they will not sell a bowl of soup smaller than  32 ounces. Why can't you just sell a half bowl??? Oh well there are a lot of other places to go.

0,DO NOT GET YOUR CAR SERVICED HERE! I came here for an oil change and tire rotation. The guy told me my cabin air filter was gone and he would replace it for half the cost. I ended up paying $100! I checked the reciept and there were so many extra charges on there it was ridiculous! I suppose I could of argued but the guys that work there are kind of scary.  I get all my service done at Camelback Toyota and they are always super nice and never try to rip me off even when I try to act dumb on purpose just to see if they will try to rip me off. I will never come back here!
0,The Art of Upselling by Jiffy Lube\n\nBUYER BEWARE! Want to learn the art of up selling. Come here.  It can never just be a regular oil change.  They do not realize the value of repeat business.  I suppose they want to get all they can on the first sell and don't value loyalty.  They don't realize a loyal customer will go 3-4 times a year. Oh well.  Buyer Beware.
0,Dive does not even begin to cover how bad this place was.\n\nFirst off myself a several co-workers went here because we heard of their wing challenge.  When we walked in there was not a single other person in the place at noon.  It smelled like Clorox bleach was used on everything.  After we sat down we were greeted with the smell or sewage because there was a truck pumping out the bathrooms.  The service was very slow even though we were the only ones there.\n\nIf this wasn't enough when we asked about the wing challenge they said they don't do it anymore but they still serve the wings.  Hoping to save this terrible lunch trip we still ordered them.  It took over 20 min to get 4 orders of boneless wings out to us.  The wings were not hot at all.  They tasted like Tyson's frozen buffalo wings that had been cooked and the tossed some sliced jalapenos on them for effect.  There was not heat at all I have had mild wings at other places that are hotter.\n\nOver all I would avoid this place at all costs.  It was a dump and smelled like one and the food was terrible.  \n\nI have a challenge to any restaurant that has the guts to take it.  I want to a spicy food challenge worthy of the valley of the sun home of 120 degree temps.  Any takers?
0,"I recently took my Acura TSX in to get work done on it. There was some window moldings that needed to be replaced. No big deal. I called two shops and the dealer. I went with Hon-Automotive, not because they were the cheapest, but because they had very good customer service, called me back promptly and I felt comfortable with them.\n\nI was a bit disappointed though at the type of up-selling they did. Consequently, I lost trust in them, and wouldn't feel comfortable going back. \n\nOver the phone, I was quoted $428 in work done to the vehicle. I checked online, found a $40 off of $400 coupon from their website and asked to use it. When I walked in to the shop, I was told the phone price was the \""bottom-line\"" price and that their \""accountants\"" didn't like coupons. \n\nThey also recommended a transmission flush every 15,000 miles. (WTF !?). They quoted me $80 to change the cabin air filter. I asked if that required taking out the glove box. \""Yes, that's right\"". \n\nReality is, that's not the case. I did it myself and there are no screws, or extra tools needed to change it. It's probably the easiest thing to change on the car. Just pop off a piece of plastic and it's good to go. \n\nLong story short, I was looking for a shop I could regularly depend on to be upfront with me. I didn't find it at Hon-Amotive."

0,"Hot water heater installation price way out of line with every article I read on the web $550.00 compared to $250 to $350. What was worse, I was told I was paying for a quality installer.  Here's what I found, reviews for the contractor, Delta Mechanical, were not that of a professional installer rather one that doesn't care about the customer and barely ranks 2 stars on Yelp.  End of the story, I went to Lowes and found a similar hot water heater and their contractor and installation price ($275.00) were both aligned with my expectations."
0,"ok, let me be straight with you. i hate paying full price for anything. yes, i'm one of those people. i love a coupon. i love a discount. and i absolutely love a bargain! but i don't like to feel dirty when i leave a store. i felt really, really dirty when i left this store. ewwwwww. this is a yucky ross. dirty, dirty, dirty! the floors and clothing racks were filthy. i couldn't have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross - i got black \""stuff\"" on my hand after touching a clothing rack. the floor was so discolored i'm not sure what the original color was. parts of the store's floor were sticky. many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them, presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on. selection was meager, there wasn't a single shoe, bag, wallet, sock or home decor item that caught my eye. the trip was a waste of an hour that i'll never get back. never, ever again."
0,"I won't be playing here again. \n\nI randomly ended up here a couple of weeks ago with my usual hitting partner and was very disappointed with the facility. For whatever reason, this facility charges a court fee. Most Phoenix tennis courts do not. Apparently for this fee, you get the following:\n\n* Disorganized, amateurish staff\n* Dirty courts\n* Several courts did not have center straps, which meant we had to wait 30+ minutes to access a court\n* Gaps in the fencing\n* Grippy but very cracked surfaces \n* The surfaces are you standard city park surfaces, they are not the nicer, cushioned surfaces you typically see on paid courts\n* Weirdly, you have to register to play here. Never seen that before!\n* No water on/near the court\n* The staff disappears at 8 pm\n\nOn the plus  side, the courts are very well lit, and though the benches are not covered, they are spacious. Also, the center is buried within a neighborhood, which makes it both inaccessible and yet fairly quiet.\n\nThere are better courts to be had, especially for the money."

0,Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!
0,"Let me start this by saying I am a mom of 2 young kids. Needless to say I don't have the biggest nightlife, because parenting at 6am with a hang over is just NOT worth it.  That being said I've never had cause to visit a Wendy's at 1:30am, until tonight. I've been up all night with my 6 year old son who is sick. I thought a frosty would soothe his throat and do just the trick to get him back to sleep, but all I got was a foomy version of one from them, plus shitty, cold food. If their food is going to suck at 1:30am, then don't be open that late."

0,"Worse \""Ray's\"" I've been too! The girl told me that they raise their prices this time of year cuz of pizza. Took over 30 mins to get our food! Worst pizza ever!! It was just sauce and little but of cheese. Plus I had the coupon and so they just added $10 to the price of my food so a pizza and wings was $35 all of a sudden. Horrible food!!!"

I have never had my things ruined or had such a piss poor job done on my dry cleaning before. Im a little shocked still.. when people drop things off and entrust a business with their personal items, to do a job that is ... oh i dont know... on the huge neon sign above their door!!!

0,"I took a pair of shoes to this place.  It was a simple repair, they just needed the straps glued back in.  I was shocked when I went in and there were display cases of watches and only old shoes in sight.  It looked like a fence for something.  I showed him my shoes and he told me the only thing he could do was staple the straps on the outside.  The shoes are Steve Madden Juke and it would have change the entire look.  He informed me that was the look now.  Um no, I'll try somewhere else and left.  I took them to another shop and the owner glued them and fixed them for me for $15.  Would never go back to this place, not even if I were shopping for a watch."
0,"If I could give a 0 star, they'd own it.. I have nothing.. Not one positive to say about this bank.

Waits on phone , awful customer service.. Oh and the kicker.. I deposited a trust fund check.. From Vanguard!! They wouldn't let me have it for 10-14 days.. Despite that Vanguard had cleared the check with them.. I'm guaranteeing BofA made interest off of my $7k! Don't get me started on what they have done to our housing market.. Ahh.. Thank God I can bank with USAA.."
0,"I needed a backup, for emergencies only sort of account, somewhere I could put money and forget about it until the day rolled around I needed it. It was a mistake getting it from BOA. \nI need to take some of the blame though, I am the one who opened a BOA account and didn't realize I needed to have paperless billing or I would be charged $9 A MONTH. After many months have passed I finally checked my statement to realize I didn't have enough in savings (the majority was all in checking) which charged me an additional $5, so for months I have been being charged $14. \nI'm willing to take responsibility for that. But, I do think it's pretty crappy to charge someone that much a month in fees!\n\nI stopped in this branch yesterday to close the account and was surprised how little they seemed to care. We exchanged greetings and chatted about our Halloween and what each of us were doing. I told him I needed to close both my savings and checking account, he said OK and printed off the paperwork no questions asked. Really? No Questions? This bothered me more than the fees, he never asked me why I'm closing the account, never asked if there was anything he could do to keep me a member, seemed pretty happy to let me go. I've heard this from other people, BOA just doesn't care about their members. If he would have asked why I was leaving and asked to look at my account to see how we could eliminate fees from that point forward I may have considered staying a member, but to no avail, he just didn't care."

After calling them, they put me on hold for a while to \""review my account\"" (which obviously means to see if I am important enough to them to refund the fees). Apparently I am not. After holding I was told they won't refund them (again these are fees from a program I never signed up for). Insulting.

Left a voicemail to the lady who opened my account and hopefully she will get back to me.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter an hour wait on the phone, I finally got to talk to someone and they did tell me I cannot make an online payment using the checking account from a different bank.

I found out that they canceled my credit card when I went to Credit Karma to review my credit score for the month of November. When I called them, they were terrible and I spoke with someone that was rude and did not want to listen. They told me I was 28 days late and after 15 days, their system will review the account and determine the outcome and they have no control over it. They want me to go into the local branch and speak to them about getting my credit card reopened. I will not be going down to the local branch to get my credit card reopened. I am going to pay off all outstanding debt and then cancel my account.

I would use MUCH MUCH HARSHER words to describe the experience but suffice it to say I do NOT reccomend working with them. I will let you draw your own conclusions by explaining my experience. CR charges me to fill my properties. The tenants have been bad. Really bad. They have caused many repairs,.monthly. I do not mean fix a backed up toilet. I mean one month a $1000 garage door, the next month every water carrying device in the house is in need, bathroom, sink, kitchen, floors, door handles etc. then more the next month etc..The tenants are not of great quality so they also do not pay rent on time, so CR takes the revenue as late charges which they take before your rent is paid, pocket about half, collect a % on top of the late fees, rent and all, and what is left they pay their repair persons hired to do repairs... Then ask me to replenish my account. We received aprox 50% or less income to us. Yes more than half of the rent dissappeared. I have to say it starts to look very fishy the way they manage properties. I advise you to steer CLEAR of this company. I have lost at least 10k a year on rent since they managed properties for various reasons. If anyone else has these experiences with them please let me know or post it asap."

Chantel Humphreys did an initial walkthrough and told me that I had nothing to worry about, house looked great and I wouldn't receive any charges. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, she and another man I'd never met came through a few days later when I wasn't there and decided to somehow fabricate my entire deposit's worth ($1,300.00--to the penny!!) of charges and damages that I was responsible for. I disputed the charges and reminded them of an overpayment that was due to me from the previous month. I also started demanding itemized bills. Only after I furnished proof of the check that they had cashed did they give me the $300.00 back but maintained their bullsh_t claim of $1,300.00 in damages. \n\nSo I ended up with a net bill of $1,000.00. I still wonder how they racked my bill up so perfectly in their favor with the intention of keeping every red cent. I mean really, my ENTIRE deposit?

0,"The past 24 hours have been brutal for our 10 pound, 8 month old puppy.  Leo almost died due to the negligence of North Phoenix Spay & Neuter Clinic and from what I've heard we are not alone in our experience.  \n\nYesterday 10/8/2014 at 4:45 pm I came in to pick up our 8 month old puppy Leo from NPSNC (North Phoenix Spay & Neuter Clinic) from a routine Neutering.  When I arrived I paid our $114.00 bill and they handed me Leo. As I was putting Leo in his carrier in the car I noticed blood all over the seats, my clothes, body, and a large pile of blood in his carrier.  I rushed Leo back in the NPSNC and let the woman know he was bleeding profusely.  She waved me off with, \""That's normal, just make sure you don't set him on white carpet.\"" \n\nI was shocked and terrified as I brought little Leo home to my boyfriend Easton.  We frantically rushed him to the 1st Pet Animal Hospital on Union and 7th avenue.  They gasped as they pulled Leo out of his crate and assured us we did the right thing.   They let us know we were lucky we brought him in before he lost too much blood.  After waiting anxiously for almost two hours we were told they would keep him overnight as long as we paid at least a deposit of $400.  Knowing our baby boy was in good hands was worth cleaning out our bank account.\n\nBefore we left for the night, one of the nurses discretely let us know this is not the first time she's seen this scenario from the same place.  She also informed us about Arizona Veterinary Medical Association which is the watch dog of all Veterinarians.  \n\nWe stayed up all night praying, crying and talking about what our solutions were.  We were determined to make NPSNC reimburse us for the emergency bill as well as do everything in our power to make sure this doesn't happen to someone else's animal.\n\nThis morning Easton and I took the day off work and sat down to contact NPSNC.  Although we were emotionally and physically exhausted, we kept calm while trying to speak to someone above the girl at the front desk.  Finally after calling multiple times we spoke with Office Manager/Head Technician Kate Smith Southard.  She told us that she did the surgery herself and nothing was wrong with Leo. She also said that the emergency vet only wants money and there was really nothing wrong and refused to reimburse us.  When we tried to get Owner/Veterinarian Arden Anderson we were refused.  At first we were told he would be on vacation for a few days, and then when we asked for an appointment with Mr. Anderson we were told he wouldn't be back for months because he is out of the country.\nDespite what seems like a dead end we are determined and will never stop until we get this resolved."

0,"I have recently reconsidered trying this place again which led me here after looking at their menu on their website, and I remembered why I have lived just a block away for seven years and have only been once. Way over-priced!!!! This place is trying to be something it is not. I'm sorry but it is more than olive garden and someone mentioned macaroni grill and pales in comparison. There is a reason that almost every single review on here mentions that they were either the only patrons in the place or close to it. I walked into this place seven years ago and looked at their menu prices and instead of just walking out, I ordered one kid's meal for my daughter-some spagetti noodles- It was subpar at best. And seven dollars for mac-n-cheese, that is outrageous! I have been many places and have ordered many kid's mac-n-cheese (it's all my daughter wants) and NEVER has it been seven dollars! It really is a shame, I drive passed this place every day going to Safeway and whatnot, and am always looking for a place to sit down with family and enjoy good food, without breaking the bank. The prices should reflect the food, the location, the atmosphere and decor, and the service. If it did, there would be people there eating, rather than a ghost town. Honestly, I am surprised it is still in business."
0,"Holy shit.\n\nWhere do I begin? \n\nFirst off, \""Joey's California Bistro Italian Restaurant\""? Isn't that like, \""Mandy's Apparel Shop Store for Clothes\""?\n\nThe place was mostly empty, save for terrible, dated decor and a smattering of rather lively and vivacious flies. A waiter was screaming at a customer from the other side of the restaurant. Even when I realized they were screaming sports-oriented things, it still wasn't normal. As our waiter wheezed the specials of the day to us, we feared he was literally about to die in the middle of the word \""stuffed\"".\n\nOur salads consisted of romaine, three pieces of cucumber, and one tomato, cut in half. The bleu cheese dressing contained no actual cheese. I ordered tea with lemon and honey, but the honey was a \""blend\"" made out of mostly high fructose rice syrup... is honey too rare a commodity to hunt down these days? Our dinner companion ordered lobster ravioli with shrimp. The waiter brought the lobster ravioli out, then the shrimp, separately, in a little cup. Oh, and the shrimp was BOILED. What is this, 1965? What the actual f*#&.\n\nIt'd be one thing if this place was dirt cheap, but entrees hit well over $20.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Rather than coming here, just eat the money. Even if it's in coins."
0,"A friend and I visited on a Wednesday evening. The place was empty, save for a few people at the bar, ourselves included. \nI made the comment to my friend that this place gave off a \""Ramsays Kitchen Nightmares\"" vibe. He laughed. I worried, because the food hadn't arrived yet.\n\nThe manager (at least I'm assuming he was, he wasn't just behind the bar, he was all over the place) was friendly enough. Very nice chap. I'd give him 4 stars on personality if I could rate that here.\n\nThe prices are a bit overpriced. I had a simple 8\"" Margherita pizza. At $9 for the pizza, that's more than a buck an inch. Normally price isn't an issue IF the food is worth it. It's pretty hard to mess up a pizza as simple as a Margherita. Or so I thought.\n\nThe pizza was very bland. They substituted oregano for the traditional basil. This substitute may be acceptable to a lot of you, but not to me. Basil makes a Margherita. In addition, it did not have enough olive oil, and it was a bit cold as well.\n\nThe pizza arrived, and as the manager put the plate down, the pizza slid halfway off the plate, and onto the bar. Half the pizza was now sitting on the bar counter. Using the spatula, he tried putting the half that fell onto the bar counter back onto the plate. After pushing the pizza around the bar counter several times trying to scoop it up, he apologized.\nAll I could think to say was - I hope the bar counter was clean. They said it was. I've only their word to take for that.\n\nDid he offer to cook us a new pizza? NOPE.\nDid he offer a discount on the check? NOPE.\nA few minutes later, he offered me and my friend each a shot of his homemade Limoncello, on the house. It was sub-par.\n\nI give this place a few more months before they're gone. \nAnd if the owner/manager of Joey's California Bistro is reading this, give Gordon Ramsay a call. Your place would make a great episode. It's just a shame I had the experience of eating in the 'before' version of this place."
0,"Wow, this place is certainly empty for a reason!\nThe meat in our entrees was way over cooked, or perhaps cooked days before and reheated?  The quality of the food was very poor in comparison to the prices on the menu.  But actually, I would have returned my dish even if I was at a fast food restaurant...which is where I headed after leaving.  \nThe bruschetta was good, and the place was clean but this is about all of the positive comments that I can make on Joey's California Bistro.  Too bad, I really wanted to like it."
0,"Can't believe this place is still in business. We recently moved to the area and were were trying out all the restaurants. We ended up here on our anniversary.  The place was empty (that should have been our first clue).  All I remember is it was pretty expensive and it wasn't even good.  \n\nIf you want Italian food in the Deer Valley area, go to Time Square on 27th Ave & Deer Valley."
0,"I reluctantly sent my overworked husband to Joey's to bring home a carryout of chicken piccata and chicken Parmesan. First of all, the meals were freezing cold, bland, and the piccata had no lemon taste whatsoever. We had three bites and threw the food away :("
0,"GROSS!!!!!!!My husband and I moved to the area about 2 yrs ago. I always see this place but have never tried it...Until last night. What a mistake that was. My mother and I were going to grab a bite before seeing a movie and she mentioned Italian. I did a local search on my phone and came up with this place. We walked in and the place was a complete hot and stuffy ghost town. We canceled our order of iced tea and water  so we could leave, but decided to stay. The water was served in a Bud Light pint glass with next to no ice. The tea was served in a wine glass....Huh??  Upon opening the menu  I was shocked. Given the location and d\u00e9cor, the prices were absolutely ridiculous. I ordered the Shrimp alfredo, she the eggplant parm.  My sauce tasted like it was from a can and had the viscous consistency of cheez whiz. Not to mention the TINY shrimp were what I would imagine chewing on an old tire would feel like. My mothers eggplant was chewy, not peeled, and drowning in cheap greasy cheese. I sent mine back, and declined a diff entr\u00e9e. My mother powered through hers and ended up paying 20 bucks for it..  This place needs a Kitchen Nightmares make over ASAP!! I feel sorry for the poor staff who choose to hang on to the railing of this sinking ship. Our server was sweet. Poor gal. Left a good tip... Here's one for you reading this...DON'T GO! I ended up at the fast food place in the same complex which was still gross."
0,"Let's just say this. I feel sorry for you people who thinks this restaurant serves good food. Went there after reading all your fine reviews here. I will be short and sweet. Hot and sour soup was passable, the pad thai was edible. House chicken was big chunks of deep fried breading with salty brown sauce. Mongolian beef was salted jerky with green onions, and the fried rice is just white rice with soy sauce in it. The soda was okay. If you have ever had decent Chinese food,, stay clear. This is not it. Will someone get my money back?"
0,JUST say no.. the worst General Tsos chicken I have ever tasted.. its supposed to be spicy.. not so sugary.. and seriously I was ill that night.. my friend had sweet and sour...and it was sour and not sweet.. the lady was so nice .. how do you complain! I had always wondered about this place near where I wander and now I wont wander back..
0,"From previous experiences, this had become one of our favorite Chinese food restaurants in the valley.  We went here for dinner tonight with high expectations.  Tonight's visit was unbelievably disgusting!  It started off with us receiving dirty silverware only to be replaced twice by none other than some more dirty silverware.  Then the plates we received were dirty and had to be replaced as well.  As if this wasn't disgusting enough, as we were eating, my boyfriend found a dead spider in his food!  We brought in to the attention of the manager and he offered to bring us more food but who could eat after that? Needless to say, that was the end of our dining experience and we will not be returning."
0,"I like to make it a point to find the good in all experiences.  Unfortunately, the only good thing that I have to say about my experience is that the portions were huge, however it ended up just being a lot of awful food.  I ordered the chicken Pad Thai. I was excited to see the enormous mound of of Pad Thai next to an equally impressive side of fried rice.  Excitedly, I twirled a good fork full of noodles with a nice piece of chicken, and took what I expected to be a glorious mouth full of my all time favorite Thai dish.  It took everything I had not to spit this deceptive bite of food right back on to the pile of which it came from.  This restaurant uses the wrong noodles, poorly seasoned chicken, and a sauce that left a lot to be desired.  Next I tried the fried rice, which was rice and soy sauce.  Maybe it was just my dish, but it was enough to ensure I wont be visiting this eatery again.  It is unfortunate as the wait staff is very friendly and attentive."
0,"Since new ownership in late summer of 2013 this once excellent restaurant is a shell of what the former owner built. \nI have lived in Moon Valley for 30+ years and the Bamboo house was a once a week stop. I will never return! Food quality has diminished, portion size diminished, bland flavor. Take out containers barely 3/4 full. \nI would welcome to discuss my thoughts with new owners as I am NOT the only one who believes this. My neighbors have the same feelings on the recent downfall of this once neighborhood favorite."
0,"Beware of the fried rice!  \nThis place is in my neighborhood and one weeknight in March we went for the first time when family was visiting. We ordered fried dumplings to start, saut\u00e9ed green beans, double saut\u00e9ed sliced pork, beef with broccoli and chicken with mixed vegetables with an order of steamed rice for the table. I must say we all thoroughly enjoyed our food! I didn't care for the pork, thought it was too \""porky\"" but everyone else liked it so I'm the outlier.  The woman manager/owner comes up to us at the end, asks us how we liked our meal. I tell her we really enjoyed it, we live in the neighborhood and we'd definitely be coming back. Then this is where it went south. She asked us if we'd like boxes for our leftovers and we were debating whether to take the steamed rice. She says she can give us a carton of steamed rice packaged already and my husband says that if we take rice, we'd just take our leftover from the table rather than the carton she was offering.  \""We wouldn't want it to go to waste and take new rice.\""  Her reply??? \""Oh that doesn't go to waste, we use for something else.\"" Oh really?? My husband asks what it is used for and I'm not joking...she replied  \""We use that for fried rice\"". We were speechless. And just so there is no confusion about what rice she was talking about, that we are absolutely clear we were talking about the half eaten rice ON our table she says, pointing to the bowl on our table, \""see, it's like nobody really touches it anyway.\""  I'm not joking. We left absolutely devastated! And though I really liked the food, I will not eat here again and cannot recommend it to anyone else. There are basic minimums I expect from a restaurant I patronize and reusing leftovers from the table is outrageous and unacceptable.  So sad."
0,"We used to really like Bamboo House and were surprised when we went there for lunch and there were no cars in the parking lot, not a single customer inside.   Food was dreadful, like over fried and left on a steam table for a month.  We couldn't even chew through the egg roll and every bite of chicken, half of it was spit out. Stringy tough.\nThey are going to have to do a major overhaul before I go back."
0,"Just wasn't good\n\nI really hate to write a negative review about a restaurant that receives so many positive comments but the food at Bamboo House just wasn't good. With that being said let's start off on a positive note.  If you go to Bamboo House , you will receive good customers service. \n\nNow time to move onto the meal.  My meal got off to a bad start with the egg-drop soup, which consisted of a tasteless, watery liquid in which floated, hard peas, tofu, and thick strands of eggs.  Moving onto the entrees, the Mongolian Beef was tough and chewy, the chicken chow mein dish was likewise an exercise for one's jaw. The rice, eggrolls, and fried wontons were equally disappointing.\n\nIn all honesty, I would be hard-pressed to think of a place with worse Chinese food."
0,"The good: it's cheap and the service was great. The bad: I'm still not sure if I was eating chicken...\n\nI ordered the Chicken Chow Mein in hopes of receiving a dish so good my guilt for ordering it would disappear into a plate of fresh and flavorful noodles; however, the so-called \""Chicken Chow Mein\"" from Bamboo House left me regretting every decision I ever made that afternoon. (I'm still not sure if it was chicken I was eating.) The fried rice tasted like old burnt leftovers - my lover and I kept imagining the food coming from the frozen section at your local grocery store. Unfortunately, I think the frozen section would have better prepared food than this place. \n\nI hate writing bad reviews because it's the death of restaurants, but when the food tastes like leftovers from the patrons of last nights dinner rush - and by rush I mean 6 people - and the chicken is so questionable that you contemplate drinking toilet water so the possibility of throwing up is higher, you have to share the bad news."
0,"As I try to chew my rubbery, non-spicy General Tso's chicken, I'm writing this review with a feeling of  regret for spending $30 at this place. I'm pretty sure the chicken is seasoned with beef flavor Top Ramen spice, and the pad Thai is made with the noodles from the same package. I contemplated finishing the food but I think I'm going to have to wave the white flag. Never. Again."
0,"okay so I haven't yelped in a while and let me tell you I have a lot to yelp about!\n\nMy boyfriend and I went here on Sunday and got the worst service ever!!!! I actually called and complained about it to 2 different stores because when I called this Bell road store to complain they said there was no manager and the girl who answered was the girl I wanted to complain about so DUH I wasn't going to tell her my complaint so she could pass it on to no one so that is why I called the other locations which No one ever called me back soooo... we will never be going back here. \n\nSo on Sunday we went here and yes they were a little busy. Our order was taken within a few minutes and then we proceeded to the salsa bar which either the person before us made a huge mess or the thing hadn't been cleaned in a while. My boyfriend and I ordered the EXACT same thing... chicken taco plate, flour tortillas, mild salsa, add onion. Simple right??? Okay so the taco plates comes with a small bag of chips.... I asked him if I could get a small side of guac for my tacos- he then asked \""do you want the 8oz size with chips\""... and I told him NO... my meal comes with chips I just want a small side. (which I have gotten before and I think it was like 1.50 or so.) So me not paying attention to the receipt didn't realize that yes indeed he did (even though he asked me and I said NO) charged me for the 8oz with chips. Now like I said I just wanted a little guac for my tacos. Which not to mention the guac isn't really all that great. The tacos are good, the service is bad. \n\nSooooooooooooo anyways after we get our salsa we then sit down at a table to wait for our food. Pretty much every single open table was dirty too. Almost immediatly after sitting down a plate comes up in the window and is put under the heating lamp. About 5 minutes goes by and that same plate is still sitting up there. Okay so now the girl working puts that 5 min old plate in a bag and sets it there on the counter. And now about another 5 minutes goes by and a plate comes up in the window and she gets it and puts it in the bag with the old plate. And of course... my luck... it's our food! Okay now like I said before... we ordered the EXACT same thing! So now why did one come up in two minutes and the other take 10???  \n\nSo trying not to be rude but KNOWING that that 10 min old 5 minutes sitting in a bag food was going to be COLD.... I asked her \""why did the one come up so fast and the other take so long and they are the exact same thing... isn't that one going to be cold since it has been sitting in a bag for like 10 minutes\"".... and she so rudely said \""I DONT KNOW\"".... I don't know???? really????? are you kidding me... that was her answer. So I said again \""isn't that one going to be cold\""... I'm sorry but I don't go out to get cold food... and she said again even more rudely \""I DONT KNOW\"". Uummmmmmmmmmm I think that should have been the point where she had them remake the food so it would be hot or something. \n\nOkay so then back to the guac.... So like I said I had realized that he had charged me for the 8oz when I only wanted the small side...  So I then mentioned to the RUDE girl that \""hey you guys charged me for the large side when I only wanted the small side\"".... and she said \""WELL IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME\""... ??????? what really???? it's totally not the same. You guys are now charging me for chips when my meal comes with a small bag. yes it was a lot more chips then we usually get but the point is... We didn't want them! So then I mentioned to her that my meal comes with chips and that I didn't want to buy extra chips and then SHE TURNS AROUND... GRABS THE TWO SMALL BAGS OF CHIPS THAT THE MEAL COMES WITH, BASICALLY SMASHES THEM IN HER HAND WHILE SHOVING THEM AT ME, AND PRETTY MUCH SAYS... HERE'S YOUR CHIPS. \n\nLike I said... the tacos are good - BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO COME BACK AND BE TREATED LIKE GARBAGE BY SOME GIRL. I am a paying customer that doesn't like to pay for cold food, be charged extra for something that I didn't order, call to talk to a manager and be told that there is no manager, call and complain to not one but TWO different locations and be told by TWO different locations that a manager will call me back and have TWO different locations NOT CALL ME BACK! \n\nWILL NEVER GO BACK!"
0,"My friend and i drove 25 miles to get to a yoga class at 2:00pm, we get there 5 minutes late and they did not let us in.  We did all we could to get there on time and the lady at the front desk asked us to leave and to arrive on time next time.  \n\nI asked her since we drove such a long way to come to this place can we get in?  She still said no.  I felt so hurt at all the effort we put in.  She was looking at us funny because I am Mexican and my friend is Black.  We have both practiced yoga for a while now.\n\nSince then, I will not got back due to poor customer response.  I will not recommend this place to any of my friends."
0,"This is a hair salon that does nails on the side. I think if nails were the main source of revenue they would be better at it and have a wide variety of name brand polishes to choose from.\n\nThe manicure was below average, I should have suspected as much when I saw the condition of my manicurist's nails & cuticles.\n\nI will not be returning."
0,"I've lived in a number of apartments over the years and Crystal Creek was, by far, my favorite. It was a third floor one bedroom with a balcony that overlooked the pool. Since that balcony was on the west side I got a lot of sun some days but the sunsets and the thunderstorms made it worth it. I've often thought fondly of that apartment...\n\nThat was 7 years ago. Today, I learned that a few months ago Crystal Creek put a derogatory note on my credit for $62, lowering my score by 80 points. Seriously? After 7 years? Over sixty two dollars?\n\nI still don't even know what it was for. They haven't contacted me once in all this time - even though I lived in a property owned by their management company for three years after leaving Crystal Creek.\n\nThey insist that they're owed the money, too. I still don't know why. So now we have to go to court because I insist that they're high.\n\nDo you really want to live in a place where they'll go after your credit 7 years after the fact for a measly $62 without so much as a phone call?"
0,"I typically really enjoy Chili's and think the food and service is great. This is the first time at this location and will be the last. We went there for lunch last week and had horrible service and we were not even there during \""lunch rush\"". The waitress was not busy had maybe two other tables the entire time we were there. Yet, two tables that were sat after us in a different section received their food before us, even though we had ordered first. \n\nChips were greasy, food was cold and was impossible to get a refill on drinks. Next time we are craving Chili's we will drive a few extra miles and go to the Chili's at PV Mall."
0,"Okay. I love chili's and my family always loved doing a quick chili's to go order for Friday dinner. Since moving with my fiance to this location, I haven't had that experience! Tonight we ordered 2 buffalo chicken sangwiches. Simple! We get home and we have breaded chicken sangwiches with mayo.....okay. the rest of the order is fine so I call back and re ordered. My fiance and I didn't get to sit down to eat till 10;30pm! And what do we find? Another chicken w/mayo with wing sauce on the side....one with wing sauce and nothing else. \n\nThese guys were not busy when I went in to the To Go entrance and seeing as they ruined this simple order twice within an hour, means they've got some pretty bad cooks, or some pretty bad attitudes. \n\nOh and the fries were cold both times. Like not even \""to go\"" cooled...we live 3 blocks from the place!"
0,"Ate here with a friend because we were starving and it was easy. ...not so fast. The place was filthy, wait staff ignored us for 15 minutes literally...I had to do the \""hey miss can we get some service thing\"" when she began helping people that had just sat down.\nThe food wad meh and frankly I couldn't get past the dirt factor. ....tables, floor, etc.  Neither one of us could continue.... her"
0,"OH MY GOD.\n\nI completely understand how employees want to go home and not have people walking in when they are closing; but one day my mom and my siblings came to this location maybe 2-3 hours before closing time so  we thought we were okay.\nNO. The waitress barely had that many people to wait on and it took her a million decades to get us anything whether it be drinks or food. You almost did not want to ask for anything just because we wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP. We already knew what we wanted for a good 30 minutes before she came back and took our order.  Then we got our order maybe another hour to an hour and a half later! SWEET. By that time my mom being the feisty little Filipino lady that she is was absolutely livid and was complaining about when we would get our food. I don't rush people yes i am irritated and hungry but i will not rush you or get loud.  God only knows what they could do to my food behind closed doors. \n\n    So after staying at this location for 2 hours or so because of the long wait for everything i am slightly scared to go back to any chilis but i love their strawberry lemonade so its hard to refuse based on one girls performance or lack of.  As i finish my review on their not good food quality and piss poor service i cannot help but notice another girl had the same issue in june and i almost wonder if we had the same female who had waited on us and literally waited before taking our orders and giving us anything. If i went to this location which i highly doubt we will, i hope to god she is or was fired because if you cannot handle a couple tables and are no where to be found majority of the time something is just not right about that.  I am sorry. This is Arizona honey work laws suck here and if you aren't a decent worker you should not have a job unless you are being a brown noser with the managers and that's the only reason you are there is one of the many reasons i hate hate HATE Arizona work laws with a passion. But that is a whole other story."
0,"Have you ever gotten to a restaurant and then wanted to stab yourself in the hand with a fork? Me neither.\n\nThis was my reaction to chilis. I don't ever remember this local neighborhood joint being tasty, but the boyfriend and I edge starving and decided to give it a whirl. \n\nOur whirl was consistent of waiting in the lobby for over 5 minutes for the hostess to acknowledgments us. Not sure where she was but we waited patiently. As a side note, it was 9 pm, and we were the only folks on the lobby.\n\nWhen we finally got our table, the table was still wet from being cleaned. This does not feel good when one is wearing shorts. The menus were disgusting. They were sticky, ripped, faded, food stuck on gross.\n\nNeedless to say we actually walked out of the restaurant.\n\nOne star only because I cant put zero and the waitress didn't ask us to pay for our iced tea."
0,Rude bartender\nNeeds to learn how to fix drinks instead of arguing about it...specially when someone in training is making them and he didn't offer to help or fix the matter.....
0,"We were hungry and I was thinking Chili's would be much like Applebee's. You know great food and service? Well boy was I wrong. \nThe restaurant was super loud and it was difficult to talk. We were hungry and ordered \nNachos. Seems like an easy plate to make, but they bring us 5 chips (no kidding!) with beans and cheese on them (sort of like mini cheese crisps). The presentation was horrible, they tasted even worse. I end up ordering a chicken salad and my friend something like a rice black bean bowl. I was brought a huge salad that looked awful and tasted worse. Just wilted lettuce and chicken (that tasted like it was old). I ate two bites and had had enough. The waitress had no desire to provide us with any level of service and kept on coming back to us almost rushing us to leave. This was almost the worse dining experience ever! Stay Away! $30 for a awful appetizer and two entrees. Never again."
0,"Seriously what the hell happened to this location!?! I used to come here ALL the time over the past 2 years but I haven't been here for a couple months and disappointing is all I have to say. Came in and sat at the bar for lunch on Saturday it really wasn't that busy and it was just one thing after another. My friend and I had ordered almost the same exact meal (just slightly different) we had the fajita trio I had mine plain and she wanted hers with all the peppers, onions and spices. So our food comes out and to our surprise there is only ONE plate! Seriously idk how this guy did not here the TWO separate orders. Of course at that point we are forced to send it back and wait for another 20+ minutes for our food to come out. And of course I had to talk to the manager to make sure they didn't just put that one plate (that was completely plain mind you) under the heat lamp to sit there while they cooked the other one. I'm not going to eat some nasty heat lamp food because you messed up.\nSo finally the food comes out after 25 minutes and the next thing I know is I look down and my plate has all sorts of spice on top of the beef, shrimp & chicken. I ask the guy why is all this nasty red spice sauce is on there and he tells me he thought I said I just didn't want peppers & onions. What part of PLAIN is that difficult to understand especially after the first plate that was brought out didn't have anything on it!\n\nNeedless to say the newer manager didn't do a damn thing no discount no apology absolutely nothing. What was supposed to be just lunch ended up into an early dinner because of their constant mistakes. I never have had a problem here so this was disappointing to say the least. I even remember when the manager who was there at the time first started & it wasn't too long ago and even then he was completely useless with a very unruly customer who was a constant disruption. Seriously bring back the Chili's I'm used to!!"
0,Ammaccapanes very bad customer will keep me from ever stepping foot inside again. I work near buy and myself and coworkers frequent it. Lindsay the bar tender and john the bouncer have alway treated me very well. Oct 6 2013 1030pm I took a friend there for a beer and wings. The male bartender put in my order and brougt me a sm pitcher of kilt. My friend got a blue moon. I was waiting for my wings it wasn't busy as I finished my 1st beer. Second beer down still no wings last half beer started and I asked bartender to cancel wings. If I can't enjoy them with the beer what's the point. He acted as if I was being an a$$. And told me he won't void it cause he will have to pay for it. All with attitude. He checked the ticket time and it was over22 min for Wings wtf. I'm not paying for them I stated. He then explained how his boss the owner makes them pay for all voids and walkouts. This is illegal. The attitude and the owner being a jack hole is why I will never return. I will miss lindsay she was always great. If the male bartenders story was true or not. I paid for the drinks gave the tender some labor advice tipped to cover the wings and left. Sad and unhappy. This place craps on it guests threw the owners bad managing and the male bartender has no clue what customer service is about. Don't waste your time or money here unless lindsay is at the bar. Really.
0,Bad bad service.  And with attitude. Everytime I give it another try I regret it.
0,"Ordered a pizza and cheesebread for carryout, when I arrived I was informed that they do not handle bills larger than $20.\n\nAfter trying to \""break\"" my valid US currency at the nearby CVS (which would not...)\n\nI went back, to have the manager tell me they could not accept my valid US currency.\n\nI guess throwing away food is better customer service than accepting a paying customers money.\n\nI won't be back."
0,This place has crappy customer service. They forgot part of our order from tonight. When we called to get it corrected the manager was rude and unhelpful.
0,"This is a HORRIBLE Pizza Hut location. I don't know what their problem is. I've had orders messed up five different times now. One of the times the manager gave me a credit for a free pizza, yet next time I called in the other manager said that I couldn't have it for free, but only a discounted price. THEY HAVE AN ACCOUNT FOR ME ON FILE, it's not like I just pulled that out of my A** when I called back!!\n\nOur food has been incorrect, things have been missing, and it has shown up bone dry before. No fun, and they don't even act like they care when you call.\n\nThe latest debacle this evening was the wings. I like my wings saucy. Shouldn't be a problem, right? A long time ago, I ordered their wings and they were mostly dry. So from that point forward, I ordered extra sauce, which you have to pay 50 cents more. Yet every time I did that, the wings were drowning in sauce, so I didn't even need the extra sauce on the side. I kept paying for extra sauce for no reason. Tonight, I orders wings (no extra sauce) and just put a note to make sure the wings were sauced well. \n\nMy order is delivered...NO blue cheese that I paid money for, and the wings have spots where there isn't any wing sauce on them at all. Seriously??!!!!!\n\nI called and spoke with an extremely unhelpful guy, he sounded young. He wasn't listening to what I was trying to say and at one point said that I could order my wings without sauce on them. WTF my problem is that you guys don't put enough sauce on them!!! He then went on to say that my note said extra sauce and since I didn't pay they didn't put it on. Yet A) my note never said \""extra\"" and B) I always got the phone call from them in the past saying if you want extra sauce you have to pay the driver 50 cents. No phone call this time. I assumed that my directions in basic English would be clear to the average Pizza Hut worker. He said it's how they \""interpret\"" the note.\n\nThere is another Pizza Hut location closer to me, but for some reason this is the one that is assigned my address for delivery. Apparently the credit that they wanted to give me for the blue cheese is only good if I order from their location again. What a joke. I told them to not bother with the credit and hung up.\nI guess from now on we will only be eating Pizza Hut if we want to pick up our order, since we're done with this location for good."
0,"RUN AWAY. They may have a Pizza Hut sign and Pizza Hut food, but with the service you get, you would think you are in a back alley getting surgery from Michael J Fox. Metaphor aside, this location is TERRIBLE. Spend the time to go to a different location. They have an average of 2.5 stars for a reason. I placed an order online at 8:09 that was followed immediately by the email saying my food will be delivered at 8:39. At 8:20 I missed a call because I'm busy enjoying a laughter filled night in with my boyfriend. I check my phone to see the time at 8:21 and saw that I just missed a call from a number I didn't know.  FYI - I'm new to the area and AZ in general so every number is foreign to me.  I check to see if I have a voicemail from that number......NOPE....I go on about my night.  Fast forward to  8:59 when I checked my phone again (20 minutes after my food was supposed to arrive), I get frustrated thinking the food should have been here.  I look up their number and give Pizza Hut a call **SPOILER ALERT** It was Pizza Hut at 8:20pm.\n\nI call back, asking what's going on and instead of getting any information, I get told, \""Hold on.\"" Then I'm talking to someone new. Adam. Who I can assume is a manager, maybe? Anyway, I come to find out that my card was declined (thanks Chick Fil A and your security breech) and that they cancelled the order after I didn't answer my phone (because no American has more than one credit card). I bring up that I didn't have a voicemail from said caller which contradicts their policy/protocol which IS to leave a message. Said manager ADMITED that she (female caller) didn't follow protocol and had no sympathy that now an hour has passed and I'm a very unsatisfied client. Did you get that?.. The manager ADMITTED that they didn't follow proper protocol for this situation.  Adam, like a robot, kept repeating, \""the best I can do is give you a $5 credit.\""  Adam said they canceled the order after I didn't pick up the phone.  That's how disposable of a customer I am?? You're too lazy to leave a voicemail?? What if I was taking a shit? Screw me, I guess since I missed your call I don't get dinner tonight.  I'm supposed to have pizza hut's number memorized and know that a random 623 number was them?? Oh wait.... I would assume any reputable business would in fact leave a Voicemail if they needed to get in touch with me. \n\nOk well I'll remember that the next time I'm hungry. Oh balls, that's now. Well at least I have credits. They're low in fiber, just like everything else...because they're NOT FOOD! What could have made it right? Say \""I'm sorry,\"" I'll give you a different card and you get someone to bring me the dinner I ordered. But who am I? I'm just a simple girl with simple expectations.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and DO NOT expect any customer service from this location. Go elsewhere. I will be driving to a different Pizza Hut just to avoid this kind of awful handling of issues that arise. I know things happen but the way you deal with them is how you retain customers. Shame on you Pizza Hut.  I asked Adam, \""Is it worth it to you to lose a customer who just moved to your area over a $16 order?\""..... Apparently the answer is YES.  Employees don't follow protocol and do their due diligence to ensure their running a smooth a customer focused/customer satisfied business.  Worst Franchise EVERRRRR!"
0,"Just had the most frustrating experience I have ever had at any shipping location.  All we wanted to do was ship a package from Phoenix to Chicago.  The person we talked to had no idea how the process works or any suggestions to help us ensure the package would arrive next day.  When we inquired about sending it to a FedEx location instead of the home address to ensure someone could pick it up, she was absolutely no help in finding a FedEx location anywhere close.  She just wanted to say here computer would not let her search locations.  Really, you can't search FedEx locations from a FedEx????  We asked about Saturday delivery and she had no idea how that worked or what would happen to the package if it couldn't be delivered on Friday.  She wanted to talk about everything but shipping the package.  It was almost like she couldn't hear because she paid no attention to the questions we were asking.  We finally get a price and it is outrageous and she quotes a time different than what we filled out on the slip.  I came home and found a FedEx location very close to where we were trying to ship the package in about 60 seconds on the FedEx site.  We were quoted $160+ for overnight.  Per the FedEx site we got a quote for $110 using generous measurements.  We also got a quote for $77 for Saturday delivery which the store person couldn't even come close to figuring out.  Ultimately we took the package to UPS and shipped for Saturday delivery at $75, less than half of the only option the clerk could come up with.  I have shipped thousands of items with FedEx, UPS, USPS etc. and you do have to ask questions or you can be disappointed.  This gal clearly has not been trained and I don't have enough time to do their job for them.  We were there 30 minutes and finally left because we couldn't get anywhere.  Ultimately we also saved $85 or more than half so the extra hour to get it all done was worth it.  That will be the last time I use this FedEx."
0,"On the upside, they have a lot of equipment, services, and classes. They offer it at a great price and the hours are convenient, however for working 3rd shift the classes I would want to do aren't offered early enough for me.\n\nDownside was offered a free hour of personal training when I signed up. Once the personal trainer found out I had no plans to continue personal training, they had no interest in me and were very dismissive.\n\nThe BIG Downside and reason I'll never go there again. The only payment they accept is automatic withdrawals from my checking account/credit card. Was going out of state for a few months and wanted to cancel my membership. Went in and they refused to cancel it there... even though I signed up there. They stated I had to fill out a form and send it to the California office. Sent it out and was still getting charged. Repeated the process. Still got charged. After the third time and me STILL getting charged, closed my checking account against them. \nThen they had the nerve to threaten to send me to a collection agency for not paying the bill. I stated they could go ahead, I'd be happy to take it to court and get my money back for the months of them billing me after I initially tried closing the account. Found out later, LA Fitness has a policy that anyone who tried to close the account and doesn't send it certified mail, they just throw the letters away. I know they've had a few class action lawsuits against them, and can't remember if this was one of them."
0,"I wish you could leave a rating with 0 stars, because that is the quality of service you receive with LA Fitness!  \n\nWhere to start really...Monitor your account, they will try to double charge your account, and make charges to your account that they can't even explain themselves what the charges are from.  Front desk is extremely rude so forget about asking any questions to the members that work there.  Direct all your questions and complaints to the GM who is never there, and who never returns your phone calls.  I could go on forever on this, but review space here is limited and my main focal point of frustration is their kids care service.\n\nPlease, I repeat PLEASE do not bring your child here.  If you love your child and care for their well being (as most parents do), do NOT bring your child here.  The people that are paid to watch over and take care of your children do not even interact with them or watch them.  Instead you can find them sitting in a corner playing on their cell phones or having inappropriate conversation in front of your children with other employees.  If your child has any kind of altercation they discipline them by yelling at them and sending them to a corner until you pick them up.  Now I don't mind disciplining my child my self when my daughter gets in trouble but I will be damned if someone else does it.  If there is a problem the parent should be contacted immediately and let them resolve the issue.  We provide the gym with both of our cell phone numbers that are with us at all times, and the part of the gym that we never leave.  There should be no excuse not to contact the parent as soon as any kind of altercation takes place.  A parent should never have to pick up their child who is crying uncontrollably, especially when the employees can't even tell you how long she was \""in timeout\"" for.\n\nWhen picking up your child, you do not even have to provide any kind of identification, they go based on a \""we know what you look like\"" policy.  I mean come on we live in a city of over 4 million people, the odds that there are a few others who resemble me can be quite high.  As a parent would you feel safe that just anyone can pick up your child without any kind of identification based on another employees assumption of who you are?\n\nThis place is hell, avoid it like the plague and do not waste your money here.  If you have no other alternatives just please avoid their child care services..."
0,"Club had a great remodel.  But its going down hill really fast.  The mgmt is not friendly, and most of the personal training staff scare me to death.  I have seen one personal trainer who seems to know how to be a proper Trainer.  So if you go there ask for Frank(He's on top of his game), pretty much most everyone else you are putting your own safety at risk  The GM prides himself on telling people if they don't like something they just have the option to go somewhere else.  Not to bag on everyone there, some of the front desk staff greet you with a smile and try the best they can, but it's pretty easy to see it starts up top.  So I guess you get what you pay for-"
0,"So, I have been really wanting a gym membership and I finally made it in to check it out.  I was looking for a gym that has lots of classes and a good amount of cardio machines.  L.A. Fitness seemed like a great fit.  It is really hot outside today and I was dying to work out.  I figured L.A. Fitness had something where I could do a trial period so I could work out and see how I liked it. I want to make sure I feel comfortable working out there.  If I liked it I would sign up. This sounds reasonable right?\n\nBasically, what happened was the guy at the front desk told me...NO, I had to sign up, pay sign up fee plus monthly membership fee then if I didn't like it they would give my money back.  Also, if I didn't sign up today it would cost me more money.  He kept throwing all sorts of numbers at me and talking fast so that I couldn't keep the numbers straight, he wouldn't write anything down for me so I could see how much all this would end up costing me and think about it.  It was like trying to buy a used car.  I hate high pressure sales.  \n\nAlso, to insult to injury he said,...\""You look good  but you really need to tone up a bit.\""  Really?  Your going to insult me to get me to sign up for your membership today?  I think this is a terrible sales tactic.  NEVER do I spend money ANYWHERE that insults me.  The only reason I currently do not have a gym membership is this sales tactic.  So, in a nut shell I just walked out and will never go back.  \n\nIf you like high pressure sales and some guy commenting on your body, pointing out how tone you are or not,  commenting on how many inches you need to loose, then this is your place.  As for me I really hope to find a gym that is not like this."
0,"I have had my membership at LA Fitness for almost two years now.  I did not attend often at first because I was unsure how to use the weights and machines, so after saving up some money I enrolled in personal training with Jake.  He was a phenomenal trainer and motivated me to push myself and keep coming back.  After two months with this trainer, he was promoted to \""master trainer\"" which, unfortunately for me, meant it would cost me more. I reluctantly accepted to stay in his schedule since I was seeing great results with him. Two months later, he left LA fitness to pursue something else.\n\nSo, I called LA fitness a week or two later and asked to be placed back into a regular trainer's schedule back at the old rate that I was at, because going up to the master trainer rate was hard on me financially. I spoke with Ashleen, the personal training manager, and she said that would not be a problem and from here on out I would go back to the old rate and I could see John for personal training.\n\nMy next payment went through for the master training rate, so I called Ashleen again and after many unreturned phone calls I finally got ahold of her and she informed me that there is just something I have to sign in order to clear the new agreement at which point she will credit me back the difference to my account.  I went in and signed the necessary form and still it he next month I was still charged at the old rate!!!!! So, this is two months I am getting overcharged. I, again, called Ashleen numerous times without a response.\n\nI decided at this point that I needed to call corporate. I called them and they told me I still needed to sign the agreement (that I had already signed four weeks prior at this point). I explained the situation and I was told to go in and speak with Prague this time.\n\nI walked in and Prague was available who gave me the form to sign and it was clear that I would be credited back the past three months of overcharges.  I asked when I should expect to be credited back and he said the next Monday or Tuesday (which was five days away to account for the 4th of July holiday weekend).\n\nIt is now July 14th and I still have not seen a penny back of the past three months I have been overcharged. My whole family and many of my friends attend this gym and I will be sure to tell them about this experience because clearly the staff here cares only about if they are getting their money and nothing else. As soon as my contract is up I will look into personal training somewhere else and so will everyone in my family."
1,"I had to find something to do with my time as I anxiously waited for little Leela wonder puppy to reach the 12 weeks of age required before I could bring her home from the breeder. And since I had already purchased basically every product she could ever need or want, I decided to search for the perfect vet. I researched and interviewed quite a few places before settling on Animal Care Hospital. The fact that it is so close to me was definitely a factor, but I was impressed with this office regardless of location. I wanted to make sure the vet I chose would be a good fit for my Yorkshire Terrier, so I had plenty of questions to ask and Dr. Bishop graciously answered them all. \n\nAnimal Care Hospital has three practicing DVM's on staff, as well as 4 certified veterinary technicians. All 3 vets are members of the AVMA, AAHA, AzVMA and other organizations. Dr. Bishop is the Hospital Director who started the practice in 1973, Dr. Halver has been there since 1981 and Dr. Temple has been here since 2006. They use isofluorane gas anesthesia, which is the safest anesthesia, especially for toy breeds. They also have extensive monitoring equipment is in place during surgery, including EKG, pulse oximeters, respiratory rate, CO2 monitors and equipment to maintain core body temperature. Since almost every dog will be put under at least once to be fixed, it is good to know that they monitor vitals so closely. \n\nFor routine appointments, they schedule a full 30 minutes. Many of the vet offices I spoke to scheduled as few as 10 minutes, or maybe 15, not enough time in my opinion to really get acquainted with me or my dog, or to ask any questions or share concerns. This may seem silly, but the amount of time the vet spends with each animal can make a big difference in their health. \n\nThe vet I saw , Dr. Temple, was flexible. When I asked to deviate from the standard puppy vaccination plan and follow the veterinary protocol recommended by my breeder (a yorkie lover with 20 years experience breeding show and pet yorkies), she was accommodating and even excused herself to go print some info to re-familiarize herself with this particular protocol and permanently place it in Leela's file."
1,"I recently got my little baby pug Penny from a private breeder, so I wanted to take her to a vet and get her checked out. Animal Care Hospital was close to my house, so I figured I would give it a try. \n\nThey were able to see me SAME DAY, which was an awesome treat. I was afraid I would have to wait several days for my new puppy exam and the medical guarantee from the breeder was only good for one week.\n\nAnyways, the vets office was conveniently located, the office is clean, the staff is friendly and everyone was in love with Penny. (it's hard not to be.. I know I am a proud mommy, but she really is adorable!)\n\nI sat down and filled out my paperwork and they took me back right away. The vet, Dr. Temple, was extremely friendly and thorough and answered all my questions. I signed up for the \""puppy package\"" that basically takes you through all of the shots they need for the first few months, wellness exams, fecal test and a microchip and also includes a start up of heartworm preventer.\n\nPenny had her second set of shots the day prior when I purchased her from the breeder, but for some reason Dr. Temple gave her another set. She told me there was nothing to worry about but they didn't charge me, so I think she may have made a mistake. Penny was fine and she told me that it would not cause any problems, but I'm glad that she didn't make a mistake on something life threatening. (This is the only reason I am not giving ACHS five stars.)\n\nWe went back three weeks later for our third set of shots and got in immediately. They were quick, friendly and efficient again and able to provide me with some suggestions on how to curb Miss Penny's biting habits.\n\nThe only issues I have encountered were with the billing. I think that the puppy package confuses the billing girls a little, because both times I went in they had to make adjustments. Not a big deal, they took care of everything and refunded the incorrect amount immediately, I just hope it doesn't keep happening.\n\nOh, another really cool feature is that your pet gets a login and you can keep track of service records through the vet. They have some cool features on the website where you can fill out forms for someone babysitting your pet and you can post pictures and put in information about the diet. I know I lose papers all the time, so its great to have all of Penny's records online where I can easily access them.\n\nThey have awesome hours... so I can get in after work, and the location is convenient for me. They also sell different types of food and hygiene supplies there, so you can pick up stuff for your animal should you need to.\n\nI would definitely recommend this Vet's office to anyone. Knowledgeable and Friendly staff!"
1,"I love Animal Care Hospital. We have two cats and a dog, and they've provided excellent care for all three. One of our cats has been boarded there a few times and I appreciate that I can trust them to take good care of him. \n\nThe dog has gone there after spending the night at the emergency vet and the difference is stark--Animal Care Hospital always makes sure to ease our fears about whatever is going on with our animals and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Well, except for the time the dog got his teeth cleaned and one broken tooth pulled, that cost more than our rent. But still, they did a great job and they made sure that the dog, who is considered senior at age 7, was screened for any complications and I like that they use anesthesia that is considered more safe. (Sorry, I don't really know much about it but they have info in their office about it.)\n\nI do have a pretty strong preference for Dr. Temple vs. Dr. Halver, although they're both wonderful. I think find Dr. Temple to be more engaged and she's extremely willing to answer every single question I have, whereas Dr. Halver isn't always as thorough with my questions. Then again, I ask a ton of questions and he's always provided excellent care, so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to friends.\n\nDr. Temple is also a relaxed person, and she's willing to explore all the possibilities and be up front about how much things are going to cost and what's necessary and what can wait until the cheaper treatment option is given a chance to work. \n\nMy only negative is that I have to agree with a previous review about them pushing the expensive Valley Fever test, that's happened to us too and I really don't think it was necessary since the dog didn't have many, if any, symptoms of having it. They didn't use extreme scare tactics but there was some guilt-tripping going on, but for all I know they're just hyper-aware of the perils of dogs getting Valley Fever. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nOne huge bonus for me is that Joyce, who is almost always the one to answer the phones and make our appointments, is incredibly competent and always puts me in a good mood. She seriously makes my day whenever we go in because she does her job well and treats everyone with such respect, and she's as good with animals as she is with people."
1,I love my pets doctors and staff this animal care hospital is wonderful caring employees kind loving with my pets . I told some of the best girls ever at the Starbucks next door they mentioned my name and the hospital gave them their exam for free with my referral I was shocked when I heard that pleasantly surprised and with that news I will be giving more referrals .  I use this hospital for all my pets and my sons dog too they really are caring when my cat Roenick got hurt and attacked by a dog they were great and very kind and loving with me too as a pet owner . So yes I will say that my pets vet/doctors/ staff are amazing and affordable \nThank you all at animal care hospital you are wonderful
1,"This is my second year being a member of the Phoenix Film Society and my second year attending the Phoenix Fim Festival.  I go with a flex pass so each year I see 4 films.\nThis year, I almost didn't attend because I had a ski accident and was told by the doctor to stay home and rest with my leg elevated before my surgery.\nWell, I got bored and decided to do double headers on the last 2 nights before the festival ended.\nI was able to call ahead and reserve my tkts ahead of time which was a big time saver.  On my way to the theater, a volunteer saw me walking with crutches and walked with me, held the door open for me and even sat with me through the movie to make sure I would be okay.\nIn betwn the movie, a volunteer got a chair for me to sit on so I didn't have to walk far while they cleaned the theater in btwn the movies.\nThe second night was the same.  The volunteers were so nice.  One even adjusted my crutches for me because they were not fitted correctly.  In addition, I sat next to a couple who really empathized with my situation~ the husband had just got done with surgery and rehab.  They told me they would bring me his wheelchair and walker for me to use during recovery and sure enough, the hubby brought it by the other day!\nHere I am glowing about the volunteers at the festival and haven't talked about the festival itself.\n. . . this festival is a year long planning event completely run by volunteers . . . for this to happen, the festival itself has to have a lot of heart,  And any event that has a lot of heart, has to be good.  \nI love movies, I love the Phoenix Film Society, and I love the Phoenix Film Festival.  \nI ask that anyone who has attended the festival and had a bad experience to become a volunteer or a member and once you get to know the directors (volunteers) and what it takes to pull a festival of this scale together, then you can better appreciate the existence of this wonderful festival."
1,They have the BEST wings...not fried! They now offer grass fed and hormone free burger...YUM!
1,Great food! Great service! We will be back!
1,Fantastic service from Toma and good eats! Love this place! We will definitely be back.
1,"I love to go to lunch at off times when  they are not so busy. This was the case on Friday.  I had a fantastic coupon and the waiter that rang me up said he would even make me a fresh pot of coffee. I did not even have to ask.  The salad was wonderful! I really liked how fresh every thing was. Soup a bit so so,but they even had tacos and they were really good. It was very nice and clean inside. My waiter brought me lots of fresh coffee, i was very happy."
1,"They really have done a spectacular job with the remodel- they put the luxury back into luxury shopping. The handbag arcade looks so fresh and elegant! I like the cosmetics expansion, and I also dig the mega-mega jewelry section. \n\nIf I could only figure out how to make a few boatloads of cash to purchase some of these wonderfully marketed objects, it would surely be retail heaven."
1,"This store is gorgeous. Clean, nicely laid out, you can see everything, and the people they hire in the departments know their stuff. All employees are friendly and attentive and they treat you like gold. Products are of the highest quality and all the name brands are top-of-the-line. Of course, you get what you pay for."
1,"I absolutely love shopping at Saks 5th Ave in Phoenix!  Kourosh in the ladies shoe department is one of the best client service representatives I have ever had.  He really takes the time to understand the client, make sure you have a shoe that fits your taste, style and ability - I say ability because I once tried on a really high pair of  heels and almost rolled my ankle standing up and Kourosh was right there to catch me, sit me down,  and then insisted on a different style for me :)  \n\nI have always left the store satisfied with my purchases and service. As well the follow up from Kourosh with emails to make sure that I am satisfied has gone well and above my expectations.  I live in Canada and I only buy my Louboutin's and other fine shoes from Kourosh as he truly respects and treats his clients like gold.  One time I showed him a picture of a style of shoes I had seen on line and he searched high and low to find them keeping me in the loop and updated the whole time.\n\nHe makes you feel very welcome, and I highly recommend shopping with him."
1,I went in looking to find nice fragrances for my husband and I.  I was helped immediately with friendly and knowledgeable associates Ramona in Jo Malone and Tina the Chanel brand manager.  They helped me try several men's and women's fragrances in order to find the perfect one.  I also loved that they threw in some samples to try other fragrances for mixing with the Jo Malone or for winter for my husband.  I felt very at ease while shopping and seeing the huge jewelry department only tempts me more!  Also I saw some yummy Marc Jacobs candles while checking out...
1,I'm a LV lover and with the prices so high I am so picky! I've met the nicest most helpful sales associate.  Her name is Carrie.  She's always helpful and is very patient with me.  She's one woman you can call that will go the extra mile in customer service for you!  I love talking and having her help me.  \n\nI purchased my Monogram Pallas in black and she was was very helpful.  It took me almost 3 weeks going back and forth to the store to make my decision.  \n\nMy experience here has been awesome!  I've purchased two bags so far from this location.  I've gotten my wallet hot stamped and it came out great!\n\nThanks for hiring Carrie!  I'd recommend her to everyone heading to this location LV!!!!
1,Best printing service there is! Great customer service and fast turn around time! Would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants high quality printing without emptying your bank account!
1,"I have been sending all of our business printing projects to JC Printing for more than ten years. They provide great prices, excellent service, fast turnaround time and the quality of the finished pieces is perfect. When I need suggestions for maximizing the value of my projects, they are happy to help me get it just right."
1,"I am happy to have found them.   They offer so many services to market my business.  I have always been pleased with the quality.  I rarely give them ample time to get my products shipped to my franchises, but they constantly come through for me."
1,"Cole Haan has always been a trusted brand for me. I have had numerous pairs of dress shoes and years of comfort and style. I was so happy to see the Cole Haan store at the Biltmore. \n\nOkay first let me say that I lived a long time in San Diego so my attire is usually a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops. The Cole Haan store has a more upscale feel to it when you go in. I felt way under dressed as I do a lot of times. Hahahaha. Hey I like comfort. Well you would have never thought I was dressed like a beach bum. \n\nThe sales team was very attentive and helped me find the perfect pair of boots for my girlfriend. Even offered me some water. Nice touch. Found a better deal than the Cole Haans in Macy's. Always a plus. I will be back again."
1,"While I cannot say I have any love for the Biltmore, I do have a lot of affection for Cole Haan no matter where it is located and between the friendly staff, great holiday deals, and top quality shoes I'd be lying if I didn't admit to spending far more time and money at this particular location than I should.  From the Lunargrands to the reflectives and from Wingtips to loafers there is something to be said for any brand that makes shoes that fit with such uniformity and for someone who spends the better part of twelve hours a day on his feet either running or in a professional setting the transferability of CH to Nike is something that cannot and should not be overlooked."
1,"Its a mint to eat here my wife and I used to each here before BC (before children) and its pretty damn wonderful. The wait staff it there for you to wait on YOU. They are excellent, they want you to be happy they want you to have an excellent menu, they want their tip. \n\nIt is the old school-old world eats the steak is so tender you can slice it with a fork the lobster my wife had was massive and excellent. And they will shell it for you, you know how hard it is to get at the meat of these things. \n\nThe wine is excellent and its a wonderful place to visit if you can take out a low interest loan. \n\nOur bill out the door with tip was $310.00 for two people but that was years ago and I know it has not gotten cheaper."
1,"Great selection of steak and seafood. Not a place you go without increasing the limit on that Visa a little. We got the special salad, steak, seafood, 2 sides and dessert. After all was said and done we paid a little less than$200.00 for for an amazing meal and two glasses of wine for two people. It was worth every penny. We both got the Fillet Oskar, crab cakes,  asparagus, mashed potatoes, cheese cake, and the Merlot. It was a cozy 1940's type atmosphere with dim lights and attentive wait staff. It made me feel fancy :)"
1,"Such a great steakhouse! I could not have been more impressed with the experience. \n\nIt started with a knowledgeable bartender that put together a refreshing gin mixed drink and a solid gin martini (I always recommend Hendricks).  \n\nFor dinner, started with the oysters which were very good. For dinner I got the double cut bone in fillet. Talk about an amazing flavor! I really appreciated being able to see an example the cut prior to cooking the meat, very nice touch. \n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake, which was delicious. The server was nice enough to give us a free VIP after dinner cocktail. \n\nI will be going back."
1,"Morton's is the quintessential steak house. While others feel it is a place for the \""good old boys\"", it is none the less, one of the absolute prize steakhouses of the world. Morton's is a chain, and can be found in many countries of the world. I have eaten in many of them ranging from Hong Kong to New York and the food is consistent wherever you choose to go.\n\nDrinks at Morton's are nothing to sneeze at. They are always made with premium brands and are more than adequate for most people. (Their chocolate Godiva martini is to die for!)\n\nA word of warning - all food at Morton's is a la carte, and portions are big. Should you order a tomato as a salad expect to see one of the largest and most succulent tomatoes on your plate, perfectly presented. Morton's has a large assortment of entrees ranging from lobster bisque to shrimp cocktail (not sure if those are shrimp or small lobsters) to tuna tartar, crab cakes and perfect oysters on the half shell. Always remember that portions are huge and you still have the main course coming!\n\nSpeaking of main courses - in a word - unbelievable.\n\nThe portions, once again, are huge, and their meats are all true prime. Your waitperson will wheel a cart of the meats to your table so that you can make your selection. Watch out for that 3 pound lobster - It's alive on the cart and just could nip your finger if you get it too close!\n\nFor a real treat try the porterhouse or the Chicago bone in rib eye. Truly amazing to eat. The prime rib (Friday and Saturday only) are wonderful but if you want it you will need to come early - it's a limited cut of beef at the restaurant - when they run out that's it for the night.\n\nFor lighter fare they also have assorted fish and chicken dishes as well as spectacular lamb chops.\n\nFor sides, try the creamed spinach, the Lyonnaise potatoes, or share a small football sized baked potato.\n\nDesserts are legendary at Morton's. Some like the chocolate souffle must be ordered at the beginning of the meal, but oh are they worth it. The desserts are made with the same care as the entire rest of the meal and are just as fattening! For a change of pace, try their fresh berries - you won't be disappointed and it will help with your waistline. Do plan on bringing a doggie bag (perhaps several doggie bags) home with you.\n\nSanitation is impeccable, and the bathrooms are gorgeous. This is a terrific special occasion place. Valet parking out front.\n\nI rate this a 5 star restaurant. (Expensive but worth every penny)"
1,"Found a great rate on Golf Now - called in and spoke with Brad. He was extremely friendly, courteous, and gave great advice on what course to play. Hole 15 on the Links Course has incredible views and I recommend this course to anyone looking for a great value. One of the oldest courses in Phoenix too!"
1,I am so fortunate to live near this 36 hole course. The Adobe is a more traditional course with forgiving fairways and greens. The Links course encircles the Biltmore homes and will give you a better challenge with awkward lies and elevated tees. The courses can play very slow so you may want to try playing later in the day. You can't beat the rate if you live in the valley and the course is always in great shape for the amount of play. \n\nStaff is extremely friendly and the restaurant offers great food at a reasonable price. I would stay clear of the course on the weekends in the morning. You will play a 5+ hour round.
1,"Came here to buy the lady something sparkly for her finger and was greeted promptly.  The folks behind the counter were super helpful when I needed them, but weren't too up in my grill.  They have some nice stuff that won't cost you a fortune.  Two thumbs up!"
1,Darrell and his staff helped me make the most beautiful custom necklace for my wife  commemorating the birth of our first son.
1,"Great, authentic, entertaining, somewhat scary (Good Fellas, Joe Pesci  scary) Italian joint.  And please rest assured that this reviewer does NOT consider Olive Garden as the standard (I wish we could root those folks out and sign them up to a Yelp for Dummies service)...yes, I'm a freakin' elitist, but what can I say?  I am a foodie, and Italian culture reigned supreme for a millenia.  \n\nThe owner is 100% Italian and runs all over the place making sure all is well.  The wine list is all over the place and mostly phenomenal, very pricey bottles.  We found an excellent Amarone for $60, but you can find some bottles for less.  Wait service was excellent, but totally unpretentious.  This is the real deal folks.\n\nAsk for a pasta sampler plate.  The gnocchi is out of this world.  Escargot was traditionally prepared with butter and garlic, Caprese salad was perfect.  Veal Osobuco with rissoto was out of this world (I usually resist veal as the treatment of the animal is more than I can bare, but man you can hardly go authentic Italian with that attitude!).\n\nHere's the scary part:  There were some mob-looking folks in there, with plastic-surgery wives and fat rings...I could totally picture a scene in the Godfather or Sopranos where someone is dragged down that narrow, long hallway to the bathrooms/back alley by a guitar string wrapped around their neck.  I swear I was peeking around the corner before walking into the bathroom just in case someone had put a hit on my ass!  Luckily I made it out of there alive and very very satisfied.  \n\nSpent $150 for 2 including tip and a nice bottle of wine, and we gourged.  I rarely give a place a 10 unless it's very fine dining, but this place came at it from a different angle and was worth every penny.  Enjoy!"
1,"You will not find a better Italian restaurant in Phoenix than Avanti. Ignore the hype, this place is serious class. The owner meets you at the door and the food is the best Italian around.  I'm Sicilian so I know good Italian food and this is the best Italian restaurant I have found in Az. It is not inexpensive, but you will not be disappointed."
1,This place is awesome!  Service and food is great!!
1,"The first thing that comes to my mind when I walked in was a scene from Scarface. I expected to see Al Pacino sitting waiting for me, but instead I was greeted  by a very nice waiter and then introduced to Angelo. Angelo gave a heartily Italian greeting to my friend and I while he sat us. He alone is a reason to go to this gem of a restaurant.  \n\nWe started off by ordering Escargots De Bygone the garlic butter and brandy wine combination was just right. This was my first time having escargots, and I really enjoyed it. Avanti has set the bar high for others. \n\nFor our main entrees we both ordered a pasta special which included Gnocchi in a white sauce, Penne Pasta in a red sauce, and Two huge Ravioli's with spinach. Each was delicious in it's own way, being savory, and rich without being overpowering. \n\nWe then were treated to a fish, I can't recall the name that was Parmesan crusted with a delicious sauce that was just right. The tenderness of the fish combined with just the right amount of richness from the sauce created a crescendo of flavors that was perfection. \n\nLast but not least we had a desert platter with three delicious deserts, a mango, ice cream sorbet that was amazing, tiramisu which was equally good, and a classic Italian desert I can't recall. It reminded me of lemon bars my mother used to make for my sister and I as a child. \n\nOverall this experience was amazing. I'm still thinking about it and telling my friends. The atmosphere, ambiance, and intimate setting along with outstanding food and service makes this a must see and eat place in my opinion. So many restaurants these days are about group dining, and group experiences, this is a lovely escape from all of that. When you just want an outstanding meal, friends, and good conversation."
1,"This place was amazing.  I went there for lunch today and I can't wait to go back.  I was greeted at the door by Angelo, the owner.  I felt very special and welcomed.  The atmosphere was very intimate.  Kind of reminds you of an East Coast old school Italian restaurant.  \n\nThe trio of pasta was excellent.  My favorite was the gnocchi in Alfredo sauce.  All 3 were fabulous, but the gnocchi was exceptional. \n\nI've already made plans to go back for dinner with my husband.  \n\nI went on Groupon, just to try it out, but I would have gladly paid full price."
1,My new favorite restaurant in AZ. This is the kind of place I have been looking for since I moved here. Real authentic Italian food finally!
1,"I had a turkey sandwich and a fudge sundae.  Mmm mm.  Jerry's is like a good version of Denny's or any of those late night diners.  It was difficult for me to wrap my head around the concept of a 'good' denny's, but their food is actually tastey, their booths are comfortable, it feels like a diner the way it's set up, and they didn't fuck up a sundae.  \n\nOh and I didn't feel sick or gross after eating there AND I saved half my sandwich for later.  Now that's a level of diner food that is deserving of 5 stars!"
1,"Laura the best waitress in the valley is back at Jerry's she is there every night but Sunday and Monday. This place rocks again. The best late night place to go, great food, and with Laura back the best service around, as far as I am concerned every waitress in the world should go and watch her work you could definitely learn a few things. \nIf I were to open my own restaurant this women would be running the show. To the owners and management of Jerry's you better take care of this lady."
1,We have been here for breakfast on many occasions and have never had a bad meal. Recently we tried the all you can eat Friday fish fry and it is wonderful. The clam chowder is excellent.
1,"I don't write many reviews, and I generally don't like letting my favorite secret places out of the bag, but I love linda's on osborn breakfast!  I eat breakfast every weekend, all over the valley, and this is one of my favorite simple spots.  If you want to be at Daily Dose or Breakfast Club (not that the food isn't good there) to people watch and 'be seen', this is not your place.  If you want incredible value and delicious food - jackpot!  As a Texas transplant, this is some of the best chicken fried steak and eggs you will find in AZ (I actually discovered this place after Ranch House Grill burned down). The breakfast potato's are the icing on the cake, best in town hands down, but be careful, they're addictive!  Linda is a very nice, hardworking lady who is always there.  For great homemade food, you will NOT be disappointed!"
1,Friday night all you can eat fish fry....ask for it grilled if you prefer!  Be sure to leave room for the homemade pies.  Chicken pot pie is a must try as well!
1,"Whenever I travel, I obsess about bringing back the perfect regional souvenirs and foodie items for family and friends.  We're living in the Phoenix area for a few months and I wanted to send small and inexpensive Arizona-esque little gifts to my son's preschool class in VA.  The sample sized candies are perfect and they sell them in bulk bags of 30 in the store. The store itself is a hole in the wall, but the gentleman working there couldn't have been nicer.  He gave my kids free lollipops and a student discount on the large order of candy.  And the candy itself is just insanely good."
1,"Case# 25       Food of my childhood\n\nI have been eating these subs since I was a little kid. My mom (R.I.P) used bring me here and it is one of the few childhood memories I hang on to. For those who do not know about this place as the food detective I will share a little background info from my case files to help you out. \n\nMr. Submarine is actually a small chain that really got it's start here in the valley in the early 80's. At one time the locations stretched from the east valley to west phoenix. With increased competition from larger sub chains ( Subway, Cousins, Blimpy, and Quiznos they were forced to limit their growth and use word of mouth advertising to keep customers coming in. This resulted in store closings and now only two locations remain open. When you try and compare a place like this to say a subway which spends big time money to advertise their five dollar foot long special, or their new breakfast sandwich there is no competition. \n\nThis place wins by a mile. Who needs a 5 dollar foot long that is served by some teenager who only cares about his shift ending so he can escape. No, I would rather have the owner there serving me a sandwich that he himself is going to eat for lunch. Don't give me slimy meat and dried out looking cheese. I want soft fresh bread with toppings that enhance the other components of my sandwich not cover it up! OK enough with the ranting, this place is a no frills type of place. No wraps or cookies. They offer the normal meat choices including ham, turkey, tuna and your choice of bread ( white, wheat, and sourdough).\n\nNo annoying jingles or sandwich Nazis (read my subway review), just good food, made and served by someone who cares about what they are selling you.  They are open Monday through Friday 10am to 10pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 8pm.\n\nThey are a little more pricey than Subway but for a great sandwich and great service it is well worth the price.\n\nCase closed"
1,I have been coming to mr. submarine since I was a kid and the location on the west side was still open. I have since moved to California but when I come into town this is a must stop for me. the subs taste the same as they did when I was a kid. I love this place. best submarine place I have ever found!!!
1,"Damn...who's a sexy bitch?\nMy car is. Right after Perry and his team has spent the entire day detailing it.\n\nWhen I bought a black car, I knew I was in for some high maintenance. But it wasn't until a good friend of mine who's a paint/body specialist referred me to Perry and European Detail after some acidic water leaked on my car after someone power washed the top level of my parking garage. \n\nI thought my paint was ruined for sure! I took it to European Detail (at that time, they were located on Indian School) and not only did they get the acid off, they suggested a GLARE product to protect my paint from further episodes...even bird droppings! The product is amazing and my car looked better than it did brand now. It removed all the small swirl marks/scratches. So from that point forward, I frequented European Detail for basic washes.\n\nWhen they moved their location up to the Scottsdale Airpark, I didn't visit as often.  I hit up a few hand wash places here and there in-between my visits to European...but nothing compares (to you!). It wasn't until recently that my car turned 1yr old, and I treated her to a spa day with a full detail. I am a perfectionist to the core, but I think I found my match with these guys. I couldn't find one thing that was missed or annoying. They treated my leather, steamed carpets, engine, you name it. But the difference between European and others is that there was no chemical smell, my seats/floors weren't soaking wet needing to dry (they use the most amazing techniques and products)...I drove away in heaven.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.\n\nI know that Craig Jackson uses European Detail and trusts Perry and his team to keep his cars in top notch shape, that alone speaks a million words. The knowledge of detailing for the team is an art form, not a quick wash/in-out situation.\n\nShockingly, it's only slightly higher in price than what I've paid previously at these corner \""hand-wash\"" places but the results are 1,000 better.\n\nMy vehicle is not only an investment, but I am proud of it. And when I drive away from European Detail I have no doubt I have even more to be proud of because I got the best service and Auto Detail in the Valley. \n\nWhich reminds me, I need to frequent for in-between washes as well - not just details. Thanks for the great service Perry and Team!"
1,"MY JAW HIT THE FLOOR!  These guys are incredible!!  After taking my car to another detailer who left deep swirl marks all over my black Hummer, I was desperately looking for a place who could help me.  OR  I was seriously looking at having to repaint the car.  No other detailer wanted to touch it because they knew how difficult the job would be. Greg and Perry at European first, put me at ease. And then second, gave me my car back not only swirl free, but I felt like i seriously got a new paint job!!! I mean it was better looking than the day I bought it and it looked like i could roll it onto a showroom floor!  As if that wasn't enough, I learned that they hand wash cars by appointment. I live 20 miles away and I will gladly drive that distance to have them wash my car from here on out and for eternity. I will not trust anyone else. I know they handle the Barrett Jackson cars, and I really felt like they treated my car no differently than what they would have done for either Mr. Barrett or Mr. Jackson themselves. \n\nI cant begin to express my gratitude and appreciation for care this business gives to their clients and their cars. I must mention Greg again since I was so impressed at the customer service he provided. Totally professional through and through!!"
1,"stand up guys.  They checked my alignment, basically said I have bad tires and they could align my wheels if I  wanted but wouldn't solve the problem the tires being bad, said there was a deal at costco or they could hook me up with a deal from his friend but advised costco due to their service and if you are traveling there will be a costco and not this local shop to  get serviced for free.\n\nThey didn't charge me anything.   \n\nThey also checked the alignment  manually and not  by computers.  I was  impressed and am impressed  when someone has an old school skill.  Makes the quality of the work better."
1,"Extremely clean Lot and Waiting area.  No wait for my 8:30 AM Appointment which I was 7 minutes late for due to Indian School Construction (Thus avoid EAST BOUND Indian School prior to 16th Street as once you pass 12th Street you are stuck until you route thru the one Right LANE open.  In addition, The City Bus stops a few times which ties the back up further.  I was charged the quoted amount exactly and paid by Credit Card.  In addition, I was informed of a damaged Tire to replace soon.\n."
1,"Great Job Gentlemen! Had them work on both of my vehicles and will gladly go back when ever I need to have work done again. Joel and Ken are very professional, No BS when it came to what needed to be done. Best in Town."
1,"My experience today at Sun Devil auto. Was remarkably wonderful. I started this morning looking for a auto shop to help me with the truck. In my third stop was the Sun Devil auto shop. I am mediately was acknowledged. By the staff. Mr Francisco Torres, ask me what brought me in. I asked if they do a diagnostic in the truck. I also ask him you can do a check on the breaks well I have the truck and the shop. . \n\nI am mediately felt like I made the right choice. The extra care and attention was absolutely high quality coming from the staff member. Mr Francisco into step by step in show me every detail that I needed to know what kind of work the truck need it. I really appreciated that. Mr Francisco is very honest and not making an upsell. I make sure that I was driving safely on the road with a safe vehicle I will definitely keep my interest in the shop for as long as I live here in Arizona. I recommend this shop to all my friends and family honesty is the best policy."
1,Here are some guys who really know their business. Honest and reliable.  My Lexus dealer could not fix the problem - my car still pulled to the right after they did an alignment.  Jacks merely rotated the front tires and the problem was solved.  Why couldn't Lexus do that?  When I asked how much - no charge.  Now you know who the real expert is.  Will need brakes soon and I will go to Jacks for sure.
1,"Amazing!  From start to finish this place was incredible.  Great french host (Mgr?).   Great french waiter, helpful and funny.   The support staff was way above average always, plates cleared and drinks filled in a timely manner. \n\nI REALLY like the fact they don't rush you and try to flip tables, we were there about two hours. \n\nThis is a quaint little stand alone restaurant that also has a small bar and a few tables out on the patio.

1,"This is easily the BEST RESTAURANT i have ever been to\n\nI love french food, and this is the very best I have ever had. Amazing service (the owner is such a nice guy), amazing service and the atmosphere is cozy and romantic (perfect for a date).\n\nI agree with some of the other raters-- this place would get 10 stars if yelp would let me put 10. Try the duck and the beef bourguignon!"
1,"Dottsy Z. and I met here last week to try their new happy hour and we had an amazing time! The weather was perfect, the patio beautiful, and the company was amazing.\n\nTheir happy hour menu featured a nice variety of white and red wines, all for $6, plus we tried the escargot, pate, and frites as well. We spoke to chef, who was very knowledgeable and able to accommodate gluten free items, especially if you call a day or two in advance. \n\nWe topped off the night with a decadent creme brulee and imported cocoa dusted truffles, which capped off the evening on a perfect note."
1,"My husband and I went to Sophie's for a date night and were very happy with the results.  I have the Beef Bourguignon and it was outstanding.  We were told it takes 3 days to make the sauce.  My husband ordered the duck confit, which he enjoyed.  I'm not a fan of the ducky flavor myself.  We also followed the suggestion of ordering the warmed brie app.  De-lish!  The service was great as well.  Little touches like asking if we would like our milk warmed for our post-meal coffee.  So great!  We will for sure be going back for future date nights!"
1,"At 40 years old, I discovered after a consultation with an orthodontist that not only would I need braces , again (I wore them in high school as well), but that to prevent further erosion of some of my teeth and have a proper bite, I would likely need surgery to move my upper jaw forward, and to widen it to correct a crossbite. My orthodontist referred me to two surgeons, one of them being Dr. Reed Day. \n\nI visited Dr Day's office and was very impressed with the professionalism of the staff and the way that I was treated by Dr. Day.  Within a few minutes of interacting with him I knew this was the doctor I wanted for my surgery.  He clearly explained the kind of operation I would need (a Lefort Osteotomy), and while I was there he also diagnosed me has having a deviated septum.  The deviated septum had made it difficult for me to breath through my nose, and likely contributed to the underdevelopment of my upper jaw. Correcting my deviated septum was added to the surgical plan.\n\nAfter my initial consultation with Dr Day, I started my braces treatment, and about a year into wearing braces, I had my jaw surgery on Nov 4, 2013.  I met with Dr. Day two times prior to the date of the surgery to go over preparations for the surgery, what to expect the day of the surgery, and what to expect in the days and weeks after the surgery.  His professionalism and demeanor really put me at ease.  I had no worries going into the surgery.  My friends would ask me if I was nervous, and my response was, no way, I'm excited to get this done, can't wait.  \n\nOn the day of the surgery, Dr. Day came by to talk to me about an hour or so before my scheduled surgery to see how I was doing.  The surgery took no more than 1.5 hours.  Afterwards, as I came out of my sleep, I was a bit disoriented but did not have any pain.  In fact, not once did I take pain medication following the surgery, ever.  I saw Dr. Day immediately following the surgery, and the next morning before I was released from the hospital.  \n\nExactly ONE week after the surgery, I was back in the office, putting in a 7 hour day, and worked pretty much a 40 hour work week.  There was residual swelling as expected, but the swelling reduced as each day went by.  The liquid diet isn't that bad.  I'm now just over three weeks into my recovery and I feel fantastic. My orthodontist is also very pleased with the results and amazed at my recovery.  \n\nNot only has my recovery been amazing, but I can finally breathe easily through my nose, due to the correction of my deviated septum.\n\nI have nothing but positive things to say about Dr. Day and his staff.  I would recommend them to anyone requiring oral surgery.  \n\nLastly, I was a bit surprised to see others in this forum refer to Dr. Day as arrogant.  I didn't detect this trait at all.  I would say that he is highly confident in his abilities, but this is EXACTLY what I want from a surgeon who is going to remove my entire upper jaw and then reattach it.  If you want someone who is highly trained, qualified, and possesses the confidence to do a great job, then I strongly recommend consulting with Dr. Day if you require oral surgery."
1,"I traveled from Michigan, seeking the best team of dentists to remove a failing implant and replace a front tooth that had to be extracted in 2009. I am fortunate in that I can travel for what I have researched and feel is the best dental care possible.\nI have had three procedures completed in Dr. Day's office since September 2012. I've been in his office possibly seven times in the last 15 months. Every time I've been in his office I was always greeted cordially by his staff.

1,"I was diagnosed with TMD over 20 years ago and required jaw surgery back in 1993 by another surgeon. It didn't work, and after 20 years of major headaches, neck aches, facial pain, jaw pain and a shifted bite, I am FINALLY on the road to recovery! I have seen 8 Oral Surgeons through the years and Dr Day was the one to properly identify my issues and fix my jaw. I found Dr Day because I got two high recommendations from two other local Oral Surgeons that said my case was so complicated, and Dr Day was the only one who could conduct the type of surgery I needed.  Dr Day was brilliant and he explained everything very thoroughly and has been caring and compassionate every time we meet. Additionally, his staff, including his medical assistants, front desk personnel, surgical nurses, and his financial aid person have been very professional and always treat me with respect. Finding Dr Day and his Team of professionals, have been a major blessing to me and my husband.  I cant thank them enough! Highly Recommend!!!!!"
1,"Dr. Day and his assistant, Danielle, were excellent with my tooth extraction.  He came in, sat down, introduced himself and explained the procedure.  He talked to me during the procedure about what he was doing and how it was going and Danielle held my hand.  They were on time, and the bill was explained to me beforehand.  A terrific office.  As good an experience I can expect from having a tooth pulled.  Thank you."
1,"I'm finding these other two reviews to be very strange considering the experience my fiance and I had here.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say they've made some internal changes for the better, since the other reviews are 3 and 5 years old.\n\nThis place is wonderful.  The staff, the doctor - they are talented and completely comforting and warm individuals.  My fiance is the biggest baby when it comes to anything medical (the poor guy needs Xanax just to have his blood drawn, so when it came time for him to have his wisdom teeth out, no ifs, ands, or buts about it, this is where we were recommended to go.  I called our personal dentist and was informed that Dr. Day is one of the best oral surgeons in the state, which had me sold since my dentist (Dr. Mow) is pretty awesome.\n\nNot only were they able to put my fiance at ease, but surgery was completed within 15 minutes, everything went smoothly, and after we returned home they were completely available for any questions we had.\n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Day and his staff - they're super nice."

I was really happy with our experience with China Village the other night. We've been doing a lot of take out lately, and it's been hit and miss ( except with my Yelp leads), but the whole experience was satisfying. We called at 9:30pm and yet the food was  fresh and the gal was very friendly. We just had basic Beef Brocolli, Lemon Chicken, Sweet/Sour Pork & Chicken Fried Rice, but it was very satisfying. And when I asked for hot mustard, they gave us the good stuff in little cups, not packets.  Their dishes have a distinct flavor that is very good, not overwhelming at all, but not just the same old..."

1,"5 stars for customer service. This is our go-to place for Chinese take-out after having tried a bunch of places in our area. The food is consistent, standard Chinese-American, always hot, with fresh veggies. \n\nTonight, though, I was prompted to write a review. I am vegetarian and my husband is a little picky, and as such I made asked for some substitutions to our order. I ordered Mooshoo vegetable with no egg (my preferece) and veggie fried rice with added tofu and no mushrooms (hubbie's preference after finding a rogue mushroom last time). Also ordered a few other items.\n\n5 minutes later, China Village called back to double-check that I also didn't want egg in the fried rice since I had asked for it in the mooshoo. I thanked him for asking, and no, we did not want any egg in the rice. \n\nI went to pick up the order, and the sweet little lady at the counter told me that that also made sure to take the mushrooms out of our soup, since she was worried that we couldn't eat mushrooms and didn't want us to worry about finding them. \n\nThey did not have to pay such close attention to details, and I wouldn't have complained if none of these things had occurred. But because they went the extra mile, my appreciation was far greater than my dissatisfaction would have been. \n\nSupport this place and show them that customer service still means something!"

1,"of course this place has the best and coolest kitchen stuff. a stop on our Elite Yelp event, we were treated to a miniature cooking demo with some of their products. the chefs were funny and very personable. they cooked up some pies and pizzas for the group. \n\ni do like browsing. it's a bit out of my budget (sorry honey, i know you love kitchen gear). something i didn't know about williams sonoma....they host artisan and technique classes....and even will show you how to use a real chefs knife for free if you are like me and normally use whatever is handy to chop things.\n\na great shop, great products, great service."
1,"This store has the most beautiful kitchen items and is jam-packed with artisan goodies to make our home cooking easier. You immediately start thinking of how you can justify buying something. I'll make spring form-tarts every weekend! I can use these red placemats for at least 3 holidays! I need a better mixer to handle all the produce from our garden! \nAlso, I had no idea that they offer free cooking demonstrations and will teach you how to hold a knife properly or how to chop an onion? On this trip they were demonstrating pizza making 101 using their artisan dough mix, along with fresh toppings, in their pizza maker! They also have a fantastic mini pie maker that utilized some of their pie dough and filling and made mini pies in 7 minutes!! Sure they are highlighting their products, but they also tell you variations of use with your own homemade ingredients as well. \nThe staff was wonderful! Upbeat and friendly, it makes shopping here even more fun!"
1,"Found Framing' Works on Yelp...  Shop was tricky to find but once there all was good.  Alan was great to work with...patient while trying to put the perfect mat and frame together for my husband's Christmas gift.  A few weeks out, I was worried I'd left the project too late to get it back in time, but Alan said it would be done.  It was done quickly and beautifully!  Will definitely go back!"
1,Was referred by a family member a few years ago and they have never disappointed. Allen has always gotten my holiday framing projects done on schedule and at the highest quality. They've even coached me through sizing and canvas issues when I've enlarged photos all of which have turned out great. Take a look for yourself...
1,They met my tight time line for two dresses i needed on the weekend. even called and gave me the time i could pick them up. very efficient and friendly bunch.
1,"beautiful hotel, a lot of family noise by the beautiful pool\nthe room was huge and very nice, the air conditioner system wasn't the best but i would  recommend it, really nice people, entire staff from the driver to the bell boy and a great front desk crew, june 2011, and the continental breakfast was amazing amazing amazing, the best so far"
1,"I am staying here on a business trip right now. I was initially put off by the obviously very old hotel, however they've made up for it by having clean rooms, updated decor, friendly staff and an awesome happy hour and continental breakfast. \n\nThe complimentary breakfast is cooked to order so you may as well be at a restaurant with all that you can order. Happy hour at Squaws Peak Cafe, the only room on the fifth floor, is free bud light and shock top on tap as well as a few select wines, pretzels, fruit and Rice Krispie treats. \n\nThe staff has all been professional, friendly and super helpful. Our business meetings are taking place here and they have been more than accommodating in making sure everything goes off smoothly. They have also arranged dinner reservations and transportation for us at off site locations.\n\nRecommend :)"
1,"An absolute must for all Orthodox Christians or for those fascinated by monastic life. This is the only Greek Orthodox monastery in North America and founded by a living saint, Father Ephraim. I drove from Los Angeles, but people come from all over the world to stay as a pilgrim at this monastery. The 45 or so monks living here run a tight ship keeping the holly grounds in tip top shape. It's immaculate, with lush gardens, fountains, and gazebos. They've turned the place into an oasis in the middle of a hot ,dry cacti ridden desert. \n\nThere are several chapels within the monastery and one major church where most of the magic takes place. Most of the furniture and icons are brought in from Mt. Athos, considered one of the most holly places for Greek Orthodoxies. Sadly, no women are allowed on Mt. Athos. But that's besides the point. Women must wear long skirts and wear a mandili or scarf to cover their hair, basically do not show any skin. Men must wear long sleeve shirts and pants. \n\nYou can visit for the day or stay overnight as a pilgrim. If you are a pilgrim you can stay from 1 -10 days. You must attend all services, which means the big one from 1:45 AM to 4:00 AM every night. The first night I went at 1 AM and was able to kiss Father Ephraim's hand. After the night morning service, there is a breakfast of freshly baked bread (the monks bake like crazy), large and small bitter green olives from the olive orchards grown on the grounds, 2 types of halva, jam, nuts, fresh fruit from their orchards and coffee. This is a typical fasting breakfast (no animal products). After breakfast you go back to bed for another 3 hours of quiet time. Walking back to my room at 5 AM was beautiful. The desert stars and moon are bright, casting shadows on the cacti and the air is cool and fresh. In the day you are pretty much free to roam. Lunch is served at 11:30 AM and there is no talking aloud, except for a monk reading a chosen bible passage in Greek. When they ring the bell, you are allowed to pour water. A typical fasting lunch that I had consisted of braised green beans with calamari, fresh bread, olive, salad, and Greek macaroni. After lunch you can try to get a blessing from Father Ephraim, go to the book store, talk to some monks or other pilgrims. Another mandatory service is Vespers at 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM and afterwards dinner is served. After dinner is the last mandatory service. And then you are ready to go to bed at 7:30. No joke. I fell asleep before quiet hours even - I was feeling extremely peaceful and happy, yet exhausted. \n\nI will be back to the monastery with my dad. I was lucky to stay two nights with profoundly holly people and have an incredible experience."
1,"I visited this monastery with my in-laws recently.  We had heard about it from my bro-in-law and so we decided we'd visit on a Saturday afternoon ... we drove to Florence from Chandler and were surprised to find such an oasis in the desert.  This place really makes you feel like you're somewhere else - the beautiful buildings, the greenery, the peace you feel when you enter the monastery.. we were delighted to have taken the recommendation to visit.\n\nI had very respectable clothing (pants, long sleeve shirt), but they required women's head to be covered and a skirt to be worn, so they were kind enough to lend us elastic skirts that I just put over my pants.. and I found a scarf in the car - presto, ready to go!\n\nThe staff there is very friendly in the gift shop and they have wonderful treats and gourmet items for sale that are made from the gardens there and made by the ladies and gentlemen living a monastic life there... got some wonderful tea and delicious baked goods.\n\nWalking through the site was, again, peaceful and made you feel you were not in Arizona.  We enjoyed ourselves and I would recommend this place for adults (children make a lot of noise and it's very peaceful here) that appreciate these sorts of experiences .. nice day trip."
1,"Sun Valley truly does rock!\nBoth in quality service and products as well as displaying character and integrity in their business practice.\nI wanted to upgrade my factory head unit by adding aftermarket speakers and an amp... Ryan was very helpful and made recommendations based on my budget... Made an appointment and took the car in... The folks at the desk picked up the speakers and amp that was going to be installed, gave me a little more info to be sure where we were going and by the time I turned around my car was back in the bay... \nAfter killing a couple hours (short of the time they told me it would take...) I strolled back in and John approached me and told me there had been some kind of manufacturer's defect that he had never seen before and explained the options I had to address the situation. John said he assumed all responsibility for the problem and would absorb any cost to make things right. \nTo sum it up... the folks at Sun Valley acknowledged there was a problem, (and ultimately they could have rigged it so I would never have known there was a problem) made it a priority, and took care of it in a satisfactory and very timely manner. \nThe name brand components they recommended did indeed fulfill the objective I was looking for at a price about 25% lower than any other estimates I got. \nBottom line... I am very happy with the sound in my car now, and was pleasantly surprised to do business with an honest and conscientious group of people. \nAny future car stereo needs I have will absolutely be directed to this long time Valley company and I recommend them without reservation to anyone needing anything car stereo related."
1,I chose this place based on the great reviews on Yelp and my experience was exactly as expected. I brought my BMW 535 to them for a custom amp install and it looks and sounds great. Highly recommended.
1,"I recently went in to have them install a JL Audio 700/5 amp with a JL Audio 10\"" sub. I was so satisfied with the work that I went in the following day to have speakers installed. The staff was very helpdful and they don't just look to sell you anything. I plan on going back to have a remote start installed. I would recommend this place to anyone!!"
1,"I've been getting my old car fixed up and one of the things I decided to do was replace the blown speakers in the back. I found Sun Valley Stereo on Yelp and all of the great reviews are true. They recommended a pair of Pioneer Speakers that were reasonably priced and told me they could install them in about an hour. Actually, they were done in less than 45 minutes and once again my stereo sounds great.\n\nIf you need me, I'll be the guy with my windows rolled down, cranking the tunes!"
1,"The gang at Sun Valley Stereo is definitely top notch. Ryan gets right to the point and saw what I was interested in, and we worked together to verify that all the parts were in to upgrade my 2004 RX-8 with a Pioneer 4000NEX touchscreen and back-up camera before I drove 90 minutes for the work. When I first left there was some adjustments needed. They took me back in without hesitation and made everything right. The installer was committed to treating my car like it was his own. He took the extra steps to make it all right, and even fixed the hatch door to my 12-volt socket. Now that's going the extra mile! 6-stars!"
1,"Although I have only lived here for a year and a half now, I must say I still enjoy residing at the Verandas. We just got a new property manager, Nate, and he seems to have picked things up where Jen had left off rather smoothly. He has answered my questions promptly since I am currently transitioning to a different apartment within the complex. Nate has also been accommodating to both myself and Bryan, which I greatly appreciate his assistance with. He has an approachable demeanor, is to the point, and seems to be eager to get things done.\n\nI wish Jen the best in her new position within the company and hope for things to continue to go well here since we are also soon to lose one of the maintenance staff, John, who has been awesome. Thus far though, MC in my experience has had great staff; I look forward to the future here and am curious what Nate will bring to the table.  I hope he will continue the great communication and community that has been here at this place!"
1,"TOO bad Barb's is located on the way to my son's school...I get into SOOO much trouble here.  \n\nBarb's has been doing my family's birthday cakes for years and they never disappoint.  Great staff and it seems they can do anything!!  the best carrot cakes and red velvet cupcakes.  \n\nyes,  all goodies are sweet...and YES the icing is thick and sugary..but, this is how pastries,cakes, and cookies should be!!  I give out their seasonal decorated cookies to friends and I always get props for being the the \""best friend ever\""!"
1,"There's not much more to say than has already been said, so I'll be brief.  Barb's is such a great bakery.  Their cupcakes are eye candy and taste even better than they look.  If you're a fan of red velvet, please be sure to try one of theirs - they are wonderful!  When they haven't sold out, Barb's decorated sugar cookies are awesome.  The cookie itself isn't very sweet, but the icing more than makes up for that.  Enjoy!"
1,"I finally had the chance to have a piece of cake from Barb's Bakery and although the five pounds I gained from the cake hate me, my sweet tooth thanks me for finding yet another fabulous Phoenix bakery! Holy moly. If you are a fan of cake and cake that's soft, moist, sweet, creamy and perfect all in one bite, this is your spot. \n\nBarb's is an adorable bakery with a storefront full of everything from cupcakes and pastries to donuts and cookies. But it's her cake that gets her the five stars in my book. My youngest nephew (2 months) just celebrated his baptism and so of course that called for a celebration. I told my sister about Barb's so she grabbed the cake from there and brought it to the party. I could have started and ended with just the cake it was so good. \n\nThe cake was the perfect size for our group and they did a wonderful job of decorating it in honor of the baptism with white and blue frosting, his name, date and blue crosses. It was a three layer chocolate with vanilla frosting cake. I originally asked for a sliver but when I saw how delicious it looked, I opted for a normal size piece instead. Is it bad that I consumed every last crumb in under five minutes? I don't think so at all. I would do it again in a heartbeat! \n\nSo with that, I'm officially adding Barb's Bakery to my list of sweet spots."
1,"Barb's Bakery...they epitomize what the local community feel is all about. It's like stopping by an old friend's house or having your childhood best friend's parents make you breakfast. They are extremely friendly, their prices are great, and their donuts are needed on a cheat day. You can't leave this place without a smile. Cheers to Barb's for doing things the right way."
1,"OH MAN!! I am seriously addicted to their Pink Champaigne Petit Fours (TO DIE FOR!!!), and their frosted sugar cookies are a big hit around the office! I haven't gotten anything here that hasn't been fantastic! One of the best tiramasus I've had in a long time, and their cupcakes rival Sprinkles all day long!\n\nAlong with the delicious treats and beverages comes generally GREAT customer service, the gentlemen that work in the afternoon are super friendly and helpful! I did, unfortunately, have one bad experience with the woman they have working there Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, she was not pleasent or welcoming in any sort of way, and honestly made me feel like I was rather inconveniencing her by being there. I was SO shocked by the whole experience since I've been going in pretty regularly for a couple months now and had never had anything negative to say, until then. I remember thinking, \""Geez, I sure hope that's NOT Barb, and if it is, perhaps she's best suited for strictly baking...in the back...as far away from customers as possible!\"" LOL\n\nSo, I do definitely recommend Barb's for cake and cookie lovers alike, you will DEFINITELY score big points with friends, family and co-workers!! Although, I would encourage all my sweet toothed brethren out there to not go Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, so as to avoid the cracken, she's just awful! Bon Apetit!!"
1,"LOVE their decorated sugar cookies.  They are always colorful and festive for the appropriate season or holiday.  Most importantly, they are yummy!"
1,Best. Cupcakes. Ever.\n\n\nThat is all.  Carry on.
1,"One of my vendors uses this bakery a lot for gifts. I have had several of their sugar cookies and let me say, they are THE BEST sugar cookies I've ever had, ever. They're moist, sweet, and simply melt in your mouth with goodness."
1,"Barb's bakery was wonderful. They emailed me promptly with estimated quotes prior to scheduling our tasting. They asked us what design we were interested in, as well as flavors. We tasted three cakes and fillings, and left feeling comfortable that our cake would be exactly what we wanted. Their pricing is exceptionally reasonable - for $3.50/slice you have so many amazing options to choose from. Our cake was chocolate with a raspberry butter cream filling, and a butter cream frosting. They did decorative scroll work and ribbon on our three-tier cake, and delivered it. It not only looked amazing, it tasted amazing. Everyone raved about it. We would absolutely use them again."
1,Must try - Pink Champagne Cupcake
1,"Pros: Don't miss the frosted sugar cookies or the ooey gooey cake! \n\nCons: Few parking spots, run down neighborhood, and sometimes they run out of the stuff I like before I can get there."
1,"I've been in love with Barb's since I had them create an amazing cake creation for Make-A-Wish Foundation's 20th birthday 13 years ago. Consistently over the years they have never failed to disappoint. The best cupcakes around... adorable and delicious sugar cookies and the pastries... to die for!  I was just there yesterday and bought some petit-fours... for me! And no, I'm not sharing with anyone! Barb's is pure evil yummy goodness..."
1,"By far the best bakery I've been to!! I took some cupcakes and a couple of their cheesecakes to the office, they were gone in an instant!! Everyone loved them! Great staff too!"
1,"If happiness was an art form, it would be Barb's Bakery. The cupcakes are adorable and delicious! Everyone at work demands Barb's for meetings, birthdays, ect. The cupcakes are a regular at every family event. Thanks for being so amazing Barbs! You rock! :-)"
1,"Ordered a carrot birthday cake for my friend last week. Absolutely incredible!!! Everyone who ate it agreed. Now, I must mention that I'm a cake snob. I've eaten cake/cupcakes from Tammie Coe, Kick Ass Kakes, Treehouse, LGO and the list goes on. Barb's Bakery is nothing short of amazing in my humble opinion. This was the best carrot cake I have ever eaten. Super moist, full of carrots and walnuts, perfect amount of sweetness. Cream cheese frosting was perfect. If you need a cake for any reason, I can almost assure you, Barbs will not disappoint."
1,"The best cake, cupcakes and cookies in town. Will use for all future events. Thank you Barbs!"
1,"I ordered an 8\"" round chocolate cake with chocolate mouse and cream cheese frosting for my mother in law's 70th birthday cake. I asked to have \""happy birthday, sue\"" written on it. I had no idea that it would be so beautiful. White with very  pretty roses that had a hint of chocolate coloring on them and a band of chocolate on the bottom and chocolate writing. And it tasted delicious. Exactly what I wanted.. Moist and flavorful. I could not have been happier a"
1,"My fiance and I went to Barbs after being significantly underwhelmed by other bakeries in the valley.  I had been familiar with Barbs from cakes that had been ordered for birthdays at a previous company, and from the Petit Fours I'd pick up on days when I needed an extra special treat. \n\nOur venue had originally sent us to Honeymoon Sweets in Tempe, which we had a terrible experience at.  Our ideas were shut down at every turn as \""out of our budget\"" or \""not possible\"" and we left Honeymoon Sweets feeling deflated and like we'd have to compromise on our cake.   Not happy with the experience, we reached out to our venue to ask about other options.  We were asked what bakery we would like to use, and Barbs Bakery immediately came to mind.\n\nWe scheduled a tasting with Barbs and from the moment we were welcomed into the little shop, what a difference!  We had a great experience!  They prepared four different flavor combinations for us which we had requested, and sat down with a partnership mentality to work with us to design a cake that came within our budget, incorporated our ideas, and made us feel like we would get the cake of our dreams.  Instead of hearing \""no\"" or \""that won't work\"" from the owner David, we heard, \""that's a great idea!  Here's how we can make that work . . .\""\n\nWe absolutely LOVED the cake that was delivered to our venue, and we received rave reviews from guests.  If you are considering a cake from Barb's, do it!!\n\n~ The Bride"
1,"I'll be honest straight of the bat, I'm biased when it comes to this Borders, but this store has regrouped and begun anew! With better discounts than ever before and an in-stock guarantee, there's no way you could leave empty handed! Plus there have been some amazing events lately including free performances by the AZ Opera and Phoenix Symphony! Famous profiles have been booking their signings there too including Giuliana and Bill Rancic, Dr. Charles Stanley, and Mitt Romney."
1,"loved it, will miss it since it's going bye bye due to bankrupcy."
1,"It isn't well known but each Manuel's is owned by one of the children of the original owner- the best one is on Peoria, that is one that you hear good things about."
1,Great food...been eating here for thirty plus years. Food has the same top quality since I started eating here. Like family here....love the food! Best Mexican food!
1,Food is always good never had bad food. Service is good for the most part its very seldom that it is not good. But everyone has a off day. Wish the prices were not so high.
1,I wasn't sure what to expect but nicely surprised!!! Awesome margaritas and the three enchilada dinner was amazing!   And so reasonably priced!  New favorite Mexican!!!
1,"I've been to a number of car washes in this town, and Lindstrom's is the finest. As a self-professed neat freak and perfectionist, I can assure you that your car will be well-groomed at Lindstrom's.\n\nThey are not in the habit of upselling and pressure tactics - just pressure washing. They are friendly, willing to accommodate my needs, and clean without frills. I have been coming to their car wash for some years, and continually come back (even when I stray, wash my own car or pick one of those gas station car washes on the fly). \n\nLindstrom's seems a little sad these days, and emptied. Not sure if it has to do with the recession, the brutally hot Phoenix summer or the recent raid on their service staff by the Sheriff's office for \""identity theft\"". But, whatever the case, Lindstrom's provides a superior service, and is a local business, and for those two reasons alone, please frequent this establishment. Your car will thank you."
1,"I pulled into Lindstroms after a truck dumped a 5 gallon tub of white paint in the street in front of me during rush hour, coating half of my (dark gray) Honda Element. It was dry upon arrival and all over the right side of my car. They checked it, said they could fix it, told me how they would do it and how long it would take. I enjoyed a shoe shine while I waited in their welcoming facility, and they kept me apprised along the way. The end result was perfect and at a very reasonable price. Check them out, they have earned a new loyal customer (and I live in Peoria!)."
1,Super friendly and a great wash/vacuum for not a ton of money.
1,"I went to Lindstrom's car wash today for the first time, and had a great experience!   Just got the basic wash, but they did an awesome job! Not to mention prices are cheap compared to other car washes I've been to.  \n\nI don't usually \""expect\"" amazing customer service from places such as a car washes, however, I was blown away by Lindstrom! The young lady working at the desk was very talkative and friendly, and I didn't receive any pressure about extra ridiculous add-on's that other car washes most definitely always pitch.  The owner was there in and out checking on customers and his employees, he was super easy going and catering, told me if I had any concerns in the future to contact him and he'd take care of it!  AND listen up ladies... all Wednesday's are ladies night and you get $2 off!  \n\nOverall, super impressed and I will be coming back!  See ya later Danny's car wash!"
1,Went in for a quick wash and to shampoo the carpet and mats and got just that! They did a really old job on both for the $40 Carpet Express. Not a bad deal! The gentlemen there were very polite and checked on me periodically as I waited. It was about 45 minutes but my mats and floors were pretty dirty so I appreciated them doing a thorough job.
1,"Tragedy has truly struck in my life.\n\nI have been to this Loehmann's location once since moving to AZ about a year or two ago and then my car stopped working. Finally I fixed my car this week and couldn't wait to get to Loehmann's. I gleefully made the trip and devoted an entire day to shopping at one of my favorite stores in the world. \n\nAlas, as I drove into the oddly busy parking lot (I feared maybe they were having a mega sale and I was left out!) I looked toward the store only to cast my eyes upon a ripped down sign, darkened shuttered windows and locked doors. This Loehmann's has closed, and they never even told me even though I'm in their insiders club!\n\nI quickly parked my car and ran up to the doors to see if there was any note or trace as to when they closed or why. I'm sure I made a true spectacle of myself as I peered in and cried in agony to myself... almost with tears streaming from my cheeks. There is truly no justice in the world today.\n\nI suppose that they closed because nobody here really knows about Loehmann's like they do in the east and plus they were in a really strange area. It's true that this Loehmann's probably wasn't quite up to par with the ones in NYC (But how could you possibly compare them?) But they still had plenty of terrific things and I bought a ton of stuff when I came here. Looks like now I'll have to book a flight back to NYC just to go shopping at my favorite store again.\n\nLoehmann's, you will be missed terribly here!"
1,"One of the best steak restaurants in the city. I have consistently been treated to top shelf food and service here. I prefer the Indian Bend location, though the Camelback spot is convenient for business dinners.\n\nSorry to hear about Sarah's misadventure, I have not yet tried their seafood -- Ruth's Chris is all about premium aged steaks to me."
1,"This was the first time I had been to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, the food lived up to the expectations I'd heard from others.  The portions were good and the items came at the right time.  I did not feel rushed in any way and our waiter, Jimmy, did an excellent job answering every question we had.  I tried their special house dressing Rimaloud(don't know how to spell it) which was a kind of spicy creamy dressing, which I highly recommend.  My steak was cooked exactly to order and melted in my mouth, one of the best filets I've ever had.  \n\nThe restaurant was very nice, the type of place that you'd visit on special occasions, worth the entire experience."
1,"The FIRST TIME I've ever eaten a steak without ketchup!  No, seriously.  My family has teased me for years, but I like the taste of steak with ketchup, always have.  Didn't need it here!\n\nCelebrated Father's Day a little early with dear hubby. Reservation for 6:00 PM, we were greeted BY NAME by each person who served us. Having never been here before, really didn't know what to expect, but our server was killer polite and helped us understand the steak prep a little better. \n\nI had the harvest salad (the best salad I've ever had, no lie, and it was HUGE!) and DH had the caesar.  He said it was very good. We ordered wine, which complimented the meal spectacularly.  We each had the filet with shrimp combo, and DH had the blue cheese crumble topping on his. I think I died and went to steak heaven!  The topping was crunchy, creamy, and just delicious.  Like I said before, no ketchup anywhere on my plate.  I have never tasted a steak so delicious, so tender, so awesomely cooked with awesomeness.  We also had creamed spinach (meh), garlic green beans (these were delish) and a crab cake (again, delish!).\n\nAll in all, a terrific dinner.  Well over $200, but a terrific dinner nonetheless.  Already planning a return trip for 10th wedding anniversary.  Can you say, \""GIFT CARDS!?!!\"""
1,"Service is excellent. Best Steak in town. It is an expensive splurge, but worth it."
1,"$7 Reverse Happy Hour, yes, please!  Awesome drinks and a great value for your money!!"
1,"I'm partial to steak and Ruth's Chris is the epitome of awesome beefy goodness. Came here for my anniversary with my wife and had an excellent time. The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and surprised me and my wife with a special anniversary dessert and took a photo of the two of us. By the way, the steak was amazing, perfectly cooked, and butter soft. This is one of my favorite steakhouses in all of the land!"
1,"Okay, I love Houston's even though it's a chain. I travel about 90% of the time with my job and Houston's consistently has good food, clean restaurants and great service (I don't understand why all restaurants don't follow their service mantra...where every server takes care of every table...you never have a dirty dish sitting on your table or want for anything for more than 5 minutes.) It is safe to say I'm probably Houston's number one fan! (Just ask my friends who know Houston's is going to be my first suggestion as the place to go eat.) I frequent the 24th St & Camelback location in Phoenix the most. \""T\"" the hostess is absolutely terrific. I ALWAYS feel special when I go in there. All of the food is good. I love the smoked salmon or spinach dip as an appetizer. And the Ahi Tuna salad, the French Dip and the  chopped chicken salad are incredible. I try and make it in to the restaurant on Thursdays for their Chicken Enchilada soup which rocks! Finally, their Sundae is the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, it's difficult to make a choice between that and their key lime pie. I have a few complaints about Houstons, I don't like their tea or lemonade very much. Lemonade is too sour and the tea tastes artificial. I'm also bummed they don't have a blender in their bar for frozen margaritas. Perhaps it's because of the noise, not sure? The ambiance at the place is always relaxing. Portions seem to be getting smaller and prices have gone up (like everything else) so bring your wallet."
1,"Fridays are our date night and I must say I was extremely happy with our choice of restaurant. Houston's at the Esplanade has been a favorite of ours for years, but last night confirmed our feelings once again. After being told that the wait would be 15 minutes, we decided to go out to the patio and order our drinks. Less than 5 minutes later we were seated at our table. Impressive already! Our appetizers were wonderful! I didn't like artichoke until last night! Total Yum! My husband had the usual, the Pork Ribs and loved them.  As for me, I had the Grilled Halibut and couldn't be happier! The freshness and quality of my dish was to die for! I love Houston's!"
1,"i like it, i like it a lot! (you must say it like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber.)\n\nWe stopped in last night for dinner and cocktails.  I left quite satisfied with the experience.\n\nThe atmosphere, service, pricing, and food were all top notch.  \n\nI really LOVED the grilled artichoke...you must try this.\n\nI am excited to check out the new facility that will be opening late this year.  It is right down the street (in the spot that Chevy's was located.)\n\nCheck it out.."
1,"Although it leans on the pricey side of Phoenix cuisine, Houston's is by far one of my favorite places to go out for a nice dinner. Their veggie burger is beyond amazing (I always get the couscous on the side which is also delicious).\n\nOn a recent trip, my boyfriend ordered the ribs on a recommendation. He said they were by far the best ribs he has ever enjoyed."
1,"Love their hamburgers, both regular ones and vege burgers. The staff, particularly at the bar, are great. (Tom and Al). The wine selection is good. Appetizers I love include the spinach artichoke dip and the grilled artichokes. Yum!"
1,One of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  I take all my guests here when they visit town.
1,"Never been a huge Houston's guy. It's too dark, the menu is too limited, and while the food is good it somehow always fails to live up to the hype. Not bad, but not memorable, either.\n\nFrom what I understand, Hillstone is an amped-up Houston's, like a luxury badge on a Marriot hotel. Yawn. \n\nI tell you all this because heading into my first visit to Hillstone tonight I had zero expectations. None. Well, other than expecting to be underwhelmed.\n\nShame on me, because Hillstone hit a home run.\n\nA beautifully appointed, thoughtfully designed, approachably classy  indoor/outdoor dining venue, Hillstone offers the same dressed-down menu of a Houston's, but in a nicer setting with truly elite service.\n\nKaitlyn, our server, was attentive and exactly the right level of chipper. She was pleasing to both my 7-year-old niece as well as my 65-year-old mother. That's no easy feat. The burger was perfect, the beverages were never empty, the table was cleared on time, the check was dropped off and picked up seamlessly and the staff was always around but never a nuisance. \n\nAnd I love the setting. From the bar to the bathrooms everything just works. There are romantic corner booths and more lively center room talbes and the patio is gorgeous, with a perfect view of bustling Camelback Road. \n\nWhether it's a business meeting or a first date, Hillstone will definitely get my repeat business."
1,"I love Hillstone!!!!!! It is amazing!  I worked at Houstons when I was in highschool and you would think that I would be sick of it, but I am not!! I cannot get enough!  The spinach dip is the best ever created in the world!!!  I actually like the change to the salsa they did!  The Grilled Chicken Salad is a dream with the peanut sauce, or the Thai noodle salad-I love the mangos, tomatos, and avocados its delicious, or the caesar salad, or the hickory burger with fries, or the ribs and to top it off the sundae!!!! The chocolate sauce is orgasmic!!  i wish I could have it everyday! The new restaurant is a little confusing because the front door is in the back of the building and its kind of awkward b/c if you dont know that you will walk right in the middle of the dining room and bar area.  However, the restaurant is beautiful and so open and airy!  The patio is perfect and I wish I could have eaten out there but it was sprinkling and cold!  There is something for everyone here and you can go for lunch or dinner!  Head this way!!!"
1,"Most excellent in every way!!!  I like the thai steak salad and the fudge!!\nPlease, I beg you........ get some chocolate cake added to your menu. \nfor the love of us all!!!! P l E a S e...please...p l e a a a s s s e e e e!!!"
1,"Last night we met friends at Hillstone's and we truly enjoyed a great meal and great atmosphere.  \nWe were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening.  We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server, she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.  The croutons crisp and fresh baked.  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye, OMG!! So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I can't wait to go back.  Was always a fan of Houston's in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing."
1,"Two center cut filets, arctic char (split) and cold perrier with lime.  The steaks were cooked perfectly.  The char has been better, but it was still exceptional and the spicy corn and baked potato (with everything but the bacon) was awesome!  Service was prompt and considerate - always love it here!"
1,"I met Monsieur here for lunch today and I was so impressed with the new look.  I've always loved Houston's (now known as Hillstone's) and the food, service and decor have always been impeccable.\n\nThe only drawback with the new location is that you can easily pass it up and the lack of parking but otherwise, it is still a winner with the best filet mignon ever!!"
1,"Over the years I have been to Hillstone/Houston's over 200 times and I can easily say that everything is out of this world. The spinach and artichoke dip, cheeseburger, ribs, fish, french dip, hawaiin steak, the apple cobbler dessert...all amazing....They do everything right here and all for a great price. I never decline an opportunity to go to Hillstone. Did I mention they have a sushi menu? Be sure to get the coconut shrimp roll. It has sauce on the tray that it comes with but be sure to ask for extra!\nI always imagine if they were to have a brunch/brekafast menu, what it would be like. I think I would cry of happiness if they ever did."
1,"i love this restaurant so much. i have yet to have something i didn't like.\n\ni have nothing really special to add to all of the amazing reviews except to order these things:\n\nthai steak noodle salad- mango, avocado, tomatoes, noodles, marinated steak...i meannnnnnnnnnnnn\ncaesar salad - their dressing is my fav and so are the croutons\nbacon, cheddar burger- so juicy, so exquisite\nroast beef sandwich- raw horseradish on the side\nfries- order extra bc people will eat these babies UP! \n\n\nservice is ALWAYS good, it's always clean, it's always pleasant. seriously, you can't have a bad time unless you're just a miserable person."
1,The New York Strip special they have is top two in Phoenix- just have to get lucky when they have it!
1,"I loved it. Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and was impressed just by walking in. The ambiance was great, the little fountains and the patio area was very cool as well. \n       This is a steakhouse, the better the meal the more it's worth, so you will pay accordingly.  I had a filet and I loved every second of it, not only was is a pretty good size it was done beautifully.  The tortilla soup was even fantastic as well.   Drinks are also high quality. I had an awesome mojito.\n \n      I thought the employees were on point, it was a thursday night so I wasn't expecting the A team but they were awesome. Although the place seems kinda snooty the staff was friendly and proficient. \n \n           I've been to expensive steakhouses before, not always do I get one that delivers on all fronts."
1,"Great atmosphere, Awesome service, Great place but it can be pricey $$$. I Love that everything is so fresh! Including drinks I had one or two martinis and every ten min they would change my martini glass so it would never get warm always chill and fresh !"
1,Everything was great.  The Tomato soup was blissful.  Beautiful venue and exception service.  Luv it.
1,"I was in Phoenix for business and found this place based on yelp reviews.  I must say, this place is absolutely delicious!!  For starters, the service was very knowledgeable and friendly.  The chef's were extremely creative which led to my questions that the servers explained in completeness.  Lets get to the food... \n\nI came with 3 co-workers and all of our meals were delicious.  I had the pork ribs and they were fantastic.  I was able to substitute the sides for whatever I wanted without a problem.  Everything came out delicious!  The ribs were fall-off the bone, some of the best ribs I've had.  Extremely tender and not overwhelmed with sauce.  Highly recommend this establishment."
1,"I had a very nice meal here, definitely a place I'd return to. The place is comfortable, looks great, and has a nice ambience to it.\n\nI ordered the Hawaiian ribeye, with a loaded baked potato. The steak was very good, cooked a perfect medium rare, with a not-overwhelmingly sweet glaze. The potato was pretty decent as well. For dessert, I asked to be surprised with whatever they recommended, and was served a tasty ice cream sundae.\n\nIt was very good, on my short list for places to go for a nice night out."
1,Best affordable wine list in the valley. The food is fantastic and the service is even better. Love this place. Think I'll go there for lunch today :)
1,"Always delicious and classy!\n\nPros:\nTeam service\nTriple filtered water in chilled glass\nDaily specials\nMargarita (freshly squeezed)\nThai steak salad\nHawaiian rib eye\nKey lime pie- yum!!!!\n\nMy mom and I had a late lunch here Wednesday. We truly enjoyed the ambiance, food, and service!  With so many restaurants in the biltmore area it can be tough to choose where to go.  Thank goodness we chose Hillstone!"
1,"Best ribs ($30) that I've had in Phoenix thus far, hands down. It's even better than Bobby Q's (much less fat on the Hillstone ones). The french fries and coleslaw that come with it are of equal quality and bursting with flavor.  Loooooove!"
1,I wish they would bring back the Club Sandwich.
1,Great meal!! Crab cakes and asparagus were amazing. Our waitress India was amazing!! Offered suggestions that both me and my boyfriend got. No complaints. Coming back soon.
1,This is my go to spot. Service is consistently immaculate no matter who you get. Tom the bartender pays attention to the customers names and what they drink with everyone I see. You can't go wrong with any of the food. I've tried it all and love it all. I generally get the Thai tuna roll with a kale salad as it's clean and fresh. Atmosphere is beautiful..lots of celebrities stop by here as they generally stay in the Biltmore area.
1,"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I love their Martinis, and I love that when you're halfway done with your Martini they bring over another cold glass to replace your existing warm one.  The service is outstanding.  The ribs are amazing, but for $30 they shouldn't be anything but.  I do agree that Hillstone is on the expensive side, but I believe you're getting what you pay for.  Even their sushi is some of the best in town.  It's certainly my favorite.  Is it expensive?  Yes it is, but it's also amazing.  At $13-$21 a roll, it better be damn good!  The cheeseburger and chicken sandwich are very good as well.  You really can't go wrong here.  If you don't like it....I'm thinking the problem isn't the restaurant."
1,This place is excellent. Great tasting food and atmosphere. They have a real comfortable  patio area and the staff are very friendly and attentive to the customers needs. Had some of the best tasting food in a long time here and dessert was excellent as well. Would highly recommend this as a top place to have dinner to anyone.
1,"Jill, Tom and Al are the very best and provide A+ service consistently. The food is second to none."
1,"When you have impeccable service and phenomenal food, you will always have my attention and adoration. THIS place is my fave spot for every excuse possible to frequent it. It hits the mark every time. I love sitting at the bar or patio area because Hillstone just attracts quite the crowd of movers and shakers because what's the fun in a staring contest. \n\nDefinitely start with the house-smoked salmon. That in itself could be your entire meal with a couple of glasses of wine, but then I would be short changing you a review of their offerings wouldn't I? On a side note, always order the grilled artichokes if they are available. It will seriously ooze goodness all over your mouth. The last thing I think about is salad at a steakhouse, but I will say that the Blue Cheese Wedge Salad,  Chicken Kale Salad or the Yellowtail Sashimi Salad are my fave side dishes to accompany the Hawaiian Rib Eye, or the Prime Rib. \n\nHere's the crazy thing. They have sushi and I haven't even tried that because I am so smitten by the other choices. Says a lot for me to give 5 stars without trying everything.  I actually will have to venture back strictly for that feasting. While their sister restaurant Houston is a fave, Hillstone takes the spotlight. It sits in a class of its own, maybe because every outing has always left me with a dazzling smile. Parking can be nuts but I promise it's worth the walk and you'll appreciate the stroll after gorging on their culinary delights."
1,Place was packed on a Tuesday night so I had high expectations Was not let down The Hawaiian ribeye was cooked to medium rare perfection and I'm a stickler for cooking beef to order. Enough said really
1,"I love Macs. Fuck PCs (even though I own one).\nThe employees are a bit off-center, but when they actually come up to you and think you're hot, they're nice.\nHappened to me the other day.\nTrue story."
1,"I really love this store and the computers, iPods, iPhones, as well as the accessories that I have purchased for them at this location. The staff is extremely personable and helpful when they aren't tied up with others. The only gripe that I have is that sometimes the store, especially on weekends or nights, can be a zoo and all associates are often tied up. Bonus that I only need to hand them my credit card, with no other information, and I'm out the door with my receipt emailed to me."
1,"so we bought a new 24 in LED display online and it arrived. everything great, waited a week or two for the new MacBookPro to arrive before we could fire it up. (mini DVI, duh whats that right? lol)\n\nso boom it fires up for the first time and i see it. a black triangle of burned out LEDs WHOA!!! no fun. panic was released and calm restored. it's 2 weeks old, i'll take it to an Apple store for a replacement.\n\nso Saturday morning i made an appointment at the Genius bar to have them look at it, and hopefully say, \""We'll just replace it for you\""....\n\nwell after an interesting turn of events on the light rail, i showed up late, only 15 minutes. but my reservation was already voided..my fault. no biggie.\n\ni tell the guy at the genius bar check in what the deal is and he says, we can put you back in the queue and one of the genius can look at it.\n\ni said \""is there a way we can just get an exchange, i don't really want to hear that it would need to be shipped off to wherever to be fixed\"" he said sure, but they might have the parts there to fix it, and that the online stock and the in-store stock are different, so he might not be able to exchange but would go check into it....15 minutes later he walked out of the room behind the genius bar with another monitor. i walked over to the exclusive register since they switched over to the mobile point of sales set up. after a couple bar code scans i was walking out the store with a new monitor. a new monitor without burned out LEDs that is. \n\ni was happy.\n\nas far as the maddening POS system they have, i give it 3.5 stars\n\ni get the concept and that it should speed up sales, but when your ignorant to who has one of the hand held devices or don't even know thats how you check out. you can be seriously put off by the whole process. but now that i know. i have no issues with it. who really needs a bag anyways."
1,I love this place. I bought my wife a ipad for christmas from here and the sales person was very nice & helpful. In fact every time I have talked to a sales person at this store they have been very informative & helpful. I plan on buying an new imac soon from here.
1,"So I cracked my iPhone 4 and called Verizon (who I pay an insurance fee to each month) and they told me to try Apple first.  I did and after a short wait the young guy asked me how it broke, how high up it was when it fell (in my hand or off of a building?) and I said it was in my hand.  He clicked around on his device a bit and said \""normally we'd charge you $165 but i'll help you out today\"" and gave me a free brand new iPhone 4.  Plus Grant Hill (Suns player) was in there at the same time. good service!!!"
1,"Went in to get a new charger for my MacBook Pro, and they gave me a new one right away-- no wait, no paperwork. Super friendly staff and extremely quick service despite being very busy! Definitely one of the better Apple stores that I've been to."
1,"I have been using this clinic for over 20 years.   Being active in many different sports and outdoor activities I often have need for a chiropractor.  They are always professional, friendly and go out of their way to see me. Even adjusting me on a weekend at the Dr's home a time or two when I'd badly thrown something out."
1,"Newsflash!!  After 10 years of living in the East Central Phoenix area, I have FINALLY found my \""go-to\"" Greek place.   It's like comfort food, but it's the entire restaurant.  \n\nMy cousin and I stumbled into this place --- the location is a bit difficult to find otherwise.  We were waiting for our nail appointment at Andy's salon a few doors down and decided to grab dinner since we had time to kill.  Little did we know what happy customers we soon would be!   An affordable, local, delicious Greek restaurant which quickly earned a #1 rating in my book!  Can't wait to go back and try more!  \n\nThe woman who took our orders and cooked the food was just so wonderful!  She recommended the Spicy Chicken pita to me, so I took her word  (see my Humble Pie review, where I learned my lesson for not following restaurant recommendations!).  It was a great choice!!   My cousin had the gyro pita, which was melt in your mouth delicious too.  We also shared a spanekopita, which was just so fresh and well made.  It was piping hot food, she cooked to order (hold the onions for me!), and the flavors were perfect. \n\nThe portions were great, the hummus was tasty, the pita so soft and perfectly grilled.  The Olympic Flame has even mastered the use of garlic, which many restaurants seem not to be able to manage.  The only downside to this place is that I guess I won't scare vampires off at night after eating here (see my previous review of Eden's Garlic Grill if you are looking to keep the vampires away), but I will sleep well with a fully belly and leftovers in the fridge for tomorrow!"
1,"I really enjoy having Sunday Brunches here.  The outdoor seating is nice when the weather is right; they have set up some canopies so everyone sitting outside can really enjoy the warm weather.  The service is great and everyone is friendly.  The food is full of flavor and the portions are perfect; when you sit down you are served croissants and jam before ordering you meal.  When you think it is done your server brings out dessert for your table; it is always great, making the meal and experiance complete and satisfying."
1,"What a great place. Another instant top 5 favorite. Loved the food, the staff is wonderful, the whole establishment is quite nice. It is located in a pretty silly place but I love it. The ratatoullie is amazing and don't even get me started on the duck confit. Hands down one of the best meals I have ever had. So good."
1,"We went for restaurant week and had outstanding service, wonderful food, and reasonbale drink prices.  We really enjoyed beef tenderloin, smoked salmon quesadillas, and pecan pie.  My French Maritini with Grey Goose was awesome for $12.50!  It is a formal setting with low lighting for a nice romantic setting."
1,"Vincent's remains my all time favorite. It's been ten years since I have been here but the quality is the same. The spinach salad had warm sauteed mushrooms and bacon with a balsamic reduction all in perfect proportions. The duck confit wasn't on the menu. No problem. Vincent prepared it anyway and is was to die for. The brown sauce was perfection. Then, just when you are ready to cry uncle out comes the souffles and chocolate bombs. Spoon in a little creme anglais and you have gone to gastronomic heaven. A comprehensive wine list that might be weighted a little too much on the high end on the French side but plenty of good California choices in the affordable range. This is a very special restaurant with a world class chef that is a treasure known to all Valley of the Sun natives. Don't miss it."
1,"What a fabulous dinner at Vincent's on Camelback. Thankfully Chef Vincent G. was in the kitchen  when we recently dined and the meal was absolutely superb. We began with an appetizer of foie gras with Schnepf Farm peaches and a balsamic glaze. A small portion, but if you love foie gras as we do then you will not be disappointed. Meltingly lucious. For a salad I chose the Raddichio with Belgian Endive and it was so wonderful. It consisted of a mixture of chopped raddichio, belgian endive, pears, pecans, and a mild blue cheese in a lovely, mild vinaigrette. I plan to try to duplicate this at home as it was so delicious. My husband had his heart set on a lobster salad but it was not on the menu that night. Not to worry though as our waiter, Dino, said he was sure the kitchen could do one. They did not disappoint. It was a lovely salad they created with big chunks of lobster and heirloom tomatoes. My husband said it was perfect. For our entrees I chose the lobster in beurre blanc with basil pasta. That lobster was  a small one (the waiter said it would be a whole lobster split, but a small one)  but I have to say it was as sweet and fresh tasting as ones I've eaten in Cape Cod or Maine. Just incredibly delicious and the basil pasta was a perfect accompaniment. My husband ordered the duck confit and I have to say after tasting his I'd be very hard pressed to decide which entree I liked best. The confit was served with lyonnaise potatoes. Chef Vincent really did some magical things in his kitchen to give a crispness to the layer of duck fat sitting on top of the thigh and drumstick. We are confit fans but unless you have a gallon of duck fat at home it's pretty hard to duplicate in your own kitchen, plus it's doubtful it would taste as good as this one did. For dessert we both chose the Grand Marnier souffles served with a creme anglaise. Those beauties were ethereal and heavenly....like eating a cloud with a sauce that begs to be licked off the spoon. The service by Dino and the other waitstaff was top notch. We managed to greet Chef Vincent as we were leaving and told him how much we appreciated his genius. This chef is a Valley treasure and if you have not had the chance to try his restaurant you are missing out. He was the winner in the past of the James Beard SW  Chef awards and it's not hard to see why. He is French born and French trained and in my humble opinion NO ONE COOKS AS WELL AS THE FRENCH. We will return as soon as we can. This is still my favorite restaurant in the Valley bar none."
1,"Very knowledgeable wait staff to help suggest wine pairings with your meal, and the food is consistently amazing from bite to bite and dish to dish. A very romantic place to take your significant other, or just an excellent place to have a terrific meal with friends. Everyone should experience this place at least once, it's that good."
1,"I have been going to Jonny for 30+ years for cut and color.\nOccasionally when I am traveling, I've tried another hair dresser and have never found one that compares to the quality of Jonny's hair cutting and coloring skills.\nShe is the best!"
1,"This little place adjoins the main restaurant, Vincent's on Camelback, by Chef Vincent Gerithault (sp?).  All simple and astonishingly delicious dishes.  I've had their salads, coq au vin, burgundy beef, salmon, specials, desserts, and not a dog in the bunch.  Service has been spot on.  Every time.  The atmosphere is \""French country\"" and very comfortable.   When the bill comes, it almost appears to missing a digit - it's very affordable.  The whole place exists for the sheer purpose of sharing the chef's delicious, beautifully-presented meals.    \n\nThe main restaurant is there to really showcase the Chef's true talent and should not be missed.  It's a great value as well, but expect to pay for a real meal.\n\nOne last thing, during the cooler months, the parking lot at Vincent's (Cmbk, West of 40th St) is turned into something like a farmer's market with a lot of delicious food served up.  It's very comfortable with a European feel and usually well-attended.  It's a great way to taste some great food."
1,"Their prix fixe menu gives almost unbelievable value on truly fine eats. Truly fine. And some nice-priced tasty wines. Not for the real snobs, maybe (they go to the fancy end of the building), but this place is absolutely one of the best of the best - I'd give it 6 stars if I could, and I eat out a lot and in many different places. Stop reading & get your tookis to Vincent's Bistro."
1,"Welcome to Paris in the desert. Je t'aime Vincent's. Anything Vincent's does I love. Whether it's the 5 star dining in the front, the market bistro in the back or the Saturday morning marketplace outside. They really know how to frenchafy AZ. \n\nI've been to Vincent's Market Bistro several times and most recently, last night for a friend's birthday. The Market Bistro is the more intimate, kitchen style dining at Vincent's and actually my favorite way to dine there. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd entered a cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of Paris. The food was cooking, the guests at the tables were laughing and having a great time and the waitstaff knew almost everyone by name. The authentic french decor helped the cause as well. \n\nWhen I hear the name Vincent's, I immediately think \""oh yikes, here comes a pricey night,\"" but the best part about it is that the market bistro keeps the evening at an incredibly reasonable price without losing the quality of food. Are you ready for this? I got the pre fix meal that began with a delectable crab cake on a salad with avocado garnish, followed by the lobster chimichanga and topped off with the chocolate tart which was really a chocolate souffle. How much? $20. Only $20 my friends! It was delicious. With each savory bite, I became a little happier. The wine by the glass was only $5-$6 dollars and at the end, the waiter brought us a couple additional desserts to make sure we tried them all. Just what my waistline needed...but I had a bite, and I think the lemon tart is my favorite. \n\nVincent's Market Bistro has definitely been added to the rotation of favorite places to dine with character. And when I walked outside and the heat hit my face, I didn't even mind because I had such a great time at Vincent's."
1,"Gotta give it 5 stars.  I wouldn't change a thing about it, from the ambience to the server to the food quality. \n\nTo start, like a reviewer said before me, the valet parking does seem to be for the actual Vincent restaurant, rather than for the Bistro.  And yes, there is parking in the back.\n\n**Another note**:  The Market Bistro only takes reservations for parties of 5 or more.  Two of us went at 7:00 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately.\n\nWhat we ate that we actually ordered:  Lobster bisque, salmon quesadillas, coq au vin, seafood skewers.\n\nWhat the server brought-- for free for us to try-- which we ate but hadn't ordered:  The butternut squash ravioli, mini pumpkin chocolate brownie with ice cream on top.  (And of course the mini croissants at the beginning of the meal.)\n\nEverything we ate was beyond fantastic, with one exception-- the seafood skewers were a little bland.  Not \""bad\"" by any means, just not as flavorful as seafood can be.  The real standout was the butternut squash.  Our second favorite was the salmon quesadillas.  EXCELLENT.\n\nEven better:  our entire bill, including my friend's glass of wine and my soft drink, was $48!!\n\nI will go back again and again.  (And to all you thriving young bucks, this would be the perfect place to take a first date-- classy and unique, yet unpretentious, with amazing food and a manageable cost.  Score!)"
1,"Absolutely love this place!  French bistro food at a reasonable price - gratis dessert and croissants.  Simple, casually elegant, a little noisy - and by all means yummy.  Its really hard to not like the offerings.   \n\nThis gets 5 stars for filling a really awesome niche in Central Phoenix."
1,Great food! Great prices! Great service!  We have gone to Vincent's next door several times but it is very expensive.  But the Market Bistro is very affordable and still has a nice ambiance and awesome food.\nThey always serve croissants and a dessert!
1,Great Sunday breakfast after church.  The staff is friendly and was great with my daughter.  Croissants are yummy and my daughter loved the cookies after the meal.
1,"Reliving my summer in France, I have been sampling French cuisine around the valley.  Found this quaint little bistro that is so charming.  The ambiance is spot on French country.  The colors, furnishings, paintings and flowers on the plates made me feel like I was in Provence was more.  Stopped in for a late breakfast.  The mini croissants and preserves were wonderful.  Ordered a quiche that was absolutely perfect with such lovely flavors and served with a wonderfully light salad.  I can't wait for my next visit to the French countryside of the Vincent Market Bistro."
1,"You know that little, lesser-known, hole-in-the-wall, amazing restaurant that you wish you could think of on a beautiful Saturday or Sunday morning, to spend your entire morning at, enjoying the weather, sipping fantastic coffee with impeccably made pastries (croissants!), rich b\u00e9chamel sauce on some incredible egg dish and a waiter that just brings you randomly delicious things that you didn't order (and he doesn't charge you for!) because he had them in the back and just thought you might like them? Well, you found it.\n\nThis is the \""little secret place\"" you take your out of town friends to. This is the place you lose track of time at with your good friends, laughing and eating the whole morning away until you leave stuffed, totally happy and ready to relax and enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nLove this place. Easy to recommend. We have wandered in on Saturday and Sunday anywhere between 9 and 11am and never had an issue finding a seat. Very casual experience. Start with a cappuccino, enjoy the fresh hot croissants for a while, maybe get a chocolate one (dear god, so good), maybe another cup of coffee, order some breakfast, talk, laugh and just enjoy.\n\nThen be shocked at the end of this beautiful meal when the bill comes, and it is no more than any other breakfast place and the owner probably didn't even charge you for some of the items just so you'd have a better experience (happened every time we've gone). Vincent's place has a really wonderful/relaxed energy that is all about enjoying your day and we do every time we go."
1,"This place is a solid 5 Stars in my book. We took our N. Scottsdale friend here for her Birthday Dinner based on reviews from some friends on Yelp and were blown away with every aspect of this Beautiful Market Bistro. Once you find the entrance and park your car you walk up to a colorful patio decorated like you would see in a French painting by Claude Monet. You notice everyone there enjoying themselves with a glass of fine wine and a table full of tasty goodies. The inside is interestingly charming and colorfully decorated in the same eloquent fashion. Nice.\n\nWe got there early to avoid the crowds and it was perfect. We were also greeted instantly and told to sit wherever we wanted. The server showed up faster than if I had a magic wand. He informed us of the specials while he got our drink orders going as well as bringing us a complementary plate of some of the best tasting buttery croissants I have ever had before. We asked a few questions and he happily answered us with no hesitation and was most informative.\n\nWe started with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla with Dill & Horseradish Cream for $10 and it was delicious. For entr\u00e9es, the ladies ordered Saut\u00e9ed Salmon with Herb Rice and Basil Beurre Blanc for $12.50 and Beef Bourguignon with Mashed Potatoes for $14. I selected the Seafood Skewer with Pesto Sauce and Scalloped Potatoes for $13 off the specials menu. We were all amazed at how nicely the vegetables were cooked just right. The fresh ingredients, textures and flavors were spectacular with all the dishes. Could not help asking for another plate of croissants to sop up all the extra juices and sauces since I was told by the wife not to lick the plate. When we thought we were done the server brings each of us a small plate of flourless chocolate cake topped with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Yummo!\n\nWe had such a great time there and the bill was very reasonable for the quality of the food and the friendly service we received. We will definitely be coming back again sooner than later. Fantastique!"
1,"By far one of the best restaurants/bistros in the US! Scrumptious dishes. Super friendly staff. Great value. I love having lunch at Vincent on Camelback. Coq au vin is divine, and soupe du jour is always a fresh treat. Complimentary dessert is served at lunch time. Trust me, you will love this place as much as I do."
1,"It is hard see how to improve Vincent Market Bistro.  Some have complained about table crowding in this relatively small restaurant, but there is ample room to maneuver and the noise level is not a problem.  \n\nThe portions are not large, but they are not ridiculously small either.  You will probably want an appetiser and a main course, and possibly a dessert.  Get them all for $28 by using the prix frix offering.  This consists of a choice from 3 appetisers, a choice from 3 entrees, and a choice from 3 desserts.  The entries are top-end items too, such as steak, lobster, or rack of lamb.\n\nHINT: I was told that reservations are not taken, and even on a weekday the venue gets crowded.  My suggestion is to go early, like 6 o'clock."
1,"I've come here quite a few times now, mostly for lunch. Each time I go, I get excited to see the daily lunch specials they offer. I've ordered the lamb shank, lobster quiche and beef bourguignon. They all have been really good. To accompany the meal they also offer free croissants that are served with a raspberry preserve before the meal and a small dessert at the end. Although the prices of the lunch special have steadily gone up from $10 since the first time I've been here, I think the quality of the food and the ambiance is still worth every penny."
1,"I literally just came upon this coffee shop thanks to Yelp!, and thank goodness.  I've been searching for an amazing cup of coffee and I found it.\n\nI'm pretty sure the owner was the amazingly helpful and nice lady working behind the counter, (I saw her picture in an article posted on the wall). She was great.\n\nMy coffee was amazing, nicely priced, and extremely fast.\n\nI will be returning and spreading the word!"
1,"This place actually has a new owner now and it's been renamed the White Cup Coffee.  Either way, I like this place before, but I LOVE it now!!  \nSherry has done a great job of giving the place a face lift and it feels so much more cozy and inviting on the inside.  \nThe coffee is still stellar, and my absolute favorite place to grab a drink despite the numerous little mom and pop coffee joints in Arcadia.  If you like Chai latte's, I encourage you to try theirs... you will never order one anywhere else.  I promise you!!\nThe customer service here is so warm and welcoming. I will sometimes stop in with my 9 month old on the way to her daycare and all the employees know her.\nI came in one day just before they were about to close and Sherry let me stay and get an hour of work done while she was cleaning up.\n\nShe also has great interaction with her other customers and I can tell there are already a lot of regulars here.  Great place!!"
1,"I met with Doctor Mayy Deadrick a few weeks ago and immediately felt at ease. I can tell that she will be a wonderful family doctor. Best of all, Mountain View is home to several doctors so we should always be able to get in the same day or the day after we get sick. The waiting room felt clean and comfortable too, which is a big plus for any doctor's office."
1,"Best. Doc's Office. EVER. \n\nMy primary care doc is Dr. Mansfield and she is AMAZING.... as is her assistant. I don't know what I'd do without them. I've also been to other docs if I'm really sick and can't get in to see her, and they've all been great. The front desk staff is very friendly and quick with processing people through. You never have to wait long with an appointment and they have a streamlined process to get people through to a doc quick, but not so quick that you feel like you're just a number. They listen to what you have to say and don't just give you meds for the sake of giving you meds.... which I LOVE! These guys rock!!"
1,"Dr. Mansfield is amazing. She listens and provides valuable feedback and resources. I just moved t the area, and I was worried about finding a new physician. I'm not worried anymore; in fact, I'm going to stick around even though I've moved to Tempe. Fabulous care."
1,I have been a patient of MVFP for over 10 years.  I have a great Dr. (Roseann Collins). And I find them to be organized and efficient.  Nothing but good experience with them.\nRichard
1,"ZUMBA. Tony, Brandon & RyRy are the fantastic!  I recently moved back to Phoenix from San Diego and even though I have been doing Zumba for a few years, every class is different.  These guys are fun, energetic, motivating, have great play lists and easy to follow, even if you are new to Zumba. I love their classes!!"
1,"I've been training with Brian for about 6 weeks.  So far, I've lost 10 pounds and am so much more toned.  My workouts are never the same.  I feel better than I have in a long time and I actually enjoy working out now!"
1,"normally, i love/hate going to the home depot. everytime i go, i get so many ideas of what i want to do to my home and yard, buy a bunch of stuff, then spend the next 8 weekends cursing wildly in the yard for starting yet another project. \n\nalso, going to home depot has always been stressful. i pretty much know how to do most anything, but i still need help finding the right pieces and parts (because i often overlook small details like measurements and sizes and thus wind up going back several times to get the right thing). it would be so much easier if a depot employee would just help me out a little. \n\nwell, this time i got lucky. gardening. not a strong suit but i'm tenacious and damnit, i will get it to grow one way or the other. still, this time, i didn't need help with my choices, but while loading a bag of sand into the truck, those darn paper bags...one of them burst. luckily Gabriel, one of the associates in the garden center must have overheard my F-bomb and came out with a shovel and broom. he first offered to go get me another bag, but it was my fault, so i would've felt guilty. when i declined, he helped me refill the bag almost down to the very last grain, duct taped the hell out of it, and all of it with a smile. \n\ni'll have to change my regular depot to this one if that's the kind of service they offer!"
1,"I visit a lot of Home Depots. They  do carry a lot of things made in China, which is not always good when you are trying to build things. They won't last.\nSo the solution to that is you must read the labels.\n I do purchase a lot of Items here though. So they must be doing something right!\n The very best thing about Home Depot is the great return policy.  If something breaks, or you bought too many, or it is just not right they take it back. WIthout a lot of drama. I really like them for that, and that is why I really like to shop here. \nLots of parking in the lot. The staff is very helpful and friendly."
1,Extremely helpful and positive staff. Did an online order for pickup and then did some miscellaneous shopping.  Special thanks to Tracie at the customer service desk who directed us away from and to items that were better suited for the job we were doing.
1,"The Asst Mgr, Roddy went above and beyond in helping me to resolve an issue with homedepot.com. Thanks to his exceptional customer service, and patience with this extremely upset customer, I will continue using Home Depot as my supplier. Great Job"
1,"For what it is, it's the top of the heap.\nDive bar with spectacular craft beer selection.\nSeveral nights of free entertainment each week, including live bands and stand-up comedy shows, trivia, what else? I guess that's it, but those things are awesome.\n\nFriendly staff, clean enough, and i won't pretend to not remember whether or not i already mentioned the spectacular beer selection, but seriously, it's a really special, extensive menu for beer connoisseurs. one of the best (in a small joint) in the valley."
1,This place is a low-key hideaway with friendly staff. I would not really call it a dive; it's more neighborhood bar. Watching live music here is a really up close and personal experience. They support local live music.
1,"This is truly a hidden gem and I mean truly hidden! Even with the help of the trustee Yelp app, we still drove around and around the shopping center, only to finally see the glimpse of a sign out of the corner of our eyes. With a couple turns, we came to the back parking lot where the sign welcomed us inside. \n\nIt might be hidden now, but I learned that the Ice House Tavern has been around since the early 1960's...during the era when the ice rink was in the middle of a booming mall and a center attraction. I can only imagine how popular the Ice House Tavern was during those days. Although the mall is long gone, the Ice House Tavern survives and serves as a memory of what Phoenix used to be and it's a very cool memory at that. I just wish the mall was still there. How cool would it be to have a skating rink in the middle of a shopping mall!\n\nI must admit, we were a little nervous parking in a secluded back parking lot and walking into a windowless bar, but we had been reading about this bar for years and had to check it out! The moment we walked in, we knew we'd made a good choice! The very friendly and knowledgeable bartender welcomed us inside while two old timers sat at the bar and started to chat with us. Now as the other reviews say, the very coolest part about this bar is the fact that the bar's back wall is actually the window looking out onto the ice rink! We happened to stop by during the men's league championship hockey game so we got to watch a hockey game while we enjoyed a drink! \n\nSpeaking of drinks, who would have thought that this was a bar for a beer aficionado! The bartender handed us a thick binder that listed pages of beer and then the description of the beer. They have several different unique beers here and the bartender knows each one! I also enjoyed the food menu. It's simple. It's one item. When we were there, they were featuring a pulled pork sandwich and it was tasty! It was pecan smoked meat and had a sweet BBQ flavor to it. \n\nEverything about this bar is vintage, casual and friendly. It's truly a neighborhood bar and although we were first timers, we felt like family by the time we left. Besides watching people ice skating, they also have games including Big Buck Hunt. \n\nDon't let exterior appearances fool you and give this place a try!"
1,"I can't believe I've live .9 mile away and have just visited this find for the 1st time. Heck, it's next to Walmart! (I go to the Walmart purgatory all the time.)\n\nAs described previously, finding this dive bar is a hunt. Trust me, YOU CAN DO IT! You should do it. Where else can you pick from a huge beer list and watch hockey? I don't even like hockey  (Sorry everyone :) and found the experience awesome.\n\nYou can saddle up to the bar, which provides an eyeball view of the action, or go up a level and look out. Last night there was even a band! (The Leavehers rocked!)\n\nRIght, so where is this bar? In the strip mall that's stage left to Walmart. Drive around to the back, keep driving, and eventually you'll see what looks to be a loading dock area. Up high are two signs that don't particularly look legit. (They're not actually formal building signs, but plastic banners you might see on a fence. No joke.) \n\nThe door has a tiny awning and there aren't any windows that let you see into the bar. (Just two stop signs stating \""21 and over\"".) YOU HAVE ARRIVED! \n\nNo matter who you are be ready to show ID. \n(Don't be flattered ladies. I was, but alas, for no reason :)\n\nThe beer menu is incredible. I focused on the Porter section. (Porters have their own section!). By looking at microscopic print (or maybe I should get old lady glasses) I learned they have some items on a seasonal basis, or rarely. For this reason I hopped on down to the bar and asked the bartender for guidance. The bartender is SUPER NICE. I love her.\n\nFOOD? They serve one hot sandwich. Super deal at $6.75 (that pice includes taxes)! There are also chips (Doritos, etc.) and they have hot popcorn.\n\nThey also had a few beers on tap. You can pick up a small pitcher for $6!\n\nMUSIC? The jukebox is free! How so? They feature local bands only. I think this is wonderful. Music all night (after the band finished their set) and no need to continuously plug a machine with stripper dollar bills. (What? I've never been to a stripper club!)\n\nDefinitely coming back here!"
1,"I've always wanted a family friendly jeweler.  Esp. if my at the time boyfriend was going to buy me an engagement ring.  It means so much to me to have the true customer service when buying fine Jewelry, someone I can trust.  And when I found this place one day while I was at CVS I knew I had found a Gem (pun intended)! Peggy really made me and my now finance feel like we were family.  She helped him pick out my fabulous ring and answer every single one of his questions.  I'm so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because I think everyone should know about this place!  If your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile, head on over.  They are so excited to help you!"
1,"Definitely a must-try! The building itself isn't much to look at but the parking lot is always full and that's a great indication of yummy-ness. It caters to both meat and veggie eaters with fake chicken, duck, and beef plates. They also have mock seafood plates as well. \n\nMy friend and I went to check this place out because we had heard so much about it. She ordered the lemon grass chicken and I tried the ginger duck. Both were so tasty and we were kinda freaked out because they tasted just like the real thing. The service was excellent and kudos for the waitress who kept filling up our waters...even AFTER we paid the bill. It's reasonably priced and the food portions are perfect. We even had leftovers."
1,"Tasty, even if you are not a vegetarian, you will like this place. The food is great, it is inexpensive. The atmosphere is a bit lacking, but two out of three ain't bad."
1,"Of course this place gets all stars from me.\n\nLemongrass chicken is probably my idea of Grand Master Flash Heaven. Speaking of Heaven, also try the Seventh Heaven Salad rolls thingies.\n\nService is slow but by the time I think about it I'm too busy concentrating on the infomercial/yoga session video of the Supreme Goddess Master on the big screen, who never seems to age. Maybe they just switch her out when the last one dies.... Plus there are ALWAYS weird-looking people sitting nearby who order it up something ferocious, and it's fun to discuss what they could possibly do for a J.O.B. with those white-people dreads.\n\nThat is not to say that service isn't good, because it is.\n\nI couldn't believe it, but someone who went to the Veg House with me actually decided right then and there that he liked tofu. He had never had it before that day, save for a few nightmares, which is just unfair.\n\nI do wish it were open more, though. Kind of a PITA to drive up only to find the place locked."
1,"One of the best vegan restaurants in Arizona.\nClay pot sensation, curry soup, summer rolls, heaven rice rolls, Philly dream, BBQ noodles and Hawaiian burger are all excellent.\nWe go to both locations (Glendale and Phoenix) regularly since both have slightly different menu options (Glendale has delicious Pho and their Carrot Cake is incredible).\nLoving Hut serves amazing food! We have been to locations in San Diego and Orlando and all are DELICIOUS."
1,"Winner.\n\nYou want healthy?  You got it.\nYou want vegetarian/vegan?  You got it.\nYou want your food to taste amazing?  You got it.\nService?  You guessed it.\n\nA spicy cha cha might sound like something you might want to avoid, but don't look over this menu item at Loving Hut.  I don't even remember what was in it, and frankly I don't care... it was simply amazing.\n\nStart with a variety of the spring/summer/egg rolls and get a few different dishes, because you're going to want to try as many as possible.\n\nNext time I will definitely start with dessert.  I could see how you'd always end up too full after dinner, but they look too amazing to miss."
1,"This place is a less expensive but just as tasty Green. (But no tsoynamis.)\n\nGreat service, enjoyed the Noble Broccoli, chocolate cake! All vegan, but I went with a non-vegan and he also loved it.\n\nWeird white atmosphere, but quiet and clean!"
1,"The service is great at this location. Out of the different entrees ordered in my group, my favorite was the Spicy Cha Cha. Usually I can't handle hot spicy, but this one was manageable and DELICIOUS! It goes well with brown rice or the House Fried Rice. If you have time and room for dessert, definitely get the Strawberry Cheesecake. It's organic, vegan, and gluten free! It is definitely hands-down the best cheesecake I have had at any vegan restaurant."
1,"I am not a vegan, but I could eat here everyday!  Great quality and delicious. Very friendly staff!"
1,"Every time I go to this place, my taste buds thank me. I have tried many different meals, and each one has its own great flavor. I have also tried some of their desserts and drinks, totally tasty. People are super friendly there and it has a nice clean fresh atmosphere. Even my meat-eating husband complimented the faux-meat dish he got. I wish they got more business though, the parking lot is almost always empty when I go. The hours are a bit weird but I can understand it if they don't get customers all day long. If I could afford to eat out every day, I'd go to this place for sure. There are so many things still on the menu that I want to try."
1,"I went to the Loving Hut for the first time and really enjoyed the whole experience! The dining area was clean and well lit. The service was prompt and polite. They even ran my girlfriend's purse out to us in the parking lot after she forgot it at the table (I told her she was going to forget it..).  They had a variety of Asian dishes and a few interesting American-inspired entrees for those looking for something different.  \n\nI ordered the Heaven Rice Rolls as an appetizer and the BBQ Noodles entr\u00e9e.  Both dishes infused fresh, uncooked veggies into the meal in a way that didn't compromise taste, but didn't leave you feeling regretful afterwards as some oily or fatty meals can.  And the entr\u00e9e, as well as everything on the menu, was under $10! Great quality, healthy vegan food, served by a polite staff, for a reasonable price; that is what you can expect."
1,Love the studio and the family feeling of everyone there.  My daughter started ballett the first of the year and is having such a great time.  Thank you Regina and Jason for this wonderful studio.  Keep doing what you are doing!
1,"I have seen Dr. Bob and his sister as well. They are very soft-spoken, gentle and knowledgable. My neurologist recommended me to them.\n\nNote: they are opthalmologists not optometrists."
1,"I had Lasik this afternoon. It's now 8:43 PM. I just woke up from my post-op nap and I'm the happiest dude in Tempe. I haven't been able to see this well since I was a little kid. There's nothing like standing in my backyard and staring up at the finite features of the moon through my own eyes.\n\nLasik itself is great but obviously I'm not reviewing a surgery. This place deserves five stars for four major reasons. 1.) They were overwhelmingly friendly from the minute I walked through the door. 2.) They did a fantastic job preparing me for what to expect. 3.) I arrived at their office at 2:15 pm today and was done w/ surgery by 3. I know some people might think that sounds a little cold and impersonal but it wasn't. The doctor was extremely friendly and as soon as I shook his hand I relaxed completely. 4.) This surgery cost me 700 DOLLARS TOTAL! I responded to a banner ad they were running on Google for 299 per eye. I assumed it was a bait and switch. For me, it wasn't. I understand that everybody's eyes are different but I qualified for that price."
1,"I had LASIK done here in June 2012. I was initially drawn to it by Tim G's review, hoping that I would also qualify for the $299 per eye prices. Unfortunately, when I had my consultation they quoted me about $8-900 per eye for traditional LASIK. (I can't remember the exact price they quoted). My contact prescription was -2.50 in both eyes. I was a little bummed and decided that I didn't want to continue and I left. I was already starting to regret that I didn't just get it over with, as it was something I'd been wanting for awhile, when about a week later, they called me and offered me a lower price. They told me that they could do it for $599/eye for the traditional technology if I did my surgery on a specific date. I took them up on their offer and scheduled for a Friday morning. I decided to do all of my pre-LASIK appointment and my surgery on the same day, so I arrived early that morning, had everything done, spent a very long time waiting around being nervous (as your eyes can not be dilated for the surgery, and that is part of the exam to make sure you are qualified for LASIK), and then had my surgery around 3pm. I am very very pleased with my results. If you are thinking about having LASIK surgery done, I highly recommend the Lasik Vision Institute. I couldn't be happier with them!"
1,My favorite is the chicken katsu. Just like back home with one scoop rice and authentic mac salad. The cooks and servers are always friendly and the food only takes as long to be made to order. Great portions alway have one order for lunch and dinner.
1,"I love ono! At first I had the thought that this place charges way too much for a plate, then I saw the portions. We ordered the Chicken Katsu meal and the Short ribs meal and it was enormous! The chicken was so crispy and went very well with the mountain of macaroni salad and rice (not to mention a bunch of katsu sauce). The short ribs were also delicious! They gave a generous amount and the marinade they used was perfect. We had so much left over I had it for another meal! I had recently gone to an expensive Korean BBQ restaurant that had \""premium Angus short ribs\"" and I wish I had just gone to Ono instead! Haven't tried their spam musubi but I plan to in the near future!"
1,"Get the teriyaki mini meal! It has delicious cabbage, AMAZING macaroni salad, & sweet Hawaiian rice. There food is cooked to order so if you're in a hurry you can call ahead"
1,"Fantastic.  Stay away from Filiberto's unless it's the one on Dobson and Main.  Actually, that one might even suck now because of the dregs of society getting off and on buses and the light rail racket.  \n\nThis place, in contrast, is great.  Great service, great portions.  All-around best quick Mexican food joint around.  I risk a bunch of idiots showing up at this place by writing favorably about it but so be it.  If you want your rolled tacos to actually have meat in them, get a dozen of them here."
1,"It doesn't get any better!  Moda Fina not only has the finest jewlery, but it also has the latest styles and on trend looks.  Everything from classic to trendy, Moda Fina has it!  The service is the best and this upscale store makes your whole shopping experience ah-mazing!  Whoever says \""Money can't buy happiness\""...hasn't shopped at Moda Fina! lol!"
1,"Heartfelt thanks to Moda Fina for giving such special care to my mothers 35 year old wedding ring.  It had a broken prong and was quite dirty.  They fixed the prong, buffed up the ring and cleaned the diamond and its setting.  It looks like a brand new ring (and she said, \""Is that my wedding ring?\"")!  Lori is an absolute angel and couldn't have been anymore wonderful or helpful."
1,Uri and Steve are awesome. Great watches to custom priced right engagement rings. They are the best. Check them out!!
1,Best jewelers in town.  Their time is limitless when helping you to find or create your perfect piece. Excellent quality and craftsmanship.
1,"Just saw the all Balanchine program Saturday night -- going back Sunday to see it again!\n\nIt's AMAZING to me that a ballet company can go from startup  to being a destination company is fewer than 20 years!  But, BAZ did it in 15.\n\nNext season is their 22nd, and I renewed my season tix a couple of months ago.\n\nBAZ is a 'must-see' every show."
1,Love the Arizona Ballet and their School of Ballet.
1,"I did not get a sandwich from here. I ordered the spicy ramen noodles since it was a chilly, rainy day. I was genuinely shocked on how amazing it was! Not that I didn't think it would be good, but it was seriously some of the best stuff I've ever had. I now crave it at least once a week! \n\nNot only did the amazing soup earn them the 5 stars. The service was awesome. I only ate about half a bowl of soup and asked for a to-go container. The lady came out and separated my noodles from the broth and put them in different containers. She also explained to me how to reheat it properly so it doesn't ruin the flavor. She then taped them tightly shut so it didn't leak in my car.\n\nFYI this is an \""order at the counter\"" type of place. This type of superb service was totally unexpected, but greatly appreciated. I was able to eat the rest of my ramen the next day and it tasted just as fresh and flavorful as when it was first served. This was all thanks to the wonderful service of this sandwich shop."
1,"Croque is a very different as well as delightful kind of place.  Legitimately there is nothing else out there like Croque's.  You think it should be some kind of Louisiana style restaurant full of fried Catfish and gumbo like dishes or maybe a French restaurant full of less interesting French food but instead its a place that serves sandwiches, soups and various Asian themed bowls.  They have 18 different kinds of sandwiches that are American, French, Korean and German motif, so there is a lot of variety and each sandwich is of the highest quality.  I've only had the Bulgoki myself(people I've eaten with their have had the Madame and the Tuna but say there were equally amazing) but I've had it in the less traditional \""sandwich\"" form as well as the bowl and the flavor is spectacular, rivaling Bulgoki I've had at excellent Korean restaurants all over the valley.  I'm looking forward to trying the other sandwiches as well as various soups of the day (ex Mushroom Brie looked amazing), overall this is the best new sandwich place around, forget about boring Subway for lunch and try a sandwich worth eating at Croque's"
1,I love when I have to retract a review I wrote.  Especially when it goes from 1 star to 5 stars.  I've ordered a few more times in the last year and it's been right on every time.  The spicy chicken bowl is wonderful... the salads are great.  I haven't made the jump to reordering a sandwich after my last bad experience but I'll get there.\n\nDelivery is fast and friendly.
1,"What a difference a dance class makes in my daughters life!  More energetic, more outgoing, and definitely more tired! \n\nThe whole crew at Bricks love what they do and it shows with my daughter!\n\nThanks again Bricks Staff!  Keep up the KILLER job!!"
1,"The smell of this place when you first walk in the door is heavenly. The essence of smoked meat and charcuterie permeates the interior. Reminds me of the smell of the meat section on the sixth floor of KaDeWe (Kaufhaus des Westens) in Berlin.\n\nThey offer quite a selection of house-made sausage and specialties here. It all looked a bit pricey, so I have not sampled their wursts yet. I have, however, done some great stocking stuffer shopping here--they have a good selection of German grocery items. I was thrilled to find their display of Kinder Schokolade-\u00dcberraschungseier (chidren's chocolate surprise eggs). Everybody (including adults) appreciates the complexity of the prizes you find inside these eggs. Maybe it's because of superior German engineering, but Cracker Jack ought to be ashamed of the prizes they offer when compared to these! The eggs were pricey though... $2.50 a pop (but worth it for the novelty).\n\nI also found myself impulse shopping for German candy Ahoj-Brause (basically fizzing pixie stick dust), mustard-in-a-tube, and Knorr seasonings. With all my Christmas stocking stuffer needs met, I was lucky to get out the door without buying too much more.\n\nI'll be back (\u00e0 la Schwarzenegger) to try the wurst here. The smell of their sausage counter still lingers in my mind..."
1,"The German Sausage company is the closest thing we have to a big city charcuterie in Phoenix.  Our family has been enjoying their homemade ham, lyoner, bratwurst and smoked meats for 30 years.  Their prices are so much more reasonable than the grocery store deli counters and their products are always very fresh.  Walking through the door will immediately transport you to Europe!  Don't miss this Valley gem  - cash or check only just like the olden days!"
1,So glad we found this place! Everything is fresh and tastes just like we get when we are in Germany! Walked out with some fresh warm pretzels last week too!  This is our number one place for authentic German meat.
1,Great service. Very friendly and helpful workers. They got my requests correct and very knowledgeable when I asked questions. My new location.
1,"My fianc\u00e9 and I had great experiences with The Right Touch yesterday. \n\nI scheduled massages for both of us at the same time for a Sunday afternoon. He opted for the Deep Tissue Massage with Traci and I had the Therapeutic Massage with Kelly. It had been a log overdue treatment for me and Kelly was AMAZING. She was gentle yet firm in areas that needed to be worked through and my body felt like butter after it was over. I was also pleasantly surprised that she asked me if I wanted the oil removed from my body. Yes, please! She spent an extra 5-10 minutes cleaning me off with a hot towel and even that process was gentle and massage-like. We will definitely return again soon!"
1,"I was visiting Az and had a the pleasure of getting a massage from Traci. She was awesome made me feel comfortable and worked out some of the knots that have been bothering me. I just wish she was in  the bay area, but next time I'm in Arizona I will be back. The place was very clean and the gal at the front desk was very nice and welcoming."
1,"I work just around the corner from this place so I go there fairly often recently. For my money, it is the best. Very reasonable rates and you don't have to mess with a membership, so I can go often when I can, but then may not go for months. I have seen 3 different massage therapists over the past year and all 3 have been fantastic. I don't even request a particular therapist because I know whoever is working will be be great. I prefer smaller, local businesses. I don't have anything against those large chains, but I'd rather go here. Have been going for a year and a half and have zero complaints. I often walk in since I work so close, but they do get busy so I would suggest calling for an appointment. There's no need to spend what the fancy spa's charge to get an incredible massage."
1,"One of the best massages I've ever received! I saw all the positive reviews and had to see for myself... and YES, they are TRUE! Susie has strong hands and knows how to make you feel relaxed and leave de-stressed! She's been a masseuse for 17 years. I'm already thinking of when I could go back...if you are in town, must see Susie!\n\nThank you for the rockin' massage!!"
1,"The Book Gallery is not your typical book store.  If you want just a basic retail book store, Borders-I shop a lot there-Bookstar, and that type are available.  Book Gallery is something special.  The inventory is of books that one probably isn't going to find in the other stores.  Mike, the owner, buys books for people looking for something t more specific to the areas a person might be interested in.\n\nAs to service, you can receive it at this store.  The employees are more laid back and don't follow the (ninety second rule to say hello) most of the large stores are supposed to follow.  The majority of the customers that come in are coming to this store to look for merchandise they won't find other places. It is enjoyable to see what gem is available there at any given time without being bothered.  However, just ask. and the employees will go out of their way to find what you need from books small artistic items to music.  I will admit that there is one employee I'd rather not have help me but that is a personality thing.  At any time, they will call the Mesa store to see if they have something there and have it in Phoenix in a day or two.  They also will keep an out for something if you ask.\n\nMike, the owner, enjoys buying knickknacks, book ends, and just other small things that make delightful and unusual gifts.  I have a friend that is just so hard to buy for.  I found a small piece of De Grazia sculpture that I didn't even know was made.  The very reasonable price surprised me.  I expected to pay more because many of the things there you can't  buy other places.  I don't consider myself to be a snob.   I have a great time shopping at Goodwill.  I am realistic in knowing I should expect to pay more for something the owner has personally selected for some unique quality.  \n\nConcerning the prices of the books in Book Gallery, they will depend on the merchandise you are considering.  I happen to be a science fiction fan. I always find very reasonable prices on older paperbacks from two or three dollars and up. One day I found a signed copy of one of the Dune series and I paid considerably more.  It only made sense. It cost more than the original price, but  considering the author is dead, how many more are going to be signed-zilch, none!  Besides, how many stores would have it available for purchase anyway..\n\nThis store has another quality that really appeals to me and that is plenty parking!  It's a great place to go browse before or after going to one of the other interesting stores or restaurants in this small center.\n\nSo I am a snob for shopping at a small unique bookstore with merchandise that isn't typical.  Quality means more to me than quantity.  I find quality at Book Gallery.  Check it out!"
1,I went here to get a birthday book for a friend and walked out with 2 huge stacks of books for less than $100!  I got mostly cookbooks and the quality was great as was the prices.  I have a book addiction and am running out of space on my bookshelves but I will be back!
1,"My office is close to the \""Book Gallery\"" and I have always wanted to swing by and check it out. I eventually did a few weeks ago, and I'm really glad I did.\n\nThe selection of rare books is really quite amazing. I have to give a shout-out to the man who helped me, Randy, who not only had an amazing knowledge about their offerings, but also had a genuine enthusiasm for them. I picked up a few books, but I'll definitely be back. A fantastic place to pick out a special gift for a friend."
1,"I am from Chicago & I must say the book gallery compared to others I have seen back home really is amazing. The owner was incredibly nice. \nWhen I walked in I was in awe of all the old books many still on great condition. As an avid book lover this store stole my hearts \n\nThis store has a wide range of mystery, sci-fi, literature, children's books, occult, religious, jane austen, classic, westerns, archeology  & Egyptians which was my favorite sections. Only thing this store doesn't carry is romance, which my mom was looking for but wasn't able to get. \n\nNext time I am in town, I will make sure to stop by the book gallery."
1,"This store is a Phoenix. Spending time here always allows me to bask in the happy energy of bibliophiles that gather together. It's always so much fun shopping for books in this store. Bring a compass and a map and be prepared to get lost in this book lovers paradise! They have almost every book you can think of. You can spend hours just looking at interesting books. A book haven. You can find all sorts of books here.They have awesome events here too, so keep yourself updated. You'll never know if your favorite author or other cool celebrities will be there"
1,"I find it humorous to read the reviews on this store.  It is now has the third highest sales of any Tuesday Morning stores in Arizona while being the smallest.  (I asked)  To accomplish that a store has to be fairly well organized with good service.  I consider this store to be a real gem!  I don't have to pay the prices of Fashion Square or the Biltmore or deal with it takes to find a parking place there either. (Don't get me wrong, I like both of those places as well, I use them just for point of comparison.) Nine times out of ten i can go in there, find what I want and get out if I want to.  The problem is I usually look around a bit and go home with maybe a bit more than I expected.\n\nObviously in a store that carries as man better name close outs in as small a place as it is, one does have to keep a sharp eye out, and maybe do a little digging.  Who cares, treasure is to be found.  I have found this store to be infectious.  Every time I go there I seem to find a better price on something than the time before. Be it something for the yard, gifts for the kids, entirely to expensive sheets for the bed, crystal, monogrammed thank you note's, something for the my cat, Picasso, they are all there and waiting..  I took a friend there the other day who complained they didn't have prices like Goodwill.  The truth is this person is not a shopper and never will be.  If you are a shopper, you'll recognize the quality is at prices that make sense. \n\nAnother minor but really nice thing about the Tuesday Morning stores is the music they play when you are there.  At major dept stores you hear music that has been selected by a team to maximize sales according to critical factors.  The owner of Tuesday Morning picks the music you listen to.  I like his taste and usually find myself humming a tune at some time before I leave which is usually with more than I planned on.\n\nI will talk about the service which is unique to this store.  Depending on the lines of customers waiting to be rung up, they may or may not greet you as you come in.  Usually I find they do.  If you just aren't finding what you are looking for, you might have to to be the one to seek out  one of their people and ask them concerning what you are looking for.  At this point, I am usually very afraid.   They are going to steer me to an area where even if I don't see what I asked for, something will be there that will work.  I just have to decide which or how many!\n\nI haven't discussed the wonderful yellow Clearance signs have I?   I look at prices that really can't be beat on things that I probably will use for some thing  at some time.  If I can't see why they are marked down, or there is a flaw that I can live with,  I have this good habit of buying them.  The result is I never really have to shop for the holiday, birthdays or you name it.  I  dig in the back of my hall closet closet and usually something is there that will suffice.  Tuesday Morning is truly one of the stores that helps keep that closet well stocked.  \n\nVisit this location.  It is worth me starting the great American novel on shopping?!?"
1,"While at Birds n' Beer last Thursday, I learned what \""riparian zone\"" means. It is the strip between land and stream or lake. (Cue the \""The More  You Know\"" clip)\n\nThe center itself is beautiful and great for a small - medium sized event. Lots of modern architecture and what looks like reclaimed materials. It's an eco-friendly building with great native landscaping.\n\nNow to the real part of the review: Bird and Beer is a great event, if you are free on a Thursday night between 5:30p and 7:30p. 5:30 to 6:30 is a chatting/snacking/drinking time with Four Peaks beer in a can. The lecture starts at 6:30 and is very informative. This month was reptile sex and last month was bird sex. The events are usually listed on the events section of Yelp, so check it out now.\n\nThe Center is easy to find. It is just south of the river on Central, with a sign posted on the road pointing towards the building and the parking lot."
1,My cousin just had her wedding here. It was so much fun! Everyone had a good time. The environment is so natural and beautiful. I would recommend it for any event.
1,"Oh, Rubio's! How I love thee! You must put crack in your fish tacos because I think I am addicted. I have no need to try anything else at your fine establishment because the sun rises and sets upon your glorious fishy goodness. Have I had better fish tacos? Almost certainly yes. But there is some indefinable feature of your tacos that draws me back again and again. I feel almost embarrassed by how much I care for you, Rubio's fish taco. But I don't care. I wish the whole world to know how great you are. You had me at first bite. So long for now Rubio's fish taco, but I will be there soon to enjoy your company once more."
1,I just had a fantastic bean and cheese burrito.  The tortilla was so fresh and tasty.  The beans were creamy and well spiced.  There was the perfect amount of cheese.  The meal was fast was well priced and the staff was friendly.  The atmosphere was pleasant and clean.  Great place!!!
1,"This is the best Rubio's in town.  The employees and management are so friendly and accommodating.   I am on the Hcg diet and they work with me to make things I can eat.  Every time I am in Old Town for an appointment I make sure it is around lunch time so I can go to this Rubio's.   The place is very clean and they seem to be very happy working here.  Shout out to Steven, he is really nice to all customers."
1,"Visiting Phoenix from the East Coast, I wanted to savor some authentic West Coast fish tacos.  When I asked where I could find the best, I was pointed to Rubio's. Wow!  I knew with my first bite that I had found heaven!  I had the Original and my hubby had the Especial.  Both were very yummy!  If you're looking for great fish tacos, look no further than Rubio's. \n\nThe service was great, the restaurant was clean, parking was easily accessible, and the prices were very reasonable. Can't ask for anything more!"
1,"The mere thoughts of a barbershop have me reminiscing to the days of my youth, when I had to sit on the booster seat to have my hair cut by Amazio. Amazio is either very old or dead by now, and the vision of an octogenarians with scissors is what comes to mind when I visualize me walking into a barbershop today. Not so at V's Barbershop. I tripped on V's when I was looking for someone to shine my shoes. It turns out that in addition to a fine haircut, V's will include a complimentary shoe shine included in the price of your haircut.  Mr. K, the the one issue I had with your review was you left out some of the extras included in your haircut, like the steam towel, massage, shaving cream trim and razor finish.\n\nV's has now opened another location down by the new AJ's in Chandler next to AJ's on Chandler Heights Rd, so it is now my home town barber shop. My shoes couldn't be happier!"
1,"Old school, classic feel. I searched high and low for the type of barbershop you see in the movies where the mobsters are getting the shave and shoeshine. I finally found it in V's. \n\nThey actually do the shave with a straight blade and the hot towel and shoeshine are complimentary with your cut. I would reccomend V's to any guy looking for a good cut in an atmoshpere where you feel like a local magnate in the community."
1,"I was at the club the other morning, grooming myself after my workout (you know, much like lions and monkeys...picking off the tic's and lice, smoothing my fur using saliva, etc.:-) and I thought to myself, \""I need a haircut:-)\n\nBTW, if I can just digress for a moment...I see things at the club that no person should ever be subjected to...this particular morning was no different...an 85 year old, Grandpa Jones look alike, standing naked at one of the sinks, one leg up on the counter and shaving \""himself\"" in places that I had trouble believing that anyone other him would care about...you just can't \""un-see\"" that kind of thing:(\n\nIf that describes you...please, for the love of god...go into a shower stall or something...I was blinded from seeing this and I spent the next twenty minutes stumbling along, asking for someone to just put me out of my misery, before I managed to grope my way into a shower and boil myself:)\n\nAnyway...I still needed a haircut...(or, I needed to reform my band from 1970...we played a very ragged version of \""House of the Rising Sun\""...and that's about all we played:)\n\nThese days, my choice for sartorial reconstruction is V's Barber Shop...I used to go to Great Clips, but V's  has won me back and won me back for good:)\n\nThis location is everything I want in a great barber shop...a manly experience that simply cannot be duplicated at a \""salon\"":)\n\nNowhere near enough testosterone in any salon...even the unisex Super Clips and Great Cut's:)\n\nThat's not the case at V's...it's all testosterone, all the time:)\n\nThe barbers are all barbers...they may be stylists too, but first and foremost, they are barbers...they know how to cut hair for men and they know how to chat with guys like the great barbers I used to frequent in San Francisco and Portland.\n\nLots of sports to talk about (and flat panel TV's with ESPN on at every station), plenty of magazines to read while I'm waiting for my call to action (and not a Cosmo or Vogue in sight:) and tons of wood paneling and manly smells (I mean witch hazel, talcum powder, etc....not \""pull my finger\"" manly smells:)\n\nAnd, most importantly, they cut my hair correctly...all of the barbers and any of the barbers at V's do a good job...they cut my hair right...as right as my poor misshapen head will allow:)\n\nThat's important to me, because (as I might have mentioned before), I'm not a \""classically handsome\"" man...I'm a little bit \""quirky looking\""...and a decent haircut helps:)\n\nI'm pretty sure that a good haircut is the only thing that keeps the Beautiful Carin from second guessing herself and the (possibly drunken) decision making that led her to select me as her husband (no one ever believes that she proposed to me...I can't believe it myself...but that was a great haircut that I was sporting that day! :-)\n\nSo I'm back at V's and I'm happy to swing by and get my \""ears lowered\"" (a colloquialism that I suppose is lost in the mists of time) and talk football and golf and chicks and other guy stuff with my buddies at V's:)\n\nAnd if you need one, there are even post or pre-haircut cocktails available next door at the Arcadia Tavern...and believe me, sometimes quite a bit of alcohol is required to forget the horrors I've seen in the locker room at the Village:)\n\n\""Involuntary Shudder\""..."
1,"I've been visiting V's on and off since they first opened in 1999. For a while I thought that I needed to pay a Scottsdale stylist big bucks to cut my hair but as I get older I've come back to the realization that a good barber is all I need.\n\nI'm not sure why I ever strayed because I've never had a bad haircut at V's. I've gotten a shave here as well, although I tend to think a straight razor shave is overrated, and I also really appreciate the fact that they offer a shoeshine service. In fact I've stopped in many times just to have a polish put on when I'm headed to an interview or an important meeting.\n\nCurrently I'm working in California so I only get back to Phoenix about one weekend a month, but if I can make it work, I try and hit up V's to get my haircut.\n\nToday I took my two boys with me so we could all get our haircuts. As always the atmosphere was great and the service was excellent. It's fun to see all the other fathers with their sons and I know that when I move back to Arizona permanently this will become a regular event for my children and I.\n\nIf you need a great place to get your haircut, get a shave, get your shoes shined or just to hang out with the guys, head over to V's - you won't regret it!"
1,"I had a great experience at this shop for my very first straight blade shave.  I think her name was Abrila( spelling?). She was great and made me feel at ease. I would highly recommend doing this if you have never done it.  Great way to treat your hard working face! \nThanks,  Dave Lastinger"
1,"Great spot. Alex always does a great job cleaning me up, quick, clean, and professional. If you make an appointment they are always ready right away. If you don't, they are busy so be prepared to wait."
1,"The salon is nice and inviting, has always been a pleasant experience.  Katie is a coloring master!  She definitely knows her stuff and I've always walked away from her cuts and colors a happy customer.  I know at least 20 other people who won't let anyone but Katie touch their hair...she's that good.  Highly recommend her!  Oh yeah, they have goodies to eat and drink while you're there, always appreciated. and some great jewelry...!"
1,"one day i was shopping in one of my favorite stores, LUSH, and i noticed one of the employees had GORGEOUS curls. i complimented her on them and started in with the usual styling product questions. she briefly told me what she used but credited her amazing curls to her stylist, lauren williams at leidan mitchell salon.\n\ni took down the number, but i held on to it for a while before calling. i was loyal to my current stylist. after a few times of inability to coordinate an appointment with her, i gave up and decided it was the perfect time to try out someone new.\n\nit took me a few tries to get in with lauren because our schedules are pretty much opposite, but when i finally did it was worth it. i told her i needed a change and basically gave her free reign over my hair. i went from blonde to red, and i never thought of myself as a redhead but i love it. i don't think i've gotten so many compliments on my hair in my life!\n\nmy next trip she chopped my hair (at my request) and gave me amazing bangs. i never thought i could even wear bangs with my coarse thick curls, but she showed me how to style them and make it work.\n\nlauren is amazing! she even texts me to follow up a few days after my appointment to make sure i'm happy with my hair. i highly recommend her."
1,"Love this salon. Very clean and all of the stylist are very talented. If you are looking for someone new ask for Hannah, she is also the best at extensions. Great local business to support. Very convenient location no matter where you are located in the valley"
1,"Got a Groupon and went to see Amy for a full highlight. Loved her work, the salon is Beautiful, and she was super nice. Every employee at the salon had AMAZING hair so Id trust them all! Amy was quick, but I consider that a good thing! She did great work, and I had compliments from 2 random people in 2 different stores the day she did my hair. I will be going back for my up keep.  Thought about rating her a 4 star bc she was a little hard to get a hold of initially, but Like most of us..she's busy! If you can't reach her right away just text her. (For groupon users her # is the one in the instruction box on how to use your groupon with her. Not the one for the salon at the top) Her work was worth the 5!"
1,I haven't had the food but the agua frescas are amazing.  I had them two days in a row and would go back again and again and again.  The melon is amazing right now.  I went here in LA to get one at the farmers market and it didn't even compare.  I almost cried.
1,This place is the best i allways get the nachos mmmmm the best but if u share the nachos with someone fight to get the mother nacho lol
1,"I love Chipotle. This location, though not as good as the one on Camelback, for whatever reason, is still great.\nThe food always tastes fresh and the ingredients are the above standard. The design of the great, simple, modern and ergonomic.\nChipotle uses only natural meats, not factory farmed hormone injected animals. And some of the beans are organic. \nAlthough the menu choices seem limited, burrito, tacos or bowl, the combinations are endless with the different types of meat, beans, salsas, etc. The menu is more than accommodating to vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike. They serve domestic and Mexican bottled beers as well as fountain drinks. The portions are huge, the burritos could easily be mistaken for a newborn baby wrapped in tin foil.\nNo matter how long the line is, which it is usually really long, you will get your food fairly quickly.\nIt is refreshing to have a business that actually cares and at the same time serve an amazing product."
1,"This Chipotle location always has fresh ingredients and a friendly, attentive staff."
1,"I love chipotle, so good. Sometimes the line is long, around lunch and dinner time. If you've had this place before you would understand why. It's a little expensive but it really good. I just wish they would dive you a little more meat."
1,By the far the most friendly chipotle I've been too! Everyone was more than helpful not to mention the food was amazing and fresh!
1,"Yes, I agree this place is a gem.  I have always had terrific food here (the gyros and salad's  are awesome).  ALWAYS fresh.  A little expensive considering it's a dive (a very clean one though).  And i have had co-workers complain they don't give you enough food.  But giving 5 stars based on the quality of the food"
1,"Awesome food! I dream about the falafel from here. I have tried Pita Jungle and many other places, even resorting to making my own but it is never the same as Elie's. Elie is so warm and inviting as she serves you herself. Prices are a little high but so is the quality. The fries are fresh and so is the meat. The pitas are so soft and fresh, very hard to find pitas such as these. I remember I passed out once here, I don't know if it was from a serious disorder or from me being in so much ecstasy from the food! Remember to bring cash, that is their only drawback."
1,"sitting in elie's right now and i have nothing but good things to say. the food is delicious, the owners are friendly, your order comes out FAST (i got my hummus and falafel pita within minutes of ordering--i barely had time to sit down!).  this is a little hole in the wall deli off 44th and thomas but well worth a visit. i haven't tried the famed gyro yet but i'm looking forward to it!"
1,"Well, I completely agree with Tina!  I went to the Bernina Connection for the first time and was thrilled.  I stumbled on their website and found out that they were open late tonight (Tuesdays only).  They have a wonderful selection of fabrics, notions, and some books.  I was given a newsletter and told I'd be getting emails about sales and classes coming up.  Great customer service - I'm glad to have such a great independent business nearby."
1,I hate this place because Gus my sweetie pie spends a ton of money here. But he always gets good extremely friendly service and the best products along with instruction and occasional repairs on his machines.
1,I have been using Bernina Connection for years to have Bernina sewing machines serviced. They do an excellent job for a reasonable price and they give a discount for bringing 2 machines in at the same time. Everybody here is very friendly and helpful. They warranty their work and I have never had any problems with the machines I have taken there for service.
1,"Very helpful, knowledgable and repairs reasonably priced."
1,"I stopped here for some Hawaiian shaved ice and I ended up buying a water bottle. It's been a long time since I last had some shaved ice but I really enjoyed it from here. Pi\u00f1a Colada is the way to go!  The syrup is all natural, none of that scary artificial stuff. Denise was very friendly and welcoming. She actually takes the time to shave the ice and is not stingy with the flavoring. As I waited around I noticed the different water bottles from liters to gallons. One caught my eye of course, perfect size for my workout days. She even took the wrapper off, rinsed and filled it with ice cold water.  AND, I can stop in at any time for a 35cent refill. Can I do that anywhere else? Nope. Thanks Denise."
1,The best water ever!!!!!!!!! Plus when you go in there you are  like family . Denise is wonderful you get to see the dog and you just feel warm and loved .
1,"What more can you ask for when you walk into this family run joint?  The food is great and there are tons of regulars that it almost feels like a mini version of \""Cheers\"".  The white pizza is particularly fantastic!"
1,"Try the Chicken Parmesan!  It's the best I've ever had? Quite possibly. When I worked in that area we would hit it for lunch once a week. Donna is awesome in a take-no-shit-but-still-take-care-of-you kind of way. She calls it as she sees it and I think that's great. By your third visit she will most likely know what you are gunna order.\nI can't comment on the rest of the menu as I've only ordered the Chicken Parm. Yeah, it's that good."
1,"Calzones!! This has got to be THE best place for a calzone, hands down. Packed full of cheese, wrapped in a tasty crust,  and then, for a few bucks more, add all your favorite meats and tasty morsals...you'll be walking away feeling like you really ate something special."
1,I have been going here since they opened! \nLynn is my favorite! She takes her time. This place gets very busy so I suggest making an appointment!
1,I love this spot! Lisa is is amazing and the girls are all so friendly! I always feel so relaxed when I leave.
1,"These guys are awesome! Had a technical failure with a BMW remote key access and they provided a solution, allowing me to continue my destination. If it wasn't for them this issue would have cost me HUNDREDS!!"
1,"Dexter just graduated from puppy school today.  We've been going for 8 weeks and Lauren, the trainer, was awesome!  Even when Dexter piddled, she didn't get pissed.  Of course, he was the most adorable puppy in class...Ok, most of the time he was the ONLY one in class, but, still...\nThe first few weeks, we were given bags of treats to take home and use for homework.  Yes, homework.  After each class, I was given a hand-out of that week's class to use at home.\nThe class cost $109 for 8 weeks and was sooooo worth it!  Not only do I have THE most adorable puppy in the entire universe, but he's also the smartest.  He's a store favorite.  All the employees learned his name!  Of course, he's a lot like Mommy and went up to anyone looking for some lovin'.  Er...*I* don't do that, but you know what I mean.\nI've heard about other PetSmart's training classes.  This one didn't live up to the horror stories!\nHe'll be going for intermediate classes in the fall.  I guess that's like Middle School.  For dogs."
1,"I have to give 5 stars to the Banfield Animal Hospital at this location. Had a little emergency a couple hours ago- my dogs anal gland had swollen and ruptured in less than 24 hours....they were able to squeeze me in and take great care of her. This location is one of the few open on Sunday's (again, this review is for the hospital, not the actual retail store of PetsMart), so I was glad they could help me on such short notice as they did seem to be pretty busy. Prices were reasonable and the vet techs and vet were all friendly and helpful. Thanks for a great experience"
1,Although pricey...they do an awesome job and you get what you pay for! I've looked into cheaper grooming and the positive reviews compared to negative were not worth me taking my dogs elsewhere!!! Thank you pet smart!!! You guys rock!!!!
1,"Excellent service from a New Jersey born bartender.  Jason has been manning the bar at T Cooks for seven + years and certainly knows his clientele.  Locals and hotel guests fill the lobby on a nightly basis and the live piano playing is icing on the cake.  \n\nAn even better treat than the live piano is the creme brulee cheesecake topped off with an espresso martini.  However, start your night off with a glass of wine and any appetizer from the shrimp sliders to the foie gras.  The fresh bread and pesto sauce is delicious, but don't fill up on it... save room for your choice of paella, scallops, filet, or duck - you can't go wrong.  Even the $14 bleu cheese mushroom burger melts in your mouth.\n\nThe resort itself is a secret 9 acre gem hidden in the heart of Phoenix.  The unique old world architecture and lush grounds are the most romantic in the city... what other resort do you know that has a 'Director of Romance' on staff?\n\nCheck it out... you will not be disappointed."
1,"Normally, I would reserve 5 starts for something that I had been back to, but I'm not sure when I'll be back in Phoenix and the meal we had was really stellar.\n\nCourteous staff, relaxed for a formal place, and all of the food was delicious."
1,"T. Cook's is my favorite restaurant in AZ thus far. I really enjoy the spanish colonial architecture, gardens, water fountains, patio, and charming walk-ways and courtyard. The ambiance is extremely romantic and puts me in a calming, reflective mood. I can seriously see myself getting married @ the Royal Palms. \n\nI've read some of the reviews and I've always had great service here. I remembered one of my dates had asked for a romantic corner to seat at and not only did they give us a romantic corner, but the hostess came with a basket of fresh rose petals and placed them all over our table. My date must have seriously thought he was going to get laid that night by just that gesture alone, but was mistaken, lol. Anyways, I love the lobster bisque-not too salty and just creamy enough. I've enjoyed the Asian pear salad, too which is flavorful and has great texture. But if you're looking for one appetizer to try, definitely get the sauteed shrimp & calamari in an organic yellow tomato sauce Fra Diablo. My mouth just started watering. It's not breaded calamari so it's healthier and also tastes better (5 stars).\n\nAs for the main course:\n\n-Pan roasted duck breast with spiced confit pave, sage gnocchi & roasted butternut squash is 3 stars. I'm not much of a duck person, but the roasted butternut squash was to die for and the duck was tender.\n\n-Wood roasted \""Pulet Rouge\"" checkan with a rosemary polenta cake, asparagus and Swiss chard is 4 stars. Any meat prepared wood roasted gives it a twist in flavor, which I appreciate. I usually ask for asparagus steamed so I'm not sure how the Swiss chard is (gotta watch my figure).\n\n-I've tried their fish (they change their menus from time to time), nibbled on my date's plates and everything has been really good.\n\nI want to try one of their pasta dishes next time when I'm not dieting. The bar area is also super sexy, sleek and mysterious. They usually have a live piano player at night. I seriously could come here weekly for just the calamari and architecture-it's like you're in another world besides the AZ desert. It's become my escape to mini paradise."
1,"T. Cook's continues to be my go-to spot... with or without my fiance.  It's like my home away from home.  I feel comfortable going in for a drink or a bite to eat any night of the week.  Let me be clear about one thing, however - I always sit at the bar!\n\nIn addition to the regular menu items, the burger at T. Cooks is consistently amazing. This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul. Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese, bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now.\n\nAnyone up for a burger?"
1,"Visited T. Cook's on the 4th of July for the first time.  Had lived in PHX/Scottsdale for 2 + yrs and return for visits a few times a year.  What a great spot!  By far the best service, atmosphere and food I've had in Phoenix (outside of Lon's at the Hermosa) in quite some time.  Excellent wine selection.  The specials offered something traditional but also creative.  Recommend the pate appetizer and squash soup for a start.  I ate a filet mignon cooked perfectly but I know their paella is also acclaimed.  Decor is intimate, inviting and not stuffy/overdone."
1,"T. Cook's is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.  I've lived in SF, NYC, and LA, which is where I am from and currently reside.  I haven't had much luck in LA in terms of finding really good \""Western\"" food.  I love LA for its ethnic food. \n\nI've eaten at T. Cook's three times now since I'm staying at the Royal Palms Resort.  Tonight's dinner was OUTSTANDING.  I ordered the sea scallops with shrimp mac & cheese.  It was so good.  Even the accompaniments were delicious - the spinach and the corn kernels.  The corn kernels tasted like they were first soaked in vinegar so it was a nice surprise and really complemented the dish.  For dessert, I had the Napoleon.  It was so delicate.  The crisp was so thin on top of a chocolate mousse.  I loved it.\n\nMy mom had the \n\nI'm definitely coming back next time I'm in town."
1,"This was a special night out as we would normally not be able to afford T. Cook's, however the three courses for $40 was a great deal for us and as long as we are able to take advantage of this special pricing we will be back. \n\nThe ambiance was wonderful. \n\nI had the calamari and shrimp first course, which was delicious.\nShe had the red onion and rosemary soup with havarti cheese, which was also delicious\n\nWe both went with the lobster toretllini which was really tasty and had lots of lobster but some the lobster pieces were a little bit chewy. The tortellini was delicious as was the lettuce that came with it. \n\nDesert was outstanding. We shared the chocolate fantasy - very very rich chocolate that when combined with the  vanila gelato and cherries was a great combination.\nThe caramel cheesecake creme brulee was also fantastic. It was much lighter than the chocolate fantasy, which was very dense. \n\nThe wine suggestions of our waiter went great with the meal. \n\nService was oustanding - they were very attentive and friendly - We never felt rushed and didn't have to ask for anything. \n\nAs I mentioned above as long as we can take advantage of the 3 courses for $40 we will back again. There is so much more of the menu we want to try."
1,"I met a friend for here for cocktails a couple of weeks ago.\n\nWhen I got home and answered the query \""where did you go for drinks?\"", I was reminded by the Beautiful Carin just exactly how long it had been since we had been to T Cook's for dinner...apparently a very long time:(\n\nBecause, while I did remember having dinner there, I couldn't have told you the year or the time of year...luckily, I have the Beautiful Carin to remember these things for me:)\n\nYou know, I don't why we haven't made it back to T Cook's a little more often!\n\nT Cook's is one of those rare places that can genuinely say \""everything is good\"" when you ask for their recommendations:)\n\nMaybe it's just me, but the atmosphere, ambiance, service and food combine in subtle (but effective) ways to create a meal experience that you really don't find very often...T Cook's is a jewel:)\n\nI have heard that they went through a bit of rough patch, service and consistency-wise, but if our dinner last week is an indicator, they have solved any problems that they might have had:)\n\nI was lucky enough to miss any rough spots...3 years between visits will do that for you:)\n\nWe had a 7:30 reservation, and by 7:38 we were drinking perfectly made, ice cold Ketel One martinis at the table, and enjoying our conversation (Carin is one of the most delightful conversationalists you could ever hope to meet...she still keeps me entertained and enchanted...we still have so much to talk about after all this time:)\n\nOnion soup, Lobster Bisque and pate started our meal (and could have completed it...it was so good...fortunately, I'm a big eater:)\n\nCarin had Poulet Rouge (Red Chicken? Seriously, the menu nomenclature people need to re-think that one...When I think of red chicken, I think of salmonella, but that's not what they mean:) \n\nI know, I know... they mean the chicken is red with pecan wood smoke, and it is and it's a terrific dish, but still...the name:)\n\nI had braised short ribs...perfectly done with a marvelous horseradish infused risotto cake:)...Inspired:)\n\nThey also have some very pleasant and tasty sides:)\n\nWe had brussel sprouts (that were nearly as good as the sprouts I make at home:)...and potato puree...and seared Foie Gras...decadent and wonderful:)\n\nI tried to get Carin to have the foie gras with me, but we differ in our opinions about foie gras, and so, I had to take the bullet and eat it all myself:)...That should make my cardiologist buddies happy:)\n\nTime really can stand still when you're having an evening like this...by the time we finished our shared Chocolate Napoleon and coffee, it was 10:30 and way past our bed time:)\n\nBut such a pleasant evening...never any rush from the servers, never a wait for the next course...everything perfectly timed, completely unobtrusive (no, our conversation was never interrupted to inquire \""do you love everything?\"":)\n\nIt was worth staying up late for an evening as pleasant as this...and almost worth waiting three years for, too!\n\nBut we won't wait three more years to swing by T Cook's again...they are just too good and right in the hood:)"
1,"Since moving to AZ we have gone to T. Cooks several times and each time it has been a lovely and delicious experience. \n\nIt's my favorite place to go for brunch. It's pricey and it's not a huge Vegas style buffet but all items are high quality and delicious. Plus, you can order a la carte plus the buffet and the price is the same or just a bit higher than the buffet alone. I also enjoy the decor and ambiance. \n\nWe went for dinner last night and oh my!!! It was outstanding! I knew what I was going to order ( I have an obsession with looking at menus online before hand) but they surprised me with a Farm to Table menu from Chef Lee. The \""theme\"" was pork,yum! And to make it even better, 3 courses for $40.\n \nFirst course was pork belly with frisee greens and a poached egg. It was so goood!! A sprinkle of salt and pepper, crusty bread to scoop the egg and it was like breakfast :D\n\nSecond course, braised pork filled ravioli with bacon, squash, pearl onions. It also had a bit of cheese (Brie?) on top. I loved every single bite of it! It was amazing, the sweetness of the squash, the salty bacon, creamy Brie and the perfectly cooked ravioli bursting with the  braised pork was just heaven! \n\nThird course, goat cheese cheesecake with apple compote and caramel sauce. I'm not a huge fan of apple desserts but the compote was on the side.  I never had goat cheese cheesecake before (surprising since goat cheese is one of my favorite foods:) and this was great, creamy, not as tart. A perfect ending!\n\nThere was a nice lounge singer at the bar, which we were able to listen to while eating in the restaurant. Now that the weather is nice, dining on the patio was very enjoyable.\n\nI recommend T. Cooks without reservation. I'm already looking forward to my birthday brunch there!"
1,"Had a beautiful brunch here. Sat outside among the bougainvillea listening to the many birds (some who had equal sugar packs in their nest?...but that is another story).\n\nWe had the option of trying the buffet which looked very nice but as the menu was looking so good we ordered from there. \n\nI had the Breakfast panzenella which was just what I felt like and enjoyed immensely. It is a traditional Italian dish layered with grilled vegetables, tomatoes, potatoes and topped with two over easy eggs.\n\nMy husband had the Boneless \""Poulet Rouge\"" chicken thigh with roasted tomatoes and fingerling potatoes which he said was very tasty.\n\nWe accompanied our meals with a Bellini and a Mediterranean Bloody Mary - both very good - then we ended it with an incredible tasting French Press Coffee.\n\nOverall there was not one thing to complain about - the ambience, food and service were all 5 star. There was even a guitar player inside the restaurant which is also very beautiful."
1,"T. Cook's is a gem in the Royal Palms Hotel. We recently stayed at the Royal Palms, (which deserves its own review) for a week and dined at T. Cook's 4 times! Once for lunch, three times for dinner, including Christmas which was excellent despite the busy the dining room.\n\nThe setting, both indoors and out is charming. The food was great and we had the best paella since visiting Spain.  Chef Lee treated us royally. We can't wait to get back to Phoenix to return to T. Cook's."
1,"Romance. T. Cook's has it in spades, so much so that the Royal Palms, the hotel that it is located in, has a \""Director or Romance\"". Now how great a job would that be . . . . and guys- no more wondering what to do to impress- just call up and they will take care of it all. \n\nWant rose petals scattered about your table? No problem. How about a poem reader? Got it. Or a private violinist? Again- they will make it happen. They will even put together a private dinner out in the garden for you. \""Ahh. Romance\"", she says wistfully while thinking about her evening. \n\nBut I digress . . .all this talk of romance has overshadowed why I always choose T Cooks for dinner every time I head to the Scottsdale area. It's the food, the bar, the service and of course the ambiance. \n\nEnter this historic Mediterranean villa and you know you are in for a special evening. To the right, the restaurant, to the left, the bar. And not just any bar. Live music is always playing and the bartenders (Jason and Jeremy) are terrific. You can eat at the bar (they have a separate bar menu) but my advice is to wait and eat in the main restaurant. \n\nUsually I ask to sit outdoors- either in the front courtyard around the trickling fountain, or in the back, Tuscan styled gardens. On this night- it was a little cool so we compromised and took a seat by the windows looking out. \n\nWarm, fresh bread is placed on the table with a garlicky pesto sauce. Try not to eat too much as you'll want room for their wide variety of appetizers and entrees. \n\nWe went with the charcuterie plate, plenty of meats and cheeses to start. As for our entree's the sliced ribeye was the pick of the night. But there are plenty of choices from chops, to fish to lamb. \n\nService was spot on (friendly, accommodating, and attentive) and we even got to meet the \""Director of Romance\"", Robert, who made me wish I had known about this service before. Robert asked if we were staying in the hotel (we weren't) for if we were- he said he could work his magic on our room while we ate. It made me want to change hotels, if only for the night! \n\nOur evening ended back where it began at the bar listening to old Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra tunes being crooned out by an amazing duo, while sipping a tawny port and reflecting on the dinner we had just experienced. \n\nThis is not a cheap date.  Dinner for two was around $200 but worth every penny.  Go ahead, splurge.  It's worth it.\n\nAhh. Romance. If you were wondering where it went in your life- check out T. Cooks at the Royal Palms Hotel. It's there, waiting for you."
1,"Wow, great experience!  T. Cook's restaurant located in the royal Palms Resort and Spa in Phoenix is a beautiful place to wine and dine. Their colonial Spanish architecture with a Mediterranean flair is both elegant and romantic.  The Resort and Restaurant are both decorated with hardwoods and cherry woods everywhere with and hand-painted Italian frescoes and beautiful floral arrangements throughout.  The unfortunate thing about my visit, I was there for a business dinner... lol\n\nThe service from start to finish was outstanding.  The bar was fairly busy mixed with Resort guest and people like us just their to dine.  The servers were very attentive and we got our food fairly fast considering the type of restaurant.  The Sommelier was knowledgeable and eager to help us find the right wines to go with our meals. Excellent service all around.\n\nI started my dinning experience with a glass of Chardonnay and Pear and organic mixed green salad.  It was good but I was expecting the pear to be grilled.  For the entree I had a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon recommended by the Sommelier, to go with my New York Strip. I added a side of roasted brussel sprouts with duck confit which was outstanding!  My steak was cooked extremely well and delicious.  I did not have room for desert, but made room for a cup of coffee, which was very good as well. \n\nMy next visit to T. Cooks I plan to bring my lovely bride and have the pan roasted halibut with herb potatoes and local veggies cooked in a red wine butter sauce, YUM!!  It looked really good from across the table : )\n\nI recommend T. Cooks the next time you are planning a nice dinner for two or with some good friends wanting to have a great evening together.  Their wine selection is good and they have an Oktoberfest menu for you German Food fanatics."
1,"Whisk your date away into old colonial Spain, where Mediterranean breezes and flavors waft into your nostrils.  The mood is set with dim lighting, siena and sunburnt vaulted ceilings, cozy fireplaces, and an elegant ambiance.\n\nStart your evening off in the lounge, with its posh leather couches, mahogany bar, antique lamps, and baby grand piano to set the mood.  The menu of specialty cocktails will make any discerning carouser dance with delight.  From the \""Sweetheart\"" with chambord vodka, champagne, and chambord - to the \""Rose Petal Infusion\"" with grey goose, strawberries, st. germaine elderflower, and a rose petal, your lovely lady will be swooning with ardour, or from the strong martinis.  The mixologists here know their libations.  Drinks are poured with the finest spirits and crafted with love, and you pay accordingly for an average of $14.  However, do not let this dampen your spirits as Happy Hour is from 5p-7p, and reverse Happy Hour from 10p-midnight Sunday through Thursday.  Appetizers are half price, featured drinks and wines by the glass for $6.\n\nSo after your palate has been readied for the culinary splendour that is about to meet your lips, try one of the lounge's appetizers or wait until you are seated in the restaurant to be impressed.  The lounge has an eclectic menu which features \""Fruit De Mar\"" (tempura fried calamari, shrimp, and scallops), the very popular Belgian snack of \""Mussels and Frites\"" (mussels dish served with a side of french fries), \""Adana Kebabs\"" served with pita and yogurt, and even an American favorite, the short rib sandwhich.  Average price is $12.\n\nWant to impress your date? Order the Chilled shellfish and bubbles entree right at the bar, as the piano man croons in the background.  This delectable entree comes with maine lobster, king crab legs, jumbo shrimp, and oysters on the half shell, and is served with two glasses of house champagne, for a mere $55.  Now if that isn't the perfect aphrodisiac...\n\nIf dining solely in the restaurant, you will not be disappointed by the first class service, attention to detail, and the fine food that is so lovingly prepared by its chef.\n\nThe meals are split up into courses, and I strongly suggest you do all three to fully explore the tempting Mediterranean treats that this restaurant has to offer.\n\nStart off with the \""Burgundian Escargot\"" (with mushroom raviolis, roasted beets, watercress salad, and vegetable beurre rouge) or the phenomenal \""Crab Cakes'\"" (with house-made chorizo, clams, and roasted clam puree).  Not in the mood for seafood, but still enjoy good belly timber?  Then try the duet of roasted bonemarrow and sauteed sweetbreads served with their housemade brioche and a horseradish infused orange marmelade.\n\nNow you are ready to clear your palate for your main course, something light to pique those tastebuds...the \""lobster fennel bisque,\"" or the unbelievably ambrosial \""Pear Salad\"" with its gorgeous blending of spiced pecans and blue cheese on organic greens.\n\nIf you are a devotee to food, then you have saved room for the main course.  Choose from Chef Lee's Carbonara, (my personal favorite) with garlic cream, pancetta, prosciutto, and egg yolk.  For Spanish fare, there is T. Cook's signature Paella, straight from the fireplace, or a sinful slow roasted lamb stuffed with feta.  Many more seafoods and steaks grace this menu, for an average cost of $32.  You will definitely expect to pay accordingly for the quality, flavor, and love that is put into these amazing dishes.\n\nA dining experience fit for the gods, sure to impress your date, and your palate."
1,Well Lee all i have to say is good job mate.  Great food and great service. Just ask for Brian.
1,"I like to be a little stingy when it comes to five stars, but it is easy to create the perfect meal here.  Our group of five had a fantastic evening.  it is also always nice when someone else is picking up the tab.  We had to wait a bit in the bar before our reservation was ready but the bar is quaint with live music.  The surroundings and restaurant are gorgeous.  I wish we would have sat outside, but inside is nice.  Our group started with a sampler of appetizers.  We shared the antipasto platter with locally made cheeses, and in house cured meats and pickled vegetables.  The restaurant is making a very good farm to table effort.  We also had crab cakes and the super amazing carbonara for an appetizer.  Needless to say we were stuffed before the food even came.  I had the bisque which was good not as great as I expected given the reviews.  Everyone was very pleased with the food.  The only dessert we had was a complimentary birthday carmel cheesecake creme brulee.  AMAZING, I watched my husband devour it and he doesn't like cheese.  I was shocked and a bit jealous that I only had one bite, but it was his birthday.  I would go back just to get another shot at the desert menu.   Service by Bill excellent, he never had to ask what we needed it just appeared."
1,"This is my first fancy restaurant in Arizona, and it certainly deserves to be one of the best; one I will return to for special occasions. \n\nMy wife picked it as a romantic spot for her birthday, and it didn't disappoint. \n\nThis place is awesome. You drive in, the palm-lined circular driveway instantly transports you elsewhere. The valet takes your car, and you pass through passageways of intricate lighting patterns. Warmly welcomed into the dining room, which is surrounded in brick, long drapes, and exposed beams to give a classy but comfortable feel. The chairs have nice comfortable cushions for a long stay. \n\nWaitstaff were all friendly and as fast or laid back as you want them to be. \n\nOne thing that I really note is the bread course. Is the bread hot or cold? How is it served? Here, a small loaf of Italian bread with the signature dustings of flour, signifying an \""artisan\"" bread, was served with a small bowl of fresh pesto sauce. The bread was hot, the crust crispy, the sauce deelish. It was a good omen. \n\nThe food was all first-rate. While I had a vegetarian string: yummy Quorn empenadas, pear salad, and the delicately fried stuffed squash blossoms, my wife had the escargots napoleon (she loved it), the lobster bisque (which I tried--great flavor), and the Meditteranean Lamb. I also had a side dish of potato puree--creamy garlicky heaven! \n\nIt is an expensive place, but I would say it is worthwhile, and definitely good for a special night. The food was delicious and servings reasonable: if you get all the courses, you can actually take some home! The dessert menu was quite extensive, too. I think enough to please everyone. I definitely would go back sometime--just make sure you have money in the bank, know what I mean?"
1,"Came for the amazing brunch.\n\nWhat I love about their brunch is the options.  For $33 you can get their buffet brunch which includes the better than usual goodies: omelet station, crab legs, already peeled shrimp, lox, fresh fruit, warm breads, various salads, waffles, grilled veggies and a dessert bar.  \n\nNow to mix it up, they also offer delicious items off their menu.  These dishes range from $10 - $15 a plate, but are fantastic and large.  \n\nHowever, if you want to then add the brunch buffet to your menu selection, you can pay an additional $23.  So, in essence, you can get the $10 pancakes and the $23 buffet, and pay the same price as getting the stand alone buffet.  \n\nI got the banana-pecan French toast off the menu.  OMG, it was perfect - especially with the warm \""real\"" maple syrup.  \n\nService there is great and very attention driven.  Even my napkin would be neatly folded by the time I returned to my seat.\n\nWe came for a birthday and they had inscribed a nice note on top of the piece of dessert.  A very nice touch.\n\nI also love the ambiance and the grounds of the Royal Palms property.  It's gorgeous there."
1,I continue to be impressed by T Cook's happy hour.  The key is to have Connie as your server so that you can avoid the service problem mentioned in my previous review.  I'm moving up to 5 stars because of her.  Here are my 3 favorite happy hour appitizers:\n\nTuna Putanesca - Seared tuna served chilled over a classic warm Italian olive & caper \nGrilled brie served with Como Batard bread & jalape\u00f1o \nZa'atar spiced edamame
1,"First time at T. Cooks for brunch was amazing. Rebecca was great, we will definitely go back to see her and enjoy the food!"
1,By far THE best cucumber martini around. Very light & fresh. The only thing that would make it better is if they would put a thin slice of cucumber on top instead of a wedge of lime.
1,We had a fabulous lunch for four today at T. Cooks and I can't rave enough about the food and the excellent service.  The four of us tried lots of lunch dishes and then passed portions around to share. Yum to everything.  T. Cooks has always been our go to special event place and this experience was another triumph.
1,"Hard to say exactly what you should order, but i've eaten here 5+ times, all three meals.  the service has always been superb.  We typically eat here when we stay at Royal Palms, so having a $50 meal credit softens the blow.  Dinner IS pricey...\n\nPresentation is obviously big here.  Portion sizes are just right.  you won't be stuffed...you will have room for 3 courses.  \n\nI generally order something unique here.  not your typical \""filet\""...go to Donovan's or Dominick's for that.  I think entree's are best.  Apps/soups are #2.  Dessert usually isn't the best part of the meal here.  they almost try too hard with the desserts.  they need to find a couple staples for dessert and make them home runs...i just haven't found that (yet).\n\nBeet salad.  butternut squash soup.  antelope.  lamb.  scallops.  all winners.  enjoy"
1,The food was absolutely amazing and the live band was the cherry on top!! What a great date place. This restaurant has such a nice ambience and we could not have asked for any more. And a special thank you to  Bridget L. for making our experience that much better!!
1,"Customer service here as in the whole of Royal Palms is nearly through the roof great, at times even bordering on obsequious. Service was not quite excellent, but it's really great. Had dinner here and ordered tasting menu ($40) and accompanying libations ($20). The tenderloin was pretty much the best tenderloin I've ever eaten. The beet salad was delicious and the cheesecake was thick and creamy. My bf had the antelope (!!) which he thought was great, cooked to perfection, tender and tasty.The accompanying drinks were interesting and fun, but I'm not a big drinker so I reached my limit pretty early. \n\nI don't know about y'all who are complaining about portion sizes, portions are normal-sized and VERY filling. If you're used to strapping on the feedbag at a buffet, then you may be disappointed, but the bf was happily full and I left STUFFED and quite happy. \n\nI highly recommend!"
1,"After reading other posts, I had a sense this spot might be hit or miss.  I was pleasantly surprised to be mistaken.  It was a perfectly aimed bulls eye.  My buddy and I enjoyed the foie grais sizzling on a hot rock (if you like fg, this is a must!), a lobster noodle dish, the rib eye, lamb pasta, brussel sprouts, mushrooms and fine wine.  The service was impeccable and the decorum was chic as well as relaxing.  While all was spot on, the desserts were the crowning achievement.   We had the chocolate banana caramel mousse as well as a waiter special, dark chocolate peanut butter bars.  I don't make this statement lightly....the dessert was the finest I've ever had."
1,Get the asiago cheese bagel with sun-dried tomato cream cheese!!!!!!!!!
1,My daughter and I had a yummy breakfast. Fast service. Coffee is delicious. Bagel skinny sandwiches were good.
1,"This review is long over due.   I grew up in AZ and now live out of state.  I still have a lot of family and friends in AZ so anytime I need to order flowers I always order through Phoenix Flower Shops.  I've never had an issue and the flowers I've ordered (over the internet) and they have always looked just as beautiful as the pictures which you can't say about a lot of flowers you order online.  \n\nRecently I placed an order for a friend and used some of my reward points on my order.  To be honest I've never watched how many points I had etc.  To my surprise 2 days later I received an email from PFS saying they had redeemed too many of my points for my order and for the inconvenience they were going to replenish the points and also gave me additional points for the mistake.  How often does that happen?  That truly is was customer service is all about, fixing a mistake before I even realized it, more business could learn from this.  I sincerely appreciated the email and the effort made to \""make it right\"".  There are other businesses you can call on a mistake and beg for a simple solution.  \n\nI have used PFS for years and will continue to do so.  They truly define customer service and create exceptional beautiful work!"
1,"I stop in from time to time for fresh stems for the house.  The flowers are fresh and high quality, and the staff is very friendly.  They will stop what they are doing to come and help me out with the selection process every time (even though it's typically a low dollar purchase) - Tip: Fridays are half off day for floral stems.\n\nI don't send arrangements all that often, but the next time I do so in Phoenix, it will be from Phoenix Flower Shops!"
1,"Superb service. That's a big deal when it comes to your teeth. \n\nI had to have a root canal, ugh. But the doc and his assistant made it as painless as a root canal can be. Plus, they call ahead of time to remind me of my appointments. They also called after wards to make sure I was doing okay. \n\nDuring the procedure, they'd check to see if I was hanging in there. The assistant was also kind enough to tell me what they were doing. Whenever I asked prior to my appointment on how long each visit would take, they would give me a fair estimation. I really appreciate that - so I can plan accordingly. \n\nAnother big thing is the wait time. Talk about nada. When you're appointment is at 3 p.m., you can be certain you'll be taken care of on time. Right on. Nobody likes to wait, especially when it comes to the dentist."
1,"Just got back from Ingleside Animal Hospital and I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers. The building is just lovely. I love how big and spacious it is. Some vet offices are so cramped and just not enough room to avoid other dogs. \n\nMy beautiful girl dog happens to not like too many other dogs so I usually HATE taking her alone to vets because it's such a hassle to care for her, fill out paperwork and try to keep other pets away from her. Definitely NOT the case here. She did so well with three other dogs in the room. \n\nThe staff was very nice and helpful. Dr. Bart listened to me and I really enjoyed the whole visit. So did Dee minus her getting her temperature taken. Haha. I did feel pressured to get unnecessary test or meds.\n\nOne of my other favorite parts was when it came to pay the bill. It was ACTUALLY fairly priced!!! What? Isn't that just crazy? A place that actually cares for the animals and doesn't overprice every little thing like 'oh your dog went the bathroom outside here's a $300 bill'. Nope, there was none of that. When the nice lady at the front told me the price I was taken back and in shock. A vet visit, exams and meds for less then $130!!! That's awesome!!!"
1,Dr Serbin always finds the time to squeeze my dog family in when there is an emergency. He ALWAYS follows up the next day; its nice to know he cares.  I love the follow ups because he'll listen to your concerns if you have any and recommend coming back if need be.  Ingleside Animal Hospital is very close to my family and has seen us on our worst of days; they are very understanding and will even offer up a hug if you need one.  They were very comforting to our last dog that we put down and even sent a card to my family in our hard time.  We have been going to Dr Serbin for the past 8-10 yrs (?) and I wouldn't have it any other way!!!
1,"Wow! Shocked that I was able to call in for a last minute check-up as a new patient and they were able to see me in 15 min...\n\nThis vet is very close to where we live, so I think we found our new vet. All the staff was super friendly - - which is typically the case of any vet office. \n\nBut yes, I agree with the other reviews - - nice, organized, clean, and large open environment.\n\nLucy had a nice first visit today. :)"
1,We have been taking our pets here for over 15 years.  Bunnies....kitties...all get treated with love and respect.   Fantastic new building...super comfortable for you and your lil ones.  \n\nCan't recommend them high enough!\n\nJon
1,"Ingleside Animal Hospital was able to accommodate my dogs for a same-day appointment, even though they had never been there before, out of concern for their health. We arrived about ten minutes early and were immediately escorted into the exam room. I was pleased with the hospital's service and cleanliness. For exams and antibiotics for both dogs, I walked out with a bill for the same amount I used to pay for one dog at my old vet."
1,"Update: Found the time to take the dog to the vet myself (instead of sending others). The office was clean, new, and well lit. Everyone was really nice. I feel confident he is getting the highest quality of care and would not hesitate to recommend this clinic to others.  \n\n6/26/2012 :The receptionist---who answers the phones, books the appointments, and makes the reminder calls--was kind and a good listener. I found him efficient and polite. My sister reports that although our dog liked the vet, my sister found her condescending and brusque. My sister is refusing to go back there. However, since my dog liked the vet, I will just keep sending him there and have my husband take him."
1,"We were in need of somewhere that would perform euthansia and on a Sunday. The staff is wonderful and so very supportive and understanding. They explained the procedure and very efficient. When we pulled up, they were waiting for us and had a room ready for us to go into. It was a very calming experience and they gave us all the time we needed to grieve. I would definately recommend them. Dr Bart was very caring. As difficult and heartbreaking as this was,they made it a little easier. A week later, we received a sympathy card which was signed by the whole staff....such a personable touch and it meant so much to us."
1,After my cat was severely injured I rushed to this hospital for immediate care. The entire staff was not only professional and nice but they really care about your pet. \n\nThe Dr thoroughly went over every single detail and was straight forward about everything. He followed up me with several times checking on my pet and going over the procedures he had done and what to expect and look for in the future. I couldn't have asked for better care and true concern for my baby.\n\nThank you Ingleside!
1,"I love the bar at the Royal Palms, not far off the beaten path, yet in a world unto it's own.\n\nYou can easily pass the entrance as you cruise down Camelback.  Once you turn into the drive way the valet team greets you to park your car. On the way to the bar, stroll through the lovely garden/fountain area - as you step into a more tranquil time.\n\nThe bar has a number of nooks & cranny's, four cool seating sections - the fireplace room, the tables along the windows bordering the garden, the spacious corner and up at the bar. The entire property has an early Arizona motif which is consistent in the bar with comfy chairs & couches and a wonderful mix of floor tiles.\n\nCaitlin, our waitress was welcoming and  crisp with her spot on recommendation's.  Pork  flatbread, was a stand out appetizer with a flavorful consistency of meat, cheese and mushrooms. The Bergstrom Pinot,  a real treat, was a nice compliment to our food.\n\nThis gem of a hideaway was the perfect spot for a light bite and glass of vino on a rainy Monday night."
1,"If you're going to eat til your sides hurt, it's good to get an early start!\n\nThanksgiving in Arizona was a wonderful experience thanks to the feast we had here. We arrived at 11:15 and sat down for a 2.5 hour buffet enjoyed in their sunny side patio. This was my first time here and it's amazing to know that their renovations are fairly recent because you would never guess it! The Spanish style tile roofs, huge trees and beautiful overhanging Bouganvilla really set the tone for this place. It has so much character and thought put into the layout, you can't help but feel relaxed.\n\nThanksgiving Day brunch was wonderful! (If only you could take some home for leftovers!) Although I did miss doing some cooking of my own, I have to admit it was nice to skip out on grocery store madness and be pampered for a change! We finished 4-6 plates (the guys ate more!) from their cutting station: turkey, of course, pesto topped salmon, and prime rib, made to order omelettes, salads, and desserts. My only critique is 3 of us got a bowl of squash soup and it was so salty none of us could eat it. Must have been a fluke because the rest of the meal was delicious. They definitely have hired the best. Everyone we came in contact with was friendly, gracious and made us feel right at home. And in case you missed their Thanksgiving buffet or you want a repeat performance of their awesome spread, you can go a month later for their Christmas smorgasbord. \n\nI would love to stay here next time. From what I learned, each of the rooms were decorated by a different interior designer so they are all unique. As I was sitting in the courtyard, I couldn't help thinking, this would be a beautiful place for a wedding! (Don't tell the BF I said that!)"
1,"You have to do this. If you are reading this that means you are thinking about it. Stop thinking. Do it. Impossibly romantic this Scottsdale hideaway is understated, intimate and refined. Curving walkways through bougainvillea and honeysuckle camouflage casitas and villas all with private terraces. The rooms are Mediterranean Spanish with fireplaces and comfortable sitting chairs at the base of the massive bed. Go for the designer casitas. No two are alike. They are all amazing. The entire resort is filled with nooks and crannies where you can find solitude and luxuriate with a cocktail while you soak in the scented breezes and warm sun. It's like a private residence you have to yourself with a few others. The service is over the top good. Room service twice a day including turn-down with ice buckets and spring water. Need your car? Make one call and it's waiting at the entrance. The spa is small but you have it to yourself. Steam room, jacuzzi, massage. Do it again before martinis and a fabulous meal at T. Cooks, the on-site four star restaurant. In short, for a three day romantic getaway, there is no place I'd rather be than the Royal Palms."
1,"I am only reviewing the Restaurant and Bar area.  This place is perfect, they get everything right, the visit to Royal Palms for dinner was the highlight of my trip.\n\nReservations are met to perfection, the atmosphere is super classy without being over the top.  Service is top notch.  Food is great quality and fairly priced.\n\nAs I usually do, I will keep it short - GO HERE for drinks and a dinner date."
1,Loved this place...took my mom for mothers day and we were there for 5 hours getting wonderful services and had lunch by the pool. Cant wait to go back
1,"I spent the day at their spa and then got a 75 min massage. I don't splurge often and do spa days about once a year. Even though I have not been to many spas, I have to say, this is one of my favorites! I spent my time before my massage relaxing by the pool and drinking a couple of mixed drinks. The service was spot on coming by only when I looked up and the pool was nice and relaxing. I went on a Sunday and loved that it was not packed full of people. its not very relaxing when you have to be a vulture for a nice bed with shade, which I've experience in some previous spa days. The women's jacuzzi was private and quite lovely. it was outside, but the water was cool enough to relax in. And the massage was so soothing. With my nerves right now, this truly hit the spot."
1,"There is no surprise this hotel is #1. The property is amazing. Location is perfect. Service is outstanding. Food is delicious. The Spa offers some of the best services Ive ever had. Cant wait to go back!\nNote: Service charges are included with everything including your car service, so no need to tip!"
1,"There is a place, not so far away, where the wine is delicious and the tranquil sounds of divine music play. Should you arrive at this place with a desire for stomach satisfaction, the food will provide the vehicle for your satisfaction. My family came here to have dinner prior to going to Zoo Lights. Our guide was friendly and gentle. Ryn is the best and was able to direct our choices as to food and drink. We had the pizza which was okay (a little soggy) and the vegetabe plate and the hot dogs with fries and fruit. The place is best with just you and someone that you want to pounce on (super romantic) however, they are kind to children as well."
1,"When I think Royal Palms, I think romantic getaway. A quaint yet exquisite resort, the Royal Palms was built in 1929 to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat. Colonial as in when the Spaniards were conquering the New World.  All of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards.  \n\nWe had heard some great things about J Cook's and decided to spend a leisurely Sunday morning dining on the patio. If you're looking to be treated like royalty, you want to dine here\n\nI enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at J.Cooks.  The staff are incredibly accomodating.  What an ideal location for an intimate stay-cation!  It's a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers, I will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer!"
1,"Totally loved it!  It's so quaint and charming.  I have been to some of the best hotels in the world, and this place rocks!  Here we go:\n-charming and professional.  Not uptight like the Ritz Cartlon.  Very, very personable staff\n-amazing food and will do special meals like vegan and gluten free.  Breakfast served at 6AM and coffee bar open.  So nice to be served early as some hotels have client wait till 7AM\n-wonderful conceirge who helped me w local restaurants and hiking \n-amazing spa.  It's like you have the place to yourself and the staff knows what they are doing\n-really nice gym w great equipment\n-little nocks and crannies of fireplaces, fountains and outdoor spaces.  I want my house to look and feel like this!\n\nI hope I get back to Phoenix just to stay here again."
1,"The experience lives up to the expectation set in its name. I was lucky enough to have my wedding at the Royal Palms and must say that the experience from start to finish was spectacular. Set against the backdrop of Camelback Mountain, the setting is simply stunning. We had our wedding reception in the Estrella Room with the cocktail hour in the courtyard in front of the room. \n\nBefore getting married here, I was told by anyone I spoke to that the wedding food is by far the best they've ever had anywhere else. I completely agree with this statement. The food is a culinary masterpiece. It doesn't taste like your typical catered food. It tastes like the food they serve in T Cooks, if not better! Everything you eat, down to the bread and pesto dip is extraordinary.  \n\nThe service is about as extraordinary as the food. I worked with Suzanne who was extremely helpful from start to finish. Each bride and groom gets a \""shadow\"" for the wedding day. Our shadow was the fabulous Christy and followed us around while we took pictures and throughout the whole night and made sure we had cocktails, food and any other help throughout the night. She even helped me in the bathroom with my large wedding dress! I can't say enough about Christy and how helpful she was throughout the night. She was calm, comforting and helpful throughout the whole night. \n\nI will end this review by saying that \""you get what you pay for\"" and while the Royal Palms is on the pricier end, it's worth every penny and they make sure they work for their money. Everyone is kind and helpful and I couldn't imagine getting married anywhere else.\n\nBesides the wedding experience, I was also lucky enough to stay at the Royal Palms the night before and the night of the wedding. I highly recommend staying in the Valencia Casita #125. It's got an adorable courtyard, little sitting area, a small kitchen and a nicely sized bedroom. The rooms are intimate and have a lot of character. The grounds are extremely relaxing and lovely to just walk around and take in. \n\nI have also been a guest at their spa and must say that it's a relaxing and luxurious experience! The staff is friendly, the amenities are very nice and everything is completely relaxing."
1,"This review is specifically for the Alvadora Spa...and even more so for Mariah who gave me the most incredible facial I have ever had in my entire life. Ladies and gents - if I were you I would definitely take advantage of the $99 summer promotion and treat yourself to a truly rejuvenating experience. I've had a number of facials in my life but I've never had an aesthetician actually stay in the room while the masks were drying and give upper back, cranial, arm and hand massages nor have I ever had luxuriously warm rehydrating hand mitts during the process of a facial. My skin has a new, refreshed glow to boot. This is the pinnacle of facials - I will never go anywhere else!"
1,"The best and most intimate resort in Phoenix. Stayed here for my wedding night so of course this is a special place fore but believe me we had many places to choose from. The rooms are beautiful, grounds are intimate and well kept and the staff will go above and beyond to meet your needs. I have not gone to the spa personally yet, but purchased a massage for my mom for Mother's Day and she loved it."
1,"This review is for the Alvadora Spa at the Royal Palms Resort.  My friend planned an amazing weekend in Scottsdale and our day at this resort was relaxing and fun.  This Spanish-style resort is quaint with a very European feel.\n\nI had a deep tissue massage, and it was among the best I've ever had.  Even better is that with any treatment, you can enjoy the rest of the resort for the balance of the day.  Coming from the Chicago winter, we chose to lay by the pool, basking in the Arizona sun with a couple of cocktails.  Perfect way to spend a girl's weekend away!"
1,"I stayed in a Valencia casita and it was cozy luxury, featuring a high bed, private patio, dramatic lighting, reliable temperature controls, intimate pool, Mediterranean meets southwest decor, and an overall boutique experience. Lovely!"
1,"This is a wonderful intimate boutique style hotel where everything is a close walk, not long distances  like the large resort style hotels.  The service is impeccable throughout.  It is situated in the middle of Scottsdale close to everything, but you feel like you have been transported to a place in colonial Mexico or Tuscany, the gardens awe amazing We stayed in a room that backed up to the street and one could hear traffic in the mornings, but this did not bother me in the least.  I will definitely return to this gem."
1,"This resort makes me feel like I have died and gone to heaven.  I didn't want to ever leave.  The pool area is so lovely and quiet is feels like a sanctuary -not at all like the noisy pools at most resorts.  And then there is the restaurant, T.Cooks, which is amazing!  An outstanding menu by a talented chef and the ambiance of dining in a Mediterranean villa.  Staying here is a real treat!"
1,"Amazing.  I did not stay at the hotel , but I did visit the Alvadora spa.  This spa was very warm and inviting.  I liked the fact that it was indoor and outdoor, with plenty of natural sunlight.  I used the eucalyptus steam room, and private outdoor jacuzzi prior to my treatments.  I enjoyed that these facilities were separated from the men's facilities.  The treatment room was lovely, with floor to ceiling plantation shutters that offered just enough light.  Sometimes I feel like I am in a cave when getting a massage, so this was a welcome change.  The therapist, Jennifer, was an absolute delight.  Knowledgable, professional, and a great conversation.  She did both my massage and facial.  She gave me wonderful tips on skincare, and even taught me an exercise to stretch my back after a long day at work.  The rest of the staff was very pleasant and accommodating as well.  The products used were animal, and environmentally friendly.  I will be back for sure!"
1,My wife and I went here for a weekend getaway . Very nice rooms . Great restaurant and bar .Excellent service . Very accomindating . It's small in relation to the Fairmont Princess but much more intamate.Would go back in a second.
1,"Absolutely wonderful no words can describe the tranquility I am feeling. Great staff, immaculate, and will receive serious pampering.  You deserve it. Go"
1,"This is a great place for a staycation!!!  It really feels like you are at a Mexican resort.  We went in July and got good use of the pool.  It is smaller, but served it's purpose of relaxation and had really attentive service.  The rooms are very nice and romantic.   They have a great lounge with live music and excellent mixologists.  I didn't get a chance to try the  restaurant, so I will definitely return for that, as I have read and heard great things.  If I remember correctly, all tips are included so no need to worry about awkwardly pulling out your wallet.  Highly recommend!"
1,"Cars. Haven't owned many of them. I've ridden subway cars for most of my life. When a car did need some work there was always a man around (Dad! My brother!) to handle the fixin'.\n\nYes. That's the sexist truth. So after hearing a number that made me gasp from a Ford dealer I turned to a dude. He recommended Spitfire Automotive. Actually, who he recommended was \""Mike Carlton on Indian and near you.\""\n\nCan I tell you next to useless this bit of information is on Google? (Still shaking my head on that one.) Anyhoo, I finally found the owner. With such a glowing referral (the dude had used him to fix his off road racing bikes many, many times) I figured, \""Eh. Ok. Besides, what do I know?\"" And it was conveniently close.\n\nAfter speaking to Mike to confirm his hours of operation I dropped my car off. His team was able to look at my car the next day of operation. They confirmed the diagnosis the dealer made lickity split. I was shocked, there's no way to emphasize the level here, but SHOCKED when Mike called with his estimate. The difference was substantially less *and* my car was going to be ready the very next day.\n\nLet me say that last part again:\nMy car was going to be ready THE NEXT DAY.\n\nI don't know the location of the magical unicorn tree where Mike grows Ford dealer parts. But my car, Bear, is so very happy. No need for a rental car, so I was happy too! \n\nSpitfire Automotive is family owned and operated. It was opened in 1958 by Mike's grandfather when Indian School was a two-way dirt road. Currently the shop handles automobiles and motorbikes. There are plans to move motorbike repair to a northern Scottsdale location (74th St & Butherus Dr.) where it will be called \""Dirt Riders West\"". Motorbikes can be purchased at Spitfire Automotive. While there I got my first up close and personal look at something called an off-road Beta Motorcycle 300.\n\nThe next part will make men groan. (Ok. Maybe some women too!) I'm looking at the bike and I think. \""Hmm. It's ...red.\"" I don't know! These are things that go thru my head. That, and, you better gosh darn write a review for this place. It's girl friendly. Manly place, but girl friendly. \n\nOh! And efficiently fast!"
1,"Ok, apparently I'm the one breaking ranks here.\n\nAfter I bought my house, I had a housewarming party and I bought a cake from Tammie Coe. It was 50 bucks and people said I was crazy for spending that kind of money on a cake. That was almost 2 years ago, and people still remember how awesome freaking good that cake was. My grandma sat on the back patio with a slice, a glass of wine and a cigarette and looked like she had died and gone to heaven. I don't remember if this location is like a caf\u00e9. I don't think so. But she has a location on Roosevelt and 7th St. in downtown Phoenix and that one I believe does. All great cities need great desert shops, and Phoenix has one of the best."
1,I love Tammie Coe Cakes
1,"I am writing this review strictly on the cupcakes, I have not and do not wish to try anything else, but the cupcakes are amazing.  \n\nMy friends and I had a cupcakes and champagne party for my birthday - everyone brought cupcakes from different places around town for a side-by-side taste test and Tammie Coe's Ooey Gooey's won hands down.  Warning: If you do not like frosting, you will not like Tammie Coe's Cupcakes.  There isn't a ton of frosting, but a fair amount so if you are one of those that likes scant amounts of frosting, this isn't for you. \n\nOther notables from Tammie are the Coconut and Red Velvet - they are always crowd pleasers.  Great frosting, great cake and wonderful colors/designs, Tammie Coe's are great to take or have at a party....or even have LGO deliver to your car on your way home from work. :)"
1,"Not cheap, not healthy, but nothing better.  In this crazy world of cupcakes on every corner, Tammie Coe does it right.  Simply put- right combination of cake and icing.  Love them.  Don't ask/worry about the price, just order and em."
1,"On Saturday two friends and I were in Old Town Scottsdale for lunch. We were craving dessert and a friend suggested LGO. Friend no.1 had her eye on a dessert at LGO. Nothing caught our eye for me and friend #2. I'm familiar with Tammie Coe, but have only had items of hers from Whole Foods or AJs.  I saw the sign and suggested Friend no. 2 and I walk over. The minute friend #2 and I walked in Tammie Coe's we were welcomed with open arms. We enter only to see not the regular bakery atmosphere, instead Ammie and two others are working away at creating delicious yummies out in the open.  She asked what we were craving and we mentioned \""CHOCOLATE\"" something LGO didn't have that day. Tammy walks over, gives us a sour cream sugar cookie and OMG! amazing. I ordered the ooey gooey and it was delicious! As we were leaving Tammie gave us a sample of buche de noel, this delectable treat was maybe the best dessert i've ever had. As mentioned before I've heard of Tammie Coe but I had no idea how involved she is in her business. She was friendly, inviting and a true delight. Tammies desserts were wonderful but her warm personality and hospitality were equally delightful."
1,"I really like Carsten Salon, Ally in particular.  The desk staff have improved and are not any more snooty than at any other high-end salon.  It seems to go with the territory in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  I had tried severl other salons over the last few years trying to save money (Great Recession) but really think Carsten is the best salon in Phoenix.\n\nReally my loyalty is to Ally, she always gives me a perfect cut.  She is super nice and I've missed her.  If Ally left I would probably leave too, but for now I'm glad to be back."
1,"I have always been self-conscious about my receding hairline until Morgan cut my hair. She made me aware that I could show my hairline and that it was only natural for it to be receding \""a little.\"" Because of my new haircut I feel more confident. Thank you Carsten Salon :)"
1,"Having grown up in Europe, if there is one thing I truly miss is high quality sandwiches. Nothing wrong with Subways, but the quality of the bread, despite being made several times a day seems to be very cardboardish. Sack's was close to were I worked and has so far been my favorite sandwich place in Phoenix. Always a but crowded and busy, maybe noisy for some but I'd rather be in a place that feels busy and alive than the only one eating my sandwich. My  favorties are the Improv and the Gothic (warm sandwich). All sandwiches comes with a little cookies which is always pleasant I find. Only negative and I'll admit to ignoring the suggestion is that there is a sign by the owners that ask those who have \""regular\"" sized cups to not refill. Not very customer friendly I think. But, and I ask the manager/owner from time to time I really do wish they would open one up in Scottsdale. Prices are probably a bit high, it comes with the neighborhood but I do think the quality of the sandwiches make up for it."
1,"I love Sacks and will go out of my way for lunch here!  \nEvery time I eat at Sacks, I order something different. Sometimes it's a regular from the main menu, and sometimes it's one of their creative daily specials. I've never been disappointed. Fresh ingredients and fantastic flavor, created and served quickly by their super friendly staff in a casual cool ambiance."
1,"Mama Java...often the highlight of my day! \n\nOk, so i might be a bit of a caffeine addict and while i am sure that contributes to feeling good almost every time i walk in the door at Mama Java, it is also the coffee and the staff that make me smile.  Best coffee, truly!  Jensy and Billie (the baristas) are sweet, fun, friendly and truly coffee prodigies.  I am sure they will have their very own coffee shop someday soon but for now I am happy to give them my $4.06 everyday like clockwork!!"
1,"I love Mama's!!!!!\n\nMy family and I walk over to Mama's all the time... the coffee is great, the staff is cool, & the owner always comes out and gives our puppy treats. This is a cool little coffee house... a refreshing break from the corporate \""coffee\"" joints.\n\nThanks Mama's!!!"
1,"Love this place!  They're so friendly and the coffee is fantastic.  I'm a sucker for Starbucks because of the drive thru... but the more I visit Mama Java's the more I remember just how bad Starbucks really is.  If you haven't visited this place yet, do it!"
1,"New in town, I had heard nothing but good things about Mama Java's, so since I live half a mile up 36th, I decided to walk down and try it for myself. I walked in and was immediately introduced to a warm, welcoming atmosphere. A very popular place, there were many people, and there was still ample seating. As I approached the counter, I had asked a friendly employee what they would recommend. As soon as she had asked if I liked chocolate, I quickly nodded in confirmation. I didn't have to wait very long for preparation of my soy mocha, which tasted truly outstanding. I highly recommend Mama Java's Coffee House, it's very well worth the price...SO much better than commercially owned coffee houses like Starbucks."
1,"I really enjoyed myself here!! I wish mamas was closer to me! The prices are around starbucks but, that's okay. I was spontaneous one day and wanted to find a great place to sit and work and I found Mama Javas! So awsome! Im not a \""hipster\"" so I wasnt really feeling the atmosphere or did I feel like I fit in (they could work on that) But, I was there to work and enjoy coffee and I did. Bagel was amazing too!"
1,"My daughter and I chose the 4 hour ATV ride.  Our guide, Chad made the trip fun for people of all ability levels.  This is a first class operation.  Great tour, lots of fun, I highly recommend it!"
1,"Can't say enough about our ATV adventure and chad our guide.  Chad was very informative and matter of fact which I loved, having three teenage boys in tow.  My youngest son has autism and rode with Chad on his ATV.  Chad was caring and patient with him and my son was thrilled!!! Highly recommend."
1,"I am with Gabi:) I have been a member here for 10 years.  This is a family gym with lots of activities for all ages, shapes and fitness levels.  The staff is exceptional and very friendly.  This is more like a resort than a gym..."
1,"I love this place, i was invited by a friend and when i saw all the facilities i was very impressed. it is expensive but it is woth it."
1,I feel lucky to be able to work out at the Village. The yoga instructors are my favorite part about it - all or most of them are from At One Yoga. The equipment is state of the art & the facilities are very nice. Plus it has one of the best views in town of Camelback Mtn from the back patio/tennis courts!
1,"After the closing of my business last year ( Moss Wellness Spa), I had to find a new place for my yoga practice.   I value and support many Yoga Studios in the Valley ( At One, Metta, Urban Yoga, etc.) but I was looking for more than just a yoga studio.  And I found it here, at the Camelback Village Club!\n\nThere is yoga, pilates, tennis, basketball, a cafe, boutique, spa (Nails, Massage, Facials), Child Care ( not a selling point for me), Socials and it is in my neighborhood.  Their yoga program has talented instructors (Max, Lisa, Harmony, Beri and Amy) that are known throughout the Valley and it is authentic.  I can practice on the floor (without a mat), in jeans, without music and find my flow.\n\nI will be returning to the cafe soon on Friday afternoons with Greg and Max for a beer.  Of course, this will be following a great yoga class.\n\nJoining the Village is not inexpensive, but what price do you put on your health & well-being?  For me?  Priceless."
1,"I'm not sure writing a review is even worth it for The Village, because obviously it's amazing- but I go there so much, I feel I owe it to them to Yelp them :) \n\nMy family (husband, 2kids) all frequent the Village 3/4 times a week. I have to be honest and say that sometimes I go there, send my kids off to the awesome kids club / X-Arcade and just go sit in the steam room, lay out by the pool and/or take a relaxing shower. But yes, sometimes I actually work out! I am a Yoga teacher and the Village is where I take most of my yoga classes (the high quality of most of their teachers and the kids club is a major plus for me). I love their Cycle classes and the fact that they are 45 mins is great when I am in a crunch to get home for dinner/homework/bedtime but still need a quick workout. They have a HUGE selection of workout machines so you never get bored. \n\nNot that every health club needs one, but the Village has a fantastic cafe and a cute bar right by the tennis courts that have served my husband and I well when we need a date night and can't decide between a great workout together or a dinner/wine date. \n\nDefinitely recommend the Village to anyone looking for a gym with many extras! It's worth the high price, if you can afford it. We love it!"
1,"This is the gym I go to when I visit my Dad in Arizona.  The yoga classes are very hard, but rewarding.  The facilities are very clean and there is a good restaurant you can indulge in after burning all of those calories off.  I'm heading to Phoenix in a couple of days and looking forward to visiting!  My Dad loves the yoga classes and has been a member for years."
1,"Amanda's spin class is the best in the city!!! High energy advanced riders kind of class!!  If she wasn't there I don't think I would even be a member!!! Also,Check out the yoga studio, there are many talented instructors practicing"
1,"Great place for families, too."
1,I had a manicure at village spa. Shirene Najm did a fab job. Well worth the $25. Ask for her!
1,"I love it here, and even though I'm moving across town soon, I will always continue to bring my pet cat here.  The vet is wonderful.  He's very honest and you can tell that he really loves animals.  The woman who runs the front desk is very polite and always on top of things.  They were also considerate of my financial situation and didn't try to sell me vaccines that my cat didn't need.  They were very up front about pricing.  I love it here and I'm so glad I found this place.  I trust my kitty in their hands :)"
1,"This place is super cool. The only bad thing about it, is that it got TOO popular! I am very happy for the success of this place. At least they made the place bigger. There was a period of a year where i ate at this place saturday and sunday for breakfast! i was addicted. One thing i like to do if its really busy is to call your order in, so you dont have to wait in line. The only down fall is sometimes your toast gets soggy!\nParking is a pain in the butt for this place.\nThis is place is a big hit for people of all ages and its a great place to chat.\nMy fave is croque monsieur. YUM"
1,"I moved from L.A. to Phoenix a few years ago and missed the little cool small shop restaurant places with character.  Le Grande Orange made me feel at home, and now that I'm back in L.A. I'm super psyched to find out there seems to be a new one opening in Pasadena.  Does anyone know if this is the same owners?  Looks like it.  I HOPE SO!!!"
1,"I would give LGO six stars if I could. I love this place, they really have done everything right. The food is amazing, the displays are fantastic, and the music selection is always great. Parking can be frusterating but once you get inside you realize that it was worth the wait."
1,"Any place that makes a BLT with avocado is tops in my book because bacon and avocado might possibly be my favorite two food groups. (Yes, they are their own food group.)\n\nBeyond that this place is super charming. I loved everything about it. From the novelty candies to the delicious dessert case to the kitschy toys to the kitchen items. I actually thought this place was initially called \""La Garage\"" because it was such a mish-mash of cool stuff.\n\nI imagine if I lived in Phoenix I'd be here quite often."
1,"It is REALLY hard to rate La Grande Orange because there are so many amazing things about it, but it is so hard to find parking.\n\nPros\nThe food is really, really amazing\nThey have an awesome selection of things you wont see day to day\nThey have really tasty coffee drinks\nIndoor and Outdoor seating\n\nCons\nThe parking is really really rough\nThey are pricey\nYou have to wait in some pretty long lines\n\nTry the commuter with avacado. It's amazing. Also, they have excellent chai.. and their english muffins are TO DIE FOR.\n\nIf you live in the area and can walk there, you are set. I used to live a half mile away and would take a walk there for breakfast. The absolute best way to start your day, IMO."
1,"Okay, so it's not their fault that the parking sucks like no other....it makes me feel like I'm back in L.A. though!\nThe atmosphere here is fun. It's noisy, it is great for people watching and there are a lot to see (and, if you're like me, BUY)\nThe staff always seems to be smiling, and are helpful when asked, BUT this will never be the Nordstrom of restaurants.\nSo here are the things you have to try! They are WONDERFUL!\nMia's French Pancakes\nCroque Madam\nCommuter Sandwich (either with avacado or salmon, both are great)\nJersey Girl Omelete\nThe Cubano Sandwich\nThe Rueben\nGuacamole BLT\nI forget the name, but its either a Spanish or a Mexican Latte is wonderful!\n\nI also love the little pickle slices  they serve!! So good!\nThe Tammy Coe cakes are so good too! I love the designs! very creative use of fondant!"
1,"This place is da bomb dot com. \n\nIf you love Whole Foods then you'll love this mini-version. It's a cafe, coffee shop, pastry shop, and grocer that sells anything from fresh greens and post cards to hot sauces and wine.\n\nGabi K brought me here for a small pre-flight brunch. We walked directly up to the counter and ordered from the menu. Like what I saw: lots of health-conscious entrees. Everything looked so delish, especially those breakfast plates they were flinging across the counter with egg whites so artfully laid out alongside fresh fruit and multi-grain toast. \n\nAfter placing our order, we snagged a very small table near the bottled wine. There I spot various jams; particularly the mimosa jam caught my eye, made with oranges and Champagne. I bought that for a future birthday brunch we're planning at the lake, along with some peanut butter dog treats for my little schmoopie. \n\nWhen our food finally came out, just minutes later, my seared ahi tuna sandwich (new to the menu) with avocado, greens and tangy sauce was soon just an empty plate with a few bread crumbs and a watermelon slice. It was a large serving stuffed with so many fresh goods, but even more delectable I devoured it before I could even ask Miss Gabi how she was enjoying her Commuter breakfast taco. Also a popular item.\n\nLove the vibe here, It's lively, friendly, local and smells fabulous with that coffee/cafe aroma. And they have free wi-fi too. Wouldn't mind sitting around for a few hours and get some work done. Til next time La Grande Orange."
1,"Wow,it's been over a year since I have come here.  What in the world was I thinking?  I forgot how much I liked the unique and tastey sandwiches here.\n\nAfter a long grueling Camelback Mtn hike my friend said we should come here for a bite.  Glad I agreed to and that part.  My muscles everywhere on my body were hurting, but that sandwich made me forget all about them as we sat on the patio.\n\nI know parking is a nightmare on this corner in Arcadia, but who cares about that.  Great place to people watch and enjoy great food at the same time.  I definitely won't wait another year until my next visit."
1,"The parking sucks, its kind of pricey, and there is generally a long line....\n\nbut it is ALL worth it and I still give it five stars.\n\nI never come to Phoenix without visiting La Grande Orange. Amazing food and ambiance, amazing pastries and so much fun stuff to buy!"
1,"Man, I *love* this place!!! Great atmosphere & crowd. And I just heart the Venice Beach Burrito (sans tofu) with a delicious croissant for weekend breakfast with Earl Grey lavender tea or a decaf Americano.\n\nGood vibes always on the overhead. I was able to bask in the sun at an outdoor table, enjoy a leisurely meal, write in my journal, and take in all the people (& dogs!!!). \n\nTotally dig this place!!!"
1,"Always very busy, and a 35 min drive for me to get here since I live in gilbert but really, I dont even care. Everything about this place it so worth it. The important part though is, their coffee! Best coffee I have ever had ever. They have a yummy breakfast menu, everything I have every ordered is yummy, including their crepes! Lunch is good, and have to try their pizza!! I always saw a couple of Phoenix sun's players there, which is nice also since I am a suns fan."
1,"How could you not love this place?  Not only is the food fantastic and consistent, it has a great atmosphere and an adorable \""grocery\"" shop next door.  It's a great place to people watch!  (Don't forget to check out the wine section--not only is the wine random, it's affordable and a great conversation starter with all the cute names and labels)\n\nAfter moving here from San Diego, I've been so unimpressed by all the breakfast spots in Phoenix.  This is the one place that I LOVE!  I think it offers something for everyone, however my go to is the Venice Beach Burrito.  It's such a casual spot--you order from the counter, find a table, and wait for them to call you to let you know your food is ready to be devoured.  There's tables both inside and out, and you can peruse the store while your stomach rumbles!\n\n\nThe only thing I've ever been disappointed by is the sangria, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white sangria.  I will not be ordering it again but I have girlfriends that love it.\n\nI had never been here for lunch until this past weekend--it was always my late morning brunch spot.  Technically, I believe its a pizza place, but I've never had a pizza.  Although, they look quite good!  I ordered their tuna sandwich this past weekend, which came with a side of fruit and pickles.  The bread was thin and grilled panini style, and the tuna salad definitely did not disappoint!"
1,"Love Love Love this place! Laid back atmosphere, great music and delicious, healthy food. Mmmm...just writing about this place is making me crave the daybreaker :) If you go for breakfast on the weekends, make sure you get there early so you can find parking and a table. It gets crazy crowded!"
1,"My boyfriend and I visit LGO often ...maybe TOO often! But I just can't get enough of this little place. If you're looking for a trendy place for a lunch with friends, or even a dinner date, this is it. My favorites are the commuter with salmon and avocado, and the cheeseburgers. The cheeseburgers are amazing...and I don't even LIKE cheeseburgers. I also enjoy their Arnold Palmer's! Hands down, 5 stars."
1,The salted chocolate cookies are the most fabulous things I have ever had. I could eat them everyday! They have tammy coe cakes which are jst as beautiful as they taste.  I love their french pancakes they ate sweetened with honey and strawberries and topped with creme fraiche delicious!!!!!! When I step into this place its like going to a french cafe.  I used to live there so I remember what those places were like.  I live a block away so I go a couple times a week its just fabulous!!!! The wine selection there is wonderful...the staff is friendly.  Its nice because they have curbside pick up if you want to enjoy your goodies at home...you can also stay and enjoy at nice little table inside or on their cute patio.  Its nestled in the heart of arcadia you cannot get much better!!! Try it you will become addicted!!!
1,"This place is awesome... it makes me forget that I'm in Phoenix sometimes.  While I can't review the whole menu, I know their yogurt, orange juice, and coffee is awesome!  Service is usually really good and friendly, and the fact that you see a lot of the same people there a lot means that they're probably keeping more than just me happy.\n\nCheck it out next time you're in the area... driving, cycling, or walking."
1,"My fav breakfast place in Phoenix!\n\nYou get: great food, great atmosphere, good service (parking a little bit of a challenge, but I live right across the street so I just walk).  They even have drive up take out service!\n\nI mostly eat the breakfast there but have had sandwiches as well as the pizza at the Pizzeria next door.  Delicious!  Anyone who gives LGO negative reviews has just fallen into the usual boring Phoenix restaurant style type eating.  LGO is something different...order and serve yourself....kinda' like fast food (but you have to wait a little bit because all the food is made fresh), but seat yourself and don't have to worry about waiting for a server to bring your drinks/food!  Coffee is great (and strong). Daybreaker is my favorite healthy breakfast choice (egg white with turkey slices, avacado, tomato and salsa....get with a side of fruit or potato...fantastic!)\n\nYes, prices are a little higher than average in Phoenix....but you get what you pay for.\n\nWe love coming here after a good hike at Squak Peak or Camelback! Fresh squeed OJ is great and fresh made english muffines are yummy."
1,BEST RED VELVET CAKE IN THE WORLD! The store is crowded and always busy but the food is worth the drive and hassle.
1,This place is AWESOME! \nThey have the best Chicken salad sandwich i've ever had in my life! If you're in a hurry this isnt the place to go. It's always packed but thats a good thing! it's absolutely delicious!
1,"I love this place, and the wait is well worth it. If you are not a fan of waits, crowds or good nosh or novelty food, then La Grande Orange is not for you. But those among you with a versatile and educated palate will enjoy all they have to offer!"
1,"I love LGO! Everything that I have had here is always very fresh tasting and delish!  My favorite lunch salad is the smoked salmon salad.  You can also take your dog here and sit on the patio which is very nice since there are not a ton of places in Phoenix to bring your pup!\nThe Tammie Coe desserts are also to die for!  The last time I went I got the coconut cupcake, I thought I made good cupcakes, but then I tried this one!  Very moist and the cream cheese frosting was amazing!"
1,"This place makes such great food and the store is fun to shop in while you wait. They make their own English muffins, which are so freakin good, you'll wonder why no other bakery has ever made them."
1,"I go to LGO any chance I get for breakfast. I love love it!! The coffee, lemonade and the french pancakes (well any of their pancakes) are soooo good.  Besides, you can browse the shop for unique gifts.  I only bought a plant once. But, they have neat things if you ever need it..."
1,I have never had an english muffin like theirs! Absolutely amazing.  The food is high quality and you can tell the difference.  The only problem is finding seating.
1,"I love everything about La Grand Orange!!!!\n\nI would like to review both the grocery and the pizzeria together since it was the entire experience that makes it perfect. I've been here a handful of times now and have been impressed every time! \n\nFirst time visiting: I stumbled across the place so I decided to come in. I love the grocery area and the fun gifts. I bought some birthday cards and took home some Spicy Tuna Maki. The Tuna Maki was fabulous and I knew I was going to come back. \n\n2nd time visiting: Went with my husband for breakfast. He had the burrito and I had the Daybreaker and we both shared an order of potatoes. All was good and tasted very fresh. The best part was my coffee drink, the Havana! Something about condensed sweetened milk makes any drink  tastes good.  My husband that is hard to pleas enjoyed the items in the grocery store too. He bought a few nik naks there during our visit. \n\n3rd time visiting: Tried their pizza for dinner and OMG!!!! I swore on that day that it was the best pizza I've EVER had! We had the Magrherita and it was just divine. The buttery crust was the right level of crispiness and the mozzarella was gooey and perfectly melted. I am not a big salad person, but even the orange fennel salad that I had before the pizza was delicious! \n\nWe've also taken visiting family members here and they loved it too. I would like to find more places like this in Phoenix. So yummy and what a great atmosphere."
1,"Never one to let the idea of three square meals a day deter me from enjoying a visit to a new city my three plus days in Phoenix, Scottsdale, Glendale, and Chandler would additionally lead me to a number of ancillary eats - some upscale and French, some down n' dirty Southwest, some new, some old, some hot, and some cold.  Beginning first with my love of pastries, the first of these six stops would be at the combined grocery, caf\u00e9, bakery, liquor store, souvenir stand, and pizza parlor that is La Grande Orange Grocery; the sort of place you have to see to believe yet the sort of place where it all seems to \""fit.\""\n\nHarbored in a small strip mall with plenty of parking plus curbside checkout for those on the go I made my way into La Grande Orange only half knowing what to expect and having already mentioned the commodities entailed the only thing I could think of when I entered the door was a trip to Whole Foods if you condensed the entirety of one store into a space approximately one quarter the size.  With cups to one side and cupcakes to the other, wine to my right and coffee to my left my first impression was one of total sensory overload yet at the same once I entered and started to browse I detected a sort of controlled chaos as the various lines moved toward their destination with a good flow.  \n\nHaving already eaten breakfast and had plenty of coffee with pizza plans at Bianco for later in the day I took my time investigating the space - children's toys, shirts, travel mugs, cheeses, pre-made salads, locally roasted coffees - before finally approaching the pastry counter to browse the cornucopia of goods.  With many items baked in house and others provided by Tammie Coe Bakery two doors down I weighed the options carefully while additionally gauging my hunger and although any number of the options sounded delectable I ended up settling for two; one my own choice and a sort of obligation at this point and the other a recommendation from the young woman at the counter as \""the best thing in the world;\"" a promise I told her I'd hold her to if she was wrong, and after paying the modest tab I made my way to the street with my choices packed up (ostensibly for later, but in reality for enjoyment less than thirty minutes later as I checked into my hotel.)\n\nBeginning first with my selection, La Grande Orange's very own Red Velvet Cupcake, this large specimen wrapped in red wax paper and topped with an ample pile of cream cheese frosting would prove to be one of the better Red Velvets I've had in some time save for the stellar version at Bouchon Bakery just one month prior.  Loaded with notes of cocoa and sugar plus the faint taste of cinnamon and what I'm pretty sure was clove I really enjoyed the subtle nuance to this cake and despite the $3.95 price tag the portion was substantially larger and the cake significantly more moist than more expensive versions in other major cities.\n\nMoving next to the suggestion of my cashier, the Tammie Coe Crumb Bun, I really was not sure what to expect of the $2.50 option but what I received, while not the best thing in the world, was without a doubt the best sweet I had on my visit to Arizona.  Beginning first with the exterior, this golden biscuit looked something like a cinnamon roll meets a scone with a spiral texture encased in crystal sugar, but digging deeper and peeling off a layer the texture was instead somewhat akin to the famous Breton Kouign Amann kissed with cinnamon and topped with streusel.  Layer after buttery layer, bite after yeasty bite, and making a mess of the carpet (crumb bun indeed) all the while all I can say is that if you find yourself in the Phoenix area this is a must try and given the quality of both selections I was lucky to be staying so far from La Grande Orange and Tammie Coe because otherwise I'd have gone back for more."
1,"One of the benefits of being a native Arizonan is knowing all the best kept secrets our state has to offer.\nThat doesn't mean I'll share them with you, because I won't. \n\nHowever, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, mainly about how I do little or nothing for my fellow man and how the karma from that might bite me in the ass someday.\nSo i'm going to share one secret with you about a Phoenix restaurant this one time. \nLGO.\nThe food is superb, the service is quick, the ambiance, fantastic. That's not the secret.\n\nThe secret is MJ's breads. \nMJ Coe is an award winning baker whose breads are the best in all of Phoenix.\nAll us natives know this, and now you do too. \nLGO not only uses his breads in their  sandwiches, they offer them by the loaf. \nAnd here's the secret that hopefully keeps me out of the karma-cancer hot seat. \n\nMJ offers a signature chocolate-cherry french bread that's quite simply the best bread on earth.\nThe color of chocolate, dark brown, it looks like no loaf of french bread you've ever seen, almost like a pumpernickel.\nOutside, the crust is perfect.\nInside, the crumb is moist and chewy, with large chunks of what I can only presume is world class chocolate along with whole fresh cherries. \n\nAnd as if the chocolate french bread wasn't enough, biting into a chunk of chocolate or a cherry in every bite is the experience of a lifetime, one you won't soon forget.\nBut plan ahead.\nLGO doesn't shelf this bread, it's a special order requiring a one day notice. \n\nHere's another tip, mainly for men. \nOrder at least two loaves. \nOne for the drive home, as you incessantly pick at it until its DOA. The other to present to your wife in a blatant attempt to barter something other than jewelry for a blow-job."
1,"Had their red velvet cupcakes (the ones from LGO, not from the cake shop), and they're amazing!!! I had to bring some home back to CA with me. Really wanted to eat here too but the place was pretty packed Sunday morning. Will have to come back and try their food next time."
1,"So fancy and so good. Pizza, wines, notebooks, cupcakes, coffee.  Everything your yuppies heart needs.\n\nAlong with some free wi-fi, you can see why all the folks and their yoga mats were hanging out here."
1,"Oh My Heaven... I can't believe I haven't yelped La Grande Orange .  I am so in love with LGO , I wish I could be an apprentice back in the kitchen and learn how to make EVERYTHING . I have had almost everything on the menu and love it . When I am running to the office ahead of schedule, I treat myself to breakfast , Crepes are beautiful , the Birchermuesli , the day breaker , you really can't go wrong with anything you choose. The Banana nut muffin is one of the best I have ever had . The Salads are amazing , I've been eating the Thai chicken salad twice a week , trying to figure out how to make it .  I really want to try the Bloody Marys one of these weekends. I had one at their sister restaurant \""The misfit \"" in Santa Monica. I hope it's just as good . LGO should be on your Bucket List . Now Go !"
1,"Get the Commuter Sandwich!!! SOO GOOD!  I love this place- it's always busy, but they move quickly and the staff are always friendly.  I got really excited when I saw that they are opening an LGO at the PHX airport!"
1,"I can't really say anything that has not already been said. This place is fun, funky, and delicious. My go to sandwich is the Croque Madame. The egg on top is always cooked perfectly and its a big sandwich for your $$ ! I have yet to order here and NOT get a desert ( I can't help myself!!).... you really can't go wrong. I love all the cookies but the last few times I have been sucked in by the cupcakes..... banana bread cupcake with toasted coconut frosting... DONE! So moist and the frosting was killer ( but there is a lot of it) \nI love all the quirky gifts you can buy in here, and a lot of it is by local artists! I always get all my stocking stuffers here! My most recent purchase was a LGO hot/cold cup .... so much cooler than the Starbucks ones :) \n\nLove everything about this place! I really do... its my favorite place to stop after a hike up Camelback! ... really its just my favorite place to stop period. :)"
1,"oh wow, this place is amazing! It's like a modern Cracker Barrell (no offense, I like Cracker Barrell) however, this place had a younger, more hip twist to it. Pet friendly patio, picnic benches in the back, and complimentary valet. I could get used to this!"
1,"I've heard the hype about LGO and this was my first visit (and then again a second time at the SWA terminal at the new airport location). I was not disappointed with the huge portions, unique ingredients and fair prices. \n\nTuna salad sandwich is spectacular. Also loved the Thai salad. The sonoma garden salad was a little less memorable as I think it's all packaged before you order it at the airport. It still had nice ingredients and they added shredded chicken for me (at no charge)! The other items I ordered at the restaurant location listed.\n\nI imagine all the food is to die for at LGO.\n\nBe aware that in the evenings the sandwiches aren't available and pizza/entrees take about 25 minutes. Salads are still available"
1,"I generally don't visit the same place more than once - a quick glance at my blog would prove this point; Alinea, Eleven Madison Park, Bouchon Bakery, and The Griddle Caf\u00e9 round out a list of spots that I've  experience, and the people made me want to go back as soon as I walked out the door.  Sure there have been other restaurants that have stirred such emotions but for whatever reason - generally distance or a desire to try something new - I have not yet had the opportunity.  With that said, I've now been to La Grande Orange Grocery and Pizzeria four times in four months and if you count Chelsea's kitchen as part of the LGO empire that number becomes five - the most times I've been to any single space except perhaps the quick casual and fast food restaurants I frequented during my childhood and early years of college.\n\nDescribed simply as \""an organic coffee and breakfast bar, caf\u00e9, pizzeria, and funky retail grocery\"" La Grande Orange was one of the first places I visited on my seminal trip to Phoenix and the place I first suggested to my mother after driving cross country to pick up gifts for my sister and aunt back home. Sort of like The Cracker Barrel (for mainstream reference - I apologize to those I may have offended) or Southport Grocery and Caf\u00e9 (more appropriately) in scope with a small store and bakery up front and a full-fledged kitchen/restaurant in back I'd originally planned to write my standard review of LGO and all of the things I've purchased, eaten, and loved but eventually decided that such a mission would be shortsighted and considering the fact that I now own a home in Phoenix also rather futile - unless they close/burn down or I move/die this list will simply grown and grow.  Instead what I will do from here on out is seasonal updates with salient notes and pictures; from the black and white garden gnome salt&pepper shakers, toad banks and elk-horn knives to the baked goods, pancakes, and pizzas I love this place.\n\nEthiopian Reserve Coffee/Decaf/Black and Tan from ROC2:  I'd be lying if I didn't admit that at least half the reason I spend so much time at LGO is related to the free Wi-Fi and copious refills of coffee from The Roastery of Cave Creek.  Owned and operated by Dave Anderson and Michael Smith with operations not far from my home I've been lucky enough to enjoy some of their single origins from Central America, but for a blend the two offered up at LGO are both excellent with brighter citrus notes accenting the Ethiopian and lower cocoa and earthen notes in the Black and Tan.  Beats wildflower or paradise any day of the week in the battle for best freely refillable coffee.\n\nCroque Madame with Whole Wheat, Tomato, Egg, Ham, Gruyere:  I don't like Dijon and as such I requested the Croque without and what I received was superlative as the savory ham and aged gruyere were briny and bold yet tamed admirably by the crusty bread and sweet, bright tomatoes.  Topped off with a runny egg, sea salt, and just a touch of cracked pepper this wasn't quite a traditional croque but it was delicious...though the accoutrements of sour pickles and sweet melon didn't really 'fit.'\n\nFamous French Pancakes with honey, strawberries, and cr\u00e8me fraiche:  My grandmother was Hungarian and as I remember it she was also a very good cook, a talent my mother unfortunately did not inherit save for a couple of dishes; one of these dishes was Hungarian palacsinta or sweet pancakes.  Sort of like a French crepe but with a bit more tooth LGO's \""French Pancakes\"" reminded me much more of palacsinta than crepe and while others may think this a bad thing I thought it was sublime.  When mom comes back to visit this is on the short list of 'must tries.'\n\nBlueberry Muffin with Whole Wheat Streusel:  Admitting my sweet tooth and wearing it on my sleeve, the first of many pastries sampled at LGO (aside from the Red Velvet Cupcake during my recruitment trip) was this, a killer whole wheat muffin topped with buttery cinnamon streusel and literally bursting with fresh blueberries.  Clearly seasonal with their focus on using fresh, never frozen ingredients I was stunned by the quality of the berries as summer had recently come to a close but hefty in butter and berries while light and fluffy on the bite this was a great muffin.\n\nPumpkin Spice Muffin:  A second muffin, this one just before Halloween, was even better than the first in terms of composition - and with a surprise burst of tangy cream cheese filling on the inside a contender for best pumpkin novelty I've had in recent memory.  Big and bold with the flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg all perfuming the palate and moist like pumpkin pie without being wet I particularly loved the salty toasted pumpkin seeds topping off the muffin - a savory touch that worked nicely with the sweet filling.\n\n...more to come"
1,"This is always a highlight of my business trips to Phoenix.  There is a location in PHX in the Southwest terminal but it just does not compare.  Every time I come here the parking lot is full and the staff is slammed.  The couple in front of me literally ordered $300+ worth of food/wine to be delivered when this isn't a 5-star restaurant.  \n\nI always manage to find so many things to buy in their small ecclectic shopping area....cute stationary, luggage tags, scarves, Voluspa candles...the list could go on.  \n\nEverything is freshly made and there are many vegetarian options.  Plus the desserts are abound...I couldn't choose just one yesterday so I bought two!  Campfire brownie (think S'more on top of a darkish chocolate brownie) & old fashioned chocolate pudding with whipped cream and chocolate chips.  You'd think my pudding was my entree as I gorged myself to the point of rolling out of the place."
1,"I am sitting here now, at La Grande Orange, enjoying myself. Reminiscing, looking at my blog and being in love with their Quinoa/Kale salad which is divinity. \n\nThe music was very loud when I came in an hour ago. This I loved, but the ancients  started complaining so they turned it down..   Ive come to expect this in Phoenix. \n\nWhen will oldies just die already? Just kidding."
1,"If you're looking for a place that has an awesome lunch menu, a great selection of hard to find wines, a great selection of specialty drinks, awesome nick nacks, the best desserts in town (baked in house), and a great selection of specialty cheeses and salami, you have found nirvana!  \n\nI come to LGO at least once a week (on most occasions 3 times a week) and always walk out with a bottle of wine or some sort of cheese or baked good.  Their gelato, dare I say it, is better than Gelato Spot. \n\nOverall great spot to come and enjoy lunch.  \n\nOne complaint though: parking is a nightmare most times.  I hope they expand to a larger location with ample parking."
1,Their smoked salmon commuter sandwich is simply mouth watering. Highly recommended!
1,"LGO is definitely my go-to place for breakfast, lunch, and brunch. Oh who am I kidding...dinner and dessert as well! My favorite thing to do is to come in on a Sunday morning after the hectic activities of the weekend, and enjoy a delicious breakfast in their trendy atmosphere. Of course, everyone talks about their commuter sandwich, but my absolute favorite is the tuna salad on 9-grain. I always come into LGO intending to try something new, but I can never stray away from that sandwich. The thin apple slices paired with the perfect consistency of tuna salad, placed between two pieces of crispy toast, is like heaven in my mouth. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is also a great boost on the weekend mornings!\n\nI love LGO so much that now they've opened a location in the Sky Harbor Airport, I ALWAYS make a point to go to that terminal (even if my flight does not depart or arrive there), JUST so I can get my fill of LGO. Recently I tried their sea salt chocolate chip cookie, and is smitten. It is an incredibly rich cookie, but I love the chunky texture of it and how it looks so fresh and homemade. Plus the shaved sea salt perfectly balances out the sweetness of the dark chocolate! It is a humongous cookie though...and it is very filling.\n\nLGO also has a display of the cutest and quirkiest items on sale in the front. It's a great way to kill time while waiting for your order, as the lines as always very long on the weekends. It's a fun place to grab some unique gifts for your friends!"
1,"La Grande Orange, how much do I love you so!  \n\nYour baked goods consume my thoughts; you have taken the salty/sweet combination to a whole other level! The French salt chocolate chip cookies, where they made by angels? So heavenly! So Perfect! So addicting! The sweet chocolate chip with the crunch of the salt flaked sends me into bliss!! I can't get enough! \n\nThe oatmeal, cranberry, raisin cookie should not be dismissed; this cookie I have to say is my favorite cookie!! The blend of the oatmeal, sweet pop of cranberry and raisin makes my mouth water!!! Its mind blowing!  I pick this cookie over the my delightful chocolate chip cookie as my favorite, and when I 1st was introduced to this cookie, I said no I don't want to try it, I'm in love with my chocolate chip cookie, but then I tried a pieced and my mind was blown!  \n\n Guess I'm in love with 2 cookies, look what you have done to me LGO!!  \n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, you seduced me with your English muffins!! What did I do to you to be so tortured by this delightful food!! These English muffins are heaven sent! Perfectly amazing on their own, but take them home and make a breakfast sandwich out of them, ooooohhhh mmmmmyyyyyy gggggaaawwwwddd !!! Thomas English muffins who??? I only get mine from LGO!"
1,We LOVE LGO for breakfast! Their homemade English Muffin breakfast sandwiches are phenomenal. And their coffee is great. Perfect thing for my husband and I after an exhausting morning hike. We've also had some cupcakes and a red velvet cake from LGO and their desserts are to die for. Highly recommend.
1,Never disappoints back for another commuter sandwich this morning on my way home from airport.  Looks like they have a new rotisserie going to have to stop back for dinner sometime\n\nNice to sit out side and enjoy our beautiful Arizona weather
1,"I am always pleased with LGO!  I'll fight for a parking space any day just to get my coffee and a Commuter sandwich (bfast), Orange and Fennel salad or Stacked Turkey sandwich (lunch), or my favorite Mother Earth pizza for dinner!  The vibe is fun and busy--not the place for a quiet time of solitude, but perfect for any other occasion.  Kudos to LGO for innovating and creating such a great neighborhood spot! :)"
1,"Love coming here.  Great service, neat little grocery area (more eclectic stuff than actual groceries), and the food is awesome (simple menu but delicious)."
1,Been coming here since 2008. This place never disappoints. Great healthy choices everyday all day. Check out my Daybreaker egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms in the pic :) Delicious!
1,Love this place. Great coffee and food. Lines can be annoying and occasionally the music (although good) is waaayyyy too loud. Like nightclub loud and you can't have a conversation. Asked a staff person if they could turn it down a bit and she was totally rude about it and blew us off. Parking sucks but there is valet. Pizza is awesome. The place might be getting a little full of itself however. They need to realize there are growing alternatives nearby.
1,"My go-to breakfast place.  I've never had something here that I didn't love. For breakfast I recommend the eggs any style with fruit and toast (the fruit is always fresh and amazing, also add the bacon, they give you a TON and it's perfectly cooked everytime), the commuter sandwich (but you must add cheese, avocado, & bacon AND get it hot pressed), and the french pancakes are phenomenal if you're feeling something sweet.  For lunch I recommend the kale & quinoa salad, the vegetable sushi roll with goat cheese and sauteed veggies instead of raw fish, the Reuben (AMAZING!), and the burger. You can't forget an iced coffee and sea salt chocolate chip cookie to top of the meal... It's an unbeatable combo. The staff here is really friendly and there always seems to be cute dogs hanging outside, definitely a plus!"
1,"LGO= perfect. \n\nTheir gladiator pizza is amazing. The sausage on it is tasty! \n\nThe burgers are big and juicy and they have the best ranch EVER! It's homemade! \n\nTheir Ruben sandwich is sooooooo good! \n\nLast but not least, they have dessert! They have baked goods and gelato!\n\nIt's no wonder why this place is packed EVERYDAY!"
1,"Five. Fat. Stars.\n\nLGO (as I learned it's called in PHX) is just about one of the cutest spots I've ever been on my various trips to Phoenix. Coming from Seattle I'm very familiar with businesses that focus heavily on locally sourced goods, fresh locally grown produce, and a strong general focus on being eco friendly while not losing their edge or charm. LGO is like a breath of the Pacific Northwest for me!\n\nIt's a local business that's your one stop before you head home. Whether you're hosting friends, you're looking for dinner for one, dinner for two, or just stocking up on goods, you're covered here. \n\nRacks of wine and champagne can be found along a few walls. On other walls and display shelves you can find great gifts or home wares, plus books, greeting cards, kid's toys, candy, and of course food!\n\nThere's a chilled fridge with pre-packaged foods like sandwiches and salads, there are cheese selections, pickled foods, and if you want something made to order they do that too. It's literally a godsend for anyone on the go for any meal, or just about any errand that involves impressing friends, coworkers or family. Nothing you buy here is going to waste! \n\nI especially loved the reversible shopping totes! The fabric so so gorgeous on both sides that your real dilemma is not about when to use the tote but which side to feature!"
1,"I worked with Cole in creating a GF dessert spread for an event held last weekend. The entire process - from the initial order, through editing to delivery was smooth and professional. Not only did he deliver personally, but he brought along the Chef. Desserts exceeded our expectations, and we will absolutely be using and recommending their catering services in the future."
1,"I have only been there once, but can't wait to go back there again and again!!! I had a delicious honey almond milk iced latte, turkey sandwich, and delicious cucumber salad!!!!\n\nEverything looks delicious, and the staff are very friendly and make the lines move quickly!\n\nI highly recommend this place to anyone who likes tasty, health food!"
1,I have nothing but the best to say about LGO.  I have dined here many times and have always been pleased with my dining experience. One of my faviorite meals to get is the pizza and the salmon chopped salad.  This is a great place to meet friends and family at where you know anything you order is going to taste great.
1,"I've been here a few times, trying something different each time and I've NEVER been disappointed. My boyfriend and I split a California roll out of the case and it was some of the best sushi we've had. The open-faced Croque Madame is a must try as well!"
1,"LGO is a classic place to get a quick bite that's going to be quality.  Here are my favorites: \n-Iced Coffee\n-poached eggs and english muffins\n-any of the salads, burgers or pizzas/wings\n\nThe Reuben sandwich is great too!"
1,"The strawberry sorbet tastes like middle school... Sounds super weird but once you try it, you'll understand."
1,Gave LGO another shot and they have forever won back our business. Our servers name was Lindsey and she made our night a perfect experience. Thank you LGO for making it right!
1,Doesn't get much better.
1,"Top Quality Cigars, accessories and staff. They know their stuff and they don't make you feel stupid when asking questions. It's a huge store and once they get their liquor license, it will just add even more to the ambiance."
1,I visit the area often from San Diego and discovered Arcadia Car Wash after a really 'buggy' trip and have been their #1 fan ever since -- clean as showroom new after each visit and the wait is shorter than you think ( if you ever remember how long it would take you to do a complete handwash and vaccuum)! Big J (the owner) takes great pride in making sure each vehicle looks the best it can - you won't be disappointed!
1,"I have driven by this carwash at least 2 million times. I've lived in the Arcadia area for 20 years, went to Arcadia High School, etc. 44th street & Indian School is my 'hood. I finally tried it out, getting my mother-in-laws car washed. They did an excellent job and are pretty cheap- straightforward pricing and never crazy busy so you can get right in. Nice to sit outside and watch them take care of your car! \nThe place isn't fancy or anything, but it's perfect for what it is. \nI brought my bigger, dirtier car in the next week and they did just as great of a job. The owner (or possibly manager?) who is always there is a super friendly guy and makes the experience more personal. \nMy car was sparkling and I will definitely be back. Glad I finally tried this place out!"
1,"Just moved here from Kansas City and my Infiniti was driven the whole way. Needless to say it was covered with KS, TX, and OK bugs. Read the reviews online plus it's close to my house so I thought what the heck!  For $20 plus a $5 tip they did a helluva Job!  Only advice would be to plan on it taking a little longer because it is a true hand wash. \n\nWill be going back!!!"
1,"These folks have kept my cars clean and shiny for almost 20 years. \n\nI drove there yesterday (July 20, 2013) for a wash ... and the place is not only closed, it has been TORN DOWN. \n\nIt was one of the best hand washes in town, and two days earlier, it was still operating. \n\nThe buildings next to it have gone, too, and there's construction equipment there now.  So I'm betting that whatever they're about to build, it won't be a car wash. \n\nWonder what Big Jay and his guys are going to do now. \n\nThis is not good news."
1,"I absolutely love this Target!  True it is not as modern as some of them. However, they are in the process of remodeling. So in March it will be just as fancy as the others. It has a Starbucks for all those folks that need that. You can eve use your Target card there.(Starbucks) It is always clean, tons of parking and the staff is so incredibly helpful and friendly.  The pharmacy is by far the best though. Everyone that works there is wonderful. They can answer all your questions, they are very friendly and of course oh so helpful!  I live on the west side and i will drive all the way over there for my scripts. Of course it is near my job.SOOO it is the best Target in the Valley!"
1,"How can you not love Target!!  Great location right on 44th street and Thomas.          Great Pharmacy, and now they of course carry food..... Seems as if all the Targets are starting to carry food.  They have really good fruit and vegtables....so it is almost like one stop shopping.  The stafff at the Pharamcy is really good always happy and always helpful. There is so much you can get here. Lots of parking in the lot.  They have really great hours as well."
1,"You are awesome!  You have everything anyone could ever ask for. I honestly could spend hours looking at hair products and bed sheets!  Staff is friendly and helpful whenever I have questions. \n\nGuess what??? If you are charged the wrong price for an item, be an adult and say something, they will correct it!  It's crazy I know!  Thank you target!"
1,"I love this place too! Omg fabulous without spending a fortune. The salon is super clean which I love always! The technicians here are super friendly and always ask how you're doing. I enjoy coming here to get my eyebrows waxed, manicures, pedicures, and facials. I can come here and always leave feeling pampered and satisfied. I usually see Diem for my brow and nail care because she is a fantastic nail artist and an excellent brow professional. I don't think there is anywhere else I would want to go but For Nails Only (:"
1,"I hate to admit it (because I usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend) but I love Postino.  It used to be an old post office, thus the name.  It is now a wine bar that serves \""light fare.\""  There are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the Valley -- very California.  One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open.  Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices.  The bathrooms are lovely, clean, and lit by candles.  The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world.   Come early, get your table and enjoy!"
1,I love this place!  It's a fun place to sit and relax and sip a glass of vino.  Be sure to order the bruschetta...I especially love the figs and prosciutto.
1,"I love this place!  I just recently moved to San Francisco from Arizona, but I already made sure to visit it on my first trip back.  I have never brought someone there and had them not like it. \n\nThe atmosphere is great - small and cozy, and very warmly decorated for a former post office.  The wine list is comprehensive for both the white and red wine enthusiasts, and the servers are willing to make recommendations off of the list from their cellar.   Service is typically good unless they are super busy (Friday and Saturday).\n\nIn addition to the wine choices, the bruschetta is awesome!  My favorite is the red pepper goat cheese, but I've also heard very good things about the proscuitto/mascarpone/fig one.  You order a sampler of four different types at a time - and there is a pretty even mix of vegetarian and meat options.\n\nThe only problem is that location is less than desirable for people in the SE Valley - it is a far drive from Chandler or Gilbert to the Arcadia neighborhood in Phoenix.  Here's a tip though: when you get there, don't wait for someone to leave or pay for the valet parking in the crowded lot, there is plenty of parking available for free in the side streets nearby."
1,"I totally heart this place. The food is great - for a wine bar. You can actually eat dinner, and leave not feeling like you filled up on cheese and olives the whole time. Plus the wait staff is great.  You will have to wait on a Saturday/Friday night - but who is in a  rush then anyway? It reminds me of a neighborhood place in San Fran...a must-go in Phoenix."
1,"As per usual no disappointment for lunch and great wine selections for five bucks per glass.  We arrive just before 11 to get our favorite spot and order our usual Bruschetta (4 tough choices) to share.  Having tried all ten choices at one time or the other we chose 1,2, 4 and 8.  You will have to visit to see what we selected but please don't occupy our spot."
1,"After my Radio Milano experience, my friends and I decided to get a wine nightcap at Postino.\n\nI was already tired, but still wanted to hang out.  This was my 2nd time at Postino (first time was for drinks and dinner)  We just wanted wine this time...we ordered 2 bottles.  (I sound like a lush)  The bar closed at 11pm, which I thought was odd...on a Saturday night I thought it should be later.  But the server said that enjoy all we want and we can order all we want until then.  They will so not kick us out.\n\nI just love the atmosphere of this place.  I don't feel that I am in a pretentious crowd and the service is so on its mark.  There is a chance that I will be there for New Years...and if so...update!!!!"
1,"I've been here a few times recently, in various different social situations - romancing, bromancing, and a business meeting. \n\nWow.... is all I can say. The happy hour(s), $5 wine, is a great deal. The food is superb. I think it's a hoot that it's in the old 'Synthony' location, what was once the coolest pro audio and keyboard shop ever. The ambiance is awesome - cool, urban. cultured. The service and knowledge of the servers is above par. It's usually packed. Definitely one of my favorite places for wine in town! I wish I'd been going for a long time, and didn't just get clued in recently. I'm glad I don't live closer... I'd be there all the time!"
1,"I traveled far and wide, convinced many friends and get myself to this cute little wine bar. The outside patio is gorgeous, especially in the spring and fall. The inside is just as beautiful with a warm and comfortable modern feeling.\n\nThe menu is so uncomplicated with delicious bruschetta and cheese plates. I require not much else other than these when drinking copious amounts of wine nectar. However, I remember a special I believe on Mondays with half price bottles and pizza from across the street. It was unbelievable. \n\nThe staff was so nice and gracious when minor mistakes were made. It is definitely worth the trip when I was staying across the valley and would go again and again."
1,"This place is amazing!!!!!  It has delicious food. A great wine list and what else can you say.  It is a great place to sit drink and just talk and chill.  If anything eat the bruschetta.  Share it with a friend.  We need more places like this.  It isn't overcrowded like most places in the valley and lets keep it that way.  The one downside is parking, though I see it as a glass half full problem.  If there was more parking more people would come then it would be crowded.  So go enjoy and be merry."
1,"When I had mentioned to my girlfriend I had never been to Postino's she said, REALLY???  Well then you are in for a treat.  She wasn't kidding!  Who said a wine bar won't get crowded in late June during 109 degree temperature???  And this was at their new location on Central (just north of Camelback). The four of us shared the Bruschetta SELECTION OF 4, so we all got to pick and share...  We enjoyed the Brie & Apple w/Fig Spread, Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, and Warm Artichoke Spread.  Their portions are very generous and each bruschetta is cut in 4 so you don't have to struggle with it yourself.  Anyone who knows me well, knows I ALWAYS slice my sandwiches in 4...easier to eat :-)  Wine by the glass 11am-5pm 7 days a week...yay!!!"
1,"Wine and bruschetta: what can go wrong?  I really enjoyed my visit to Postino.  My friend and I sat outside because we felt like the inside was a little too loud.  The patio was pleasant even for an August Phoenix evening.  I ordered bruschetta while my friend got the panini/soup.  We should have shared because the bruschetta was HUGE.  Four huge slices that were each cut into four pieces.  I picked: smoked salmon, brie and apple, caprese, prosciutto with figs.  Everything was awesome.  My mouth is watering just thinking about my meal.  The wine was also good.  I don't know much about wine, but I enjoyed my 2 glasses.  =)"
1,"I've been to Postino Winecafe once and it has left a lasting impression on me.\n\nI had went there for dinner with a friend one night.  Being the art student I am, I soaked up the surroundings instantly.  The place was artsy with a vast amount of windows.  The overall atmosphere of the place was brilliant.  Any where that allows you to eat on modern and comfy couches by candlelight is definitely a fantastic place!\n\nMy friend and I shared the brushetta sampler [Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Tuscan Tuna with Gaeta Olives, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Salami with Pesto].  The bruschetta was delicious.  It was baked to perfection!\n\nFor two light-eaters like my friend and me, that filled us up quick!  But what's a cozy dinner without dessert?  We shared a classic vanilla cr\u00e8me brulee and it was so creamy and wonderful.  \n\nI definitely recommend this place to anyone!"
1,"Great food.  Great atmosphere.\n\nWe got an Olive Appetizer, a Cheese Plate, and Bruschetta (Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, and Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese)\n\nI got the \""Nine Iron\""\nHickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata\nmozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise\n\nMy wife and her friend split the Vegetarian\nGrilled asparagus, roasted artichokes, red onion, vine ripe\ntomatoes, goat cheese and house made pesto\n\nAnd, of course, a bottle of wine.  We rolled out of there STUFFED to the gills!\n\nWe will be going back again soon!\n\nThere is one problem...if you don't like to give your car to a valet, then you have to walk...far.  On the good side, it's only $3 for valet."
1,"One of the best spots in Phoenix. Great atmosphere, great music, great food and reasonable prices. No need to be a wine snob to appreciate this place. Bruschetta is a must as is valet usually."
1,"We had an event catered last night by Postino for a group of 30.  \n\nThe event was a fabulous success.  The food was terrific.  The service, both during the planning process and delivery was excellent.  \n\nIf you've never catered food before, please, for your own sanity, consider Postino.  They have an easy menu.  It's affordable.  They're easy to work with.  They also offer discounts for non-profits.\n\nWe will be using them for many events in the future.\n\nThank you Postino!"
1,BEST. BRUSCHETTA. EVER. \n\nI now live in Chicago and thought it would be easy to find a good place for bruschetta and wine and NO SUCH LUCK. \n\nPostino is the BEST. I am flying back to Arizona next weekend to get some. Delicious.\n\nYUM.
1,"Tuesday Night Wine and Bruschetta Special Rawks! I love Postino's just for that.  $20 gets you a bottle of wine and a tray of bruschetta.  This is an AWESOME deal.  My girlfriends and I love it.  We can sit and talk and indulge in great wine and food.\n\nTips:  If you have a large group, make a reservation.  Plan to get there early, it gets packed.  The Tuesday Night special starts at 8pm."
1,"Again, I love this place.  I am seriously considering moving into this area because of the restaurants and businesses, and Postino is on the list of awesome places I can't get enough of.\n\nI went here on Saturday afternoon with a girlfriend.  I was really hoping to sit on the patio since it was GORGEOUS out, but of course, we waited till absolute prime weekend lunch time and were forced to sit inside.  I make this sound horrible but it isn't at all, I was just being dramatic.  It turned out great because we sat at the bar next to this super cute, chatty couple and talked with the very nice, helpful bartender.  They roll up the garage door windows and open the doors when it is nice, so it was almost (not quite) like we were on the patio.  One plus: no bees inside.  \n\nMy friend and I decided we would day drink (why not? it is the weekend) so she ordered a mimosa and I a Bellini.  Fresh juice paired with champagne (sparkling wine, prosecco, cava, bubbly, whatever) = delicious.  AND all glasses of wine and beer are only $5 from 11:00am - 5:00pm.  Thank you, may I have another?\n\nAfter our second adult beverage we ordered olives and brushetta.  Both were delicious and perfect for a light lunch.  I probably could have sat there all day had we not made movie plans.  Probably better that way anyways, I wouldn't want to overstay my welcome (or not be able to drive myself home because of Bellini imbibement).  \n\nAll in all, another great experience at Postino, maybe I will check out the new one on Central next time...."
1,"Hands down the best wine bar in Phoenix.  Great atmosphere, music, deals and wine.  This is the number one place on my list for those who have a sophisticated pallet.  It is busy there for a reason and definitely worth the wait."
1,first time here the coke'd up owner stopped by our table and hit on my girlfriend. I would have never come back if he wasn't doing such a kick ass job with this place. Its really well done. The one wall opens up onto a wooden deck letting in the warm breeze. Food is well done and they have an excellent beer and wine selection. Style and substance. Prices aren't so bad either.
1,"This place is one of Arcadia's treasures.  The wine selection is amazing here but it would be nothing without the educated, considerate, polite and helpful employees.  i have never had a bad night at this establishment.  My favorite night to go is on Tuesday's because they have the best deal in town-a board of Bruschetta (4) and a bottle of wine from their special menu for $20.  Plus if you don't finish the bottle-you can bag it and take it home!\nMy favorite Bruschetta are the roasted peppers w goat Cheese, the Apple and Fig and the Prosciutto and Mascarpone one...Mmmmmmm Delish!\nIf you haven't been in yet and you love to lounge, drink wine and listed to good music-GO HERE."
1,"I've been craving to wine and dine here for so long, since my friends rave about it. So I finally got my opportunity to experience Postinos yesterday... Sunday Funday. It definitely felt like summer w/  the live reggae band that actually sounded more like Jack Johnson... enjoyed the music either way... while drinking amazingly refreshing sangrias. I was eager to order from their impressive wine list (definitely next time), but my friend influenced me to taste the sangria... which I'm normally not a big fan of... But it wasn't overly sweet at all.  We of course ate their infamous bruschettas... delicious!  Service was super friendly and attentive."
1,LOVE the brushetta!\nGreat location - fabulous service - and nice wine selection!
1,"This is one of my favorite places around. So much so that it's been labeled my official \""date\"" restaurant. I've been here a trillion times (okay, maybe not that much), but have always had good experiences here - even when I accidently lit a napkin on fire at the table. \n\nI have very little patience for waiting anywhere, but I will wait a half an hour to be seated here, which is pretty often on busy weekends with a party more than two. The wine list is hand-selected and always amazing. The bruschetta is TDF (which, is one of the things I miss most about being #glutenfree), I recommend the ricotta and pistachios and the apple one. Their sandwiches are amazing (although I don't actually like their focaccia bread, I always went with the cibata). The waiters generally remember who you are, and some of them even remembered the wine I get so much so that when they rotated it out of the menu they were genuinely concerned and addressed it as soon as I arrived! \n\nOn Sundays and (I think) a weekday night, they have live music. SUCH a great ambiance! If you love olives as much as I do, you have to try the olive sampler platter. It's brilliant. Even their soups are delicious. If I ever move, I will miss this place for sure. Oh, and try the creme brule. It's a must!"
1,"I've always been a big fan of Postino but don't make it down there very often. A couple of weeks ago I met some friends to hike Camelback. After a struggling hike, we went to Postino to enjoy some food and drinks. What a perfect day! \n\nWe sat outside on the patio and were cooled by misters. Our attentive servers brought us water right away. I started with fresh squeezed lemonade then had a mimosa. My friend and a bellini and the guys had some IPA (I think it was $5 a pitcher??) \n\nI can't go to Postino without having some of their infamous bruschetta... we ordered the artichoke, tomato jam, prosciutto/fig, and date/pistachio. Every bite was delicious! Can't wait to go back!"
1,"One of my fav places that I would recommend to anyone! The atmosphere is intimate and trendy. They have a good wine selection and delicious food. I would recommend the bruschetta which comes in 12 different flavors. The Brie & Apple and the Prosciutto & Figs are the best in my book. The staff is also friendly and helpful. They provided me with some great suggestions on wine after asking a few questions. Overall, it's just a great place to go for any occasion."
1,"Postino is one of my FAVORITE restaurants I have ever been to.  I always make sure to be very hungry when I go.  I can't say enough good things about it so I will try to be as concise as possible.\n\nMy friends and I usually go on Friday and Saturday nights and it is understandably busy.  We all usually grab a delicious glass of wine and don't mind the short wait at all.  I cannot say enough nice things about the staff here.  They are always very polite, friendly, and conscious of getting us seated as soon as possible.\n\nWe always order one or two planks of bruschetta to start out.  I have had them all and love them equally.  To follow that I usually order the prosciutto and brie panini.  All the ingredients taste so fresh and the bread is equally delicious (I have to admit I am picky about bread, coming from San Francisco sourdough land) I have to admit that all the food and wine fill me up so I have never tried their desserts but I am sure they are amazing as well.\n\nThe food is amazing.  The service could not be better.  The ambiance is nice and casual. The price is more than reasonable.  I have no criticisms for this restaurant and encourage everyone to go!"
1,Great for any occasion. The salty sundae is unusual and fantastic.  The bruschetta addictive.
1,Obsessed with Postinos! I live right down the street from there and frequent it quite often. I'm a vegetarian so it's sometimes difficult for me to eat places but at Postino's they have wonderful meat-free bruschetta options. They also have excellent Sangria for those who are looking for a lighter fruity alternative to wine. I like to go there on Sunday's and drink $5 Sangria pints and listen to the reggae band. So fun!
1,"I really miss this hot spot for lunch. You can not lose here. Really...\n\nMy fav would be the bruschetta. Such a hearty, italian treat served ontop of a wooden cutting board. The cheese boards are brilliant for snacking and socializing. \n\nThe building is an old post office. How unique!"
1,"A trendy spot to hit up. I am not a big fan of wine, but gave in to coming here with my friend that loves wine. I hear there is a $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine on Mondays and Tuesday. Well last night (Monday) we got the $13 bruschetta (with 4 pieces you choose) and a $30 bottle of Grayson, a cab, all for $20. I mean what a deal.\n\nDark atmosphere, good food, good variety of wine. Definitely a great local business to support. Parking is probably the biggest problem you'll encounter.\n\nOh and they have a \""People Love Us On Yelp Sticker\""!"
1,"If you have not been to Postino's....WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!!? This is one of those hidden gems...I enjoy everything about this place.\n\nThe food- excellent\nThe Wine-  cant go wrong\nService- Always have been very please\nPrice- Fair\nWait time- Yes...Ive had the pleasure of waiting a few times, but its worth the wait.\n\nBe back soon..."
1,"I have been to this Arcadia location a handful of times. Each time I got the same thing because on Monday, and, I believe Tuesday nights, they feature what is probably the best deal in the world. For $20 you get a BOTTLE of wine, your choice, from a long list, and a large plank of four different sets of specialty bruschetta. The ambiance is upwardly-lounge-casual; perfect for both a date night or meeting friends after work."
1,"Fantastic bruschetta. And $5 glasses of wine during some lunch time happy hour thing (I can't recall the times though).\n\nI really enjoy the food here, and it's pretty cheap for what you get (a lot of food). They have free valet parking if you can't find any parking on the street."
1,I was torn between this place and LGO but was at LGO for breakfast.  Pretty happy I picked Postino for lunch.  Sandwich selection was unique (Prosciutto with Brie) and the general ambiance during lunch was real nice.
1,"I can't say that I would fight for a parking space at many places, but Postino makes the list. Will I ever steal a parking spot? Not at all, but I will look long and hard for one here. The wait is worth it yelp friends. Postino does a great job luring customers in and keeping them. With their incredible happy hour, I wish I could sneak away to dine on a glass of wine before 4:00 PM on a weekday and for those who can, I salute you. \n\nEvery time I wine and dine at Postino, I leave full, happy and satisfied. The original Postino location will also be my favorite based on it's location, ambiance, character, service and quality products. The wine is obviously top knotch here at Postino. Bottles line the walls and the staff knows their selections inside and out. They offer bottle specials all the time and you can enjoy a bottle at a reasonable price practically every day of the week. \n\nTheir food competes with the quality of their wine. I long for their bruschetta. You chose four different flavors and for a reasonable price under $15. My favorite bruschettas are the prosciutto and fig, and tomato paste with cheese. The tomato mozzarella is also a classic. But, it really just depends on your taste buds because any bruschetta you choose will be excellent. Many times, I got for the half sandwich/salad combo. I like to order the Market which isn't on the menu. It comes with pesto, tomato and mozzerela. I make sure to add chicken. The Mediterranean is my go-to salad but I vary between all of their salads. You really just can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. And it tastes even better with wine. Doesn't everything?"
1,"This is the perfect spot to go to with a few friends. Great wine and great food. \n\nThe bruschettas they have are so so good, as well as the sandwiches.\n\nThey have a large selection of wine and each glass is only $5.00 each until 5pm -- The staff I have interacted with have all been really nice and helpful.\n\nSome of the people that go there are wannabe foodies and snobs though, use caution. lol"
1,"This is the perfect setting for a girls day on a Sunday afternoon.  Share a bottle of wine while listening to Walt Richardson perform.  Couldn't get any better than this. Also, can be very romantic with the right man.  Gentlemen take your lady's here, they will be very impressed. The food, beverage and ambiance is amazing."
1,"Bruchetta board, pitcher of Kronenbourg, sitting on the patio, stellar service and boyfriend = death because this is the best dining experience I might ever have. \n Favorite slab consists of: Roasted Red Peppers on Goat Cheese, Warm Artichoke, Dates, Pistachios with Ricotta and Sheeps Milk below a sweet Tomato Jam. \n\n The only *bad* (more so just personally annoying), thing I've ever come across here, had nothing to do with the food itself or even the servers..well not our server..was when one of the ladies walking around clearing tables felt the need to express to us that SHE has OCD therefore, we needed to remove the last 2 pieces of bruchetta from the board, so she could clear it..because it was making HER uncomfortable..\n\n Never push your 'disorder' off onto someone else and expect them to abide, especially when your customers are deep in mid-conversation about serious things like puppies and the night's baking agenda...this customer will not yield and out of spite, leave a lingering, lonesome bruchetta upon the slab for your sake.\n\n I, too, have a disorder - not caring about your fear of individual bread pieces on a plate.\n\n Despite said occurrence, there are NO complaints, ever. A valley staple that I recommend highly, for all occasions."
1,"Can't wait to go back.  I love the Monday deal, it is genius.  I was there with my twin mom group (about 12 moms of twins), we had a blast.  I love the Brie, Apple and Fig, Prosciutto, Fig and mascarpone, Tomato jam bruschettas.  I had the Teira Zinfandel, which was perfect."
1,Love this place.  Love all the food and the staff is great.  We drive from Gilbert to have lunch at Postino's Arcadia.  We understand a new location here in Gilbert will be opening soon.  Can hardly wait. I do recommend this place to everyone I meet.
1,"First time here a week ago. The atmosphere is fantastic ! We came during dinner (around 630PM) and the place was packed but everyone was friendly and so was the service.\n\nWe ordered 4 different bruschettas. I was originally intending on ordering a panini, but one of my sorority sisters suggested otherwise. A few other sisters vouched for their bruschetta, so the bf and I didn't think we'd go wrong there. All of the different kinds we tried were delicious! So much that we ordered another 4 with our 2 favorites. Can't go wrong... just pick one! Or 4... since they come served that way.\n\nI wasn't feeling wine that night for some strange reason, but their cucumber lemonade was sooooooooo refreshing. Yes, that many O's.\n\nNew favorite stop-by-when-we're-in-town place."
1,"Postino is an amazing place to chill and relax with good company, good food, and amazing wine. \n\nWe had a nice Friday afternoon lunch outside with a glass a wine, and it was a perfect atmosphere. The Arcadia location makes you feel like you're in a small town rather than a city like Phoenix. \n\nThe cheese board - amazing!"
1,"This is my 2nd review because I love this place sooooooooooo much...Everyone should go here!!! It is one if the best places in phoenix!! The atmosphere is beautiful especially at night! Im so lucky b/c i can just walk here and i do ALL THE TIME!!!

The desserts are fabulous my favorite is the salted caramel sundae...i like the caramel ontop of their chocolate cake and ice cream its amazing...of course leave it up to me to love two desserts and combine them...or if you want a good drink other then wine try their bellinis and mimosas...they are delicious at anytime of the day hahaha...just dnt drink too many and drive have someobe get you a cab...\nI love this place so much and cannot tell more ppl enough about this place!!! So come here and enjoy!!!"
1,"Has got to be one of my favorite restaurants. Monday and Tuesday when you are there at or after 8-close, It is $20 bucks for a bottle of wine and your choice of four different slices of their bruschetta. \n\nThe Chicken and Mozzarella Panini is one of my favorites.\n\nYou can easily have a dinner for two, including an app, two entree's and a bottle of wine for well under $60.\n\nBe aware that there WILL be about an hour wait for this quaint little restaurant. However, in the same center is a place called La Grande Orange that you can grab a decent bottle of wine at while waiting for your table. As well when you do that they validate your valet parking ($3) not including a tip. \n\nValet is a must usually around this spot since the parking is quite horrible. But when you expect it, you should not be disappointed."
1,"Great food, great Sangria, great live music, great vibe, great service EXCLAMATION MARK. Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon."
1,"I effing love this place, that is all there is to it.  I have taken a parade of first dates in here, so much so that when I was single my friend swore they were going to think I was a lady of the night.  But I love it so, I'm so comfortable here, the place is so warm and inviting, and who doesn't look hot gilded in candle light?  I have been here prob more than 80 times, and it never gets old.  I return at least once or twice a week, and not just for a date night, wine with friends, lunches with mom, happy hour are all equally fun here.  \nMy favorite things: $20 night, although Mon and Tue after 8 are busier than a weekend up in here, be prepared to wait and get drunk; brushetta in all it's glory - always fresh, always perfect; the ever changing wine list, always fun to try them all and order for others; the soups in winter; the prosciutto and brie sandwhich, I die.  One more confession, I actually picked my current condo because of it's proximity to Postino.  Less than a mile.  Sold.  xx"
1,"There are a lot of wine bars popping up across the Valley in the last few years and they are pale imitations of this.  Postino's is great.  Love the atmosphere and the Bruschetta boards are amazing.  Lots of choices and each board is a large serving, big enough to share.  Perfect place for happy hour with the $5 glasses of wine.  I can't wait for them to open their Gilbert location."
1,Absolutely amazing!\n\nI finally made it to Postino after hearing great things from many people.  We came on a Tue night to meet up with another couple we hadn't seen in awhile.  Mon and Tue they have the special where you get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20.  This is a great deal.  The place was crowded so if you go make sure you go early and get your name in.  The nice thing is that you can start drinking your bottle while you wait.  We were waiting for around 45 min before we got a table but we were having fun nonetheless.  The bruschetta was amazing and there were many different types to choose from.  We also tried the grilled cheese which was delightful.  We will definitely be back again and I am excited to try more things on the menu.
1,"Beautiful people, tasty Brushetta, good wine all go well with the good weather.  No complaints, but this place could you an early acoustic jazz happy hour a little more regularly.  \n\nGreat place in the sun!"
1,"This restaurant got all the right stuff. Great service, a great wine list, quality food, and a relaxed atmosphere with a European feel to it. \nThe chef must have a great knowledge of foods and flavors that compliment one another because I cannot recall trying a dish that I did not like. Bruschettas are great because you get to try four different flavors in one order. Last time we went I had their chicken and mozzarella panini which was delicious. I highly recommend you try this place."
1,I always have a splendid time at Postino. The food is wonderful and usually comes out pretty quickly. Fun atmosphere and I love the historic building.
1,"I miss Postino! I moved from Phoenix about 8 months ago and every time a happy hour is needed, I think if only I could have Postino tonight... \n\nPhoenix, enjoy this place- go often- eat lots of Bruchetta and raise a glass of wine to celebrate ANYTHING.\n\nTake it from me, a girl who missed her favorite place...there isn't another place quite like it. The atmosphere, the servers, the comfortable patio and wonderful selection of wines to choose from make Postino Arcadia a 5 star location!"
1,"Don't ask me about anything on the menu except the bruschetta, I've never been able to get past it.  Many different inventive delicious toppings on perfectly toasted slices of rustic bread, served on a narrow wooden platter.  Each and every bite is to die for, and they have a good glass wine.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the loud techno music.  Everyone yells to be heard above it.  Which means I have to, too."
1,"Great bruscetta salty carmel sundae, and of course wine.  Service can be a little slow from time to time but not a big deal.  Love the sparkling sav blanc on a hot day.  Cool atmosphere as well."
1,"The soup, salad, panini, and especially the bruschetta were all fabulous! Delicious and beautifully presented. We also really enjoyed the live music and the peach tea. I wish I lived closer - this would easily become a favorite lunch spot for me (although maybe only for special occasions as it's a bit pricey)!\n\nHIGHLY recommend. :)"
1,"There is nothing that I don't love about this place.  My first visit was a late afternoon lunch after a hike and we sat on the patio.  Trust me when I tell you that you MUST get the bruschetta.  I can't wait to go back.  The parking doesn't bother me a bit because it's all part of the experience-don't let it deter you.  If you want a big lot and a restaurant with crappy food, no ambiance, and terrible service, go to Chili's."
1,"There's not much more I can say about Postino than hasn't already been said... the food is incredible, the wine list is extensive, the menu is reasonably priced, the ambiance is delightful, and the service rocks!\n\nI was there last night and enjoyed the $20 bottle of wine + bruschetta deal after 8 p.m. The portions on the bruschetta deal were surprisingly generous, and amazingly delicious! I went with the mozzarella with tomato and basil, the goat cheese with roasted peppers, the smoked salmon with pesto, and ricotta with dates and pistachios; I loved the first three, but I would not order the date and pistachio bruschetta on my next visit. \n\nI also ordered the \""pick two\"" panini and salad/\""soup of the moment\"" combo, with the Brie and prosciutto panini and a healthy serving of tomato soup. The panini was scrumptious! It was perfectly prepared, and tasted amazing ... I wish I had ordered the full sandwich! The soup was just OK - it wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as exciting for my tastebuds as the panini. \n\nI would liken my dining experience at Postino to \""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\"" -- after I had one phenomenal item, I had to have them all! After polishing off a bold and zesty Syrah from California, I ended up leaving with a bottle of the Reunion Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina. Restaurant patrons receive $9 off bottles of wine to-go, so I mean, I wasn't gonna not... (perfectly acceptable use of double negatives).\n\nAlthough it is a trendy spot, Postino has somehow managed to remain friendly and unpretentious - both staff and guests alike. The servers all know their stuff and are more than happy to provide recommendations based on your preferences. Even the least sophisticated palate will feel comfortable dining here on account of the helpful service and charming atmosphere; hence why I hereby award Postino with my first 5/5 star review! \n\nAproveche, my friends!"
1,"Fig and marscapone bruschetta is to die for. I crave it all the time! Vintage 95 in Chandler has attempted to copy Postino's recipe for success, but it doesn't compare to the service, atmosphere and quality that Postino is known for. Prices are completely fair, wine and beer selection is great. The Mixed Green salad was totally amazing. I drive 30 minutes from Gilbert to get there, and it is worth every minute. I can't wait for the Gilbert location to open! One of the best places in Phoenix, hands down."
1,"Monday night is reverse happy hour! Starts at 8pm. You get a bottle of wine and choice of 4 bruschetta for $20! The burrata, bacon, arugula and tomatoes  and the warm artichoke spread are to die for! Outstanding! This is definitely a place to go! One thing that was a little annoying was how loud it is in the restaurant, but the great food outweighed the noise."
1,"So as expected I have nothing but good things to say about Postino Arcadia. In fact it would be silly for me to comment since it will be a repeat of what everyone else has already said. So I'll just say its a great place to hang out, drink great wine, eat yummy food and soak up the vibe. Must haves are: bruschetta, salted caramel sundae and the pub board."
1,"The Brie and Apple with Fig spread Bruschetta is amazing! \n\nSince I don't live in AZ, I orginally heard of this place by Meghan McCain who I follow on twitter and listed this on her blog as one of her favorite Phoenix hang outs for those that are not native to the area.  Although she listed Postino Wine Cafe, I was brought to this location and I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived.  The staff was knowledgeable on their wine selection and provided great service.  The cork on my bottle of Pinot Noir had \""Wine Crystals\"" or Wine Diamonds\"", nothing I had seen before.  The server was very informative on explaining what it was, turns out I did my own research and the information provided was very accurate.  http://winesworld.com/index.php/wine-crystals/68/  \n\nAlso, If you are a fan of music, on the Friday night that I was there, they played music by The Whitest Boy Alive, The XX, Phoenix, Hercules & Love Affair and Band of Horses to name a few.  I was tapping my toe as some of these are on my own personal playlist so it instantly gained a few stars for the music alone.   Next, I'm coming back for Sangria Sundays and reggae.  Overall a very unique experience, great ambiance and delicious food.\n \nCheers!"
1,Love love love Postinos. It is such a great atmosphere and I'm a huge fan of the rasp chicken salad. \n\nWill be back again and again!
1,Good Stuff can't beat the happy hour. Definitely sign up for their email prior to going in and you should receive a free bruschetta board email.
1,"Great place to dress up a bit and feel more of an urban vibe. Hip but not pretentious. I went to Postino's Monday night around 8pm. We were given a wait time of an hour for a party of four. The place was full but we managed to find a standing table near the bar to wait out our table. We drank a bottle of \""Available\"" per the recommendation of folks next to us (heavenly) and were visited regularly by waitstaff to fill our water. The music was just the right level to support conversation, but kept a hum in the background. When seated our waiter came to the table nearly immediately and submitted drink orders. For food we had two orders of bruschetta which was more than enough. Everything was delicious. Definitely coming back here."
1,"Postino. Oh, how you bring love to my heart with your bruschetta boards and interesting atmosphere. \n\nLove this place! Here's some tips; everyday before 5pm the glasses of wine are $5.. You may have a tough time finding parking so make it easy on yourself and bring cash to valet. Make sure to stop by the LGO grocery store after you eat at Postino. \n\nNow, onto the food at Postino. Pretty much the best thing you can order is the Bruschetta board because its SOOOO AWESOME! \n\nAs many other Yelpers with great taste have mentioned, a couple of the best bruchettas (although it's tough not to just order 2 boards and get them all- except the artichoke, that one should be avoided). \n\nHighly Recommended (I don't have the exact names down, but here's the main); the salami one, the one with fig, apples and brie (****BEST*****), the roasted red pepper and mozz/basil/tomato. \n\nThe first time you go, you may just have to order 2 boards if your party is big enough, because they are all so good, except for the artichoke one- that one is NOT good. \n\nThe wait staff does a great job, and I love everything about Postino! After writing this review I need go, like this weekend... Like now, wait, \""Can we go to Postino for lunch?\"""
1,One of my all time favorite restaurants. Bruschetta is amazing!
1,I love this place!  It's on my short list of places to make sure to take visitors.  I always get the bruschetta and there are so many different options to choose from it never gets old.  One of favorites in the valley.
1,Loved this place! Amazing food and wine! Service was great! Beautiful experience.
1,"Always great service, lovely ambience, great wine selection, and appies that can't be beat. The bruschetta is delicious, the meat platter is divine, and the cheese plate delights my palate. Our party of 10 had a very enjoyable evening here with extremely attentive service. I can't ever say 'no' to Postino's. Ever!"
1,"I'm on a huge Postino kick lately and had another awesome dinner there last night with five girlfriends.  Since my last review of this place was in 2008, I figured it was time for an update, but honestly, not too much has changed since then - I'm a very loyal customer and have been for years!\n\nMy favorite menu items are still the same too:\nThe artichoke dip (which actually comes with hummus too but I always special request double artichoke instead because I love it so much), the mixed green salad with added turkey, chicken, or prosciutto, and the bruschetta board... My top two bruschetta faves are Brie & Apple with Fig Spread and Prosciutto, Fig & Mascarpone. Mmmmm!\n\nI'm not currently drinking (I'm prego again), but of course this is the perfect place to go for a glass of wine or four as well!  \n\nService is always fabulous and the atmosphere rocks too.  So in my eyes, this place deserves five stars... even almost five years from my original review!\n\nOf course, it is worth noting that it's not only a favorite of mine, there are plenty of others that love it too... so, sometimes you may have to wait a bit.  If you've got a large party (eight or more), I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time."
1,"My favorite place for a date and conversation. The decor is unique since it was a restored post office. Lots of lounge and table type seating.Try the bruschetta board! I always order the sweet tomato jam and sheep's milk, ricotta and dates, apples and brie, and salmon/pesto. Consistently great food & drinks. Service has more spunk and personality at this Postino location too. Try the cucumber lemonade if you don't like wine or just plain water. If you order wine and it isn't happy hour, you can easily spend more than $30 on yourself. However, I think it is worth it, and I always leave full and happy. Thanks Postino!"
1,"One of my favorite spots for any time , any day of the week ! Everything here is yummy and delicious ! The staff is always awesome ! If I could give this place more stars - I would ! :)"
1,"I've been coming here for years and I'm happy to report that it's still as great as ever. I met a couple of my girlfriends here after work last week. We stayed for hours at our little patio table and the wait staff was attentive, friendly and helpful the entire time. The wine was nice and the portions are generous. The bruschetta is beyond belief good. It's really just a proven nice place to spend some time with people over good food and wine. It will always be one of my go-to places."
1,"Can't say anything that's not already been said, just reiterate it.  Fab bruscetta!  Can't go wrong with any of those selections. I've been in the evening when it's super crowded, but my favorite time of day is lunch especially when it's a beautiful day and the garage doors are open, you can't beat this place for ambiance!"
1,"Perfect date spot!  But also perfect for a friendly gathering for wine and bruschetta.  My friends and I ordered a couple of bottles of prosecco  and 7 or 8 different kinds of bruschetta.  Perfect for 5 people and we had a great time talking and laughing underneath the heat lamps outside.  I loved this place and I will definitely come back every time I visit Arizona. \n\nDear Postino, open a location in San Francisco.  Thanks!"
1,"$5 WINE and BRUSCHETTA FROM THE GODS. WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR?\n\nIt was my first time in Phoenix this weekend and I wanted to shoot myself because I was disappointed by so many places that people raved about on yelp/tripadvisor (i.e. Carolina's, Desert Botanical Garden, The Vig - to name a few)\n\nI stopped by Postino's on my last day there and if it wasn't for this place, I would probably never visit again.\n\nFYI - stop by La Grande Grocery next door and try the A-Z cookie. It's BOMB."
1,"Okay; this place is pretty dang tasty and their most popular dishes are the Bruschetta! How can little pieces of bread with an assortment of toppings can be so amazing? \n\nTo name a few:\nRicotta with dates & pistachios: The cheese is not over powering and the date gives it the sweetness whereas the pistachios give it a nice crunch. \n\nProsciutto with figs & mascarpone: Luckily it was fig season because you can never go wrong with prosciutto and figs! \n\nSalmon and pesto: It's something that everyone usually gets but honestly this was kind of a disappointment. The salmon was a bit thin and I didn't like it with the pesto. \n\nBrie & Apples with fig spread: Brie is literally the tastiest cheese. buttery, sweet and crunchy from the apple (another favorite) \n\nThe bruschetta does change occasionally but they keep some of the popular ones on the menu. Great place to hang out with your friends and drink wine from their extensive wine bar."
1,"Same great happy hour and food as the central location.  I did not note a difference in the food between both locations.  \nArcadia has a nice outdoor patio, I prefer the tables that sit halfway outside and halfway inside.  See if you can get one when you visit.  Enjoy anything with fig on it. :)"
1,"What can I add that others haven't already said?  This place is adorable, the food is delicious, the wine selection is admirable and the employees are great.  \n\nGo.  Go now."
1,DELISH. Atrichoke sandwich is the way to go! (light on the cheese tho!)
1,"Love this place! I still kinda like the one on Central slightly better, but this has a cool inside/outside vibe and being next to LGO is awwesome!"
1,Love this place. Great ambiance and food. Wish I could go weekly.
1,Is there anywhere else in the Valley that does bruschetta this yummy? I think not! Love their catering too!
1,"We stopped here last night and glad we did.  The choice of four bruschetta was awesome loved them all white bean, artichoke, burrata and mozzarella. My glass of Manifesto Zin was really good as well.  A nicely appointed restaurant that I would frequent more given the chance."
1,Bruschetta...Wine\nThe options to choose for your bruschetta are terrific!  And they are the best in town!  The wine selections are terrific!  Great service and very reasonable prices.  What is not to like.\nDick
1,"Live music, great bruschetta, great service"
1,"I always love going here--feels like home in a great sense.  The decor esthetically pleases and relaxes me.  The service is always individual and\nusually great (one slightly short bartender in Gilbert once ... ),  and the food (bruschettas mostly) makes me smile ... Contemporary take on them is refreshing."
1,"One of my favorite restaurants in town , love the food and. Atmospheres there. Bruschetta is the best !!!"
1,"The bruschetta and pub boards are to die for, and we look forward to the $20 wine & bruschetta deals on Mondays and Tuesdays every week! Get here a bit early on those days though, as everyone likes this great deal."
1,"Postino has 3 locations around the Valley!  I've been to 2 of them now and the one thing you can say about Postino, they are an amazing place to dine/drink and they are very consistent with service, quality and ambiance.  \n\nWe typically go the Postino on Central, however we dined here a couple of weeks ago with some friends and found them to be fantastic! I really like the patio area!! It was too cold for us on this trip however this is a \""must come back\"" kinda of place just to enjoy a great meal on their patio!!\n\nFood~ if your dining for lunch go straight to the salads and/or bruschettas!!  Their portions are actually larger than you think and after you pick and choose some of the different ones to eat, you'll thank me for passing on the apps!!  \n\nHowever if you re dinning for dinner or have a larger group or a huge appetite, then go ahead and order some apps.  I suggest trying their Bella Postino~ warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted breads or their Butcher's Block~ with different artisan meats and cheeses served with Tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini.  Both are DELISH!  \n\nBruschetta's~ here are some of our faves;  Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto is my go to!! The Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato is also a go to!  We also like to try their seasonal burchettas as well!  \n\nPaninis~ go for the prosciutto with brie or their Nine Iron with smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and special sauce = nom.nom.nom!! \n\nService~  our service was a little slower than what we are used to at their Central location however our server was very friendly, knew the menu well and tried her best to keep up.\n\nAll in all it was a FANTASTIC experience!! My friends and I are looking forward to coming back on a Monday or Tuesday when they have their $20 special, a bottle of wine and burchetta ~ put me down for 2 please! I hope to see you there."
1,What a great place for focaccia bread. Yummy. Love the pesto sauce. I don't always like paying $12-14 for a glass of delectable red wine but sometimes it seems so worth it to blow a few twenties among friends. Its a great place to relax. Great ambience
1,"Two words:\n\nProsciutto With Brie on Focaccia Bread.  \n\nOkay, that was a lot more than 2 words, but I don't care.  \n\nIt was downright amazing; like my tastebuds were being dry humped by the best sandwich ever invented in the History of the World (Part II)."
1,The best bruschetta ever.\nSo many delicious  flavor combinations.\nMake a meal of it.\nHighly recommended..
1,"Love love this place. Sooooo gooooooood!  Recommend highly,"
1,Everything was amazing. We got the bruschetta: you get to pick for different kinds and a panini to share. We got the iron and it is giant and delicious. More than enough food for the two of us. The wine is great. We went for happy hour $5 a glass so we just got a bottle for $20 - I'll be back!
1,"Another 5 starts for this wonderful restaurant!!  Not only do I love the food that's served here - I mean, best Bruschetta in town!!!  The customer service continues to WOW me everytime I visit!  I hosted my little sisters Bridal Shower here in the sofa lounge area of the restaurant and everyone just loved it.  There were 14 newbies to Postino Arcadia and they'll all be coming back to visit again!!  Thanks for helping me create such a memorable day for my baby sister!  She couldn't have been happier and that means the world to me :)"
1,Great food and boards
1,Arcadia area is very cool and Postino fits right in
1,"amazing food, you literally can not go wrong with any of the bruschetta toppings. I even tried their seasonal one for kicks and it was delicious too..\n\nyou will love it, but you will hate the wait.. still worth it.. especially the board and bottle deal."
1,my friend and i used to come here after hiking camelback.  you can't beat an excellent sandwich and sald w a crisp pitcher of beer or sangria.  we love the patio and the atmosphere along w the live musician they have on a sunday afternoon.
1,"LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. \n\nWhat a great place this is! I mean wine and bruschetta? You can't get better then that!  \n\n On Mondays Tuesdays they have a bottle of house wine and a bruschetta for $20!! What a steal! The only down side those days WILL be busy but it's totally worth the wait! (And you can start drinking your wine while you wait. They have little tables you can stand around or sometimes areas you can sit!)The outside patio at night is to die for! But it can be a bit noisy! \n\nWonderful \""girl night\"" get together spot!"
1,Tuesdays are the best obvs thanks to their special. Not really a dinner place but great place to hang out and have a variety of wine selections.
1,Amazing wine selection AND $5 glasses during (a super long) happy hour. A great variety of bruschetta! My faves are the salmon w/pesto and the roasted red pepper w/goat cheese :) can't go wrong with any of the paninis either! The atmosphere is perfect for dates and lunch with the girls!
1,"Good food, good service, nice atmosphere"
1,This place has the best wednesdays in the valley! I love all of their bruschettas! I will always love this place!
1,Favorite resturant in Phoenix!
1,"I had the best bruschetta here. \n\nThe drinks were good and refreshing.\n\nThe sandwiches and salad were fresh and delicious. The place looks like a bar but comfy and big. Service was quick and patient. \n\nAgain, bruschetta not to miss"
1,"Hands down my favorite restaurant in the valley. I typically go to the Gilbert location as I feel it's the largest but had brunch at this location on Sunday. The bruschetta is an absolute must whether you are there for dinner or weekend brunch. They have $5 mimosas and bellinis which are equally delicious, and a large wine selection. I have never had anything bad from the menu here!"
1,"This place is amazing! They have amazing food.. Love the Bruschetta plate. It's very filling and great for 2! Make it an evening, enjoy some wine, very cool place to hang out!"
1,"Great vibe, great food, great wine. Get there early."
1,;( RIP Chuy's
1,I went to see Dr Cherkuri for an initial visit. I found him to be knowledgeable and empathetic. They looked busy but not rushed. The staff was overall very friendly and seemed to want genuinely talk to you. Overall it was a good experience.
1,"Outstanding team of cardiologists here at Biltmore Cardiology! \n\nI had been experiencing some intense chest/breast pain out of nowhere. You know, just sitting on your couch, laying in bed, sitting at your desk.\n\nPretty scary when you're a youngin like me. Heck, anyone of any age, but you get the idea.\n\nMy Mom has fibrocystic breast condition (easily managed when you dial back on your caffeine consumption or eliminate it all together, no fun), and told me to hit up my OB GYN to make sure there weren't any suspicious lumps. \n\nWell, clearly a mother always knows what's up. \n\nOB GYN was almost positive the chest pain I was experiencing was related to that amazeballs fibrocystic breast condition (aww, thanks for sharing, Mom). But, as an elite level athlete, she didn't want to take any chances. \n\nOut of the office with a referral in hand to Biltmore Cardiology. Boo ... But better safe than sorry. \n\nSaw Dr. Akil Loli and Dr. Harris on my first visit. Teenage like blood pressure, normal EKG, heart sounded great. He also said some of my chest pain could be related to all the torso twisting involved with hammer throw. \n\nCaring, compassionate, respectful specialist, and very easy to talk to. He gets major points for knowing what my sport is. Usually I have to explain it as Track and Field / Hammer throwing isn't too popular in the United States.\n\nDr. Loli still wanted to go forth with an echocardiogram and stress test because of my lifestyle. Nothing like only making it to Stage 6/7 on the treadmill to make you feel like a fat athlete, no?! \n\nFront desk ladies and the testing team were stellar! \n\nHad Dr. Loli's partner, Dr. Gordon (retired, but occasionally covers for the practice) review my results. Clean as a whistle. \n\nWhat a relief!\n\nI hope I never have the need to see a cardiologist again. But if I do, I know I'm in good hands with anyone here. \n\nHighly recommended."
1,"This is a super classy Fry's! They have a Starbucks, nice floors and lighting, and a natural foods sections, which I love! Healthy and organic shopping is becoming a lot easier to do at Fry's. Great deals and savings on milk!"
1,"I've been to each of the three locations of Havana Cafe and have never been disappointed. The food is always delicious and I had the best mojitos I've ever had at Havana Cafe. \nIt can be a bit pricey, but the food is definitely worth it."
1,"One of my favorite things to do is go hike the echo canyon side of camelback and then cruise down the hill to Havana Cafe. The best mojito in Phoenix hands down no arguments please! The black bean fritters, o my holy ****! So good! Everything on the menu here is very well done. I have a good amount of Cuban food and this is one of my all time favorite spots. Good ethnic food is hard to come by in the Southwest and this place sets a good example. Heads up ladies, This place is full of Latin charm so go with your girls and your drinks will be nice and strong!"
1,"Cute little restaurant, very cramped, but I feel like that is how it should be.  On a hot day, I almost feel like I am in Cuba.  They have a diverse menu, so you are sure to find something for everyone.  This doesn't seem like the ideal place to have a dinner date, but so far I have only had hits with this place.  Everyone I've taken here has loved that food and commented on how cute the restaurant is.  Mmmm...thinking about croquettes is making me crave some Havana Cafe."
1,"OMG. If you're afraid of flavor stay away because this place has the market cornered. Papa Rellena ,one of my favorites. But my absolute top pick so far is the Gallina Frita. Its just perfect. But there is soo much to choose from. The Paella seems to be a huge hit on Friday nights when it's only $20. Oh and if you want a potent drink that will make you giggly but not sloppy. \""Pussy's Painkiller\"" Yeah.. I know..its fun just to order it."
1,"Seriously, my favorite place in the entire Valley.  Fabulous food in a casual environment.  Excellent service, great drink menu.  Every time i eat here, i rave about the food.  I usually have the Pollo Cubano.  Its simply delicious.  An entree is about $20.  And worth every penny!"
1,"When you go: try the black bean fritters with avocado dipping sauce---SOOOO GOOD...i could've eaten those for my whole lunch!\n\nThen, my friend and I shared two different dishes: \nthe Cuban sandwich (like a panini), which came with the black bean soup and a pork dish that was marinated in lime juice and spices.\n\nBoth dishes were really good! i would definitely go back, because EVERYTHING on the menu looked tasty. i wanted to try it all, but alas, my stomach and wallet are only so big."
1,"I miss this place every day.\n\nUsed to live right behind it, and took it for granted.  Simple and the yummiest.\n\nTheir Berenjena con Garbonzo is one of the most magical things I have ever put in my mouth.\n\nBlack bean fritters, ham croquettes-- everything is good.\n\nOH!  Their cocktails!!"
1,"This place was great!!! Went there last night and had a great experience. We showed up at 9pm and there was plenty of seating inside and outside on the adorable patio with lights strung up and music playing. Our server was fantastic, and he recommended the black bean fritter appetizer which was to DIE for. I would go back again just for those, with the avocado dip, they were amazing. We also had the gazpacho soup, which was good, nothing amazing but there's not a whole lot you can do with gazpacho. Also had a chicken entree that had fried plantains and beans and rice that was quite good but too big to finish. Great wine and Brazilian beer too. All in all, a great experience and we will definitely come back soon!"
1,We came for lunch. My husband had the lunch special of the jerk chicken with rice beans and a citrus slaw. It was very tasty. I had the Ropa Vieja with plantains and black beans and rice. IT was absolutely delicious. The waitress was very friendly and very attentive. Our ice teas were never less than half full and she made a point to check in frequently. We had a Groupon and everything went smoothly. We will definitely be back.
1,Great food.  Great service. Loved the mohitos...just like in Cuba.  And the Ropa Vieja is excellent.
1,"I had a Groupon and went for dinner with my boyfriend last night.  This place is amazing!  We started off with the tapas sampler, and everything on it was great.  We also ordered bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, which just melted in my mouth.  For our entree, we shared a fried chicken dish--very good and actually not too heavy.  And if course, since it's a Cuban restaurant, I had mojitos.  They were delicious, and very authentic--no Bacardi!  In addition to the great food, the service was fast and friendly.  We will definitely be going back soon!"
1,"Can't believe this place isn't better-reviewed. Have probably been here a dozen times and never had an item I didn't like. Starters are always fab -- wonderful black bean and chicken soups, kids love the plantain chips and black bean dipping sauce. I would go here just for the bacon-wrapped chorizo-stuffed dates. Meaty, salty, sweet luscious goodness? Yes, please. They do a wonderful (and HUGE) arroz con pollo, and their caribbean chicken with black beans and rice is also to die for.  Friendly service, nice location, Havana Cafe is always a winner."
1,Some of the best Cuban food I've had and very reasonably priced as well! \n\nI can never decide between the bistecs cubano or the bacaloa (salt cod)!
1,"If you're looking for a delicious Phoenix feast, head to one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley, Havana Cafe.\n\nI always try a little bit of everything when I'm at the Cuban restaurant, and when my pal and I went this week, our meal was no exception. We had more than 10 different menu items peppering our table, and we both left stuffed and happy. Like it is for me, Havana Cafe instantly became one of his favorite restaurants after one meal there.\n\nOne of the coolest things about Havana Cafe is that there are mojito making classes offered there periodically. I've attended one and loved it, and the mojitos at Havana Cafe are amazing. \n\nWhen we went to dinner this week, we got a pitcher of sangria instead of mojitos, because sangria is another one of my favorite drinks. The sangria at Havana Cafe is packed full of fruit flavor, and it's a really refreshing drink that goes well with the heat of the Cuban dishes.\n\nLet's start first with my favorite dish at Havana Cafe, the Frituras de Frijoles Negros ($5.25). They're bite-sized black bean fritters served with a cool and creamy avocado dip that is to-die-for. I love, love, love this dish and could eat it all the time.\n\nThe Maduros Fritos ($5.95) are just as amazing. They're sweet chunks of bananas that make a perfect dessert or sweet appetizer accompaniment. If you don't like eating raw bananas, you'll probably still love these.\n\nWe also had vegetable empanaditas ($6.95), mini-pies chock full of veggies. For being such little appetizer treats, they're really filling and could make a great main course for vegetarians.\n\nI also had the Potage de Frijoles Negros ($4.95 for a bowl), which is a vegetarian black bean soup that is also very hearty. It's so tasty!\n\nMy companion got the San Juan Combination ($16.95), a massive sampler plate that lets you taste seven different dishes-a Puerto Rican tamale, plantains and pork, a vegetable croquette, twice-fried plantains, peas cooked with rice and pork, fried pork and beans and rice. The dish could probably give you 2 days' worth of leftovers-and they're not gross leftovers, they're almost as good as if they'd just been served to you.\n\nBesides the phenomenal food, I love Phoenix's Havana Cafe for its intimate setting. The restaurant is comprised of a little dining room with mirrored walls, and there's also a patio. It's not quite Cuba, but the aromas and warm, welcoming atmosphere are enough to make you feel as relaxed as you would on vacation."
1,"Mmmm! Lunch for two here was great. We ordered several smaller plates and split it all. Every flavor was so unique. We devoured everything. The sun spots are tasty as well as the empanaditas and the tamale type thing wrapped in a banana leaf (I forgot the name). When we went, there was no one else there. Service was good. We ordered some desert also which was delicious. The decor isn't anything special, but it's not about that here- just the food!"
1,"I had a really great experience at the Havana Cafe.. Everybody there was super nice and the service was great... I don't think our water glasses ever got to less than 1/2 full. The food was excellent. Price-wise it was a little more than we expected, but totally worth it. The sangria and drinks were kind of pricey, but ah well. Overall a very good experience- we will be back!"
1,"JT, JT, JT....OMG...the wings will make you take flight. They are the most delicious little mouth delights. Serious ..dude should have a solid gold chicken wing out front. They are grilled to perfection, the degree of heat or flavor is right everytime. The bar is fun, fun, fun! The regulars may look you over a time or two..but hey I'm good lookin so I don't mind. lol. The tacos rock out Thursday night.  The only problem with JT's is, he's not open on Sunday for football..and that pisses me off every time I remember on hangover Sunday, that I forgot to get them on Saturday. Damnit, I hate that I have to go there twice a week.  Cuz he is open for Monday night football..oh ya.....screw  it..I'm going right now...c ya..."
1,Best wings ever!!!! There is no place that can stand near this place for wings.
1,"All I really need to say is GRILLED WINGS.... but I shall say more in detail. They have the BEST wings in town! They fry the wings, but also grill them. All the staff is VERY nice and friendly. If you go more then a few times, they will know you and know what you will be ordering! Every time I have gone to JT''s it has been busy, so that say's something about the place. So if your mouth is watering and craving wings, JT's is your spot!"
1,"Congratulations to JT's for being voted Best Neighborhood Bar Food by Phx New Times!. I'm a devoted regular at JT's and I love going there. They weren't when I started going, but the bartenders, their sig' o's, and many of the other regulars are now friends of mine. The wings are EPIC! I get the Hot wings, but sometimes I'll go Teryaki Hot and have them double dipped. Messy as hell, but so delicious. The steaks on Wednesday are always great, and Julio keeps mine nice and rare. Perfect. It's a great place to chew the fat with a friend. You can also just walk in by yourself and spark up a conversation with just about anyone there. Be careful with JT though. He is a man of few words, and if you annoy him, he'll likely say 'Fuck you, go home'. (The phrase is actually on the menu, FUGH, somewhere near 'DUH'. Anyway, just food, just booze, or both...you'll have a great time. And the bartenders are definitely easy on the eyes...just don't be creepy or they might knock you out."
1,BEST WINGS EVER!!!!  Service is slow but it's worth it!  Burgers are good too but the wings are outstanding!
1,"Jt's is a fantastic neighborhood bar. Full disclosure: I'm a regular there. This is not a fine dining establishment, but the wings are the best in town, and the rest of the nightly specials are definitely worth trying. Go in and check it out, but leave your attitude outside..we are all friends at Jt's and you will be welcomed by all. Oh, and the drinks are strong and the bartenders are awesome. Tip: don't order a frozen drink. It's not the place for it, and I don't think there is even a blender anyway. Try Applebee's instead."
1,"The BOMB, arguably the best wings in Phoenix. Jana and Julio have it on lock down.\nThe place is tiny but the food is BOSS. Worth the drive from anywhere in town."
1,"Brilliant little bar. Really friendly staff, and the food was fantastic. The wings are incredible. A must visit! I'll  be back for sure!"
1,"This Cleaners is great!  It's called Elite now, not Queens though.\nWe do our laundry here.  \nThey have a convenient drop off.  They give you a bag and you write your instructions on the tag and you never have to wait in line to drop off!\nThey are professional, on time and their work is really good too.  \nMy husband never complains about having a press mark at the bottom of his shirts like the 2.00 cleaners used to do.  \nIt is slightly more than the 2.00 cleaner, but this is close to home and we don't get attitude from the employees like at the 2.00 cleaners.  \nThe owner is usually on site and you can just tell that he cares about his customers. \nIt's right on the corner of 48th St and Indian School by the Arcadia Tavern.  They also do free pick up and delivery and if you call in advance when you're on your way they'll get your order ready and deliver to your car!  Seriously what else can you ask for?  :)"
1,"I started going to Elite Cleaners because it is so close to my house. And never dawned on me to write a review since most people go to closest dry cleaners to their house. But there yelp page seemed unloved so I took one for the team and wrote the first review. \n\nThe women who work here are super nice. They do an excellent job with both laundry and dry cleaning. And the price is not to bad for dry cleaning, I recently picked up 15 articles both dry cleaning/laundry and it was 30 bucks! And that was before my discount as a returning customer. \n\nThe only downside is that this place shares a parking lot with Arcadia Grill. Which I have never been too but based on their lack of parking and over use of valet service means lack of parking. So just dont expect to pick up your laundry durning lunch time. Though there is a drop off only parking spot, but just one. So here is hoping luck is on your side if you do try to pick it up durning lunch."
1,"I found this gem on Yelp (go figure)and have taken numerous shirts, jackets, pants, and dresses etc.to be cleaned.  This company lives up to it's name.  The staff is prompt, professional, and reliable.  The owner takes customer service very seriously and values customer loyalty.  I used the spend $30 for $50 coupon on the yelp site and redeemed it from my phone.  It was a true breeze.  The owner (I'm assuming) explained they have delivery service free of charge.  I agree witb his philosophy- dry cleaning should be hassle free.  Quality work every time, no exceptions.  Not necessarily the cheapest, but absolutely the best.  You get what you pay for.  Cheers!  \n\nOne request for the owner: please put a fan (or anything to cool) in the receiving area.  That place can get toasty for those that choose to pick up in person."
1,I have been using Elite Cleaners for over 10 years now.  I love the free pickup and delivery service!  Clothes come out great and I feel their prices are fair.
1,"My friend and I both went at the same time to the Optique Center at Tatum and Shea in Phoenix.  The store was very clean and well stocked.  (I must have tried on 100 pairs and didn't even touch 1/2 of them).\n\nThe technician was extremely friendly and thorough, as well as the doctor, and we did not wait long.  The staff was extremely solicitous, I would rarely rate a store five stars, and don't know all of them, but have been to three of their stores so far.  (I have several children).  It is good to have your paperwork done in advance.  \n\nGood job Nationwide!  Holly"
1,This is by far the best Chinese food in the valley. The pan fried noodles and sesame chicken are AWESOME!!!! I eat here at least once a week.
1,"I don't care if it's authentic or not, what's important to me is how good is it.  It is so good I find it hard to eat Chinese food anywhere else."
1,"This has got to be the best chinese in phoenix. The food is always fast and fresh. The servers are always attentive and friendly. This place is just great to go to. I normally get the chicken chow mein and my bf gets the sweet and sour chicken and both are excellent. The sweet and sour chicken isn't one of those gross fried puffballs covered in sugar, it's a real chicken breast, fried crispy and sliced. It makes such a difference. I have been coming here for years and my waiter Ed (who isn't there much anymore) always remembered us and knew what we wanted to order from memory. Now that's good service."
1,"I had driven by this place at least twice a day on my way to and from work and always thought it was one of those shady Chinese places that would end up on the news for at least three years. And then one day I had a craving for Chinese did a search for the nearest Chinese restaurant and this place popped up. The ratings were fantastic, so I thought I should give it a try. \n\nI placed an order to go, went to pick it up, parked my car and opened the door...it was an OASIS inside! I have to say, I was fooled by the outside.. The food is awesome. I usually get the Moo Shu Pork and my husband gets something new and we share. Everything is so good and, most importantly, you don't get that ill feeling (that sometimes Chinese food seems to make you feel, you know what I mean the \""I just ate a ton of grease and my day is shot\"" feeling). \n\nWe have been regulars for a couple of years now and I couldn't recommend it enough."
1,Always greeted with a SMILE (and a HUG)!  \n\nGreat Food!  Great Service!  \n\nGreat family owned restaurant that really cares about their customers. They remember their regulars by name and ask about your family members or friends.\n\nAlways fresh ingredients and no msg. Always consistently delicious!
1,"BEST Chinese!  I've been a customer for almost twenty years & they are amazing.  Restaurant is comfortable with nice atmosphere & the food is perfection!  Great prices, too.  SUPER nice staff.  NEVER had a bad meal there in nearly 20 years and Chinese is my favorite!"
1,Nothing beats Desert Jade.  They've updated their dining room and accommodate my now vegan diet.
1,Great food! I loved the Tangerine Chicken! :)
1,Pleasantly surprised! Didn't expect the light atmosphere from the outside... Great fast service... Decent price great food
1,"Food, tea, service are great!"
1,"This place has the best fried rice ever . not too dry , just perfect, I've only eaten inside once, and the workers are very nice. I order take out from here all of the time and they have fast service."
1,"This is the best American Chinese food we have had in the valley. Anytime we want great Chinese food, we drive here. It's out of the way but we'll worth the drive. Today I ordered the Peking Pork & House fried rice. My GF had the sweet & sour chicken. Each dish was amazing and worth adding to your next dining experience. The service is always exceptional. This is our favorite place for American Chinese food."
1,"Holy general Tso's ghost. How did I not discover this place before? So I was in my office and had a wicked craving for Chinese food. But the only place I knew of was Panda Express on 40th and Thomas... I'd rather eat my shoe with siracha than that panda. So I turned to the break room to see what fliers or menus were posted on the cork board... And Lo an behold ... Desert Jade. \nIt was not far at all doe my office and said what the hell I'll try it out. Drove over and liked that it was quiet and quaint. Not to over the top with typical Chinese restaurant decor... I couldn't find any Buddha statues or that annoying waving cat that you can't help but poke it's paw. It was very relaxed and cozy. \nImmediately they brought out water and hot tea... The hot tea by itself with no sugar is awsome. Not sure what kind of tea it is, green maybe or ginger, don't know don't care, it was good. \nThe lunch menu is very inexpensive and very plentiful portions. I ordered the sweet and sour pork with fried rice. It was very rich in flavor for a classic lunch time go to. The fried rice was simple and didn't have crazy extras like bamboo shoots or bean sprouts. Two hearty scoops of fried rice and an egg roll plus my swee and sowa pohkk ... Great food and very hearty portions and left with a bill less than $10 with tip. Can't get that at panda, and unlike Panda, it didn't do the express blowout 30 minutes later in the office bathroom. Great little place hidden off indian school. Will definitely be going back."
1,Great!  Our favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  Staff is extremely courteous.  Try the jade chow mien and salt and pepper pork.
1,"This place is great.  I usually get the pulpo tostadas, but everything is sooo good it's hard to decide.  It is usually packed during the lunch-time hours, especially on the weekends, so if you're in a hurry it's  probably better to go on more off-hours.  But DO go - it's clean, fresh, and delicious."
1,"I know it looks like a hole in the wall, but the food is out of this WORLD. I was introduced to this place by some co-workers who are very familiar with what good REAL Mexican food is. This is it, we have been going back religiously since... The mocajete (i think), is this bowl of seafood tomato sauce, spices and cheese that is made and served in a lava rock bowl, it is still boiling when it makes it to the table. Not only is it HOT but it is also SPIIIIIIIIICY! Delicious...."
1,"I went here because it was the closest restaurant to Discount Tire... What an awesome place, and I will go out of my way to go back! \n\nFriendly staff, clean restaurant, and outstanding food. Chips and salsa were great, and the food was delicious!\n\nThanks!"
1,"Another outstanding Phoenix find!  This place isn't much to look at but the food is fantastic.  I had the Filete Relleno de Mariscos.  It was a fish filet (tilapia I think) stuffed with octopus, shrimp, squid, and snails smothered with a spicy tomato based sauce - fabulous!  I must have looked like a Minnesotan, because when I asked the waitress about it, she warned me that it was very spicy!  I assured her that I like spicy and it was a perfect amount of heat.  My wife had fish tacos and loved em!  \n\nThey serve a salsa unlike any I've tasted.  It wasn't real tomatoey and was brown with just the right amount of spice.  I asked the waitress how it was made but her English wasn't too good and my Spanish is non-existent, so I'll never know.\n\nThe extent of seafood at most Mexican restaurants is confined to shrimp dishes.  The menu here is saturated with different seafood options.  If you like seafood Mexican style you must try Mariscos Acapulco."
1,"Wally's is fab. The decoration is like a classy den with some memorabilia and Americana, but nothing overbearing or tacky. Very casual and convenient, the bartenders are very friendly, and the place is seemingly run by people all very comfortable and familiar with each other (something I really like). Great beers on tap, some super wines, and the food is above average (lots of variety... think Village Tavern with an edge). It's popular with Arcadia residents, but is still politely tucked away, so you rarely have to worry about the crowds. They also stay open until everyone leaves, so getting a big party in late may not be a problem."
1,"Where everybody knows your name.  Very refreshing to be waited on by Wally himself, I'll come back for the we serve mostly \""regulars\"" feeling you get.  I don't think enough people know about this place but those that do come back for more.  The Cuban is my lunch of choice and the beer selection is perfect for happy hour."
1,"I have been dining at Wally's for the past several years. \n\nWally's has great food and drink served by super friendly people in a family friendly enviroment.  The prices are also very reasonable.  \n\nWally's is the Best  casual dining experience in the Valley.  \n\nYou really can't go wrong with anything on the menu but for lunch I recommend the smoked turkey sandwich or fish and chips.  For those of you that like burgers, the Wally burger is great.    For dinner the chicken parmesan is outstanding.  I also really like their chicken marcello.\n\nWally just also opened a second location in Scottsdale.  \n\nIf your lucky, you may even run into Wally."
1,Great place for really good food.  My husband and I have always enjoyed everything that we have had at Wally's\nJane Lynch
1,"God this place is good.  Stepping into their dinning room is like being with friends.  It's quaint and comfortable and the servers are always friendly.  As for the food, it is equally as enjoyable.  The mac n cheese is to die for and the fish n chips is the best I've had in the valley.  Their homemade tartar sauce is what really sets them apart. \n\nIt's a little tucked away, but quite the gem."
1,"Wally's is an upscale pub with a price tag to match but the menu is carefully thought out, well prepared and (usually) served with a smile."
1,Always delicious and usually exceptional service! Love this location and the food! I will be a repeat customer for sure. The salads are always fresh and the food is so flavorful and amazing.
1,"Went here on a work luncheon, not expecting to see a line out the door at 1:00pm on a Wednesday.  After being sat, and greeted by our server, I could see they had a great customer service protocol as we had our drinks within 2 minutes.  I followed suit with the others and ordered their wings \""Wally Style\"" and onion rings.  Usually with appetizers, it takes something pretty special to make me happy, but the wings were fantastic!  Crispy, flavorful, only the drums, and sauce on the side.  The onion rings were so good also, that I brought my girlfriend back that Friday to try their other food.  We started with the escargot, and then I had the bangers n' mash, and she had the fish & chips.  The entire meal was phenomenal, and the service was perfect.  Couldn't recommend more.  My new guilty place to go when I have time to enjoy my lunch during the week."
1,"Wow! My first trip to Wally's .... and I got to meet Wally! Neat-O! \n\nNot only is he the bees knees he was hands on. I was, quite frankly, surprised by that. But more on that in a minute!\n\nTo frame my experience, I popped in on a Tuesday night during the dinner rush. One of our friends had hopped on over ASAP to nab a table. (Apparently this place is hopping. She was spot on!)\n\nIt's a really cute place that is friendly to all sorts of different folks. \n\nIf you want to watch the game? Sure! TV at the bar. \nFeel like eating at the bar? Yep!\nCasual dining? Absolutely.\nDinner date (where you want to impress)? YES. \n\nI was (not on a date) but did see a number of couples engaged in serious conversation over wine. It's not too loud of a place (at least on a Tuesday night) to foster intimate conversation. \n\nFor dinner I followed the menu's guidance (and then asked Wally himself). Chicken Vesuvius is w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l! Chicken medallions, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, 'cider' smoked bacon (HOH MY) with plenty of herbs and spices. My meal was served with a hearty portion of salad and (HOH MY) horse radish mashed potatoes.\n\n1) The chicken was cooked to perfection. Not a hint of dryness!\n2) The chicken wasn't bathed in oil. That sounds like a terrible way to describe it, but, I didn't feel like I was tossing a gym session out the window. \n\nThat being said, note that portions are on the very [very] generous side. I took 2/3rd of it home.\n\nRight. So about Wally, the impeccable service and a delightful experience... Let's see...Our server described the specials with such delight that I only wished I was going off menu. But no! I wanted something \""regular\"" on the menu. Wally was incredibly helpful in helping this first timer navigate the full menu. (Alas, the house was out of the nightly special of ribs.) Wally has a comedic sense of timing. Watch out!\n\nOk, so what's the deal with Wally's fantastic beard? Were you thinking Ernest Hemingway? Why yes! In fact, Wally and his son enter a contest every year for the best E. Hemingway beard in FL. \n\n[Drum Roll] They are 2013 crowned winners!\n\nThis is a great spot if you're popping in to AJ's. Loved it!"
1,Best place in town for Friday night Prime Rib!
1,"While visiting Phoenix we happened upon this place and were pleasantly surprised at how good the burgers tasted!  \n\nIt was a nice evening so we sat outside (coming from the snow we had this winter, sitting outside was something I didn't think would ever happen again).  \n\nThe menu was pretty extensive, I think anyone in your party should be able to find something to please them.  Usually I would expect with such a large menu the food would be just okay.  But not this place, at least not as far as the burgers.\n\nI ordered the buttons and bleu burger and my boyfriend ordered bacon cheddar burger.  We both ordered our burgers medium rare and they were cooked perfectly!  There was a ton of mushrooms and bleu cheese on mine and lots of bacon and cheddar on his.  So much so, that he was able to share some bacon with me.  \n\nThe burgers came with a mixture of regular fries and sweet potato fries (my favorite).  I loved the idea of mixing them so you don't have to decide on one or the other.  \n\nOverall, the food was delicious, the prices were fair (especially for amount of food) and outside sitting was perfect!  If ever in Phoenix again, I will definitely go back to this place."
1,"I've been to Taylor's Cafe on several occasions... both for breakfast and for lunch.  Breakfast is served all day, and there is plenty to choose from.  As Shannon wrote, there is a variety of healthy options including several veggie omelettes and design-your-own as well.  \nServers are consistently friendly and even when the restaurant is crowded, I've never had to wait too long on my food... \nTaylor's is good for groups but it works for solo diners as well... guys may think it is a little bit 'fru-fru' but they will not complain when their food arrives - indoor and outdoor seating available.  My next visit will be one night for dinner - i think they have live music from time-to-time."
1,Love this breakfast place!  My fav place for breakfast.  I can bring puppy and sit on outside patio. Love the healthy omelet options.  The crapes are DELISH. French toast and buttermilk pancake DELISH!! Excellent Menu with several great options for vegetarians. Full five star in my book!!!\nCozy comfy atmosphere- always run into the kindest people dinning here as well.
1,"I am amazed!\nI wear heels...all the time. \nI fall in love with certain pairs and inevitability need to have the tips of my stilettos replaced. I had been putting it off, because I thought I would be without my favorite pairs for a few days. I called The Shoe Shop. They were so friendly and said if I can in before 2pm they could fix my shoes while I waited. What???\nI got there about 1:30 and (having a blonde moment) was wearing one of the pairs i needed fixed. The gal took the shoes I was wearing and the other pair to the back, where the magic happens. She came back seriously 2 minutes later with perfectly repaired heels. I could not believe it! The cost was $12.50 per pair, quite a deal when they are done this fast!\n\nI am a forever customer, it was a perfect experience!"
1,"I know it gets a lot of bad reviews, but since I've been going to this place since I was a kid, and sweet and sour pork is my favorite \""Chinese\"" dish, I'm giving it 5 stars. I remember as a kid, all of the Chinese food buffets had a thin sweet and sour sauce on crispy bits of breaded fried pork, but every other buffet I go to now has a very thick, overly sweet sauce. It's not a desert, it shouldn't be so sweet, and Golden Coin has been making this dish the same for so long, it's an absolutely perfect blend of sweet and sour. No they don't have a big selection, but it's better to make a few great items than to make 1000 mediocre items."
1,Thank you Doctor Romine! She pays extremely close attention to my personal needs and concerns. I have been to numerous doctors and found her practice the most reliable. She even called me the evening after my appointment to check in on me. Very well run and trustworthy office.
1,"Wonderful place that will be honest with you and talk with you about ALL your choices  unlike other clinic who only want you to do what what best benefits their bottom line. Don't go into other clinics where their \""counseling\"" is just a sales pitch! Highly recommend this place! I love my son so much and would be lost without him, never have I ever regretted my decision to give birth to him."
1,"Excellent customer service! The owner personally went above and beyond for our needs, and we were \""wowed\"" by their amazing service. We are customers for life!"
1,"I love this place! The staff are courteous and knowledgable. I am typical man that has no sense of taste on flowers, what to send per occasion, etc... Pam was there when I needed her. On a Saturday I had two close relatives in the hospital, one gave birth, the other hanging on. What can I say, but a big Thank You to Fresh Cut Romance. I appreciate your help."
1,"Dive bars, mmmm good. Wood paneling and cheap drinks, 3 bucks for gin and tonics and most other mixed drinks. A shuffleboard game, Golden cup video golf game, darts and a good jukebox.   As far as dives go this place is a hidden gem."
1,"I have had dogs my whole life and have been to many different Vets around Scottsdale and Phoenix. I got a new puppy in July and a friend recommended Dr. Bracken so highly that I decided to go instead of taking her to my regular vet. I signed her up on the puppy plan which is great when you have a new puppy. It includes all shots, nail trimmings, visits and a discount on spaying. Dr. Bracken is the sweetest, most caring vet I have ever been to, he takes time to teach you puppy training and answers any and all questions you may have.  I have since taken my two other dogs and transferred their medical records to his office. You can tell on your first visit that Dr. Bracken's office is very busy but he is worth the wait. He loves dogs just as much as you do and isn't driven by the all mighty dollar that so many other vets exude. I would trust his honest, straight forward opinion over any one else!!!!!! I normally don't write that many reviews but if you love your dogs as much as I do, you'd taken them here!"
1,"Those who have cats and love them as much as I do, know that it can be difficult to find a veterinarian who is good with them. The reviews written by Teri B. and Sarah K. helped me to make up my mind and give this clinic a try since I was looking for the vet who was on the holistic side and really good with cats. And so far I haven't been disappointed. Dr. Bracken is very knowledgeable and progressive, and just like other reviews say - very kind, attentive to your pet, generous with his time and doesn't try to run the bill or prescribe/do any unnecessary procedures. The day before we went there I read somewhere online that a good veterinarian, before going straight to the exam, will try to interact with your pet, and that's exactly what Dr. Bracken did, even before he introduced himself to us! I have a Bengal and Dr. Bracken already knew what to expect of him, it was obvious he was familiar with the breed. But what is more important, my cat, who usually goes crazy at the vet's office, headbutted him marking him as his friend. He also asked me to tell him about my cat which had never happened before at other veterinarians' offices. \nWhen I told him my cat was on a BARF diet (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food) he didn't roll his eyes and didn't try to convince me that it was dangerous or inappropriate as I've read most veterinarians do. Actually, after talking a little more to him about it, I found out that he had done some reading on this topic and sees positive results. He even accepted \""An open letter to veterinary professionals\"" that I had printed out for him, which appeals to veterinarians to stop endorsing dry kibble and supporting pet food companies that have only one goal - profit and not our pets' health, and instead to learn more about ALL diets so they could help us to make better choices for our pets when it comes to their nutrition. He didn't try to push any vaccines (we were there for an annual exam) either.  To sum it up, the exam was not as stressful for my cat (which means for me as well) as usual, my cat likes his new doctor and I trust him. The only negative - you may have to schedule the appointment way ahead of time, especially if the only day you can go is Saturday. We had to wait about 2 or 3 weeks, but I say it's worth it."
1,"Do you ever meet someone and it just clicks that they are in exactly the right profession, doing exactly what they were put on this earth to do? That's Dr. Bracken. We've been going to Arcadia with our pets ever since I was a little girl and now I take my own family pet there. I can't say enough good things about the kindness, love and warmth that Dr. Bracken shows each pet. He talks to them a little before taking them back to take care of them and immediately puts both my dog and me at ease. He's gone above and beyond his job description in so many ways, from taking a sick pet home with him to care for, to calling long after his office hours to give veterinary advice when I was frantic and needed an answer, I could never thank him enough."
1,Dr. Bracken and his staff are top notch! They actually care about you and your pets. They worked with me and my husband to get our puppies in on time for their 9 week shots even though the schedule was full. Such a great team of knowledgable people!!
1,"Dr Bracken is by far the most hard working, compassionate and understanding veterinarian out there. I was recommended to him by not 1 but THREE separate friends after my dog was hit by a car. My dog, Maeby, is a rescue dog and the light of my life. Seeing her get hit by a car was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life followed by a very stressful few months. I initially rushed her to an Emergency Clinic in Glendale who was available at night. I was terrified by their service. $400 dollars later I took her home with pain medication, some antibiotics and a 3 day internal bleeding watch. The next day I woke up to pooling blood coming from her undercarriage and once she finally let's me take a look I notice a HUGE gash that had completely been overlooked at least 4-5 inches on the underside of her tail. I took her back to find out her tail was broken and needed to be amputated. So now I'm on my second visit and the vet that comes out says that \""these things happen\"" and \""can easily be overlooked\"" Excuse me? She's a 13 pound dog. For that price and for being hit by a car I don't think I'm out of left field in expecting you look at the entire dog. \nUltimately he tells me her tail needs to be amputated and it would cost $1400 but did not want to \""steal my thunder\""..this was a problem as I didn't have that kind of money up front and had already spent a few hundred. I pay for the x rays of the tail they overlooked, the sutures and for additional pain medication-- about another 300 dollars. \n\nI was hysterical. My friends recommended getting a second opinion and this is when my god send, Dr Bracken came into play. He agreed to see Maeby the next morning- somehow he was able to make out what I was saying through my high intensity gurgle cries. She stayed intermittently with Dr Bracken and staff for a month getting her tail sutures checked and rebandaged; checking her hemmoraging and cuts and bumps. We were going twice a week which was extremely overwhelming in it's own. Some days I just had to get to work and they would watch her the whole day for me. Dr Bracken understood my financial concern and the love (understatement) I have for my dog. They worked with me and never made me feel anything less than welcome and at home regardless of my hysterics every single visit. \n\nThe whole staff has a deep love for animals and understands how much yours means to you. They will give you nothing but straight answers, 100% of their attention and fantastic service. I think half of them are also human psychologists. \n\nMaeby ended up losing most of her tail through the process but Dr  Bracken never lost sight of my concerns for her and would call me personally with check ups. She is now back to her normal puppy antics and happy as ever wagging her little nub every minute of the day. \n\nWe will come here for life and I constantly rave about this place. You won't find a better vet anywhere in Phoenix."
1,"I usually don't like to review chain restaurants but I have loved El Pollo Loco since birth! I feel like this is a great alternative to eating fried chicken. I find myself able to eat a full meal with out the guilt that comes with eating McDonalds or Popeyes or any other fast food. If I'm in the mood for something super healthy, which I haven't been in a while lol, I'll go for their humongous chicken tostadas. The whole thing is delicious including the taco shell bowl that it comes in. Their chicken is just amazing. You can taste that it is freshly grilled after marinating forever. Even though it is fast food, it doesn't taste like it! On the more regular occasion we usually opt for the family meal that comes with 8 pieces of chicken, 2 large sides, a salad and dessert for about $20. Macaroni and cheese is my side of choice; super cheesy (probably not healthy). We get some flour tortillas and make little tacos with the chicken, salsa and rice (Eric likes to put Mac n cheese in too). Even if its just the two of us, I love taking the leftovers to work for lunch. I love their salsa, so much that we can never go through the drive thru bc I have no shame and need about 15 salsas :). El Pollo Loco is my fast food of choice!\nP.s. the staff is super nice, they messed up on our order and took care of our next meal!"
1,"Great neighborhood sports bar!! Price is right, lots of drink specials. If you like playing pool or darts this place is for you."
1,"After reading the reviews on this site, I was a little leery about trying this restaurant.  However, my friend had a gift certificate for $50 and was looking forward to  having a nice Italian meal.  \n\nWe had a 6:30 reservation and was promptly greeted and seated.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and was patient in answering our questions about the various menu items.  \nFor starters we had the artichoke hearts stuffed with seafood drizzled with a Vodka sauce (mmm Yummy!) Just the right amount of garlic but not so much to overpower the delicate seafood mixture.\n\nWe decided to skip the salad and went straight for our entrees:  P had the seafood creps (again, in a Vodka sauce with pistachios.)  I opted for the halibut.  The halibut presentation looked like a Picasso artwork and the halibut steak was the lightest and flakiest I have ever had in my life. Sauteed in seasoned olive oil and italian bread crumbs with three circles on the side of the plate consisting of pureed green pepper drizzled with red pepper sauce. ( Isabella, owner and chef , cheerfully shared her recipe with me but I don't think it would ever come close to how she prepared this awesome fish) She told us that she purchases most of her produce from local growers as well as her meat.  She is a proponent of the \""Slow Food Movement\"" and understands the importance of supporting local growers and businesses.\n\nFor dessert we shared  freshly made 3 cheese cake with mix of fresh berries - it was light and oh so delicious. The homemade Tirmasu -light with perfect layers of sponge cake soaked in coffee liqueur combined with sweet whipped cream, mascarpone cheese, coffee, cinnamon and cocoa powder was also divine\nThe wine list was small but original (not your typical run of the mill or popular California wines) and the cappuccino was excellent.\nService was not too slow nor rushed.  The menu also has a couple of gluten free dishes\nThe only slight negative was the bus person who seemed to have an ongoing tiff with our waiter.  This was more amusing than anything else. \n Most of the tables are rather close together which is probably not conducive to a confidential conversation. A couple of the tables at the entrance seemed a little more private.  However,  we met  some very nice and interesting fellow diners which made our dining experience even more special.\nIsabella occasionally makes homemade cookies and instead of mints with our bill we got to sample her chocolate almond cookies that she had made fresh that afternoon. \n\nI am sorry that some of the Yelpers had a bad experience here in the past because the experience we had was totally opposite  Perhaps Isabella read their reviews and decided to make some changes???)\nAnyway, we defintiely will be back to try some of their other tempting dishes and to chat with Isabella again.  Ciao!"
1,"this is perhaps the best italian food in Az. We have been going there for about 10 yrs and always recommend this place to all our clients. Best food, which is all homemade best service. This place never disappoints us. We recommend this place to our  clients and the feedback is thank you for the best food experience we have had."
1,"Great food in a very homey location. Set up as a cute local family style place, we tested it with my well behaved 3year old grandson. Most of the other diners were our age and enjoyed the young enthusiastic Italian eater. The staff went out of their way to show him a good time. \nAs for the food, excellent homemade pasta with a very delicious sauce. Meatballs were light and tasty, ravioli were homemade ade delicious. I had the veal parm which was great. \nIf you are in town for a meeting, give it a try"
1,Probably the best Italian food I have had so far the in the valley. Our waiter was very friendly as well. This is more of a spot to bring your significant other then a group full of kids.
1,"This place is the best! It is very traditional inside, like a family home. It is family run and you can taste it! Food is excellent, really excellent. I had the gnocchi, a salad, and tiramisu. All delicious, savory, buttery, the kind of food you think about later. Personal service. We went here on a date night and it was great from the wine at the beginning to the dessert and coffee at the end. You really want to spread out your meal and enjoy."
1,"Best Italian in Phoenix. The pepper steak is just like grandma used to make. Best diablo sauce i've ever had outside of Italy, but very spicy. Service is not the best so dont go in a hurry."
1,"I took the White Knight (my Rav4) here on a Wednesday and got the $8.99 wash and interior vacuum. My only complaint is that they neglected to clean the bottom edge (under the doors) all around. I got home and had to wipe off the tar myself. Everything else went smoothly...fast service, little waiting, car (most of it) clean and shiney.\n\nThursday night it rained and the White Knight was a mess again. I brought \""him\"" back in and they rewashed and vacuumed at no charge because they have a 48 hour rain/rewash policy. I love that!\n\nI'll be back."
1,Arcadia cleaners was able to fix a disaster - last week my son's fiance pulled her wedding dress out of their car after traveling from Kansas to find it covered in green candle wax - I brought it right in to Arcadia cleaners and within 3 hours they called to say it was white again. We are all so thankful!!!! I'm telling everyone about how they saved the day!!
1,"Ah, the little things I miss about living in Arizona.  For instance, the Chicago Hamburger Co.\n\nWhat a gem.  You'd drive right past this place without blinking an eye, just another dive place branding itself  \""Chicago\"" or \""New York\"".  NOT!\n\nThis is the best slider I've ever had.  Holy crap they are good.  Reminders of White Castle and Krystal burgers, except these are better.  In other words, it doesn't have to be 4am while trashed to make them taste great.\n\nThe fries???  PERFECTION.  That right combo of crispy on the outside, yet nice and soft on the inside, not overcooked, not undercooked.  The perfect fry.  It's beautiful.  It's art.\n\nWhere is Dorothy's slippers???  There's no place like home...there's no place like home..."
1,"I've been here dozens and DOZENS of times over the last 25 years.  5 stars without a doubt.\n\nStandouts are the Italian beef with \""lots o hot\"".  Their cheese fries are absolute perfection...  here's why.  Put fries in a basket, smother them with cheese sauce, put another hand full of fries in basket, SMOTHER AGAIN WITH CHEESE SAUCE.\n\nWhen you are done with these cheese fries you are looking for more fries for the cheese, not more cheese for the fries.\n\nThen, when you walk out, school girls and boys break into song and birds start chirping.\n\nOh, I have to mention the cheese steak.  I don't like the standard way they do it (beef, onions, cheese) BUT if you ask for it \""Philly Style\"" they do it with their cheese sauce that they add extra cheddar cheese to.\n\nYum yum yum."
1,"I live right down the street and this is one of the best places to swing by (off hours are the best because it's not as busy) and just pick up a bag of sliders to chow down on.  Hadn't heard about the \""Philly style\"" cheesesteak; I'm going to have to try that out soon!"
1,"One of my Arcadia faves. Their sliders are great and so are the burgers, when I'm not in the mood for a burger their Chicago dogs are awesome (fully loaded w/all the fixings). Their french fries are my favorite, I always ask for them well done so they come out extra crispy. They also have fantastic malteds."
1,"This place reminds me of every neighborhood wiener joint and Chicagie Dinerette I have ever been to in Chicago.  The Chicago street signs, team schwag, and general Chicago schwag, the old school arcade games, simple booths - this could be anyone's Uncle Stanley's joint in Chicago! \n\nThe food is as expected - real Vienna Hotdogs, on the right buns, with seasoning, and the loud green relish.  Deep fried, tasty veggies like mushrooms and zucchini, and damn good, old school sliders that would slap the towers off of white castle.  It is quite the place for anyone missing the divey wiener huts of Chicago or trying to recapture some childhood memories for those aged 25-45. \n\nThe ambiance just makes the food so much better."
1,"Words cannot describe how amazing this place is, although I will try.\n\nThis is one of my favorite restaurants. I'm originally from Chicago and this is the only restaurant I've found in Phoenix with REAL Chicago style food. My favorite dish are the cheese fries. This is the only place in Phoenix I've been able to find Chicago-style cheese sauce, not that fake Velveeta stuff. My fiance swears by their chili dogs and sliders, saying they are amazing.\n\nTo make matters even better, they are ridiculously cheap. My fiance and I will go and barely go over $10 for the both of us. I definitely recommend going. If you are a native Chicagoan, its mandatory."
1,"My sister lives in Arizona and every time I come for a visit, we have to stop by this place. This place has THE best sliders. Better than White Castle!!! Not only are their sliders AMAZING, everything else is also. Their fries, veggie burgers, and milkshakes are all great and their onion rings are straight up TO DIE FOR. I prefer a chocolate  shake with my savory food. \nThey have outdoor seating which is nice if you want to take a pet, which I happened to bring a few visits ago. Their seating inside is pretty comfortable as well. The tables aren't crowding each other and the memorabilia all over the walls is interesting to look at."
1,"I lived in the valley from 1999 to 2004 and now get back to Phoenix every few years, wife had not been back n 10 years. First stop of the plane is to head here and order a 'Beef' and Chicago Dog. Hands Down the best outside of Chicago. Have seen some people complain about the prices but hey, its a small business and it costs money to get the original supplies and such. The Dogs were overflowing and the beef was great too. Nt the worlds most impressive, physically but the best does not have to change much. Good job Bob, see you next year :)"
1,"This place rocks! It's as close as you're gonna get to a WC this side of the Mississippi and in my opinion its much better!\n\nThe sliders are perfectly cooked with all the fixings, taste amazing, and bring that mid-west experience of sitting at the slider joint trying to eat 2 dozen at a time. I wish I could tell you more about the other menu items, other than their fantastic homemade milkshakes, but every time I get here its a toss-up on the single or double cheese sliders.\n\nIt's a Chi-Town sports themed sit-down type place with old-school booths and a hometown feel.\n\nThe only negative I have on this place is parking, but I usually get there early to avoid the rush, you can park on the side street too.\n\nIt takes every ounce of restraint not to stop here when I drive past, do yourself a favor and stop in."
1,This place is capital A Authetic. I guess you could call it the cats meow. The second you walk in from your buisy work day you feel welcomed by the aroma of burger. The owner Bob is a great guy just ask him for the catch of the day. Always blows me away just like the windy city. Gotta love this place!
1,Perfect place to come to for burgers and dogs! Especially if you're from Chicago and miss White Castle ;) they definitely makeup for it with their excellent sliders
1,"I love this place every Wednesday is lady's day which means $5.00 off your oil change, plus they wash the windows and vacuum the car AND they are normally done if less than 15 minutes. They also have a free fountain machine so load up on Diet Coke while you wait...it makes getting your oil changed not so bad!"
1,"Awesome!   I got my oil changed and tires rotated in about 15 minutes.  The prices are totally reasonable.  The guys were friendly and approachable.  I felt completely comfortable there the entire time.  At the end, he went through everything they checked in my car, told me which fluids were fine, which ones they topped off, and which filters were dirty and needed to be changed.  Over all, a fantastic, quick, and easy visit.  I will definitely be back and I highly recommend this place!  :-)"
1,"I'm relatively new to town and was searching for a great spot to get an oil change. After reading reviews and calling a couple places to inquire about pricing, I selected Avis Lubrication.\n\nWhen I arrived, a friendly gentleman met me at my car and asked if I had ever visited the shop. He then asked me a few simple questions about myself (name, address, etc.) and my car (year, make, etc.) Within five minutes, my vehicle was being pulled into the bay and being worked on. I found this impressive considering there were two cars ahead of me. While one employee changed the oil, another was washing the windows and checking the tire pressure. \n\nAfter my experience at Avis Lubrication, I can definitely say I'll be back. These guys are courteous, prompt and efficient. Within twenty minutes of pulling up (and paying less than I was quoted at other highly reviewed spots), I was on my way. Thank you, Avis!"
1,"I happened upon Avis on accident and it was the best! I just happened to find them as soon as my Change Oil light came on. I was just going home from work, spotted Avis, and turned in. Wednesdays ladies get $5 off any service (a nice surprise at checkout), free coffee and fountain sodas, and Top Gear on the TV (not news or midday talk shows, thank god). I was done in about 15 minutes and no one came to up sell me on air filters or \""special oil\"". They even wiped down my windshield. I will go back when I need an oil change in September."
1,"Love Baker's Nursery!  I bought some rosebushes from them last year, and they are doing really well.  \n\nI just went there yesterday for a free talk on the care and pruning of roses.  They had gift certificates taped under some chairs, and I won a free 5 gallon rosebush!  \n\nThe staff is very knowledgeable, and their selection of plants is excellent!  So much better than Lowe's or Home Depot."
1,"I have found the Garden of Eden , a place so wonderful that it inspires dreams, hopes and desires. When driving to Baker I began being fearful that once more I would be let down by a garden shop. So many times I have opened my heart to others but they have let me down. Some are out of state, some are too commercial and some really are about big business . But Baker isn't like that . From the time I pulled up I felt at home and loved.. the  old signage  giving me the vintage vibe, nice. Lots of space  and stuff to look at , a Potpourri of Pottage even. The variety of herbs and veggies alone were enough to make my heart purr. The  plants  were lined up neatly  in rows that screamed  we are cared for but not over watered and ignored.We are plants that won't get home and die from some  a mystery interloper who we brought into your garden . The grounds , employees , plants and set up all seem to express : We Too Love Gardens just Like You!\nI was so pleased to find my new partner in living green  , oh happy day ."
1,"Best variety of fruit / pit / exotic trees, with (hopefully) appropriate chill hours for our region."
1,"I've recently started a garden using pots in my apartment patio. Trips to Home Depot and Lowes leaved me wanting more. They had all the basics, but I wanted something more exotic like a grapevine. Oddly enough, another customer at Home Depot recommended Baker Nursery. Home Depot and Lowes has just lost a customer.\n\nThe selection is crazy. They have everything you could want at relatively decent prices. There seems to be plenty of knowledgeable employees, but they're always busy with other customers. I didn't have a problem with that because it gave me a chance to tour the grounds. The one question I did have was answered by the woman at the check out counter. She pointed me in the direction of the grapevines and gave me tips on care for them.\n\nBaker Nursery is now my place to go for all my gardening needs."
1,"I love Baker Nursery! Their selection of plants is superb and the plants always look fresh. The staff is always very nice and helpful. And I love the atmosphere...sounds weird for a nursery, but it is very homey. It is as if you are walking into somebody's back yard...which is almost true. I believe that the house next door is the owner's property.\n\nI remember my mother bringing me here as a child - I always had so much fun there. She brought me here because she also used to go there as a child! Baker's has been around for so long and is a wonderful family business. You should go check it out!"
1,love bakers. super friendly and knowledge staff. great selection of plants and trees... always a relaxing trip to this nursery!
1,Very helpful & knowledgeable staff. Bought a lime tree and they have helped me keep it alive by answering my questions over the phone months after I bought it there!
1,"Bakers is the best from plants to those concrete gnomey kind of things that can inhabit your lawn and garden.  I have been going to Bakers for about 54 years.  When I was a little child I went with my mother, a woman who could literally grow anything and did, in the AZ heat.  The result I have seen just about any situation you can think of being dealt with using Bakers, successfully most of the time.  Truthfully, I have always had such a good experience here that anytime I have used anyone else, I end up returning.  They just can't be beat.  They answer your questions nicely about their tremendous supply of just about anything at any given time.  If your desire to garden never goes past house plants, they are just as much for you. They won't lie to you about what they sell. Don't expect to go home  from Bakers with what you planned on.  It will usually be more."
1,"A local favorite.  Baker family owned.  Anything you need to know, they grow.  If you wonder if a plant grows in full sun, that's where they stock.  Amazing selection of plants and trees.  5 star staff.  I have brought in a plant clipping and they will tell you EXACTLY what you have.  6 stars if possible for this place."
1,Such a great nursery. I've been here twice. The staff is very eager to help. I love all the plant varieties they have.
1,"They are closing in December 2014. I can't believe it! The helpful advice, the nice people, the rose experts...all will be lost."
1,This is an incredible place! I saw no reason to add my\ncomplements but in reading a review learned they close December 2014. I am in accord that it will be a terrible loss. This is a  :T H  A  N  K   Y O U!
1,I found out Bakers is closing the last day of December this year.  I can't imagine taking care of my house and backyard without them.  No very often can I truly say that the closing of a business is a real loss.  This is!  This has always been a a ten star place!
1,They have the friendliest staff around. I hope they stay the same under the new ownership!!!!!\n\nGood luck guys...
1,"Two times eating here and two times leaving very satisfied. The pad Thai is perhaps the best I've had in Phoenix. The panang curry was nothing short of addictive. The mango w/sticky rice was a delicious end to the first meal there. \n\nI believe they've been in business 30+ years making them the oldest Thai place still in operation. \n\nThe service has been friendly, the location clean, so I will certainly be back!"
1,Great service from Sherry! She helped me out a lot with finding the right matress for my daughters new loft bed and I got a great deal!!!
1,Owner was cool. They had a humidor. Good stuff! Fine cigars! Late night tip. Great spot found on my yelp app.
1,5 STARS..I cannot switch the stars in my precious review but I give them 5 stars:) The staff is amazing and very loving:)
1,"I really like this vet clinic. I've tried a few others in the area and Blue Cross is by far the standout.  The facility looks very new to me and is impeccably clean.  It has separate entrances and waiting areas for cats and dogs to minimize the trauma, which is a nice touch.  I have found the vets here to be extremely responsive and kind.  And they put up with my maniac cat that just HATES going to the vet.  You've seen cartoons of the Tasmanian Devil, right?  That's my cat at any vet clinic."
1,"I live in Gilbert and drive to Scottsdale for Dr. Dutton, that says a lot. She understands people who have financial situations and does not push unnecessary treatments and provides other options. \n\nOne quick story to show why I love her so much: My female rottie came down with a rare blood disorder. When I brought her in during the day because of her 1st symptoms all the needed tests were run and we had to wait for the results. I brought my dog home and later that night her nose started bleeding. Around 7pm I called their office, totally expecting them to be gone for the night and for me to be transferred to the ER Clinic, but one of the other vets answered. I explained I had seen Dr. Dutton earlier that day and what was going on. She told me she would try to get ahold of Dr. Dutton, 10 minutes later Dr. Dutton called me from her home. She told me to bring my dog and she would meet me at her office. I have never heard of a vet willing to come back into the office, or even calling you from their home! I highly recommend her and know several friends who also use her! \n\nI have also taken my dogs in and they were seen by the other vets on staff when Dr. Dutton wasn't available, they have all been great."
1,I have been  using Blue Cross Animal Hospital for more than 30 years.  You will not find a better facility in the Phoenix area.  The staff is informed and caring and the doctors can't be beat!  If there were 10 stars available they would get them from me!
1,"I had been going to Blue Cross since I adopted my wonderful soulmate, Amelia, in 2003. Blue Cross was her clinic when she was with AZ Rescue, so I figure, why change?!  Amelia was an indoor cat, so she only saw the vet through the years when updated vaccinations were necessary.  Dr Ryan was her primary vet, but she has seen other doctors at the clinic without any issues. Regarding the waiting at Blue Cross, it has never been an issue for me. I love this place!  Now more than ever!\n\nWe also adopted another cat 2 years ago, that also attends Blue Cross. We drive from North Phoenix down to 36th St and Indian School for the amazing service of Blue Cross and Dr Ryan. Simply AMAZING!\n\nOver 6 months ago, my beautiful Amelia developed a mammory tumor. I was devasted. Dr Ryan was so thorough and understanding. We all decided that surgery was best and proceeded to remove the tumor.  Amelia was in excellent health and worries were not necessary.......until.........during her recovery a couple weeks later, she develped CRF (chronic renal failure). Again, beyond devastated!\n\nAmelia was hospitalized for a week at Blue Cross. I was able to visit her everyday and Dr Ryan ALWAYS kept me up to date on what was happening. Even when I would call multiple times a day, not one staff member was annoyed with me.  Everyone was EXCELLENT!  Amelia was the resident sick kitty at the time and they all participated in her recovery. We almost lost her right then and there, but she bounced back with decent blood results and was able to go home.\n\nShe was on constant fluids (everyday), medication and visited Dr Ryan often for the past 6 months. In the end, she weighed only 4 lbs, but fought the most incredible fight. Dr Ryan did EVERYTHING possible for Amelia. However, Amelia lost her fight on 10/2/12 and I have never been so heartbroken.  Dr Ryan and her staff have been INCREDIBLE. She guided me though the \""putting to sleep\"" process and continually explained everything to me through my sobs.  She even cried herself.\n\nDr Ryan, I dont know if you read these, but I couldnt have made it through the past 6 months without you.  I appreciate you more than words can ever explain.\n\nThank you!  You are my vet for life! I will see you soon!"
1,"Boyfriend and I had a great experience here. My co-worker recommended these guys and the Yelp reviews confirmed it was a good decision. \n\nPoor Milly Mutt had a rash on her belly and was acting weird and not as spunky as normal. We found out she had an allergic reaction to something and had a parasite. They gave her a shot on spot and gave us the results of the poo test a day later saying they already had her prescription ready for us. \n\nEveryone there loved Milly, as I am sure they love every animal that walks through the doors. Boyfriend met with the doctor and said he was nice and great with the pups.\n\nWhen I called to make the appointment, the woman I spoke with was so kind and excited to meet Milly and you could tell she was an all around animal person which made me happy.\n\nI plan on taking our two cats here to get shots and get their chips updated and taking Milly Mutt back here for a chip and any checkups/emergencies. Its great to finally have a relationship with a vet in the area."
1,"Five years ago, my husband and I moved to Phoenix. We needed to find a new vet for our cats, and did not know a soul. So, I turned to the internet and chose one based on Yelp reviews. That's how I ended up at Blue Cross Veterinary Clinic.  Blue Cross is about twenty minutes from my house, without traffic (I live in Laveen). Sure, there more than a few vets between my house and Blue Cross, but I have never felt like looking for a new vets. That is really saying a lot, because we have three cats. Cats do not like car rides, especially long ones!! Still, I love the care my babies get from all the doctors and staff there. I have nothing but an awesome experience with ever doctor there, but Dr. Mulla is my favorite. Like I already mentioned, all the doctors there are great and caring, but something about Dr. Mulla really puts me at ease. I adore my fur babies and would not want to take them anywhere else."
1,This place from phone call to service. The guy on the phone explained everything which actually sealed the deal. I was going to search around but after he gave his shpeal it was done. My air quality improved exponentially and I recommended to my friends.
1,Ok so my neighbor had a little fire and well the smoke came into my place and I had smoke damage. I was living out of hotels and my mom's house for 4 months trying to get someone to clean up the soot. I had initially called Top Hatter when this started but for some reason I passed them over. 4 months later I called again and scheduled something with Steve. I was very impressed because I let Steve know my situation and he got me the best deal on everything I needed done. These guys did an amazing job and we're just so professional. They cleaned up before they left and even impressed my parents who both now want services done. You should absolutely call these guys if you need your ducts cleaned. Please tell them I sent you.
1,"I struck gold...twice!\n\nAre you one of those people who has a fear of the dentist's chair? Well, this is the place for you!\n\nI'm originally from out of state and refused to see a local dentist, opting to wait for visits \""back home\"" where I could be seen by my favorite dentist to whom I've been very loyal. He was very skilled and we had a great rapport.\n\nThe day finally came when I couldn't wait for that trip back home due to the lifetime supply of plaque in my teeth. A friend recommended Dr. Choules' office because  of the reputation for getting patients out of the chair in time to get to work early in the morning. I had no idea what I'd also find was skilled, friendly, personable service to rival what I left behind back home.\n\nEveryone --- from the front office to the hygienists to the dentists --- have provided professional, sensitive service with a smile. Melissa, in particular, has been a joy to have as my hygienist. We never seem to lack for things to chat about --- which is a challenge when you're having your teeth cleaned! You'll never feel nervous or uncomfortable in her care. She's the most thoughtful, gentle and considerate hygienist anyone could ask for. I hope someone's reading this and giving her a big, fat raise!\n\nSo, if you're shopping around for dental care, do yourself a favor and make an appointment here. You won't be disappointed. Oh, and the $50 take home bleaching kit offer with a Yelp check in can't be beat! :D"
1,"I've been coming here since I got my braces on 15 years ago and have recommended it to many people. The staff is so friendly and the dental hygienists do a great job. I've had all sorts of dental work here and they have made every experience a positive one. They listen and answer all questions I may have and they make sure that I am comfortable throughout the appointment. As long as I am in Phoenix, I will always come here for my dental work."
1,"They are open again and some of the old staff is back!  The shredded beef they are using in Chimichangas was outstanding, rich but not greasy, a good chewy but not stringy.  KUDOS.  Welcome back and Good Luck.  So happy to have old fashioned mexican food within walking distance - yay for me!"
1,"Went with the fam tonight and it was just like old times.  Nothing has changed, thank heavens.  Hot sauce and chips: just right, not greasy.  Small, plastic tumblers filled with crushed ice--yes.  Combination #6 is my current favorite.  Enchilada sauce: not too thin not too thick.  Taco: small and crispy, not some huge crazy size.  Shredded cheese:  a nice sprinkling over taco, tostado, and cheese enchilada.  Cash only.  It's back--yea!"
1,"Spousal Unit has insisted we come here just about every other day since they re-opened!  Its is BETTER every time, these guys are definitely shooting up the learning curve and refining their offerings as the kitchen staff gets comfortable back in that little area where the magic happens.  My current favs are the Bean Tostado (beans are fresh, smooth, creamy and don't seem to have any, er, side-effects if you know what I  mean!) and a crunchy shredded beef taco.  The shredded lettuce is fresh and crispy, good amount of shredded cheese and the Salsa has its Perky Personality back.  Good Work guys!"
1,"I have been eating at Dons since it opened in the 60's, so maybe I'm not the best to write a review or maybe I am?  Its the kind of place with a special taste that cannot be gotten anywhere else.  Its easy to slam the place if you think your an expert cause you been here since 87.  Well I have been her since 53 so I have a lot more history eating my favorite food.  I call Dons \"" classic valley of the sun sonoran style mexican food! \"" When I see the word AUTHENTIC, I want to run.  Have you ever eaten in Nogales, Mex.  Thats authentic and you can have it.  They only thing I'm not crazy about is their red or green chili burritos, not bad just not the best.  Their fries used to be the best I ever had, don't known since they reopened if they are the same.  I'm glad they reopened with new people, the prior owners had the personality of a fence post.  They used to nickle and dime you;  extra chips you paid for, ice tea refills cost; common this is Arizona.  I think they don't do this anymore.  Now if they would add chicken to the menu and how about a decent beer like Bohemia!  So I just have to say if you don't like the food you were weaned on the wrong style to start with.  Last thought, no indigestion."
1,"Having grown up in this neighborhood I always try to frequent the businesses in the area. Don Jose has always been my favorite for stopping in while visiting my mom's home nearby.  The food is consistently good and the prices are very reasonable.  When I go in the employees are very friendly and always on their toes with water or tea refills.  If you like a place that is inexpensive with great service and delicious Mexican food, I highly recommend it.  I like the lettuce and tomato burrito smothered with green chile sauce it's not on the menu but they make it up for me because I am vegetarian."
1,Still love this place!__
1,"All time favorite restaurant! Good prices, good food, fast service!!"
1,"family friendly, divey little place.  a.m. radio and bullfighter paintings complete with red booths and formica tables.  very old school atmosphere.  this place is clean, cheery, and has friendly charming service and staff who remember your regular order, and sometimes your name.  the food is classic old school sonoran style with gorgeous and flavorful sauces and cheese.  the hot sauce is to die for...served in a thumb- triggered, red handled syrup bottle, just like hot sauce should be.  if you are looking for a sexy date night, this isnt it.  but if you want some good old fashioned mexican comfort food with a friendly smile at a good price, this place is it. love it.  i get takeout from here every week and i marvel at how Fast they are!"
1,"This place is Yummy. Must get a cheese crisp, with your meal. The only down side is that they take cash only. Wait that's a good thing, because their prices are so reasonable. My friend highly recommended it, and I also highly recommend it."
1,Great value for the price! The servers were super nice and attentive. Food is delicious! Probably the best tamales I've ever had. Def will come back.
1,"I swear I drive past this little Mexican restaurant multiple times a week and have never noticed it. One night, we were craving some quality Mexican food and started exploring Yelp to find a nearby Mexican spot that we had never tried and had good reviews. We called to see what time they were closing, because it had conflicting results when we tried to figure it out online. The staff answered and stated that they were closing in 5 minutes, but very kindly said that we could order and pick up if we could make it there within 10 minutes. We don't live too far so it was doable, and we gratefully made our way there while still on the phone ordering. I didn't have too much time to ponder on what I would order so I skimmed through the menu and decided on the shredded beef (machaca) burrito-enchilada style (I'm a fatkid). My man got the combo #1, which included 2 enchiladas, a taco and beans. Both orders smelled amazing, it was hard not to pounce into it in the car. When we got home and started grubbin' it was scrumptious!!! I had to give this place 5 stars based on their awesome customer service and delicious food. I am definitely going to have a hard time ordering something different next time because the burrito was so satisfying. We plan to come back and actually sit and eat for a meal, some happy hour and looking forward to their taco Tuesday! The new menu is a little bit different than the one posted on the Yelp page and they gave us one with our pickup order. I'll post it when I get a chance :). They only take CASH so be prepared!! Definitely a good find, THANKS YELP!"
1,People working there are nice. Good food.
1,The bomb dot com. I feed my unborn child Don Jose. I feed my grandma Don Jose. I hear angels sing when I bite into those pork tacos. Machaca is on point. Chicken tacos are delicious. They even have good desserts. Plus it's all cheap. I LOVE THAT SAUCE.
1,My favorite place. My family has been coming here for generations. ...since they have been opened. Love this place!!!!
1,I love this place! I have been eating here for years and was so sad when it closed for a bit. The new owners are AMAZING! Their dedication for maintaining the original food and atmosphere yet adding new items that compliment the old is incredible. The food is as good as ever. I truly love this place. Order the cheese chips and tacos!
1,"I love, love, love this place.  I switched from a previous office where the place always seemed to be a three ring circus.  Working together with Dr Oclair and Kate Montgomery, feels like a team.  This place is a well oiled machine!  My most recent visit with Kate Montgomery was to go over some maintenance medication concerns over health conditions she had more familariaty with, and the fact that I wanted to change, and what our next steps were.  We agreed on a change, but would do it by making sure we had the information needed to make sure the proposed choice was a good one with some additional blood tests.  She knew about the medication I wanted to switch to and provided me with well rounded information.  Unlike previous practices, this office is not change adverse, and after I explained why I wanted to change, felt we were on the same page.  This is easier said then done with most practices.  The office is a bit of a drive for me in the mornings 45 minutes which is longer than I like, but with the service received, it is so worth it.  Also unlike my previous provider, when receiving maintenance medications they provide at least 1 or 2 refills that way I'm not there additional times just to collect additional co-pays.  I feel like an empowered patient, Thanks Dr Oclair and Kate Montgomery."
1,"Dr. O'Clair is fabulous.  She is smart, caring, and very knowledgable.  I feel well cared for and listened to, which is very rare to find I feel today.  Plus they have in house lab, X-ray, OMT doc, and much more.  Not to mention the organized, friendly and helpful staff... Worth the admin fee every day of the week!"
1,"Did new sign/graphic install here and the people were very friendly and accessible. The office was busy the day we were there for this install, which shows me they have a very thriving practice. Good to know, in case I ever have to refer someone to a new doctor's office. This one is in a nice business/medical/professional park."
1,Great service and they had what I came for. Some work boots. Rand H. and I called in first to make sure they had what we were looking for and they did indeed. Big 5 Gets my big 5 stars!
1,Love this store the variety of women shoes goes good with a outfit to work out or run. they have good deals. Their staff is awsome! and the best thing is that i dont have to drive so far away because they are around the coner.
1,Spinning.  Hardcore.  That about sums it up.  Give it a try if you want a workout that will totally kick your ass and leave you crying.
1,Wow!!! I just took a spinning class from Ty and it was great! I had a knee replacement 10 years ago and have not been able to run since. I have done other cardio workouts but nothing compared to running. This class gave me that 'runner's high' I so enjoy. Ty is a sweetheart and very motivating. She uses a terrific mix of music too.
1,"I am taking my 3rd class tonight and I LOVE it!  When the hour long spin class is done you will wonder how it went by so fast.  The music is loud and the lights are off or dimmed most of the time which for me really takes your mind off the cardio and the burn and keeps you motivated.\n-Come Early (15 minutes)\n-Bring water \n-Bring a small towel\n-Don't have shoes? You can borrow!\n-Prepare for an amazing workout and a lot of fun!\n\nIf you haven't done spinning before don't worry, I did my first class with at beginner and she was fine.  Just make sure you tell the front desk person that you are new and they will take great care of you!"
1,"I decided to take the plunge and finally try a spinning class.   Glad that it was here, a perfect environment to feel like a newbie. (The spin studio is dark, really dark.  Arrive with plenty of time to find a bike and to adjust it for your frame & body.)  I was greeted at 8:45am by the instructor and spinning phenom, Samantha.  She played great music and inspired everyone to push harder.She would turn up the music occasionally when the black light was on, it became also trance or rave- like.\n\nAfter visiting a few more spin classes at the Village on Camelback, I learned that Studio 360 is a stand-up studio (they rarely sit down when riding.)  After more spin practice, I will return and see if I can ride standing up the whole time.\n\nSorry that I missed out on the Yoga Studio 360, that segment of the business ended a few months ago."
1,Love this joint. Best breakfast for the buck. BnB Breakfast aNd Beer. Love the staff. Yay tacos.
1,I don't know why I always shop around bc I know Pruitts will have the best price. I wish they had a better website.
1,"I'm sorry to see that others have had a bad experience because ours was nothing but good.  We were at another furniture place prior to walking into the Pruitss on Alma School Rd.  The other place, their sales associate was on our heals at all times.  That's what drove us straight out of there. Glad we did go to Pruitt, no hassle shopping without a doubt.  Sam was our sales person. He let us know if we needed anything to let him know.  I LIKE shopping like that. He literally had the sale within 5 minutes. \nThe delivery guys that delivered our sectional were courteous when they called and when they showed up, they were in and out within 5 minutes. I cant thank them enough. They even had to go around our home, thru the backyard and bring it into our home thru the back. Didn't even complain about it. Thank you Pruitts"
1,"I've been holding out on purchasing a new bed for sometime now, and today a friend referred me to Pruitt's. I went in to look, thinking I would need to wait a few more months to budget accordingly, and to my surprise I left having purchased a new 10\"" memory foam mattress & box springs (queen) for under $500, including delivery. The mattress even has a cooling technology, which in AZ is amazing this time of year. Ask for Pat, he was extremely friendly, professional and I didn't feel pressured at all. I'm actually looking forward to going back and finding some accent pieces soon."
1,"I feel bad that I haven't written this review sooner...the manager really deserves some recognition. \n\nI have celiac which requires me to order gluten free food. Pei Wei provides quality gluten free options and though the gf menu is rather small, I'm always satisfied. \n\nA couple months ago, my little sister and I decided to call ahead to get take out. When we arrived we were told it would be about 10 minutes.\nI'm perfectly used to waiting longer for gluten free food. I understand that it takes a couple minutes longer because the cooks have to change their gloves, change pots and pans to prevent cross contamination ect ect. So we waited maybe a minute or two over ten minutes and I really couldn't have cared less. However the manager was so very apologetic for the delay explaining that they had to remake mine because it got contaminated. Hey I'm perfectly willing to wait a couple extra minutes to not get poisoned!! I told him everything was fine and he proceeded to give me a $10 gift card just for the short delay. I didn't even make a peep about waiting and yet he made it clear that he cared and we were important and that means a lot! \nI wish I had asked his name but I didn't :( so if you ever read this sir, thank you! \n\nAnd about the food...yeah it's awesome. I love the sweet and sour combo (chicken and shrimp) on white rice or the spicy chicken!"
1,"I ordered some food to-go and my order wasn't right so I came back. The manager, alex I believe,was very understanding about the fact that I was upset about having to come back so he compensated for my time. This experience wont keep me from coming back. The food was good as usual"
1,"Tasty Asian American style  food. I go there about 4 times a week. The food is always hot and fresh. Clean restaurant, not too pricey and Friendly employees,,, Deserves not less than 5 stars!"
1,manager Veronica delivers the best service. I ordered a dish that was too salty and she was courteous all the way and made sure I got a different dish. Thank you for the excellent service!
1,"Great food at reasonable prices, if you like PF Changes you'll love Pei Wei. Same company and very similar food."
1,"I LOVE DAIRY QUEEN!\n\nWell, mostly their blizzards! I went and was very surprised that you buy one get a blizzard free of the same size or smaller. This definitely made me happy :D\n\nMy favorite is their oreo blizzards! That's what I usually get although their strawberry cheesequake blizzard and hawaiian blizzard is also yummy!"
1,Two years pass by......and I'm happy to report the boys are rockin it hard core at Bike Barn. I walked in the other day and two ( two!!) greeted me.  When I looked confused one asked if he could help me. Mary was still bustling around doing her magic but the Guys added a sense of ease.....and it was nice. So yep Bike Barn... . Love me some Bike Barn.
1,On a road trip and the Thule rack started to lean. These guys tightened it up (w/o charge) and sent us on our way much relieved. Thanks.
1,"Bike Barn has been in business since 1957 for one reason: Unbelievable customer service. We return for the experience. (I say this as though I'm an experienced cyclist. Let's be clear. I'm not.) I'm just an incredibly satisfied repeat visitor.\n\nThis store happily helps all levels of cyclists. I've watched and listened. My favorite question (heard over and over) \""Hey, do these tires do something special?\"" As shoppers point to beach cruiser balloon tires. With the patience of a saint, and without fail, the employees here explain the history.*\n\nThis is a one stop service store. They offer everything you could possibly need for a bicycle. (And a granny knee scooter, should one have foot surgery.) Obviously, bicycles. The scope of bicycles sold is mind boggling. They offer a fitting service to help you select one. Bikes can be assembled for you if you ship one here.\n\nAccessory products range from locks, gloves, water bottles, lights, shorts, tops, mirrors, fenders, baskets, bells (I personally own one with a pink heart, thank-you-very-much), tech gadgets galore [  deep breath  ], socks, pumps, helmets, shoes. (Did you hear me search engine?) There's more. They sell stuff. Price points range from almost nothing to over 4K. And that's because they carry high quality merchandise. They also have an e-commerce store too! http://bikebarnaz.com\n\nKid products abound. (I know, I tried to purchase a unicorn design set of gloves. Alas this is understandably popular and was out of stock.)\n\nThe owners and employees of this store really are invested in the community. You're not just coming to buy stuff here. If you want, you can join a network of super nice people. They offer bike rides for all levels of cyclists. This information is posted on their website and on the white board in the store. It says \""No one left behind.\"" :)  That would be me.\n\nI brought in my bell from my knee scooter and Hamilton was super happy to find a new home on my bicycle for it. He also showed me how to use a camel hydration system (which was not purchased at Bike Barn). I knew they would they help. Additionally I was shown how to use the different levels on my new front light. These guys are really looking out for you. I've learned something in every visit to this store. This is why my dollars will always be spent here.\n\nThanks for everything Hamilton!\n\n* Balloon tires on beach cruisers: They were created for a soft ride and initially popular on the beach. (This store has a variety of styles. I'd go take a peak. I'm not giving you the full answer! :)"
1,"This is my go-to local bike shop and once again, they exceeded my expectations on some recent service/repair work on my wife's Trek bike and also my Cannondale road-bike.  I want to especially recognize Hamilton in the Service Department for his attitude, customer service, and communication.  After I crashed my Cannondale, he went above and beyond in making my bike ride-able until I could source repair parts for this 10-yr old bike (e.g. Dura Ace 7700/7800 derailleur and rubber brake hood for Dura Ace 7700 9-spd shifter).  This past week, he installed my \""new\"" repair parts and this bike feels as good as new again.   I am very happy with his work and feel like I paid a fair price."
1,"Went here because it was the only place I could find listed on Yelp. \nDemitialia's recent experience was on target. \n\nMy Jean d'Eve had stopped working while in storage and I took it in to get the battery changed. The proprietor glanced at my wrist and recognized my vintage Accutron and said, \""Hmm... nice. Collectors' watch...\"" After opening the Jd'E, turns out the battery ihad corroded. He removed the battery and the corrosion, blew the crud out of the watch with canned air, oiled the works, replaced the battery closed it up, and set the time. $5.00.\n\nI asked about a new band. \""Lizzard or Crocodile? Maybe plain?\"" He had a very nice selection of bands in various styles. I chose a crocodile. He threw in new spindles, no charge. $20.\n\nWe began talking about New York. Turns out he worked on 47th Street (the Diamond District). We traded a few stories about living in NYC. Nice guy.\n\nHe looked down and noticed that the Jean d'Eve had lost time. Took the whole thing apart again. More air. More oil. \""Bring it back if it acts up.\""\n\nTwo hours later. I'm back. He replaces the circuit board. No Charge. More air. More oil. \""Looks like the corrosion may have gotten into the works... but let's see.\"" Tells me if the watch continues to loose time, he'll have to operate.  \n\nFive hours later, the watch seems to be keeping time. I'm a happy man!"
1,"My new watch needed to have its metal-link bracelet resized and after a frustrating search (\""We'll do it only if the watch was bought here\"" ... \""We don't have the right tools for that kind of bracelet\"" ...), it occurred to me that I should have yelped it first! So after reading the more recent reviews for the establishment under new management (the 1st review is no longer valid - it was for the previous management; I'm waiting for yelp to take it down), I brought my watch here. Eddie was friendly, fast, and got the bracelet resized within a few minutes, for just 5 bucks. Now I know where to bring my watch for battery replacement, or if it ever needs repair in the future."
1,Exactly what I needed to get my watches back online. Service was while I waited and prices were more than fair
1,"Fast, affordable.  Eddie is a really good and honest guy;  he will tell you as it is, and I appreciate that.\nBe sure to bring exact change in cash, and in small bills.\nThere was a long line of dudes selling jewelry to him.  I wonder where he sells those, because it doesn't look quite like what is being sold at the watch store, so he may have a nice store where girls like me can buy our shiny toys.  \nTell us where, Eddie!"
1,"I've lived in the area for 9 years and have paid $100's of dollars numerous times for batteries, gold chain repair, crystal on watches, ring re-sizing,etc. I've been a Fast Fix customer for the duration- not because they are reasonable, -NOT. Never again.  I've been to see Eddie ( professional and very likable) 3 times in the last month, total of:\n        6 batteries ($5 each) Fast Fix, your choice $21 or $29!, ~installed less than 3 min each~\n        New crystal on a Bulova Men's watch & Mickey Mouse Watch ($25 each crystal- band repair - no charge) Fast Fix quote for crystal and repair band $125. \n         Gold ring re-sized 7 to 8.5 and gold chain repair- $50 - Fast Fix $150. It was returned in brand new excellent condition shinny polished condition!  \n      I've also taken in a very old antique pocket watch, in which he said, due to the old mechanics of it, and setting device- I couldn't be repaired.  Upfront and honest.\n     When he keeps the jewelry to repair, his $ estimate and time promised is accurate.\n     Cash only.  Eddie is a busy man, and his clients seem to all value and trust his work ethics.  \n     You won a life customer, Eddie, well at least you and I both live in the area!  Thank you for restoring my trust in jewelry repair/dealers!"
1,"Eddie replaces batteries within 5 min, for $5. Can you beat that? He does an efficient, reliable job, and gave me good tips about my watch. This place is the perfect \""local\"" watch repair location I was hoping for!"
1,AMAZING! He fixed 5 watches in 5 minutes! Owner was so sweet! Best watch repair guy a girl with tons of betsey Johnson and juicy couture watches could hope for!!!!!!
1,"Cash only - The owner is so helpful, very honest and fast. Needed to fix the metal bracelet of my husband's watch, which broke suddenly. He fixed it in 10 minutes for 10 dollars. (Considering how it broke, I was a little anxious on where to go and how much it would cost!!) Very happy to have found this place, thanks to Yelp. He adjusts rings too. I recommend this place to all my family, friends and Yelpers!"
1,Really an outstanding experience. Kelly the manager was very thorough friendly and made my tire purchase a great experience. Even though they were working in a make shift conditions due to their reconstruction I was in and out of there in under an hour. Service was professional and I would go back to them anytime and recommend them to anyone who needs a tire repair again outstanding customer service.
1,"Discount Tire is the ONLY place I will EVER get tires!!  I only wish I could give more stars.   Fast and friendly service.  Very knowledgeable staff that goes above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction.  No pressure to buy more than you can afford.  They helped me stay within budget and when I got a flat, it was replaced for free.  That replacement coverage is priceless."
1,"I have gone to this location a couple of times for tires and also stopped by when I thought I had a nail in my tire and have always received excellent service.  When I stopped because of the nail in my tire, they advised me that it was actually a screw that hadn't damaged my tire.  They could have easily charged me for a new tire, but instead they were honest and had me on my way quickly.  My favorite perk to this place is that they have a station set up for you to pull up, have an employee check the air in your tires and fill them if needed and you are on your way.  :)"
1,"I came into Discount Tire to have them fix a leak in one of my tires.  I was having a license plate issue and they fixed that too! The staff was friendly and the work was done in a timely matter, they have definitely earned my return business!"
1,Awesome ! I did not expect to have such a pleasant experience at a tire place. They were helpful anf quick. Every one was smiling and said hello. Great service. And they match any price.
1,"These guys are rock stars! They have the perfect balance of personality and professionalism. Adam met me on my way in and made the experience flow smoothly. Larry finished it off great, I love discount tire!"
1,"I first bought tires from this Dealer for my old Ford Explorer (aka The Batmobile) about 4 years ago and absolutely fell in love with this place.  They're professional, friendly and get the job done.  I grumbled a little bit about buying warranty certificates for all my tires and didn't fully appreciate that until I'd gotten a few flats, nails, and cuts.  Those tires were replaced free, well except for the cost of buying new warranties @ $20 each. On a side note, while their waiting area is kinda small, it is air conditioned and they do offer free water and clean bathrooms.  They also offer free tire gauges. \n\nI've returned, last year, to both replace and upgrade the tires on my Toyota Highlander (aka Wonder Woman).  I opted to purchase the best tires for my van, which they didn't carry in stock.  The day I went in to get the service, the manager informed me that they didn't have them and offered me an additional $30 off for waiting. I greatly appreciated them understanding  that \""TIME IS THE TRUE CURRENCY OF LIFE!\"" I was given a lift home, while Wonder Woman waited for new tires and someone came to pick me up when she was ready. \n\nThis year, one of Wonder Woman's tires got punctured.  Again, I returned for a replacement tire, since I'd bought warranties.  Again, no problems and fast service.\n\nSince this location is in \""my neck of the woods,\"" I favor this particular location.  I've written about my experiences at others, if you're interested?"
1,great shop...manager Craig is fair and knowledgeable....saved me a bunch of money!!!\nI've had all three of our BMW's in there for service..!\n\nMike
1,"Kelly is awesome!  The whole place is nice and welcoming, it has a hip fun vibe and they will give you a little sangria to make the chair sitting pass quickly.\nKelly is an artist and always does a beautiful job with my hair, I never feel rushed or picky.  If you are looking for somewhere new to try then give Salon Sandoval a call!"
1,"Salon Sandoval gave me a great experience!\n  I was in need of a blow out for a special occasion and Chris did an amazing job.  I have gone to many salons in Phoenix for blow outs and  this was one of the very best.\n My appointment was on time and I was attended to in a friendly , clean environment by a lovely staff. Thank you Salon Sandoval I look forward to my next visit !"
1,"This was my first time going to this salon. I found a groupon for it and decided to try it out. When I first arrived I didn't really think much of it. The outside was just a normal looking store. However, once I entered I was instantly impressed. Everything was so chic and clean. I loved the atmosphere. Katie cut my hair and she was fantastic! She made me feel totally comfortable and was super kind. I totally recommend everyone to go here!"
1,"Thank you Sandoval for allowing me to be in your salon, and making me feel like family.I noticed how clients felt the same way.\nThank you ilse ang gigi also and all the great staff and the owner is purely a positive and creative role model. \nSantanascissorsaz"
1,"You step in to a hip salon,professional,welcoming staff like Katie,and invested stylists like Gigi."
1,"Awwwe - I call this \""the little unknown Chinese food treasure of PHX\"" So good - cooked fresh, fresh ingredients and awesome staff. Doesn't look like much from the outside and inside is kinda plain and basic but the food is D'lish! I took some friends that didn't like Lo Mien, sweet and sour pork or fried rice - well now they like it! Don't forget to try the very healthy yummy Soup Fried rice :)"
1,best chinese food in the world!! \nthats it!
1,Very good food! Fast delivery!
1,"OK, if you like airbrush tanning,  this is the BEST place in Phoenix; BAR NONE.   \n\nSandy should be working with SI models.  She is EXTREMELY talented. EXTREMELY.  And, she grossly UNDERcharges.  I told her she should charge more.  \n\nUnfortunately, I could never get to my appointments on time, so I was ousted from the salon.\n\nBut, I still maintain that Sandy is the best airbrush artist in the state. You will never get a better color, for a longer period of time, for a more OBSCENELY low price.\n\nJust make sure you arrive on time..."
1,"This is definitely my go to for when I'm in need of some color.  Whether it be a base tan needed before a vaca, maintaining that glow throughout winter... or even during the hot summer months when I just don't have time to lay out for hours.\n\nMost salons down here require a monthly membership. Not Camelback Tanning! The packages are all so flexible.. & inexpensive! I personally buy the individual 7 tans.. They never expire and can be used for either a bed or a stand up.. My personal preference is the stand up.\n\nLet's not get me started on the tanning lotion.  Same exact lotion I paid 90 bucks for in NY is sold here for 23 bucks !! What a deal!  .. Actually feel a little silly now looking back and paying so much for it.\n\nThe staff here is amazing and so is the ownership.  . You can truly tell they care about their customers... I've been coming here for years and I've never had a bulb out. \n\nI personally drive to Arcadia area just to go tanning here.. I live in south Scottsdale.  Worth the drive for me? - heck ya! .. I'll sacrifice time for quality any day of the week.\n\nIf you're new to the area or just looking for a place where you can save some $ ... Camelback tanning is my TOP recommendation."
1,Love it here! Great beds...always see amazing results! Staff is VERY knowledgeable and friendly! Good prices and a variety of lotions to chose from at any price point! Have been coming here for months and will continue! So happy to find such a great place so close home!!!
1,This is my favorite tanning spot in Phoenix. Great prices and packages and a super friendly staff.  They gave me a discount on my package because I'm a regular.
1,"This place was awesome.  You could tell they tried to fancy it up a bit inside, too, which shows interest in appearance.  Appearance matters when working on my clothes!  \n\nFirst made contact via email and the owner responded in very timely manner directly answering my questions.  He was polite.\n\nMade a visit and that woman at the desk was friendly, nice and smiled/laughed with us.  Saying \""thank you\"" to customers is very important.  Why is it that we as customers always end up saying thank you when we pay???  Nothing wrong with that, but shouldn't the clerk say that as well?\n\nClothes and comforter were picked up and, according to my source, everything looked great and was ready when advised!\n\nA little more costly and not close to my location, but worth the drive.  Great job, Park Ave.!"
1,"This place is great.  Always gets things cleaned and done when they say they will.  I think they even get things back the same day, but I haven't used that service yet.   Parking is easy.  As someone else mentioned, the sign out front does NOT say Par Avenue Cleaners, which makes it hard to direct people here.  I have never had to wait in line...either to pick up or drop off.  Only suggestion....EVERYONE pays with debit cards these days...kinda awkward to go to a separate counter to run card, then go back to the other counter for your pick up slips.  Otherwise love this place."
1,"If I had a child, or if I had a woman who claimed I had a child and I believed her, I'd bring that child here and drop that child off on the counter and trust that that child would be well cared for... That's how much I trust these bastards. They're the best of the best."
1,"If you are going anywhere else - you are paying too much & not getting the service you deserve, these people do a great job.  Been coming here for years, if I have someting that needs a minor fix - they get it done, no charge - saves me time & hassle.  Thanks Park Ave - you rock."
1,"If you're like me, you leave your laundry at the dry cleaners for weeks because it's super expensive and you don't want to pay for it when you get there because you're thinking... why even pick up my old clothes? For $30+ I can buy a new top and just go about my business.\n\nTHAT WON'T HAPPEN HERE!\n\nIt's super cheap - everything is $2.50 AND you prepay, so you get it over with when you drop your clothes off. On top of that - they're great! They've always taken great care of my clothes. If you're going to any other dry cleaner, you're wasting your time.\n\nAlso, coupons for their services are always in those annoying junk mail packets you get in your mail box... I literally open it up just to fish out that coupon and recycle the rest."
1,"I don't know who does the hiring at Park Ave but whoever it  is certainly knows what they are doing.  The staff here is really young but they are service oriented.  I wish I could find more places with the attitude they have here.\n\nThe prices are low, the cleaning is done well, and if there is any question they will redo the garment.\n\nThey keep the price low is by taking cash and checks.  Don't expect to use a credit card.\n\nThere isn't a lot of parking so you may have to park in the parking lots on both sides of the building.  Never hurts to burn a few calories.\n\nI have been using these people for so many years that I really don't remember...maybe 30?  Nice place to do business with.  I worked in retail for many years.  Most of the major stores I worked in, this is where the majority employees took their dry cleaning  Work clothes had to last, so if you wanted things done right, you went here for a price one could afford."
1,"Great service!! They are the nicest people and run a wonderful business. This is by far the best dry cleaner I've found in the area. They really take care of my clothes and get out stains with ease. The turn around time is really quick too, and I have tendency to bring in a lot of clothes at once. Haven't gone anywhere else since I found Park Avenue Cleaners  almost 6 years ago.  Can't recommend them enough!"
1,"I've been going here regularly for more than a year. Prices are fair and the service and cleanliness of my clothes have been solid. I really couldn't ask for a better location, price and experience.\n\nAfter moving to AZ I found this place on Yelp. I think the signage outside the business says \""$1.50 cleaners\"" or something like that. I don't think it matches up to the Yelp business name, although the street address/phone number does, which is how I found it. Aside from being confusing to first find the place, I immediately started to have a good experience here...one I did find it.\n\nRecently, one of my items was damaged during cleaning. The owner apologized for the inconvenience and refunded the money I paid for my item. Now oftentimes, when a business owner or manager has to be held accountable for a mistake, they can be combative, rude, or incredulous. But this process at Park Ave Cleaners was hassle-free, easy and darn-near pleasant. This business makes my life easier by cleaning my clothes for a fair price, and owning up to a mistake made (one mistake after about 14 months of going here); and that makes me a loyal customer who further trusts this business.\n\nSolid work and honorable. Rare."
1,"We've been using Park Ave Cleaners now for almost 7 years. We bring in coats with belts, suits, button up shirts, etc. The belt is always with the coat and tagged separately so it has never been lost. The shirts are always laundered and pressed nicely. Staff is polite, most things are ready within a couple of days, and the price is great. What more do you want from your cleaner?"
1,"We'd been to Arcadia ice a couple of times before deciding to have our 6 year old's birthday party there. \nAlthough far less flashy than the ice den in northern scottsdale, Arcadia has the essentials down. Their equipment is fairly old and worn out - but the issues I found with the skates and facilities were solely aesthetic issues. The skates work well and the ice surface is well maintained. The staff is helpful and the place has a genuine neighborhood feel. \nThe public skates we've attended at Arcadia don't have the frenetic feel of those we've attended at the ice den, as they limit the number of participants to what appears to me to be a reasonable number.\nThe party we had was reasonably priced (at least a hundred dollars cheaper than the offering at the ice den), and the staff was very helpful and dedicated. From our party helper who handled skate fitting and pizza serving, to the instructor who gathered our kids and have a lesson, to the Zammboni driver who conversed with our 6 yr old the entire ride; everyone involved made the day great. \nAs long as you can stomach a slightly non-polished experience, save your money and avoid the crowds at Arcadia ice."
1,"Great customer service and top notch work!  \n\nI had several pieces of furniture in need of repair.  Some required wood working, others new upholstery, and another requiring leather treatment.  All of the work was done quickly and expertly.  Fred and the team were professional and courteous.  I have no idea how they made the leather chair 'like new' but they did it.  We've had the furniture back in our house for a few weeks now and I am 100% satisfied."
1,"Absolutely fantastic, the best money we've ever spent! Chris, Roberto and Fred were wonderful to deal with, very quick to respond to my initial inquiry and within 10 days from start to finish, our 12-yr. old leather couch and loveseat are back, looking just like new. Both pieces had several worn spots and, scratches (many from cats!) and even a tear, but you'd never know it to see them now. Customer service is excellent - Chris explained the repair process in detail, and they did just what they said they would do. Pricing seemed more than reasonable to us, and even the loaner couch we were given was very nice. It's very rare for  our expectations to be met in terms of quality of work and customer service when dealing with service companies, but Leather Like New far exceeded them with their professionalism and craftsmanship. I can't recommend them highly enough! Many, many thanks guys!!"
1,"I'm an  Italian girl from New York and I can honestly say: Marcellino is one of the BEST Italian restaurants in the Valley. \n\nIf you like home made pasta, flavorful sauces, great wine and all the other elements that make a great Italian place - this is it! It even reminds me of a place back east with the owner (owner's wife?) working the door and the old school dessert ray presented by the waiter. \n\nMarcellino is not cheap, but it's price in on par with other high end Italian like Bravo Bistro, Um Bacio, Le Cabaffe, Tamasos...etc. But Marcellino might be the best!"
1,"Yes indeed, this is good as it gets!  After discovering Marcellino's a few years ago, I am now drawn there like a magnet.  Marcellino is a \""real\"" chef, personally designing each menu item..and the off-menu items, which change regularly, are his masterpieces.  \nThe atmosphere is unique to Phoenix - high class, personal, and sophisticated yet cozy.  This is a place for food, wine and conversation, not a see-and-be-seen joint.  That said, I've seen and met some of the Valley's movers and shakers here - business owners, politicians, artists, TV personalities, politicians.  The service is consistently top-notch and professional.  Family owned and operated, Marcellino and Sima pour their heart into this place, and it shows."
1,"Do you know what \""scampi\"" really is? \nI learned new food fact at Marcellino this week, something I should have known, but most of us probably don't. \""Scampi\"" is an animal - a type of lobster that looks a lot like a shrimp. I've always assumed \""scampi\"" was the shrimp in butter and garlic dish, but it turns out that is an American bastardization of the term. Real scampi is a particular type of lobster - not very common and very expensive, which is probably how the shrimp and garlic bit happened along. BTW, Marcellino's REAL scampi is lovely, served grilled \""on the half shell\"". Plan on sucking all the tasty bits off the shell."
1,"How can I not give Marcellino five stars?\n\nThe food was fantastic - as was the experience.  We'd been hearing about Marcellino Ristorante for awhile but it wasn't until we were looking for a place to celebrate Mother's Day that we thought to check it out.\n\nFrom the moment I called to make a reservation, we received the friendliest service ever!  I was told that they could take our group at 6:45 and that they'd have a live Opera Singer (specifically a Tenor) in house that night performing - what a treat!  Well - that's what I figured when they told me that.  (None of us were opera fans before and we still are not opera fans, but it did add to the experience!)\n\nWe were seated right away and Scott was our server.  He was attentive and patient with us, even when Jared had him repeat the specials several times.  Their homemade pasta specials looked incredible, but I stayed away... Instead, I enjoyed the Insalata Ortolana, a few bites of the Canestina Polenta (if you like polenta and you like mushrooms, get this - it's incredible), and I shared the Gamberi Affogtai entree with my mother-in-law-to-be.  We requested extra veggies instead of mashed potatoes and not only did they oblige, but the broccoli, cabbage, and asparagus we received were delicious!  The shrimp were magnificent as well - juicy and tender!  Oh - I have to also admit to having some of the 'special sauce' they serve with the bread basket... it is tangy and wonderful - if you go, you must try that too.  It's made with eggplant, olive oil, and red pepper I believe... yum!\n\nJared and his sister had a Caprese Salad (a bit overpriced at $12.95), the Paccatelli al Ragu (a bolognese pasta dish I believe), the Scaloppine al Gorganzola (a veal dish that he enjoyed but serving size was not as big as he'd wished for).  We finished off the meal with an Apple Galetta served with hazelnut gelato and a Panna Cotta (similar to flan).  While I had just a small taste of the apple one, I can report that it was delicious... and since Jared and his mom finished off the panna cotta, i'll assume it was not so bad either.\n\nAll of the above plus a pellegrino, a coffee, and a cappuccino for $159.85 before tip.  Note - no alcohol.\n\nSo, yes, we wish it was more affordable - but we'll be back without a doubt!"
1,"In college (not that long ago, but boy I am getting old fast) I had the opportunity to spend a month in northern Italy.  Marcellino Ristorante takes me back.\n\nYou will find no finer Italian restaurant in Phoenix.  The pastas are exceptional, unique, and fresh.  The atmosphere is superb.  The wait staff if phenomenally proficient yet down to earth and friendly at the same time.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to treat you and a loved one to this experience."
1,"What a wonderful dining experience as my wife and I celebrated 30 years of marriage at this upscale Italian restaurant. \nWe opted for the Monday night three course chefs special with the wine paring.  There was a bit of mixup as the Internet price ($49 p/p) did not reflecrt the price increase after their move to the new location.  However after a short  discussion, the Internet price was honored.\n \nAfter the complimentary bruchetta, our first wine was presented to us - a lovely chianti blend that introduced our first course.  The first course had two very different offerings.  A wonderful mushroom sauce was served over Polenta - this was my favorite.  The other offering in the first course was traditional Insalata Caprese - mozzarella, local tomatoes and basil.  Both of these dishes were perfect.\nThe second course was preceded by a local Tuscany red wine that was a blend of 4 grapes.  This pasta course was highlighted by a delicious white seven cheese ravioli complimented with a red sausage and marinara  pasta dish.  All of their pastas are home made and were cooked to perfection.  The ravioli was my favorite!\n\nThe main course consisted of two fillets of a Mediterranean fish that was a member of the Monk fish family.  It was served with a yummy garlic sauce and accented by perfectly mashed white potatoes dressed with fresh Basil. \n\nThe evening was romantic and the service was just right.  We had a wonderful dining experience in this Anniversary stopover in Scottsdale."
1,"I have had the privilege to indulge myself in true Italian cuisine made with love and passion. When you dine at Marcellino's not only do you experience the graciousness of the owners who are ever present and friendly,but you get to lavish your taste buds in the essence of true Italian flavors. The housemade pastas are ones that you can't get anywhere else, or would you want too. Then top that off with live Opera, make you feel like to are in the heart of Italy riding a gondola. The attentive staff are at your table giving you impeccable service and enhacing your experience with through knowledge of the menu. I recommend this restaurant to everyone looking to have a memorable experience!!"
1,"The FOODwas good! My friends ordered the Filet Mignon with median rare and Lamb Chop; they were awesome! Their homemade pasta special was impressive as well. We also had a bottle of white wine that the waiter introduced to us. The wine was very good just that i can't remember the name of it :P\nAlso, we celebrated for one of the friends' birthday today! The restaurant was really thoughtful that they personalized our dessert for our birthday girl:)\nWonderful SERVICE! Other than the delicious food and birthday cake, I love the service that Marcellino Ristoante had! Their waiter was really professional when introducing the food and recommending the wine. The AMBIANCE was really good for special occasion like birthday, anniversary or date =)"
1,"When you have grown up loving and appreciating food, and have travelled extensively here in the U.S. as well as abroad, and wanted to dedicate your life to the creative process of preparing food at an early age, and already having lived many decades, it came as a wonderful shock to be so impressed and taken with a local restaurant after eating there for the first time!\nMy daughter and son-in-law gave us a gift certificate last Christmas for Marcellino Restorante located in Scottsdale,  which was about to expire on June 21st.  Couldn't let that happen, so the wife and I decided to go on a Saturday to avoid evening rush hour traffic.  After reading many reviews on Yelp, and in the AZ Republic, I knew it was considered a very good choice for an Italian meal.  Well I have to say it was a very good choice no matter what the cuisine!  During the 48 hour period after we ate there, we constantly had thoughts during the day and dreams during the night about how tasty and wonderful the food was.  We don't think this has ever happened to us before.  \nThe restaurant was classy, attractive and comfortable, the wait staff friendly, knowledgable and efficient, not at all stuffy or obtrusive.  I enjoyed the double layer of linen tablecloths adorning our table. We ordered their special blend of iced tea, a black tea with lavender, apricot and rose hips,  unusally tasty, an uncommon occurance in my experience.  I should have known if I liked the tea so much, the rest had to be exceptional, and it was!  Since their pasta had received rave reviews, and they bothered to bring a large platter of uncooked pastas to the table like many restaurants show off their desserts, we knew we were in for a treat.  We decided to order two pasta dishes,  Gnocchi Sorrentina (described on the menu as \""perfectly light potato/pasta dumplings floating in tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella cheese melting within\"", and Tagliolini Mare e Monte (the tomato sauce had small shrimp, tail on, and mixed mushrooms, with lovely little chunks of tomato).  We told our waiter that we were intending to share the dishes and he brought them out with one half of each pasta dish on our plates, pre-shared you might say.  There was an unbeliveable explosion of flavors in our mouths, the pasta cooked perfectly al dente.  We were like two little kids in a candy store, oohing and aahing as we cleaned our plates.  Next followed our one shared entree,  Salmone in Crosta di Porcini e Porri, described on the menu as \""Atlantic salmon dipped in porcini (mushroom) flour and sauted with fresh leeks and cognac\"".  Ordered slightly beyond medium, the fish couldn't have been cooked any more perfect!  I am drooling as I write this review, I can't help myself.  The fish was served with semi crunchy sticks of zucchini and fluffy mashed potatos with a little branch of fresh rosemary sticking up like a miniature tree. We continued to hum throughout this meal.  To finish this gastronomic orgasm I had a double decaf expresso and the wife had their blend of decaf coffee and our dessert choice, a chocolate mousse with fresh strawberries topped with whipped cream.  It was unbelievable how each plate outdid the next!\nChef Marcellino Verzino greeted us as we were leaving and I told him he was a \""flavor magician\"" whose magic will be long remembered.  Until you have eaten here, you haven't really eaten \""real Italian pasta\""!"
1,"The new location for this long time Valley favorite is in Old Town Scottsdale on Restaurant row right accross from Cowboy Ciao.  This used to be Digestiff.  \n\nThe Marcellino's people have done a wonderful job of creating an entirely different attidtude on this side of Stetson Drive.  Still very cool, very ambient, very laid back and not at all pretentious, but still different experience.\n\nThe thick cranberry colored drapesgive an old world quality to the mostly urban brickwork comprising most of the walls.  lit mostly by chandeliers and candlelight, the interior is warm, intimate and easy. No garish paintings or stereo typical florentine towers to be seen.  Well, there was a small reproduction of Rome's \"" Mouth of Truth\"" bolted to the wall next to the entry that kept staring down at me.  I liked it.  It brought back happy memories of Rome.\n\nWe would be experiencing the Tasting menu ($75 with 3 courses and 3 pairings)  Our server, Scott, made sure we had no food allergies or road blocks towards anything in particular.  A small cheese, olive and salami plate arrived first, compliments of the Chef.  Scott then proceeded to send over dish after dish of amazing Italian classics , like the large, single handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach bathed in an almost invisible butter sauce.  There was also some unexpected delights like the polenta strips topped with a chunky portobello reduction and the perfectly portioned filet mignon.  Each was delightfully different and kept our pallettes busy with incredible flavors and textures.\n\nWine pairings were also carefully selected and added that supreme finish to each plate. The tasting menu with pairings are always different, so you can simply come in sit down and relax and be taken care of. No regretful commitments to be made.\n\nAfter four courses, with 3 wine pairings we were quite content to fold up our napkins and call it quits, but there was still more!  Scott finished us off with a beautiful Tiramisu accompanied with freshly whipped cream that was ablaze and courted with artfully sliced strawberries.  The Tiramisu was light, airy and delicately creamy.\n\nLive music on Saturday nights differs from week to week from opera to jazz to Sinatra.  This Sunday evening we had a mixture of Sade and other light jazz simmering from the sound system.\n\nA wonderful evening was had and will be remembered.  thank you Marcellino's!"
1,Love this place ! The owners are very friendly and make you feel welcome. It feels like you're in a NYC Italian restaurant. :-)\nFood is creative and delicious . Service is great. We keep coming back ! \nYou really should try it.\n\nEither as a couple or as a group - this place works.
1,"It took me a very long time to find an Italian restaurant in the Phoenix area that I really enjoyed.  I had all the usual suspects in Scottsdale and Phoenix recommended to me, to varying degrees of success.  Most of them were good, but nothing that I would rather go to, than just make my own food at home.  A friend finally brought me to Marcellino's about 5 years ago, back when they were in North Phoenix (I miss that little place).  \n\nSince the first day I went, Marcellino has been serving some of the best handmade pasta that I have ever had.  But my absolute favorite are his lamb chops and filet.  With so many favorites to choose from, it's easier most days to just order the chef's tasting menu, which usually includes a duo of my some of my favorite appetizers (scallops, or mushroom polenta, or some buffalo mozzarella and tomato, etc.), a duo of pastas and a carne or a duo.  \n\nNot only is the food amazing, there is one server here in particular who always makes me feel like family, Scottie.  His knowledge of the menu, food, wine and the restaurant is flawless and his warm demeanor is incredibly welcoming.  His service takes this place a notch above the rest."
1,"We were in town for a weekend away and our hotel book the reservation.  This place was amazing from the moment we sat at the bar to the time we waddled out of the joint 2 hours later.\n\nThe bar:  Classic, perfectly lit, bartender was about as good as it gets (and I can't remember his name).  We had a great bottle of white (Italian) with our friends and chatted with the bartender about dinner suggestions.  Was pleased that of all the items on the menu he actually walked us through many, he asked us questions about what we like and steered us appropriately.\n\nGetting to the food:  It was the first week of October and we chose to sit outside....ahhh, perfect.  The only hiccup of our entire experience came when 10 minutes after seating us we still hadn't been approached by a server.  We flagged the hostess (What's the right way to call the person who greets you, seats you and is one of the owners?) and she couldn't stop apologizing.  What was great was that instead of sticking one of the waiters on us, she saw how much fun we had at the bar and had the bartender act as our server as well.\n\nFood:  Needless to say we all were guided to wonderful dinner choices.  I can honestly say that this was the absolute best pasta-centric meal I've ever eaten.  Mine had 1/2 a lobster, an amazing sauce and other goodness in it.  Is it possible for pasta to melt in your mouth?  Mine did.  The other 3 at the table had the same experience.  We also had a wonderful tour of Italy via the wine that was paired with things.  Dessert was amazing as well.\n\nMarcellino had the quaintness of a family owned place combined with the experience and food quality of a fine restaurant.  I cannot say enough about the quality of the food and the service.  If you have the chance, go there!"
1,Excellent service and food.   Black ink pasta with seafood is delicious.  Try the mozzarella with tomatoes.  Parking can be a little challenging but there are valet options close.
1,Marcellino's was an amazing romantic dinner experience.  I had their fresh pasta w/mushroom truffles and lobster.  The combination was amazing.  I also had the white wine that's made by a friend in Italy.  It was tantalizing and really lingered on my pallet.  The homemade tiramisu was a blissful ending to dinner.  The staff is attentive and very helpful.
1,"Brilliant - Server Scott was all over us! Fresh made pasta - ambiance perfect. Would go back again and again! Thank Chef, Scott and staff! I hope the translation is correct, That was Wonderful! Che \u00e8 stato meraviglioso!!!"
1,"Marcellino Ristorante is a truly excellent Italian restaurant. There are many options especially in Scottsdale for fine dining, especially if one craves Italian cuisine. However, one seldom finds as complete a package as Marcellino. The combination of ambience, charming decor, impeccable service, and flavorful dishes makes this an excellent choice if you are bringing a date or celebarting a special occasion. Try the homemade pasta, trust me it is to die for. They also have a version of chicken saltimboca (can't remember the menu name) that is heavenly. If you dine al fresco, you might get some live music blaring from Tapas Papa Frita, which is either a plus or minus depending on your threshold for music volume. Prices are somewhat high, but is within the expected range for a classy Scottsdale establishment. One downside is that I would not recommend the mussels appetizer as the mussels are tiny. The desserts are homemade and decent although not something I would write home about. Truly the main course is the crown jewel of this establishment's menu, but don't get me wrong - the appetizers and desserts (that we tried) are fine, just not up to the standard of the rest of the restaurant."
1,"Great atmosphere, great service (our waiter was most entertaining), impressive wine selection, phenomenal food. Deciding to take advantage of the cooler weather, we enjoyed our meal on the quaint patio. I had the seafood special with squid ink pasta, mussels, clams, calamari and a 3/4 lb. lobster in a spicy marinara sauce. It was easily one of the most enjoyable Italian dishes I've tried yet (and I consider myself to be quite the Italian cuisine connoisseur). I will definitely be back to enjoy this neighborhood gem situated on the Waterfront in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale."
1,"First and foremost, I'm Italian, and I'm always dismissive of Italian restaurants in the US. Well, I have to say that Ristorante Marcellino is now ranked #1 in my list of favorite places all up. The food (straccetti al tartufo, ravioli, gnocchi), the wine (red and white recommended by marcellino), the dessert (tartufo al cioccolato, tiramisu, ricotta cheese cake), the grappa, the limoncello and the passito, everything was just perfect and beyond my expectations. Marcellino, sei un genio culinario, grazie per l'ospitalit\u00e0!"
1,"My wife and I had an amazing dining experience last night from start to finish for our first time in this amazing restaurant. The ambience, staff, food and drinks were outstanding! The pre dinner cocktails were a perfect start. My wife had the Pure Bliss and I had the Spritz. I felt like I was back in Italy sipping on this refreshing aperitif! Marcellino's home made fresh pasta was nothing short of outstanding. My wife had the Strachetti w truffles and sausage and I had the tortoloni stuffed w filet. Ridiculously good. The home made Tartufo accompanied w an espresso martini was the perfect ending to a perfect night. Our servers Daniel and Mike were excellent as were our bus boys who were pleasant and attentive. Expect to pay but originally being from NYC we are used to these prices. I never mind paying when you have such an amazing date night experience! Grazie mille Marcellino!  We will definitely be back."
1,"By far, this is the best place for not only food, but atmosphere and music.  The food is divine.  The restaurant is first class and the owners are like your best new friend.  I love this place! Will always bring my family, friends and even by myself.  I am always treated great.  Treat yourself!"
1,"This is the spot for some of the best Italian food!\n Hands down, THE BEST RAVIOLI, with a  lovely marana and a touch of cream, it melts in your mouth, like nothing I have ever had before, it is one of their specialties, made fresh every day, it is A MUST...\n The veal marsala is FANTASTIC, tender and tasty, the marsala sauce is smooth and sweet. Linguini w/ Clams is just DELICIOUS, you can taste the freshness in the clams( Hard to find in Phoenix)\n  They end each meal with a sambuca lit on fire, Nice Touch!!!\n  They have a great wine list and a full bar.\n I love it, have been going for about 6 years, It is a little pricey, so the visits are not as frequent as I would like."
1,I love this place. The best ravioli in the city. The gnocchi is also amazing. They are really kid friendly. They prepare a wonderful chicken breast and vegetables for my son with allergies. The decor could use some sprucing up.
1,"Some of the best Italian I've ever had! It was pleasantly surprise! The place doesn't look that great from the outside, but the food makes up for it. The martini's were expensive and not that great. Pasta is made right at the restaurant. Highly recommend getting some pasta! Staff was friendly."
1,I love Tutti Santi on 16th St! The service is always top-notch. The setting is authentic Italian. It is the one place in town where I can get orange roughy-my favorite fish. It is prepared in the most divine lemon/caper sauce with artichoke hearts-truly spectacular. I love the flaming Sambuca at the end of the meal.
1,"The entire experience was exceptional.  I travel a lot for work and try new places and gamble on a great experience. Let me tell you, this place was a winner.  The host was awesome from when I walked in, the service was awesome.  Not to mention the food, it was perfect.  I tried a variety of appetizers, the lasagna OMG delicious! And ravioli is to die for.... Dessert was great and had a surprise from our server, a flaming shot a some Dort of liquor with coffee beans inside.  A truly great experience, this is my first review but every time I get to Phoenix this is my first choice for dinner always.  Love this place"
1,Homemade fresh Pasta!!!! Great... outstanding food from the beginnings to the grand finale!!!!!!!!! One of our favorite Italian Restaurants in the valley
1,"My husband, son and I just had dinner at Tutti Santi. We read the positive reviews and upon seeing that it was right near the pointe Hilton where we were staying we went there for dinner. The ambiance with the low lighting and an intimate setting was lovely. The calamari appetizer was very good and the dinner salad was simple and delicious, the main course was excellent. My husband and I each had veal dishes and my so had pasta. The pasta was perfectly cooked. The veal was tender and very tasty. The service was excellent and they even had a magician to entertain the guests. I would highly recommend this resteraunt for dinner."
1,"This place is a home run every time!\n\nAlways a nice spot for a date or intimate dinner with close friends and family, Tutti Santi is our go-to for authentic Italian.  The service is top notch.   \n\nTheir gnocchi is, in my opinion, the best in the Valley.  Try it with their pink sauce (you need to request this as the menu lists a cream sauce with a splash of marinara).  \n\nMy husband loves the Ravioli alla Nina.  It's so good. Sometimes ravioli dishes are so darn heavy, but not here!  Nina's sauces \nachieve the fine balance of lightness and flavor and this dish is a prime example.\n\nFinally, try the tiramisu.  Light, fluffy and packed with flavor, this dessert is a great way to end a wonderful meal."
1,"Amazing Chicken Fiorentina and the Agnello is their lamb shank where the meat fell off the bone. Great time with friends and Sambuca after completed the night. If you ever been to Italy, this was home."
1,"I did you a favor.  You can thank me later.  \n\nI have completed an official, side by side comparison and can definitively say that Rainbow Donuts beats that other competitor.  You know, just think double D's.  No, not those kind.  \n\nIt took several hours and 4 donuts (okay, 6...gawd!) to reach this conclusion.  By my very scientific and mathematical calculations, that equals about 1500 calories.  Which is why you should thank me.  While you were out strutting your stuff, I was stuck wearing grannie panties and an elastic waistband.  You probably had sex.  I was pretty sure I would never be able to again.\n\nBut it was worth it!  Fresh, aromatic and delicious donuts are unbeatable in my book and I can't find anything to complain about here.  The glazed, cr\u00e8me filled, and plain are all delicious and worth the caloric splurge."
1,"The maple bacon doughnut was tasty, but the cherry fritter blew. my. mind. My iced coffee was decent as well. I anticipate returning to rainbow doughnuts!"
1,"I stop by here to get my Texas kolaches ever chance I could, they make it so good with either spicy sausage, regular sausage, or ham& cheese. So so sooooooooooooo good (haven't found any other place that have Texas kolaches).  Their ham&cheese croissant are so darn good also. Lastly, can't forget the donuts. They are all so yummy. Great service also, the young ladies working here is so polite and helpful."
1,"So tasty! We went to three Rainbow Donuts locations in one day looking for their famous Maple Bacon donut.  The first two locations didn't have it, but we of course tried some donuts and they are the softest donuts I've ever had, and this was at 11 in the morning, so they'd been sitting a while, and still so soft!  We finally decided on the third place (this location) to see if they had the donut we were looking for.  Her response, \""no, but we can make some for you, when will you be here and how many would you like?\""  \n\nWhat??  That's amazing service.  And the donut lived up to the hype completely!  Definitely will return, soft and delicious donuts!"
1,"Great donuts! Don't see what you want? No problem, they will make it for you on the spot! You won't get a fresher donut than that!"
1,"This review is for the E.R.  \n\nWhen it comes to emergency rooms, I generally don't expect too much.  They are often chaotic and the wait times can be incredible.  I came to the E.R. with a serious sinus infection, after my treatment at a local urgent care facility was not working.  I expected to be seen last, because of my lack of medical urgency.  To my surprise, I was seen by the triage nurse in only a few minutes and then admitted within an hour.  The doctors and nurses were extremely nice and answered all of my concerns and questions; I felt like an active party in my care, and it put me at ease.    \n\nOh yea, I've never been in an ER with private rooms with televisions; I thought it was kind of cool, and it made the downtime between tests and results fly by."
1,I went to the emergency room at JCL with severe lower back pain and had a great experience! Everyone was very attentive and really listened! They took me directly to a private room and I got into a gown and laid down. The doctor came in and took time to talk to me and examined me. Gave me three choices. I had a CT scan to take away my worries. I decided to get a muscle relaxant and give it a few days...good decision. I went in at 5:30 am Sat morning and only spent a few hours at the hospital. Super nice people and environment!
1,"YUM!\n\nMaybe it's just because we had extra sauce and extra cheese added to our pizza, but it was AMAZING.  Thick crust, flavorful sauce, tons of cheese - and they deliver?!  I'm in heaven.\n\n*Update:  We are outside of their delivery area.  : ("
1,"***Update*** So after visiting this place again today, to grab some lunch to go, I have to bump up my 4 stars to 5. The little strip mall where Pat's sits is under renovation, but they're taking it in stride. And I still got my 2 slices with topping and drink for under $4. I don't care that they forgot my pepperoni at first and I had to wait a whole 45 seconds or so. The pizza is just really good, the staff is friendly, and it is such a deal. And I never get tired of reading the randomly odd stuff on the walls... like how Sean McLaughlin stopped there for a slice after getting married... or a Xerox certification of Elvis' check for the purchase of three Caddys... or the poster for the maiden voyage of the Titanic. Just odd stuff, but I did learn today that they have a catering menu too. \n\nA huge thank you to my friend Tina, for fronting me cash after I realized I didn't have any. They still don't run plastic under $5. Oh yeah, and after Tina went on and on about how she doesn't often find pizza she likes, I got an IM from her later... \""yummy pep pizza\"". Yes, it is. :) \n\n_________________________________________________\n\nMy hubby introduced me to this hole-in-the-wall joint. For under $4, you get a lunch special with two YUMMY slices, one topping each, and a drink. I like peno's... they came freshly chopped, sans seeds and membranes. My nose was melting, but I was happy to not get the usual pickled rings. No one I've brought here has said anything other than wow. Bring cash if only getting one special; they have $5 debit/charge minimum."
1,"As soon as I walked into this place, my mouth began to water.  The aroma in here just cant be beat.\n\nI ordered the special - 1 16\"" pizza with 2 toppings and 30 wings.  Pizza toppings were Mushrooms and Onions.  I lamented this topping combo, but it was what my girlfriend wanted.  I got the wings hot, also ordered the Calzone sampler to try it out.\n\nWhen I opened the wing box, the steam that rose from the box made my eyes and nose water.  It smelled so good I had to eat one right there at the counter.  One of the owners told me that the wings are even better if you eat them in house.  The next time I am in the area, I will try it out.\n\nI took the pizza home and cracked open the box.  The mushrooms were thick, and the onions appeared at though they were cut by hand.  The sauce was rich, and the crust was perfect.\n\nThe calzones were great as well, smothered in marinara sauce.\n\nThe price was great, the people were friendly.  The lunch special can't be beat.  (2 slices of pizza and a free soda, 50 cent refills)\n\nNegotiate the construction outside, find yourself a parking spot and get this pizza.  My only regret was that I had to share it.  Next time - its all mine."
1,love pats pizza me and my bf crave it almost every weekend they have a good deal for a large pizza and wings for 22.00 what a deal and the slices are huge wings are tasty and have a really good blue cheese dip mmmmm
1,Great Pizza & Wing special. Always
1,Pat's has the best wings in the valley! Some of my favorite NYC style crust. Everything here is great! Sorry... my fingers are too saucy to type!!!
1,Adobe carpet cleaning came to my home yesterday to clean my carpets and all I can say is WOW. They did an amazing job at a great price. My carpets were really dirty and now they look amazing. \n\nI would recommend them to anyone who needs their carpets cleaned
1,"I came here today because I was on the 51 freeway and the front factory plastic ground effects under the front bumper finally broke off and was dragging on the freeway.  I pulled off and remember these guys being here years ago so I came in to see if they can pull it off completely for me real quick...otherwise I would keep driving to find another shop, ha ha.  Anyhow the guy at the counter took a whole 5 minutes to take care of me and did not even charge!!!  I tipped him $20 for the help since I would have gladly paid what ever they wanted since I was in a rush to an appointment.  These guys were GREAT!!!!"
1,"THIS is the place to go for honest automotive work. I have been coming here since 2007 for oil changes, car battery, emissions and other various work over the years. \n\nI have referred two friends to this shop and both have thanked me profusely for doing so. \n\nI cannot recommend this place enough. This is the real deal and they will not give you the run around."
1,"Great experience.  Rick is a really friendly guy, very knowledgeable on blinds.  I was able to text photos to his son (office manager) which made the repairs easier.  Very reasonably priced.  Replaced all four brackets since three were broken and an older style.  Only charged me for one bracket.  I highly recommend.  But I would call as it's a family run business."
1,"When my boss orders us supervisors lunch, he always gets Spinato's!  I'm more excited about having it than I am having him pay for it!\nI love the square pieces and thin crust.\nAnd, yes, there is just something about the sauce!"
1,"HORRIBLE!!  I had to wait for my Spaghetti and Meatball stuffed Calzone!  They should have known I was coming!!!  \n\nThe food was just as good as I remember from 2 years ago...maybe even better!  We had dinner there Saturday night and it's now Sunday and I'm drooling thinking about my leftovers in the fridge...That yummy, yummy, yummy sauce....mmmmmmmmmm.\n\nOK, *burp* (excuse me) I'm back... mmmm that was good! \n\n:(  Now I have no more left :(\n\nUnfortunately, they don't have one in Chandler...I wonder if I can get Mr. Spinato to open up a 5th one out here! *hint* *hint*"
1,"HOLY SMOKES! I now have FOUR favorite Phoenix pizza places! \n\nWith pizza I'm all about the sauce, and this is the shizz! Yeah it's sweet, like really sweet but I freakin' LOVE it! It's soooooooooo good that I don't even want a topping,  just cheese and that fabulous sauce! This maybe my new favorite pizza but it's such a tough call. \n\nFor the record ... the best in Phoenix (for me) ... in no particular order.\n\nPizza A Metro (pepperoni) \nSpinato's (cheese) \nCibo (Diavola which is the best topping I've ever had on a pizza)\nPane Bianco\n\nAll three just rock my world, man do I LOVE Spinato's!"
1,Best pizza in town!
1,I can't get enough of this pizza. Tonight I took my friend there for her birthday..started with the house salad which was crisp and refreshing.. the ranch was ranch and didn't taste like seasoned mayo.awesome. I ordered the lil margherita and couldnt wait to taste that sweet goodness they have for a sauce and lo and behold the margherita is a white pizza???? You know what? It didnt matter it was magnificent without the signature sauce. This place is the best pizza place in Phoenix...hands down
1,"REALLY Good! It's so good, it makes good look not so good! I can honestly admit that this place was the second best pizza joint I've been to in my life (the first being some random italian mom and pops in NY that I forgot the name of). \n\nThe spinach pizza was extremely tasty, the sauce and the cheese went hand in hand without overpowering the spinach. The calzone was very enjoyable. I haven't had one before, so I went ahead and decided to try it at a place that had good pizza, and the spaghetti calzone was a great compliment to the entrees. This was also the first place I've been to aside from Taps that actually has Blue Moon on tap, which is very cool."
1,"I lovey lovey lovey this place. I'd rather not tell you about it because I hate waiting for a table!  \n\nEven if you are a pepperoni person like me, you should get the sausage. The slightly spicey is the perfect mix for the slightly sweet sauce. \n\nYou know when you play those party conversation-type games? What one thing would you take to a deserted island? What book changed your life? If you could only eat one meal for the rest of your life what would it be? My answer is Spinato's pizza. YUMMY!"
1,"GREAT pizza place!  The thin crust pizza is AMAZING!  I ordered take out for the first time and everything was absolutely perfect.  The dining room seemed to be fairly busy, but that is to be expected for a Saturday night."
1,"I have never been disappointed at any of the spinato's locations! \nI first went to the one in Tempe. It's a weird location, in a business park. It's byob, wich was great! I tried the spinach pizza and I could not believe how perfect it was. \nAll the things I love at spinato's:\nThe spinach pizza, sometimes I add sausage or meatballs.\nThe L'Italiana.\nThe get meaty.\nThe mushroom sausage.\nThe Bruschetta.\nIf you want jalapenos on your pizza but others don't the will even heat them in the oven for you to put on at the table,instead of just slinging some cold ones at you.\nThe service is always super friendly without being annoying.\nThe only other pizza I like as well  in town is at pizzaria bianco.\nGive these people your money, they deserve it!!"
1,Calzones are the best.
1,Hnnngffff their signature spinach pizza\nIt's the only thing I've ever ordered there\nAnd it alone warrants 5 stars.
1,"Excellent service, delicious food in a family environment! Whats there not to love? We left with a smile on our face and lots of pizza :)"
1,Best Pizza in Phoenix...Period!! \n\nSweet sauce. \n\nCrispy crust. \n\nNever have had a bad experience here and I have been here at least 10 times. Staff is always welcoming and polite. Also if you happen to have room at the end of your meal order the fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.
1,"This is the best pizza in Phoenix.  I have only been to this location once, but I have been to the Bell/16th St. location numerous times.  Their canolies are amazing too.  They get extremely busy on weekend nights, so plan ahead.  I think they are closed on Sundays or Mondays too."
1,They get 5-stars because they have gluten-free pizza!! I usually get their Mamma Spinato's signature pizza. It's wonderful! Like nothing I have ever tasted before.\n\nTheir wait staff is always good and very efficient. It's always crowded so try not to go at peak times.
1,"Let me just say that I freaking LOVE Spinatos. I've been a handful of times and always forget how much I love it. I wanted some pizza yesterday so we decided to shoot up here. it's in a strip mall, but don' t let that fool  you. This place is the REAL DEAL when it comes to great pizza in the Valley. Their specialty is this marinated spinach and tomato pizza and it's awesome. WE opted to each order our own personal pizza, that's around $7 and comes with the perfect amount of pizza for one person. I went with the Super Six: pepperoni, sausage, ham, mushrooms, onions and peppers. Wifey went with the spinach special with ricotta, which was another  fifty cents, no biggie. My daughter always gets the kids cheese ravioli, $4. The service is fantastic, just a real small restaurant feel.  Get there early, it gets crowded. On Wednesdays ,they have half off bottles of wine..score!"
1,One of my all time favorite restaurants but today's delivery girl was a little ray of sunshine! Such a refreshing change from most delivery people! Thank you spinatos for being a cut Above!
1,Hells yeah!
1,"My family and I have been here several times and have NEVER had bad food, service, or experience. We have NEVER had better pizza, and ever since we discovered Spinatos, we have literally never ordered or had Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Domino's, or Little Ceaser's ever since!"
1,place is too good
1,"I just visited their new location at 7th Street and Missouri.  The baked spaghetti calzone (with meatballs and ricotta cheese) put me into a wonderful afternoon food coma.  The personal size is more than enough for a filling lunch, but you need to get the regular size if you want to take some leftovers home.  They have such amazing food and they have a beautiful new building now too!"
1,"Good food, freakin' BEAUTIFUL  building, my mother & I sat in the bar, and after I said something to an EXTREMELY loud waitress at the table behind us (geez servers, inside voices, please!), everything was great. Good, attentive service by a fella, really good food, we'll be back."
1,"Notice the cool eyeglasses that I'm sporting these days?  I got them at Sassy Glasses!  You see unfortunately there's this strange thing that happens when you get older than 40- you start to lose your eyesight!\n\nSeriously I was struggling with seeing.  It got so bad I didn't like to read anymore and I'd have to go to bed at 8:00 because my eyes were so tired I couldn't see anymore either.  Everything was blurry. \n\nSo I went to the eye doctor and he gave me a prescription for guess what.... BIFOCALS!  If' you're over 40 and a woman you know what a serious blow this is to one's ego! \n\nIn any case, I took my prescription to Sassy Glasses and they hooked me right up with a stunning pair of transitional bifocals that look pretty cool!  (Sounds like something Miley Cyrus would say!)\n\nThey were great to work with, prices were reasonable for designer eye wear, not old lady eye wear, and they even sent me a thank you card afterwards.  \n\nSo if you're like me and in denial about needing glasses, check out Sassy Glasses, they just might have a pair that will make you look great!"
1,I had the pleasure to meet with Drew who works at this organization. \n\nHe was very knowledgable and an absolute pleasure to deal with. I am looking forward to having my whole family use this business and I am looking forward to recommending them to my friends.
1,I have gone to this UPS store for years.  The staff are all very friendly and efficient.  One time I was in and a very senior woman was sending a package.  The man helping her was patient and courteous and treated her with utmost respect.  It was nice to see him treat an older person with such dignity.  They are very good to their customers and if you want a smiling welcome when you walk through the door you won't be disappointed.
1,"Everyone here goes above and beyond!  Convenient, courteous and efficient.  If you're in the neighborhood , stop by to say hello to Dong, Vic and Stacey."
1,"Just ate at Aunt Chilada's and it was very tasty. Some people commented that they didn't like the noodles (fideo) with the beans but that was my favorite part! I didn't really care for them alone, but mixed in with the beans it was delicious! \n\nI ordered number 7 (cheese enchilada + green corn tamale) which was good, albeit pretty standard and my mom got the chicken tortilla soup which she said she would definitely get again. And I'd have to agree with the other yelpers- the chips and salsa are FANTASTIC!"
1,"Yet another fabulous Yelp event held at this locale. Great food.....and I am not a Mexican food lover at all....but again the food was very good. The atmosphere is authentic Mexican....a Bocce court right next to the walkway....fantastic patio for our yelp event....good live music....and there was even a \""Hell's Kitchen\"" celebrity chef serving up shrimp in a grille pineapple. \n\nYelp done it's usual prize giveaways....which are always fun....there was fiesta theme for this event and there was even a \""Adult\"" penyata which I don't think anyone was able to break open....LOL!!!! I found out they even do a free buffet during happy hour Monday-Friday 4:30pm until 6:30pm.....that's awesome. So while I don't drink or really like Mexican food.....I highly recommend this location for it's authentic feel and great patio to sit under the stars and Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"
1,"Attended a yelp event here tonight with my boyfriend.....never been here before. The food was excellent and it was served buffet style. Had beef tacos, taquitos, tamales, chicken wings....followed by fried ice cream, sopapillas and flan. All of the food was wonderful, tasty and packed with flavor. Enjoyed all of this on the outside patio.\nWill come back again."
1,"Aunt Chiladas hosted the latest Yelp event and what an event it was. The food was excellent. i was especially partial to the tamales...ate several. the chips and salsa at each table were excellent as well. the margaritas from the bar were nice and sweet/salty, just the right ratio. \n\nwe'll definitely check them out again for their regular menu!"
1,Great food!
1,"Very good Mexican food in Phoenix, the salsa has black olives in it!\nThe margaritas are very good\nNice ambiance and a friendly wait staff"
1,"My buddy Mike took me here after we played golf recently. We wanted something with \""chips and salsa\"" and a decent beer selection. Their chips and salsa are served community style, and the beer selection rocks. Winning! Oh, and the chips are corn AND flour. The place is really big, too, and has a classic vibe to it. I ordered the seafood enchiladas, and they were terrible. Told the server and she took them away and brought me something else. Just a really good experience. They have a Living Social right now, too, so we will be going back. Thanks, Mike!"
1,"I've shopped here for awhile......I love, LOVE this treasure of a store. Very friendly owner (Nanci). I follow her store on Facebook and love reading up on all the updates and specials they have. I even told her what I was looking for - for my daughters bedroom and within 12 hours she had pictures sent to my e-mail.\n\nI highly recommend this place is you are looking for treasures! :)"
1,"This place is great! Literally it's businesses like these that Yelpers need to know about! Such great stuff at really low prices. Screw IKEA for inexpensive furniture shop here and get great stuff that nobody else will have. I can't even begin to list how many awesome pieces I've gotten from here but one of my favs is an beautiful oriental end table that was $15. Another time I got a vintage sign for $7 that people have begged me to sell to them (can't blame them, it's pretty cool). \n\nAlso, the staff is so friendly and nice but not in an annoying paid-on-commission-way- but in a we-love-our-store-and-what-we-sell kind of way. This place is nestled within a few antique stores but Everything Goes is by far the best. It can be overwhelming since there is a lot of stuff but try to focus on one thing at a time. Also, don't be afraid to buy a chair with ugly fabric or a dresser painted and ugly color; use Pinterest to DIY a facelift. I don't even live close but it's always worth the drive."
1,Tyler Custom Designs was amazing! My wedding turned out so beautiful. Karen and her staff were so easy to work with and prices were very reasonable. I couldnt do it without her. I will defintley be using her for my next event!!
1,"Virginia has been my trusted vet for over 5 years now.  I have 5 dogs and each has had their share of problems over the years, but Virginia's no-nonsense approach to their well-being has been a godsend in this house!\n\nWhen one of my dogs isn't feeling well, the last thing they need is to get dragged out to sit in a strange place with other strange dogs for an exam.  But, Virginia comes right to the house and does the entire exam in the comfort of their own bed (or couch).\n\nWhile she has labs and x-ray abilities at her disposal, she uses them sparingly, opting instead to treat the animals based on her years of experience.  No strange vet techs or trainees, either.  It's JUST Virginia!\n\nGreat care at affordable prices is what you'll get with Encanto Mobile Veterinary Services.  \n\nYou and your pet will love Virginia!"
1,Virginia Kennaway has been my vet for over 14 yrs.  She was referred to me by a co worker who was singing her praises.  She comes right to your house and does everything right there. (I don't think this service cost more) I had two large rottweilers and a cat. It was hard to put them all in my mustang.  The rotties have passed on but she was wonderful to them and always right on with her diagnosis. My male rottie lived till he was 14yrs old and he died silently in the night.  My cat is 14yrs old and doing great.  I truly do believe their longevity and great health is due to her great care.  She does not waste  time or money.She is always upfront and honest.  I refer  all my family members and friends to her.  I really appreciate all she does..
1,Virginia has been our vet for 6 years. She has been incredible. We love that she comes to you. She is very caring and all our pets have loved her. I would definitely recommend her to everyone.
1,What a wonderful place! The workers are so helpful! They were able to resize my wedding ring (bc after I gained all my baby weight it didn't really fit anymore) Thanks guys! Keep it up!
1,"Wow, these guys had the truck I needed, explained everything and were extremely pleasant to deal with.  In addition, they helped me calculate the costs of my next move.  Efficient, friendly, helpful guys.  Great to deal with at a stressful time."
1,Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland. Insanely good selection & product. Tanzanian peaberry off the charts. Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best.
1,"Man, I'm loving this place. I've gone here almost everyday this week because it is in between my apartment and my school. I've loved every second I've been in there. The coffee is awesome, the staff is even better. The music is always playing (with good tunes, mind you) I even have had random conversations with people. I will be here every time I need to get out of the house and work. Grinder's wins in my book."
1,"I only pay for things that I like a lot. If an experience is not much better than making food or drink at home, why pay the premium? Grinders is one of those places that has figured out a way to bring all of the elements together to create the perfect flavor storm in a cup. The crazy part is that they charge the same or less than many other coffee spots. I am glad that the best spot in town is near my home."
1,"I wanted to like this place ever since I drove past it on an exploratory drive through the Sunnyslope area.  Based on it's location, it seemed like it might be less pretentious than some of it's other centrally-located peers.  After several visits, I am glad to give it five stars for being one of my favorite coffee shops in the Phoenix area.\n\nOn my first visit here, I immediately noticed two things: 1) the roasting equipment and raw beans displayed prominently, indicating that they did indeed roast their own beans and 2) the prices, which are lower than the average coffee shop (I'm thinking Starbucks, which came to prominence with a reputation for high prices but has really fallen into the middle of the pack compared with the better local places that have cropped up) and far lower than most gourmet shops.  True, you're not getting a pour over for each cup, but you know that it was freshly roasted (and ground) and it's less than $2 a cup.  The beans are the real deal, though: $10.95/lb for freshly roasted, delicious coffee beans?  I know some good places for coffee but none of them can even touch that price, most hovering closer to $15/16 per lb.\n\nAlthough I usually go for regular coffee when exploring a new place, I decided to get a latte on that first trip visit, which did not disappoint - good smooth espresso flavor and the right ratio of milk for me.  The next time that I stopped in, I asked a few questions about the beans and bought a cup of coffee.  After some debate, I went with their Bold roast, which I later found out is also their espresso roast.  While it makes for a good espresso, I found it fairly light for a \""bold\"" cup of coffee, and after adding just a splash of cream it tasted somewhat watered down.  In the future I'd probably go with one of their other roasts, particularly the Double French.  This is a mix between their dark Sumatra roast and Tanzanian peaberry.  I was a little concerned when I purchased it, as the barista told me to \""wait for the oils to come out on the beans.\"" Though I don't know a ton about coffee, one of the things I thought I knew was that oily beans = ruined beans, but after making it at home on a French press, it quickly entered my upper echelon of coffees.  I also picked up some single source Guatemalan while I was there, a brighter and somewhat less flavorful roast, but still excellent.\n\nCompared to many of the other places in town, this place is perhaps a bit dumpy, but it's got good character and the baristas are super friendly and helpful.  They display art in the store and even have a special night for it each month (Second Saturdays?)  It's also very quiet and has outdoor tables, so I could imagine getting some work done there unlike more popular and louder shops.  I'll definitely be getting beans and drinks from this place in the future."
1,"The best fricken caramel macchiato! Love their service, always friendly."
1,I had never been here before and the barista helped me pick an Amazing iced caramel soy latte. It was delicious and he was super friendly. The atmosphere carries good tunes and a cool casual atmosphere. :).
1,"I was a little skeptical to go here because of reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered Mongolian beef, curry chicken and Szechuan green beans. It was all really good and reasonably priced!!  Loved the green beans!!"
1,"Food City doesn't meet my regular grocery shopping needs; however, whenever I need to buy a cake this is the first place I think of! The five stars are for the the Tres Leches cake alone! \n\nA yellow cake moist with the three milks (evaporated, condensed and whole) but not soggy and frosted with a barely sweet whipped topping. Ordinarily more of a butter cream gal, myself, this frosting is the PERFECT compliment to the cake! \n\nInspired after my first try, I started experimenting with Tres Leches from other bakeries or panaderias and I have to say... Food City's was my favorite. \n\nSo, quick! Somebody have a birthday so we can get a cake!!!"
1,Mexican produce at this store is top notch!  A+...Woohoo.  Great pepper selection.  VERY Reasonable prices.  We get Kale from here all the time and it is superb.\n\nSadly...This store has now closed and is yet another huge empty retail and eye sore in Phoenix.  The owner of the plaza apparently wants exorbitant rents based on the number of shops in that same plaza that have closed.
1,"I just wanna say .  The owner saved my ass!!!! Inlaws flew in from Mexico City to be with there daughter .. Came to fine out my father inlaw wanted to see the World Cup!! We have no tv service at hm, and as soon as we got hm. He was pissed of thinking of not watching the games. So, just drove around near are house .. Sure enough this place was open at 9am.. Lol \nFather inlaw jumped out of the truck and rushed into this place.,  he said.. Yes!!!!! They have the games on!! So all of us went in,thinking it was going to be boring..not at all!! Crown royals,lg beers,chicken wings( chicken wings taste much better on the grill!!!) and hamburgers we were sitting on the far left side were the games were not being watched on.. Only on the right side, I asked the big guy if he can switch the games on the left side(but in Spanish) he said no problem.. 4mins later.. We had both games on are screens.. We went all week to watch the games. Awesome place...great fast service !!!  Thanks big guy!!"
1,"Big Daddy's is always delicious.  My favorite is the Time Out turkey burger.  You can order it with just about any topping, as with all the burgers.  I get it with jalapenos and American cheese.  The buns are soft yet grilled so you bite in and it smushes down with your burger just right.  My boyfriend enjoys the ribs, sandwiches, chicken strips, fries and whatever special is on the board.  Another bonus is the new gaming tablets from Buzz Time.  We played some free poker with others across the bar while we ate at our table.  It was really fun to have a game at the table while eating.  We plan on doing the Trivia next.  The beers are always cold and there is a good selection on tap.  Employees are friendly, prices are low, and you might even spot Big Daddy himself there mingling with the customers who are also really easy going and welcoming."
1,"I brought my 80 pound crazy Austrailian Cattle Dog here for a checkup, shots and some dental cleaning.  Let's just say that he is socially challenged and takes a bit of time and effort before he really warms up to people.  The staff here did everything to work with him and make him feel comfortable without manhandling him.  It did take a second visit and some nice doggie downers to get the shots and bloodwork done but his return for dental work went much better.  Very impressed with the professionalism of Dr. Walker and his staff.  They followed up with me and showed genuine concern for the well being of my hiking buddy.  On top of that, the bill was incredibly reasonable.  They have become my regular vet for my dog now and any pets I may have in the future."
1,"Dad's Catering just catered our daughter's wedding last Saturday at Stonebridge Manor and they were outstanding! The food was awesome, the pork tenderloin was out of this world and the Cheesy Chicken was great too, not to mention, we had so many compliments on the garlic potatoes!  Dad's also did the Cocktail Hour appetizers and the guests loved all the selection and variety. We were very pleased with them and we would NOT HESITATE to use them again in the future. The servers were polite, well groomed and excellent and they cut and served our cake as well. \nFrom the Mother of the Bride"
1,"I've been in health care for a decade and THIS is the only pediatrician office I know of that is open 6 days a week year round and 7 days a week during the cold/flu season! Not only was my kid's appointment honored ON TIME but I was in and out in half an hour! Oh, AND the doctors are really nice! :)"
1,"This is my pediatrician and I absolutely love them! I switched from N. Scottsdale Pediatrics because I never saw the same Dr. twice there. It felt more like a clinic and I wanted to establish a trusting relationship with my Pediatrician who would be there consistently for my children.\n\nI couldn't be happier. It's not as fancy with flat screen tv's and decor as the N. Scottsdale office, but the care my family has received has been stellar. Pretty much everyone I know goes to them know and I haven't heard anything but positive stories.\n\nDuring flu season, they're open on the weekends! Who does that? I feel 100% confident about recommending them."
1,"Bobby D's. Oh my what can I say about you? Except that I LOVE YOU! \n\nCheap drinks, jukebox filled with awesomeness, darts, video games, lots of tv's to watch the games on, amazing food (try the salad with grilled chicken you won't regret it), amazing staff (Barb is the best), the regualrs are super friendly, its a mix of young and old, and atmosphere is super relax.\n\nOh Bobby D's you're a little hole in the wall but you're one of my favorites and I wouldn't change a thing about you."
1,"Mothers Day Brunch was awesome from the lamb comps, prime rib, crab legs, Belgium waffles, bacon, omelette, shrimp, sausage and orange juice. Great service and totally stuffed to the point where we could barely move afterwards."
1,"Rick is the best bartender in AZ!  Food is delicious and the restaurant has great ambience.  Entry says Breakfast and Brunch, but I recommend dinner..."
1,"I have never felt this way about a restaurant in a very long time. \n\nI can't even begin to describe how beautiful this experience was. I had brought a date to this great restaurant thinking I have never been here why not. (I don't think my date was worth taking to this nice of a place) We showed up around dusk and eating dinner right by the window seeing all of Arizonas beauitiful colors in the sky was so delightful. \n\nAny anniversery or date or birthday for a special one, I would get a reservation asap!!!!\n\nps the bar a level lower is also great. Dance floor and outside patio with view. GREAT!!!"
1,"What a fantastic experience! \n\nWe made our reservation with OpenTable, mentioned that it was our anniversary, and we requested a booth with a view if possible. That is exactly what we got. There are only two booths available but from what i could see there isn't a bad seat in the restaurant.\nWe started out with a couple of cocktails and went over the extensive wine list. The captain helped us out with our menu selections, and what really impressed me was that he didn't just automatically recommend the highest priced entree.\nWe asked to share the Lobster Bisque and they brought it out in two bowls. It was fabulous. My wife got the Pork Tenderloin, I got the Ribeye. \nNot sure what varietal to pick, we asked for the sommelier, who again to our surprise, recommended a few reasonably priced Syrahs. After discussing a few of the choices we went with a 2006 T-Vine which was perfect with both entrees. \nThe entrees were full meals, with excellent sides. Very filling too.\nFrom the captain to the busser, the service was great. The timing was perfect throughout. During the evening, both the assistant manager and manager stopped by the table to see how we were doing.  We shared a dessert that came on a Happy Anniversary plate. Toward the end of the meal we advised the manager that we had planned on a cab ride home. He took care of getting us a cab and told us to just relax at the table until it arrived. My coffee was kept full until the cab was announced and we got home safely in a nice Escalade for a couple of dollars more than one of the discount cab services. ( that was a nice surprise too!)\nWe will definitely come back and are happy that we found a 5 star restaurant in our neighborhood."
1,"I had never heard of this place. I became a member of Open Table and they kept recommending it. I am very glad I decided to make the reservation for The Valenite's Weekend. The menu ran Saturday, Sunday and Monday so that was nice. \n\nThe dinner included 3 courses. A glass of champagne was not included with meal.\n\nWe had a table right next to the floor-to-ceiling windows providing spectacular views of the valley of the sun. If you don't get a window seat, don't worry--the tiered dining room affords great views from every table.\n \nHappy Valentine's Day!!! Make it special..."
1,"The food, the ambiance, the service, it was all amazing.  I think everything was awesome because I was with awesome people.  The view outside is also gorgeous.  \n\nWe were here during restaurant week and had their 3 course meal.  I got the duck ravioli, the filet minon, and the creme brule for dessert.  I sampled their lobster bisque and I wish I had gotten that instead of the duck ravioli.  My filet minon was cooked well done because I am currently pregnant and it was still surprisingly tender.  The creme brule was delightful as well."
1,"Update to my review, dined here again recently and it gets better and better.  If you go here, and the special is a meat or fish that you would like, get it.  The specials are SOOO good and really big!  They stay seasonal and change things up, so hard to say exactly what you should get, but the food honestly speaks for itself.  It's worth every penny.\n\nService is great and friendly as well, and every seat in the room has a good view, so not worth complaining if you don't get a window seat."
1,"We just moved from Florida and I was looking for a Restaurant with great food, service and a great view to celebrate my husbands 61st Birthday on Friday. It was suggested by a friend to try A Different Point of View... We are so glad we did... Let start by saying the drive up the cliffs to the restaurant was an adventure my Kia wasn't happy about but we made it.. AMAZING views... Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative. We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief! Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef! Nice touch... Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesn't like any thing on his rib eye and doesn't like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals. I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it- it was perfect. He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish... The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor... \n\nThe dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good. The sun was setting and the lights were twinkling-- Just a wonderful experience.. \n\nI can't wait to go back when it's a little cooler to sit outside...Don't miss this wonderful casual affordable piece of Heaven!"
1,"wow!!! incredible views, service off charts and food was as exotic as i have seen i would come back over and over again if i could afford it definatey a special occasion place!!"
1,"The views from this restaurant are amazing.  We were very pleased with everything from the wine list to the dark chocolate for desert.  The menu is nice the food presentation and qualtiy \""the best\""."
1,"We dined here on Monday, May 21st and took advantage of the Restaurant Week prix fixe offer.  All items on the prix fixe offer are part of their regular menu.\n\nStarted off with an amuse bouche of cucumber and heirloom tomatoes - tasty.  Then, foccacia and another type of nondescript bread with 3 spreads: goat cheese and olive oil emersion, piquillo pepper pesto, and lemon butter - all good.  First course was their signature lobster bisque - smooth, creamy, delicious.  Second course was their risotto of the day (tomato, saffron, chicken sausage and grilled shrimp) for me and the halibut for my husband.  Both were well prepared with fresh ingredients and tasty.  Dessert was their signature vanilla creme brulee with strawberries for me and their espresso cup (chocolate cake with white chocolate marscapone filling, topped with coffee ice cream and a light milk chocolate sauce) for my husband - both were super tasty!  Portions were significant - you won't be leaving hungry.\n\nView was amazing.  Ambiance was cozy, quiet and romantic.  Service was excellent.  I would definitely come back here again and bring visitors.\n\nIf it wasn't so hot outside, I would also dine out on their patio by the fire pit."
1,Fabulous! Great views (obviously) of the city. Very romantic. Amazing wine list. Superb service. Delicious menu. \n\nLuis was our server - great guy full of very helpful information (especially wine pairings). LOVE the lobster bisque (I'm usually not a fan of lobster or bisque). Amazing flavor combinations in everything we tried. I also love ending my meal with a perfect vanilla bean creme brulee. \n\nHighly recommend if you're bringing a newbie to Phoenix or if you'd like a romantic night out.
1,I simply cannot review this place because it's too amazing.
1,"DPOV is the best restaurant I have ever been to. The views are amazing, the atmosphere is great, and the staff is really nice. Each time I've come here with my wife, it's been a special occasion and the staff has always done something personalized for us to make the night special. We got to meet Chef Anthony and he even made a special surprise appetizer for us a few times. I brought my wife here for our first date, proposed to her here, and we even got married on the balcony outside. Dining in Phoenix doesn't get better than this. To me, it's the Ritz Carlton of restaurants"
1,"I'm on a positive yelp review writing kick because I'm in a good mood, so I thought I'd share this experience with Different Pointe of View. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here right before we saw Louis CK perform at the Celebrity Theater. In making the reservation, he had casually mentioned this. \n\nWe show up to the restaurant, and first of all, I was really blown away with where this place is located. It has a beautiful view overlooking Phoenix and it's tucked away in a mountain side or something. \n\nThe hostess was incredibly sweet and greeted us and for some weird reason knew who we were right when we walked in. We were sat right away and everyone who came to our table were charming and polite. \n\nWe started with the butternut squash ravioli, seared scallops, and the lobster bisque. Oh my goodness. I can't even begin to explain, there was such complexity in the flavors, it was very good. \n\nMy boyfriend got the Artichoke pesto chicken and I got the trout. Again, I cannot begin to explain how delicious our meal was. The flavors all melded so well together. My dish came with mushrooms and I completely cleaned my plate. I despise mushrooms! But these were really something else. We skipped dessert, but the table next to us as we were leaving made us regret that decision because it looked incredible. The bill was pretty up there, but, what is to be expected from a place like this? The view, service and food; it all somewhat felt worth it to me.\n\nUpon leaving, the hostess not only remembered who we were but also told us to have a great time at the show. I know it's her job as a hostess to be inviting, but I feel that's something that takes a little more effort to do, and it was greatly appreciated and really made the dinner feel that much better. \n\nThis is a wonderful date night restaurant. My boyfriend and I both agreed if we ever find ourselves in Phoenix again, we will definitely come back to this place."
1,"My husband and I committed to trying a rare, expensive restaurant on each anniversary. This year, we were led to A Different Pointe of View. Everything was special and delicious, just as one would hope for a celebratory occasion. A welcome surprise was the service provided by Luis. He gave the right amount of suggestions for courses, wine and timing - all with a sense of humor one would not expect from such a fine restaurant. (At one point, he compared himself to Cesar Milan.) We shared the Short Ribs Ravioli and Steamed Cedar Creek Clams as 2 courses, at Luis's suggestion. It felt so European! My husband savored the Coffee Brown Sugar Seared Pork Tenderloin, while I especially enjoyed Luis's suggestion of Grilled Cedar River Marinated Hanger Steak. The both proteins were some of the most tender I've ever tasted. The hanger steak was a thin serving and the perfect portion. To end, we chose a Midnight Espresso Cup, but Luis also brought us the creme brulee, too. As he said, \""You can't come to the Pointe and miss out on the creme brulee.\"" He was SO right. I hate dessert and it made me never want to say no to a dessert again. One thing to remember is to prepare for a long service. Food like this is worth it. My one complaint: the clam broth was underseasoned. Seems like small potatoes to me."
1,"DPoV is a great place for celebratory dinners and such and it isn't cheap but in my opinion it is very much worth every penny\nThe view is breathtaking and I love the floor to ceiling windows\n\nThe host/servers are very professional, friendly, and not over bearing\n\nThe crowd is very diverse but mostly older (30+)\nWhen dining here I was the youngest one and everyone was having wine, whereas I was having a cocktail.... I felt young... but my cocktail was nice and sweet!\n\nI had a three course meal which consisted of\nAppetizer- Grilled Pancetta Wrapped Shrimp \nMain Course-Coffee Brown Sugar Seared Pork Tenderloin\nDessert-Chocolate Hazelnut Brown Butter Brownie\n\nEach dish was prepared brilliantly and the presentation was exquisite\n\nI was very much in love with my main course, the Coffee Brown Sugar Pork Tenderloin\n\nI don't drink a whole lot of coffee so I was kind of iffy in having my pork tenderloin coated with it but I was surprised\n\nIt was so good!\n\nAlso, the restaurant allows you to go out to the patio and take photos or just take in the magnificent view"
1,I have been to many great restaurants and this meal ranked in the top 20 of all-time. We had the tasting menu and I highly recommend it. Great restaurant with a fantastic view1
1,"Who knew Arizona had views? :) I took my boyfriend here for his birthday after a rough week of school and this establishment was perfect, it even RAINED and we still had the best time.\n\nI wanted to take him to a restaurant with a view, and we were growing tired of the Downtown Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurants so I decided to try this place. The vibe of the place is very dressy, sophisticated, so come in your best dress. Reservations are flexible (I used OpenTable) and we were seated promptly near the window, with a gorgeous view of the city on a Friday night. If you have time, be sure to go to the Terrace Room for drinks, so you can have a cocktail and sit atop the hill and warm up next to the fire. \n\nOnce seated, our waiter was super courteous and funny, even the busboys were extremely gracious and polite. I never felt pressured to order anything (though they DO have a $9000 bottle of wine on the menu!) and was never intimidated by the atmosphere. We had focaccia bread the lobster bisque to start, and it was very impressive, be mindful that the texture is smooth, not chunky, and the flavors are very complex. We loved it. For entrees, I had the grilled endive and apple salad, which was surprisingly refreshing and not too sweet! The boyfriend had the duck breast and potato cakes, which had a perfect cook and looked just beautiful. \n\nWe finished by sharing a Birthday chocolate cupcake, which was cold but free :P As I think about it, I think the food was pricey mostly due to the location and the view, but I really can't say anything negative about the food, it was great. Take your loved one to this restaurant for great food and the experience. Definitely one of a kind in Arizona."
1,"This was a treat a fiesta in my mouth with delicious. \""All shit was good\"" it was good from start to end. Would love to come here again and try the chief specials. Very nice chief, he came out to greet us while we complimented his wonderful exploring work.  Everyones tastes buds and bellies were 100% happy :)"
1,"What a pleasure to dine in this establishment. It is expensive, but worth it! The food was prepared and deilvery to perfection. The Lamb Loin was tender. Superb Lobster Bisque, Scallops to die for and a very tasty Halibut.  The waiter, Ian Cahill was outstanding. The Chef, (From Chicago) came out and greated us when he heard where we were from. On top of all this, the View, over looking Phoenix, was beautiful. Patio drinks outside in the evening. If you can afford it, this is a must visit."
1,"The best view in the valley! The patio overlooks the valley,  what a great place to relax and sip on some wonderfully prepared cocktails with your significant other.  The food is always something special,  artfully prepared.  The staff is always on point and ready to please."
1,"Amazing restaurant-went here last August (2013), and can't believe I didn't review it.  Have been talking about it ever since and have sent several people here-all said the same things about it.  Great food, great service, great experience."
1,"This place gets a 5 star in a heart beat. Absolutely romantic restaurant at the very top of a mountain in Phoneix. It gives you a breathtaking view of the city. Beautifully decorated patio area, with gorgeous flowers, nice breeze and excellent service. The food is perfect. This is an upscale restaurant you want to go to with a significant other or to celebrate something nice. It's soooo nice! :)"
1,"This restaurant delivers on taste, presentation and the view.  My wife and I came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We enjoyed their gourmet  duck dish and a fabulous creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e  for dessert.  Service was impeccable!"
1,"The food and service are fantastic, but the real star is the view - best spot for date night in the valley."
1,"This is an upscale restaurant located in the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort. If you're looking to impress your date, celebrate a birthday or anniversary, this is the place! The food was amazing, service was impeccable and the view was just breathtaking. I came here with the PHX Yelp family, that recently adopted this Nashvillian, during Restaurant week earlier this year. They offered a 3- course Prix Fixe at $40 which was very affordable for what you get. My dearest Mike D. and I shared our selections: Guacamole, can't remember what the other app was (sorry), pork tenderloin, seared ahi, creme brulee and chocolate mousse. Everything was delicious...except for the pork tenderloin; I found it to be a bit on the dry side. \n\nDifferent Pointe of View will always hold a special place in my heart."
1,"$39.95 for the prix fix dinner which is an appetizer, entree and dessert.  It's such a great deal! And the place is gorgeous for this birthday dinner!\nChose the artichoke/lemon ravioli which was perfection.  My son chose the lobster bisque which he loved.  Next I chose the pork tenderloin with sauces and some type of polenta cake (forgive me for not remembering all the unique toppings), he chose the steak with risotto (again, unique toppings with it) = fantastic melt in your mouth eating.  Dessert for me was a chocolate, sea salt carmel cake and he chose a lemon angel food with sherbert....and with that I could barely get up and walk out of the restaurant.\nBeautiful view of the city as it is so high up, and they sat us inside near the windows for a view.  \nFantastic service with 3 people serving you or cleaning up or wiping tables, etc.\nThis is our new go-to place for special dinners or a wedding when that time comes.  The place is beautiful, unique as it is so high up and the architecture of the building alone is so different and just wonderful overall!\nHave a special dinner coming up?  Try Different Pointe of View, because you cannot go wrong with that choice.  Loved it!"
1,Had a great time. The view was fantastic. 5 course meal was awesome. Can't wait to come back. Top notch!
1,"This is the place to go to if you just want to have a drink and sit, look out over the Valley and relax!  My new go to place definitely!\nThe only downside here is the parking.  You park yourself, and when you step out of the car the ground is slanted which makes your brain feel like you are somewhat drunk...very weird feeling.  Then you huff and puff up the hill to the location...not that hard but I like to be dramatic.\nThe building is 32 years old they told me, but, to me, looks older because of the design.  It is lovely, tho, and very serene.\nI had parked at the end where the parking lot ends facing the hill going down.  Now comes the fun when you leave.  You gotta go into reverse cause if you go into drive you shoot over the parking lot, down a super steep hill and kill yourself.  So, it's important you go into reverse, turn your car around carefully because all the smart people parked in the rows back of you and slowly get out of the parking spot.  Once you do that and straighten the car out it's literally all downhill...not scary once you get out of that parking spot.\nThe head Manager of the restaurant have big delivery trucks that are scared to drive up there.  I get it totally with a big truck!\nSaturday night had a steady stream of couples coming in to sit, have a drink and stay for a little while before dinner (I guess).  \nLike I said, this is my new go-to place.  Very pretty, very serene--not cheap as my martini was like $13 or so--but so worth it just for the view and sitting pleasure."
1,We are vacationing here from Miami. Needless to say we know good food. This restaurant was impeccable. From the amazing food to the super friendly service...5 stars all the way!!
1,"Hotel restaurant.... Overpriced for mediocre food and terrible service; right? WRONG!!\n\nWe had gotten out and about while in Phoenix but finally decided to stay local and went to the Pointe which is on the top of the hill from the resort we stayed at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort.\n\nWe walked from our room, not for the faint of heart, and the grounds, and the building are beautiful, rocks, fountains, landscaping and all.\n\nThe third floor is where the main dining room is and as we past the second floor leading up we past a Christmas party which looked sheik, and I thought wow, that's a good sign if locals go here. The view is breathtaking and my pictures don't do it justice but their web site does. We were seated by the window and Corey took care of us along with an unnamed busser who was equally skilled. \n\nWe started with Blood Orange And Rocket Arugula Salad, and Roasted Butternut Squash Ravioli. Both Outstanding in the WOW category. We followed that up with: \nPan Seared Diver Scallops\ncharred organic rainbow cauliflower, roasted sun chokes, black fermented garlic, apple basil evoo emulsion\nAnd:\nA filet Mignon that today I can't find on their site the way we had it. With mushrooms, and blue cheese. See picture.\n\nWe closed with:\nClassic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\nlemon cooler cookie, fresh berries\n\nand coffee\n\nWe were not rushed for an hour and half, and the service was perfect. There, pleasant and efficient as we needed and disappeared when we didn't. \n\nIt is pricy. What restaurant with outstanding view, ambience, service, and food isn't?"
1,"Awesome, Delicious, Yummy...!! No words to explain....!! Excellent Service...!!\nEspecially by Louis. Worthy place to enjoy your anniversary. Scenic view of the Phoenix city...!!"
1,"One of the best dinning experiences of my life.  My wife and I recently went to celebrate of 4th wedding anniversary.  We were greeted so warmly when we checked in with the hostess and it seemed every one on the staff was aware of our special day.  Our waiter was very attentive, but never interrupted our conversation.  Needless to say, the views are spectacular and the food was amazing.  There brought us so many different breads and unique dips and sauces to try almost as soon as we were seated.  My dinner had a half dozen different combinations of flavors, different meats and sauces.  The deserts were delicious and it even had a customized \""Happy Anniversary\"" chocolate integrated into the design.  It was just an amazing experience and I know we'll be going back."
1,"What a great restaurant! The food was great, the view was magnificent. What more can you say, they lived up to their reputation!!"
1,"There are fancier golf courses but overall this place is a low 5 star golf course.  It is challenging, beautiful and fun to play golf here.  It is confusing for first timers as you first go the club pro shop which is not connected to the golf course.  But once you get through that, it is a blast to have access to free range balls and to practice the short game.  The holes are nicely landscaped and the greens were cut short for a true roll.  Some of the signature holes were intimidating but so fun to figure out where to place the ball.  We got a huge discount with a golfnow golf caddy deal for $50 which quickly sold out.  I think this place is worth their full price fee but it was so nice to play for less."
1,"I just saw this on groupon again and needed to share that I highly recommend! We bought the bingo deal last year and went over the summer-- My beau & I had a blast! We're in our 30s so we were clearly the youngest people there, but the crowd is friendly and the drinks are really cheap (less than 5 bucks for a strong mixed drink with awesome service at the bar) \n\nThe deal gets you a whole booklet of bingo sheets for games covering a span of about 3 hours. You can sit inside or outside on the back patio (better). Their menu is pretty basic. We just ordered fries, but heard the fish 'n' chips were awesome. Oh, and I won $100. Beginners luck?\n\nIf you go on a Friday, there's an old-school band that starts playing just before bingo gets out in the lounge. Dapper shoes optional\n\nps- We're not Italian."
1,"Great repair service!  When we arrived home after a 4 day vacation we found our refrigerator was too warm. We had to call out repair and I found this company. They came out and diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes. We had also had problems with our ice maker for years. The first day he fixed the ice maker and charged us the service fee, and a part had to be ordered,  but he was able to get the fridge back into cooling mode.  Two days later the tech came out and was in our house for less than 15 minutes. He replaced the broken part. Final cost for repair was $158 (they only charge service call for the first visit).\n\nI will use them again and again for appliance repairs. Superior service at fantastic prices."
1,I just had them here to install a new fridge and take away my old fridge they were very nice and the first thing they asked is if we have any dogs or cats so he could shut the door. They came out the next day and gave a call prior to arriving. I would definatly recomend them again.
1,"Boom, just dropped off my stove that no one on the planet could figure out how to get it to work with propane and not only did it only cost me $70 but they did the work same day!  What else is there to say??  I am so pissed that I spent money to have 2 other people come out and take my money to leave me with a stove that still does not work.  I am such in a good mood that I dont have to get screwed anymore, thank you B&B!  Also if you are looking for used applicances they have a large showroom and even back thier stuff up with a warranty.  I was ready to purchase a stove top from them if they could not fix it but they rocked so I will have to buy something else from them.  I like building a relationship with a quality company and will definitely come back."
1,"Oh, how I miss you Wendy's Nails (especially Anne, she's THE BEST!) I went to you for years and never had a disappointing visit.  I've been in CA for 1.5 years now and have tried 6 different salons.  I just can't find anyone great :(\n\nTo my fellow yelpers in Phx, take advantage of this wonderful little salon.  I wish I still could!"
1,The best at removing ingrown nails.
1,I was in desperate need for a haircut and I needed to get in a salon right away. I called salon surreal to ask how much a haircut costs there and when they told me $50 I thought that was really expensive but they were able to fit me in right away so i made an appointment. I usually pay about $30 including tip so I was wondering why they charge so much for haircuts.  My appointment was with Tasia and she was awesome. She asked me what kind of cut I wanted and I told her to do whatever she thinks will look good on me. Next step was washing my hair and she gave me a great head massage it was so relaxing I wanted to take a nap. Tasia did a great job with the cut and style and gave me tips on different ways to style my hair. She also showed me some products that I should use but wasn't pushy about selling them to me.  I really enjoyed getting my hair cut at Salon Surreal and now I understand why they charge $50 for a haircut. The stylists that work there are experienced and know their stuff.
1,"I am devoted to Hiedi Hand (a.k.a. Hot Hiedi). She's been cutting my hair for several months, ever since my previous stylist moved to D.C. She's so hilarious and outgoing--she tells it like it is. Plus she does a great job on the cut and is always sure I like it. If I'm iffy about the bangs, she'll redo them. She doesn't push me to buy the styling products at the salon. In short, love Hiedi."
1,"If you want professional work from an expert esthetician, make an appointment with Ginger Lee. She's thorough and discreet. She provides an array of services including full body waxing. As waxing goes, it's somehow far less painful with Ginger. She has a way of distracting you in at the most strategic moments! LOL"
1,"Hiedi is my stylist of choice at Salon Surreal. I've been a client for a LONG time ... let's see... 7 years. That's a long time in the hair salon years!  What keeps me coming back are the compliments I frequently get on my hair color. People are always asking me what I've done different. I really have no idea what exactly changes from one visit to the next. But I trust Hiedi every time. She puts me at ease and always knows how to change the color slightly to keep up with the season or my mood. She's fun to chat with, does her best to stay on schedule and always have great assistants to keep things moving."
1,"The best thing about a haircut by Keiko is the precision of her work.  The bad thing is that it grows out so perfectly that I don't have to go back for several months, yes - it continues to look great for that long!!  \n\nI've been to other places/people and my hair is just not as happy as when Keiko cuts it."
1,"A good friend of mine recommended this Salon. And I was at first hesitant because I wasn't sure what to expect. I really liked how my friend's hair was done. I had my hair cut short, new blond hair and highlights and stylized by the fabulous stylist Ellie. She really knows her craft. She was friendly, and she had great ideas when I asked her for suggestions for my hair. The salon has friendly staff, comfortable setting, the music was not very loud like other salons I have been to before. When my hair was washed afterwards it was relaxing and there was even beautiful relaxing music in the background. It was a fun days out!  I had some great hair therapy fun. And love my new hair! I'm definitely coming back! Thank you Ellie!"
1,"Mariah is a great stylist.\n\nCalled to make an appointment and they had us in a few hours later. \n\nThe cut and condition was for my little sister - she's 14. \n\nWalked-in (no wait), Mariah met with us a minute or two later. \n\nMy sister wanted a short \""pixie-cut\"", but wasn't sure exactly HOW she wanted it. Prior to coming into the salon, her and I scrolled Google/Pinterest for example cuts. Her choices ranged from Jennifer Lawrence's recent bob to Goldie Hawn's short, vintage do in the 1960's. hahah. Needless to say, this could've turned ugly really quick, literally AND figuratively. \n\nThank God and Mariah, it didn't. \n\nShe was very, very attentive to my little sister's wants. She cut and stopped, showing sister where she was at in terms of\nlength and style and waited patiently as I explained to sister, \""hey, be honest if you like it or not\"". Great with kids (okay, okay 14) young women. She styled her hair, then walked her through on how to style it herself and what would be the best tools to use. My sister loved it. \n\nIt is an up(per)-scaled salon, but you get what you pay for, right. Trust me, it's worth every penny. Ask for Mariah - you won't regret it."
1,"For honesty, 5 big-ass stars. \nThere ARE honest mechanics. Took my car in this morning to ask for an estimate to replace my brakes which have been screeching to high heaven. They took a look and told me I probably have 20K miles left before I'll need them replaced; it's just the pad compound that makes a lot of noise. Since I only have only 24K miles on the current brakes, this made me quite happy. They gave me their car \""for when you really do need us\""."
1,"This is a great shop!  They are honest, thorough and also timely.  I have been bringing my car to them for the past three years, and they are amazing!  It isn't easy to find a reputable mechanic, but Jose at A & B is definitely one!! :)"
1,"Best Funeral Services has helped my family twice now.  Both times they have been considerate of our spiritual and emotional need to provide the best quality care for our loved ones.\n\nThe focus was on taking care of our loved ones and not on which packages we had to buy.  \n\nAs she guided us through the process Julia  R.  was more of a family member than a funeral director.\n\nThe end result was a beautiful, dignified farewell to our loved ones."
1,"My nephew recently passed away.  He had only been in Phoenix for a short time and his mother and I had to get him prepared and transported back to his hometown of Biloxi, MS.  I had no idea of even where to start so I went on Yelp and found Best Funeral Services.  Dr. Ken Stanton guided and  assisted my sister and I thru every step of the way and it was truly a blessing.  In our moment of loss and grief he and the staff help us deal with a very difficult and seemingly insurmountable task.  They are truly incredible and my entire family thanks them from the bottom of our hearts."
1,"Dr. Simpson is the best dentist I have ever been to.\n\nAnd I have been to my fair share of dentists.  First off, I am a bit of a freak when it comes to oral hygiene.  Second, I am missing teeth.\n\nNot that you can tell, and all thanks to Dr. Simpson.  The story of why I am missing teeth is a long and agonizing one (it involves childhood trauma, something called root resorption, and even the Peace Corps believe it or not).\n\nAnyhow, long story short, I needed to get an old bridge replaced and I had to pay out of pocket to do so.  To make matters even more interesting, I had to have a tooth pulled AND get a root canal.  This entire process could have been a nightmare, but it wasn't and that is thanks entirely to Dr. Simpson and his always excellent staff.  On one occasion I was having extreme pain, and Dr. Simpson saw me in his office during his vacation (He even had to bring his daughter in with him!  Who does that?!  Dr. Simpson!  That's who!).  He is very sensitive to pain and ensures that even the most routine visit is as pleasant as it gets.\n\nMost importantly, my teeth look great and almost everyone is surprised when I tell them that they are false (many of them, anyhow).\n\nIf you want to go to a great dentist, someone who will make your smile look great, won't hurt you, will take the time to hear about your problems...you HAVE to go to Dr. Simpson."
1,"Amazing Dentist... Amazing Practice... Period\n\n\nI had neglected my teeth for far too long... Between having extreme anxiety and not having insurance, it had been a while since I had been to the dentist.  I found Dr. Simpson based on searching for a sedation dentist and reading the few reviews online.  \n\nDr. Simpson runs the best practice in town bar none.  His office Manager (If she's not the office manager, she should be), Pamela, is on her game, always on top of scheduling, insurance issues, etc.  A true pro when dealing with all of my na\u00efve questions and showing downright care and compassion for me.\n\nHis dental assistants are super friendly, very thorough, and pleasant to work with.  I never felt judged for having a not so perfect smile and the assistants were full of informative tips on how to better take care of my teeth and gums.  \n\nDr. Simpson, himself, has hands of gold.  My treatments had to be broken up over several visits (not his fault, that's just how bad I let it get) and before every treatment I expected pain, blood, needles, drills, ax murderers... But it never happened.  Every time I have been in to see Dr. Simpson has been a gentle, painless experience.  My mouth has healed and my teeth and gums truly look better than I ever though they would.  \n\nThe sedation can get a little pricy, but I had a panic attack when visiting another dentist for a simple procedure so the extra money is well spent to not have to go through that.  \n\nEVERYBODY SHOULD SEE DR. SIMPSON FOR THEIR ORAL CARE!!!!"
1,"You look at this place from the outside and you wouldn't think much of it, much at all.  Actually, your subconsciousness would probably just have you look past it and not notice it at all.  But like my buddy's friend told him one day, look for the place that looks sort of run down with a lot of cars in front, they typically have the best food.  Following that advice, looking for food, we pulled a U-turn, went back and parked.\n\nWe were going to get take out until we heard the chips and salsa were free.  Budgeting and maximizing caloric intake, you know how that goes.  Place was hotter than all can be (the 2 a/c window units couldn't keep up), but we shrugged it off like the manly men we were and parked our arse.  \n\nThe waitress was really friendly and helpful in explaining all the stuff they make, and the best part about it is that it's made fresh - chips, salsa, guac, etc.  This place is the real deal when it comes to mexican food.  It just goes to show you how most all places bend and give in, abandoning their tradition, just to meet the \""needs\"" of the American people.  Or shall I call it ignorance?"
1,I found this place just by driving to my new job and feeling adventurous! I have tried a new thing each time. The green sauce is VERY spicy and I LOVE it! \nIt is worth a drive to the Sunnyslope area! :)
1,"One of the best Arizona Sonoran style Mexican food joints in Arizona, or anywhere in the USA!\n\nGreat thin hot chips with typical, but good Arizona style salsas...\n \nMy favorite meal on their menu is the #5, Green Chile Chicken tamale, Sour Cream Enchilada, Rice & Beans...\n\nThe tamale has lots of meat in it, not like most tamales that are 85% Masa and little meat. \nThe green chile they cover the tamale with is absolutely wonderful, very fresh green chile flavor and not to spicy as to mask the flavors of the masa & chicken. \n\nThe sour cream cheese enchilada is amazing, wait till you taste it, seriously the best Sonoran style enchilada this Chef has ever had....an end product you can only get with using the finest of fresh ingredients!\n\nThe only downfalls EB has is no hard liquor, which equates to no REAL Margaritas (Ay, caramba!.....but they do have cold beer & and wine) and sometimes theres a wait for a table....\n\nbuen apittite!!!"
1,"This place is great. I've lived in AZ for 10 years now, and this is probably the best mexican food I've had in the valley. El Bravo, I'd describe as a dive restaurant. It's one of those places where you walk in for the first time and wonder if you should turn right back around and walk out. Don't make that mistake. It's definitely not going to win any awards for decor/atmosphere, but if you want great mexican, this is the place to go.\n\nThe service has been very good to date, and the family is always friendly, as you can tell they appreciate their customers. Keep it up El Bravo!"
1,Been a regular here my whole life. Nothing better than the chicken green corn tamales with sauce!!
1,I've been taking my family & friends here for over twenty years. Authentic food that hasn't changed. Quality control is very high. It's great every time we go.
1,"Yay! I'm a fan.\n\nI've used City Wide Pest control many times for spraying inside and outside my house to control the bug population at my home.\n\nThe technicians are always very professional, friendly and are willing to answer any questions you may have.\n\nUnlike many other Pest control companies, City Wide does not require you to sign a contract or agree to a certain number of months of service. You can just ask them to set you up month to month and they'll give you a call each month to see if you would like a service scheduled.\n\nNothing but good experience with City Wide so far. I recommend them."
1,"Andy's took amazing care of my vehicle.  From detailed auto body work, fair estimates to sensitivity for how long I had a rental vehicle, Tim and his team of technicians went above and beyond!  Highly recommend!!"
1,"We had a great experience here.  If you find yourself in the unfortunate position where  you need an auto body shop after a collision, I highly recommend Andy's!  We have used them twice (don't judge), and each time have appreciated the time they took to thoroughly explain the problems and what our vehicles would need, including costs of parts and labor.  They made getting and returning a rental car simple.  They're very kind and respectful, and do a great job at what they do - both of our vehicles came out looking as \""good as new.\"""
1,Simple need but they were quick and pleasant and right place at the right time.  Good job guys and thanks for your help!
1,"this place at first seemed like it wasn't going to interest me but since i was short of time to eat before getting back to work i decided to give it a shot. Considering im from chicago a new york style pizza i figured couldn't impress me any more than the prices that target has to offer now a days. when i stepped in the door i was immediately greeted by a young man w/ a sincere smile, he brought me to my table and before you new it my drink was ready & order being giving to the kitchen. the server was very attentive i found out because i guess he saw me looking at my watch and new i had a time limit to get back to work do to when the food came quickly so did my check. He politely said it was for my conveinance incase i was on a lunch break. I was amazed!! he also asked me for my name since he had never seen me there before and made me feel very welcome. I ended up going back to work very satisfied and planned on returning to the streets again on my next lunch break to enjoy another exsperience with that server named Jon"
1,"Love this place! A group of us (8-10 guys) have tried 3 different SoNY stores. This one really works thanks to Danni. She really knows how to be attentive. We come in every other Thursday and are THRILLED when we see her waiting our table. Hard to believe, but Danni actually remembers our names. Manager is cool/fun too. Great patio when weather permits."
1,"If you are looking for an honest, caring, and thoroughly competent mechanic, then you need to take your car to Central Car Car, a family owned business (three generations!). My family and I are moving to Seattle and I took my car into CCC for a tune up and to get my tires replaced for the drive up to Washington. Paul and Rex gave me a good price for those services and made me and my family feel welcome and comfortable in their shop. \nIn the process of changing my oil, Paul found an important part in my engine that needed replacing. When I told him i could not pay for the extra part in full, Paul offered to help me with the finances, which he was in no way shape or form obligated to do. He understood my situation--the move was only four days away and the car part was necessary if we were going to make the trip--and HE OFFERED TO HELP. What a great guy! What a great family! What a great business! Easily the best experience I ever had with a car repair shop. It's no wonder that CCC scored an A+ with the Better Business Bureau. \nI would recommend CCC to anyone with any car-related issue."
1,"Central Car Care is the most honest,  trustworthy, and reliable auto repair shop I've come across in a long  time.  I found them on Yelp and I'm really glad I decided to take my car there."
1,"Honest, trustworthy, fair pricing, flexible. I feel very fortunate to have found a mechanic i dont have to doubt!"
1,"This is my go to shop for whatever I need done on my vehicles,  Paul and his staff are courteous & knowledgeable. Repair prices are reasonable with quick turnarounds!"
1,"Mendelson Dermatology is a great company.  We've gotten to know the staff fairly well and they're great people, too.  If you're looking for a dermatologist in Phoenix... this is a great spot."
1,"I've never kept a car more than 2-3 years and never needed repairs. My current car has low mileage, looks like new but is 11 years old. I am learning fast about car repairs. I have only lived here for 8 months in central Phoenix and have needed minimal repairs. When my exhaust system started to rattle and made a deep throaty noise I feared the worst, a big bill. I could tell the muffler was sound but the issue was further in. I took the auto to a local well rated ( in Yelp) national franchised shop. The mechanic told me indeed it was not the muffler but all the brackets and piping upto the manifold needed replacement for $250. He already put the car down off the lift so I could not see it. I declined and went to Fry's. There I put down a towel, went under the side to look. An elderly man came up to see if I was having a problem. I explained what happened and he immediately told me to go to Gene at Mighty Muf'ler who was an honest local business. I went there, Gene immediately put the car on the lift, immediately diagnosed it was a rusted hangar clip, he fixed it, shaved away the connections on the connecting pipes and charged me $30. In this day and age to have an honest professional, I reccomend him highly. Even if it was more expensive, he took me underneath and showed me exactly the issue."
1,I like this place ! I always get my nails done by Mr. Du himself. He is the best. Talkative and sweet and he does a really good job.
1,"When my friend had took me here to eat lunch, I fell in love with subsandwich. I love it"
1,"Great little spot to grab an authentic Italian sandwich!   They are both a grocery and deli and while I just stopped in to grab a bite to eat while I was waiting on my vehicle to be worked on across the street at Mad Hatter Muffler, I noticed that they have some great looking Italian grocery items in the store.    \n\nThey handmade my \""Italian Special\"" sandwich while I waited, and fixed me a side of their delicious macaroni salad.  The very tasty \""small\"" sandwich was plenty for me, and I'm a 185 lb guy.  Also, for the size of the sandwiches, the prices are a smoking deal.  \n\nI will definitely stop back by Tony's on my lunch break for a sandwich in the future!"
1,"You're not going to find a more well-informed, friendly, helpful staff anywhere in the valley.\n\nIf you're looking for hiking, climbing, backpacking, camping, boating or rescue gear, AHS is the first and last store in the valley that you'll need to visit.\n\nMy girlfriend just purchased a new backpack and AHS spent as much time as necessary educating us and ensuring that she got the best pack for her needs and budget.  They also put effort into making sure she got the best fit by custom matching the waist belt, shoulder harness and pack to her body.\n\nREI can be good, but AHS is great.  And definitely worth a visit."
1,Very helpful. Knew exactly what I needed (a grappling hook) and pointed me in the right direction. I will use them again. Very nice.
1,"Yeah!  I just love this place.  They are very friendly and helpful and they make you feel welcome as you look for a simple hiking book or way more complicated specialist gear.  I thought their selection was very good and perfect for real backcountry work.  They had some very cool solar lamps and other overnight camping things, as well as a good selection of rock hounding books and tools.  Some excellent picks, for example.\n\nI am not a fan of REI or of any big corporation and so on that alone, I am grateful that this sweet little company is still with us from the 1970's.  The wonderful, idealistic 70's.\n\nThank you guys, glad you are still here !"
1,"Since moving to the valley we have been frequenting Whitfill Nursery for fixing up the house we bought.  They are always very friendly and helpful when I ask questions about the plants.  We have purchased an orange tree, grapefruit tree, 12 bougainvilleas, 2 jasmine plants, 4 rose bushes, and many small flower plants.  All of them are doing well thanks to their help with watering suggestions.   Oh they have a very nice selection of large planters, we love the glazed ones! Thank you!  PS everyone can appreciate a place that has peacocks walking around, super cool!"
1,"I have been going here for about 3 years now on a referral from a friend.  I finally decided that I should at the very least repay George for his honest and good work on my car by writing a good review for him here. \nEverytime I have had to bring my car in, it has been a great experience. \nHe charges fair prices for high quality work.  But the most important thing about this shop is the honesty.  Something that is severely lacking in most of the auto repair community.  Instead of adding on items that \""need\"" to be repaired to up my bill, he will tell me when I don't need something.  That is worth its weight in gold. Most recently, I brought my car in because it was having problems starting. Sun Devil Auto said I had a bad starter and needed a new serpentine belt along with it. A $500.00 repair. George told me the truth. It was a dying battery and my serpentine belt still had several months left on it. I left happily in less than an hour and only spent about $100.00.  Easily the best mechanic I have ever had. As long as George continues to run Rob's Quality Automotive I will go there."
1,"Very impressed with the customer service here!  George and the boys are most courteous and helpful!  The prices are VERY fair, in fact, beat the competition and dealerships by a long shot!  \n  I can certainly see why there are so many repeat customers - there are thank-you notes displayed around the lobby!\n If you are looking for a small business with a diligent and trustworthy reputation, This is YOUR TEAM!!!"
1,"Around eight or nine years ago my family was looking for a vets office that was caring, trustworthy, and up-to-date on vet medicine.  We found Palo Verde Animal Hospital  via the Internet and have been taking our various pets ever since.  We've taken multiple dogs there and one cat and the care has been noteworthy for all of them.\n\nThe office is small.  The whole building is small but the care is great.  The waiting room has coffee, water, various flyers and information of interest to pet owners, and Animal Planet on an overhead TV.  The waiting room and examination rooms are clean.  The last one I was in had one of the vet's multiple degrees and certificates on the walls as well as a few articles that had been written about her.  \n\nThey're a little pricey for their services but they don't constantly try to up-sell you and sell you procedures your companion animal may or may not really need.  The staff are nice both on the phone and in person and seem to really care about animals versus just doing their job.\n\nI've always felt I could trust them to provide compassionate, appropriate, quality care. If you're looking for a place you can trust, you might want to check them out."
1,"Although I love Gallagher's and this is my neighborhood standby for a quick and easy frothy adult beverage with friends, I was first leaning toward giving only four stars -- mainly because the quality of the \""fresher\"" elements of the food (i.e. lettuce, jalapenos, etc.) is not especially consistent. But, after thinking about what I would include in my write up I decided I have to go with five stars. Here's why: \n\n*FREE cookie sundae with the purchase on an entree on Sundays (Half-baked Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut or Peanut Butter with Chocolate Chip cookie topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. You can mix it up with two and go 1/2 and 1/2!) \n\n*Build your own burger - not only can you pick your \""meat\"" but you can pick your \""bun\"" and your bun can be a bed of lettuce allowing for less guilt over the fries. I'm partial to the Greek Burger (topped with feta cheese, diced tomato, black olives, and a side of cucumber sauce) made with a turkey patty on a bed of lettuce. \n\n*Karaoke on Saturday nights and, if you want, you'll easily get to sing more than once! (I, however, do not sing. I'm pretty sure I could get paid NOT to sing -- even at karaoke. I like to watch and make requests!!) \n\n* Generally not a problem getting a seat and TVs are EVERYWHERE! But, when it really counts, Gallagher's graciously took a reservation for the play off game and, actually had \""Reserved For...\"" signs on the tables. The manager was very courteous, even when some of our group were slow to arrive. For this, Gallagher's has secured its place as my \""#1 go to watch a game\"" spot for all time. \n\nP.S. If your preference is \""fake cheese\"" nachos, as mine is, then hands-down these are the best nachos in the Valley. (If you like real cheese on your nachos, you are on your own!!)"
1,I love these guys! I've taken my car there for years and they've always fixed things right the first time. Other garages have suggested repairs. I've gone to Crutcher for those repairs and they've often told me that I didn't need them--the other garage was just trying to make some money off of me.\n\nDO NOT HESITATE to trust these guys. They're honest and do great work in a timely manner. Their shop is clean. Their staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They take the time to explain what's wrong. They stand by their work. And their prices are fair. I'd give them ten stars if I could.
1,I have taken my car in to Crutcher's several different times for various repairs. Each time they have been honest and forthcoming about what needs to be done and what can wait for another time. I have referred them to all my friends and family looking for an honest mechanic....a rare find!
1,"This is my neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and a family staple.  I personaly like the roasted / peking duck.  The Shrimp Lo-Mein is good, Fast, Friendly Service, No MSG.\nLunch Specials  during the week are awesome too."
1,"Chinese food is by far my favorite cuisine and I have traveled around the world trying dishes.  I'm giving this a five star purely for the house special crispy pan fried noodles with seafood.  They are very generous with their portions with fairly large shrimp, fish, calamari, and best of all a couple pieces of jumbo scallops.  If you are a seafood lover  this is a must get.  The sauce is incredible in its flavor and compliments the crispy noodles.  My 10 yr old daughter is not a fan of seafood, but she loves the sauce  with the noodles.  I've tried several other entres in my numerous visits, and they are consistently very good especially for its location considering it not near any of the little asias in Phoenix.\n\nLike others have noted,   service is very fast and very friendly and consistent.\nPricing is a good value.\n\nAgain,  Crispy pan fried noodles is to die for an excellent choice for $12.00"
1,"Love this restaurant!! Clean,amazing service and great food. I've loved everything I've tried, but the house chicken and xo string beans are my favorite! I've been several times and have also placed to go orders and have never been disappointed. If you like Chinese food, this place is a must. You are always greeted immediately and drinks are refilled as soon as your empty. They also give you free hot green tea. Can't say enough about how much I love this place!"
1,This place was excellent. Friendly staff and a really nice environment. We'll be going here again!
1,Had a wonderful dinner and excellent service.  Mu shu veggie was delightful as was the orange chicken and fried rice.  My daughter is 9 and was treated like royalty.  Great local place as well. We found this place on yelp
1,"Some of the best pizza I know of in Phoenix - and now they deliver. If they'd only be open on Sundays, when most hangovers occur, they'd be unstoppable.\n\nIncredible sauce, great crust, pleasant owners. Try the sliced sausage topping. The only downside is this is NOT healthy fare - I don't know what the calorie count is per slice, but it's up there."
1,Great pizza and wonderful staff! I love their house italian dressing for their salads!
1,"Good pizza, nice people, great rock and roll. Coupons, too. What more can you ask?"
1,"Literally, the best pizza in the whole Phoenix Metro area.  If you don't like this place chances are that nobody likes you and you're a complete moron.  You know who you are! Lol!"
1,"Stumpy's has been our go-to place for years.  I remember when they first opened and I'd take my small kids over to watch them make our pizza.  The service has always been wonderful and they make a great pizza.  Our favorite happens to be the works: topped with fresh ingredients, sausage, onions, pepperoni, mushrooms.  Yum!  They know me by name, know what we like, and always have a great big smile for us when we come in to pick up our order (even though they deliver, I enjoy going in to see everyone)."
1,This place is the bomb. Fan-freaking-tactic pizza. Truly some of the best ive ever had. The owner is a really nice lady who made my pizza herself. I would recommend this to anyone. If only I lived closer I would have it more often.
1,"A true Sunnyslope gem. Im not even kidding when I say we order atleast once a week.... Pizza is phenomonal and the wings are GREAT! We have had one run in with an employee being rude but, Mrs. Stumpy messaged us on yelp and we great about it! We appreciated it. There can be long delivery times but, thats because, ITS SO GOOD EVERYONE WANTS IT! Im telling you amazing. A lot cheaper than spinatos and a lot more (If you're in the area and can't pick) Delivery is cheap too so we don't even have to leave! We came in for lunch one day and the cashier who was a lady (Amber? Amanda?) Can't remember but, was SO Nice!"
1,"As a pizza and wings snob, I judge all pizza and wings against Stumpy's. The pizza and wings are simple. They make them with quality ingredients and you can tell by the way that the food tastes. Very small dining area, so call your order in for pick up or delivery if you live close enough. They are not really known as a delivery pizza place so if you are picky, just pick it up yourself. This taste is worth the trip."
1,"I moved into the area recently, and was sad to leave my favorite mom and pop pizza joint behind. I got a welcome to the neighborhood packet in the mail, and in it was a coupon for a free medium pizza at Stumpy's. I figured I'd give it a try, because who can pass up a free pizza. I figured it would just be a plain cheese pizza, but I found out it was for any pizza my heart desired. I decided to go for the Whiteout, and holy moly, what an amazing pizza!!! Fresh toppings, amazing crust, incredible ricotta!!!! Friendly and fun service. We loved it so much we ordered delivery the next day. We got the Italian salad with the house dressing, which was phenominal, and baked hot wings.\n\nWe will definitely be ordering from Stumpy's again. I am soo happy to find another amazing mom and pop pizza shop in my new area!"
1,The pizza was hand tossed but the crust was perfectly crispy! The flavors were perfect too. I had the small which fed me (Im a big guy) but could have fed 2 people. I also had a 6 piece of hot wings which were very good! I would deffinately go back here again.
1,Much better than streets of New York and there wings are the best I go there all the time
1,No words needed other than this is how pizza should be. Every single time. The best I have ever had!
1,"Went in today during my lunch break for a quick oil change.  Whenever I choose Jiffy Lube, I never really know what I'm going to get.  Some locations are ok, others are pretty darn slow.\n\nI hit this location today, at around 1pm and was on the road in less than a half hour!  It wasn't very busy, but I was very pleased with the service.\n\nThey didn't push on the up-selling, of course they asked, but I liked that there wasn't the high pressure there normally is. \n\nThe two techs were very pleasant, and the manager was very friendly and kind.  They did a good job cleaning the windows/vacuuming as well!  This location is a good 8 miles from work, but I chose it because they had the best reviews of all the Jiffy Lubes in a 10 mile radius. \n\nI will be defintely be coming back to this location!  Great job. Got the speed and convenience I was looking for."
1,Love Orangewood Vet clinic! The whole staff is great and really cares about your animal. I have never had a vet who will spend the time necessary to discuss whats going on with your pet and then some. He is so full of great information about all animals. I would highly recommend Dr. Clark for the care of your pet.
1,"concur all previous positive notes.  We had our cat in last year for work and both the staff and the doctor are excellent.  I would recommend that you use the services or if out of your range, with his knowledge of area Vets, I 'm sure they will recommend someone.  My only previous dealins with other Vets was negative.  This group really clearly loves and cares for animals."
1,"Dr. Clark is the most magnificent vet and human being, who I have ever met! My sixteen year old Scottie, was extremely ill.  I walked in without an appointment and my dog was taken care of immediately, without hesitation.  Dr. Clark was extremely compassionate.  He handled the situation with the attention that it required.  My dog was put to sleep but not before a blood test assured me that his condition was irreversible.  I could not have asked for a more sensitive and caring experience.  I have always had this experience with Dr. Clark over the years.  He turned what could have been a horrific experience into a bearable and necessary experience that ultimately relieved my dog of the extreme pain that he was in.  I left his office knowing that I had done everything I could for my dog and that my dog was cared for and respected in the last moments of his life."
1,"As embarassed as I am to say it, I hadnt been to the dentist in an extended amount of time when I finally decided to bite the bullet (no pun intended) and find an expert. Dr. J and his entire staff at Squaw Peak Dental blew me away. From the moment I walked in the door, each knew who I was (even though it was my first time in the office) welcomed me, gave me a detailed tour, and even showed me the back office. The first impression of the office is sophistication, with the interior done very modern and clean, but super comfortable. There is flat screens in the waiting area, along with XBOX and Playstation for the kids (and/or kids at heart), a very clean restroom where you can brush one more time before hearing the cold hard facts, and then a private consultation area where you can discuss new procedures like teeth whitening, mouthguards, etc. My appointment was very thorough, from the digital photography and mapping of my beautiful chompers, to the full diagnostic cleaning and assessment. At the end of the appointment, its time for the judge to rule, and Dr. J reviews all of the previous work done by his friendly staff, and then makes personal recommendations for you to work on until your next visit. The office is conveniently located next door to the Aunt Chiladas and Pointe Squaw Peak Hilton, and is on the 3rd floor of a new office building with great mountain views. I would recommend beyond a shadow of a doubt to friends, family, relatives, enemies, and anyone I can tell, to go to Squaw Peak Dental and see Dr. J!"
1,"I found the Best Dentist in town, and it was Dr. James Jorgensen and his staff at Squaw Peak Dental. They were so friendly to me it felt like they new me forever. I don't like going to the dentist (who does) but they made me really comfortable. They have a beautiful office looking out to the mountains. Its like going to a resort with out the resort costs. On that note, they are very reasonably priced and they worked with me on the money side. \nIf you are looking for the BEST call them"
1,"I recently took the Grand Canyon tour around the Christmas holidays.   The tour guide was excellent.  He was full of fun and interesting facts about AZ.\n\nPeople don't normally think of the desert and think of snow or cold, but North Arizona is quite different than the desert. \n\nWe first took a short stop in Sedona.  Later, we continued north to see snow all around.  We traveled through Navajo country.\n\nWhen I finally got to the Grand Canyon, I took the helicopter ride around the canyon.  The view was magnificent.  It was one of the most breathtaking sites I've seen.\n\nI truly enjoyed my tour!  I will definitely do it again - especially if family comes in from out of town."
1,"I've been ordering Chinese delivery from a different local restaurant for a while now. No need to name names. I ordered tonight from Bamboo China, and it was very good. The pot stickers are as good as you will find anywhere. Everything arrived well packaged and hot. I had the General Tao's chicken. It was very tasty and not too sweet. I also had the Ma Pao Tofu in garlic sauce. Very nice. The hot and sour soup could use a little more \""sour\"" and a shrimp or two wouldn't hurt. That said, the black pepper level is perfect. Loved it. Will definitely be ordering again."
1,I found a coupon and headed in. There was easy access from greenway and a clean parking lot. The guys at the front desk were friendly and didn't try to do a hard upsell. The tv in the waiting room was set to a very family friendly channel so I didn't have to be awkward with my young soon accompanying me. I would definitely come again. They got the job done in about 30 minutes and did a great job.
1,"Trustworthy, Thorough, Quality Work\nI've been taking my car to Advanced Auto for over 10 years, and they've always treated me right. Two weeks ago when I walked in and told Mike I'd made a last minute decision to drive my 1999 Jeep across the desert to San Diego later that day, he asked, \""How can I support you with that?\"" What a perfect response!  They fit me in to their morning schedule to change the oil, check tires, belts, hoses and water levels, told me that I was good to go, and gave me a heads up on what I'd need to attend to in the next 6 months or so to keep my car running.  Great, great guys and great service!!"
1,"I have gone to Crystal Optical for over twenty years. The man who owns it always goes out of his way to give amazing service.  When my kids were young, I was on the sidelines at a soccer game one time and heard the lady behind me talking about how she loved going there because he would always tried so hard to make it easy for her kids....giving a loaner pair of glasses to her son until his were ready, etc. Three other people chimed in with great experiences they had had there. That's how I've always felt.  Personal service is sometimes hard to find these days, but you'll still find it here."
1,I have been eating at Flamingo Palace for at least a decade. It is my standard against which I judge other Chinese restaurants.\n\nThe egg rolls are the best I've ever had.
1,"I am giving Flamingo Palace 5 stars because they have the best food and service of any Chinese restaurant I've tried in Phoenix.  I like Bamboo House and Superdragon, too, but this is by far my favorite.\n\nMy in-laws are Chinese food experts.  I never thought we could get them to like Chinese food in Phoenix as they are from New York, where good Chinese food lives.  But they love Flamingo Palace.  Every time they visit us, they ask to go there.\n\nI just had my book club there and they were so awesome!  We had heaps of food and each was better than the next.  Plus, the service was just amazing- this with 13 people in our group.  I had such a pleasant, stress-free experience.  They gladly substituted chicken for pork, and as other people have noted, their chicken is the good stuff.  Also, they are very generous with shrimp, meat, etc.\n\nPeople in my group actually ordered alcoholic drinks from their ample drink menu, which I've never really noticed before.  I'm not much of a drinker.  But everyone really enjoyed the plum wine.  It was pretty cool that they have some different things to offer than a lot of other Chinese restaurants.\n\nFor example, try the house Flamingo chicken.  It is so good.  We wiped out their szechuan chicken, it was spicy and fantastic.  I also highly recommend their pu pu platter and spicy shrimp.  Yum!"
1,"Food is very good, lunch specials affordable, and you can get an extra soup instead of the eggroll, which I prefer."
1,"A buddy from work recommended this place, and I was skeptical, only because I am a \""snob\"" when it comes to Chinese food... I am VERY picky.  The atmosphere is a bid old school, in a good way.  The waitresses have been extremely friendly every time I have been.\n\nNow lets talk food...\n\nI went with several buddies, so we decided to get several dishes and just slip them between us.  Their Flamingo Special Chicken is out of control good!  It's lightly breaded in a light sauce that has a hint of ginger and includes green onions... fantastic!  The Moo Goo Gai Pan is also great, awesome flavor.  The Sauteed Spicy Shrimp is absolutely delicious!!!  It's a red sauce, with kind of a vinegar and tomato flavor (not the best description, but trust me), and goes great on rice.  Finally the General Tso's Chicken is the best that I have had in Phoenix.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable as well.  Usually $7-10 for a dinner portion that could feed 2 small eaters, or one of me.\n\nThe bottom line is... bring some friends and go try it, I think you will be pleased!"
1,"We've been coming to Flamingo Palace for years and they are always just as good as we remember. Even my kids love this place, when we give them a choice to go out anywhere Flamingo Palace is always on the list."
1,Wonderful service.   Very clean restaurant.   Food was fantastic!   Definitely a permanent customer.
1,Love this place. The decor needs an update but the staff is super sweet and prompt. Crab puffs are always out quick but when we are in the mood for pot stickers there is a wait as they make them fresh.  Very worth the wait. Kung Pao Beef is my fav!  Enjoy!
1,Flamingo Special is my favorite! It reminds me of the twice cooked chicken I would get from the old Chinese\nPlace that use to be outside Metro Center as I grew up. Shrimp fried rice is yummy!! Just quit getting my to go order wrong.
1,"It has taken me a while to find a good dentist in this city and now I must say I have found the best dental office in Phoenix (.) Dr. Ortale and his staff are very friendly and outgoing. \nThey are honest and straight forward, plus Dr. Ortale does wonderful work your smile will look better than ever, not to mention all the good music he plays in the clinic...not your boring elevator music that's for sure.  My wife and son also loves the office who just started up as new patients. \nLife long loyal patient :)"
1,"Shawn Eric performed at an event at our home and all of our friends and family were quite impressed.  Shawn Eric is engaging, personable, and can cater to any crowd.  I was especially impressed by not only his skills as a magician but the fact that he could cater to my 8 year old daughter, amazing her, and still maintain the older crowd's piqued interest.  Shawn Eric has great communication skills and promptly responds to inquiries and questions.\nAMAZED!  Already plan to hire him again for future events!!!\nThank YOU Shawn Eric!"
1,"Ya know in this economy you cant go wrong with saving a few bucks here and there right? 2 loves of yummy whole grain bread, 3.50.. a loaf of cinnamon raisin bread, 1.00.. 2 boxes of 100 calorie pack cupcakes, a 1.00 each.. box of Twinkie, priceless, well, 1.00! \n\nSuper friendly and knew all about the specials at Roberto's next door.. though I think she had to many Twinkie's herself because she was a real talker and was clearly sugar juiced!"
1,"I was here on 11/16/12 supposedly the final day of Hostess due to the whole bankruptcy debacle. Hope this wasn't my last time shopping here because I enjoy Hostess Bakery Outlet and all that they offer. It's a vestige of my childhood, reminding me of some great memories."
1,My 14 month old son just had his first haircut today and went awesome! Bridgett was patient with him and very friendly. He sat in a police car while watching Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and only cried a little when the buzzer went on. I will definitely be taking my son there from now on for future haircuts! The price was awesome and the service wonderful. They really are geared towards the little ones!
1,My 3 year old has been coming here for over a year now. It has been a great experience every time!! Veronica does a really great job!!
1,"My daughter was in need of a haircut and our regular hairstylist was no longer available at the salon we frequent (she only works two days a week now). So after reading all the rave reviews about this Cool Cuts - we decided to give it a try. The closet one to us is actually Paradise Valley, but I decided to drive a bit further to try this Cool Cuts since it got 5 stars instead of 2. \n\nVeronica was our hairstylist and she did a wonderful job! She had my daughter pick out a movie to watch while she cut her hair. I am super picky about anyone cutting my daughter's hair because it's curly and not a lot of people know how to cut it right, but Veronica did an amazing job! Shampoo, cut, and style was only about $20. We will definitely come back again!"
1,"Walked in at 3:30PM on Friday to see if they could fix a failed network component external power supply that appeared to have bad capacitors.\n\nAfter the gentleman at the ERC front desk popped the cover open and looked at what they were dealing with I was quoted a reasonable price for them to try to fix it and asked if I wanted to leave it with them or wait. I decided to wait.\n\nERC fixed the power supply by replacing capacitors and had me back out the door in about 25 minutes on a Friday. I was able to get back to my office in time to install the repaired power supply on the network device without any interruption to the start of my weekend.\n\nI will definitely be giving ERC my business for these types of repairs in the future. If they can fix it it's cheaper, faster and easier than used/refurb parts from eBay or unknown internet vendors and hoping the item is as described."
1,"I really love Safeway.  Their prices are sometimes more expensive than other grocery stores, but I can always depend on Safeway stores being clean, bright and have friendly service.  The employees there are always so nice and helpful.  They seem like they enjoy working there.  I also love their Just4U app that gives extra discounts and even freebies!  It's a good way for me to try new things that I normally wouldn't."
1,By far my favorite pizza!!!
1,Where's the 6-star rating?\n\nBest pizza in Phoenix--maybe on the west coast entirely.  \n\nDon't go in expecting to get a smile out of the staff though.  I've been going there for years and they could have no teeth and I wouldn't know it.
1,2 words .  Soooooo good!
1,"I am always an opened minded person and also can give the benefit of the doubt and also address credit when credit is due. So my last review about this place I was upset a little not because the food was bad or anything it was actually good but I am  always getting teased about being hispanic and not able to even eat the mild sauce from taco bell without sweating and panting with my tongue for a drink. Lol\nBut I had ordered mild and received hot last time and wasn't pleased because I honestly at 4 wings and the rest sat in the fridge for a week before I threw them out. I had called and someone offered me 12 wings and I thought it was fair but I am not the type to really complain or go running to get free food like some people would do but needless to say I was contacted by vinnie and offered to replace my whole order and even a pizza. I offered to pay for the pizza because again I am not a free food person. I know nothing in this world is free unless it's your birthday then there is an exception. Ha ha ha\nWell I met with vinnie and he was awesome and very friendly and approachable I got the pizza and wings and able to eat the wings this time it was amazing. Best wings I have had in years they were juicy and crunchy and not small. I have been to some places where the wings are so small you get like one and a half bite of it but these wings are huge and the pizza that I was able to try for the first time was amazing as well. The cheese was flowing and piping hot and the sauce has to be a secret recipe past down from a family genius because it was perfect and not too over spiced or sweet. I am so glad he contacted me to try it out again and I know that our family Friday night pizza will be ordered from this place going forward in the future.  My kids even ate the crust and not sure about other people's kids but for mine to eat the crust it's nothing short of a miracle. Awesome food and great people and I will continue to be a repeat customer and I think that if you are reading reviews to figure which pizza place to try then look no further because this place is not expensive, delicious and will feed the whole family for under 25 bucks. Can't beat it."
1,"I've been a customer of this location since 98. The food is amazing! The whole menu is really 2nd to none and you can always count on some sort of special.  It really feels like I'm back in NY when I step in this place. The service has always been a genuine kind of friendly and they're always quick, even during the Fri and Sat night rushes."
1,"Place is the best pizza in arizona, there so nice there too. If ur getting dominos ur an idiot, use the coupon and get a real pizza"
1,"Best pizza I've ever had!\"".Staff was friendly,\nWe had the Pizza and Wings special ,also ordered the pizza pie xtra thin Brooklyn style..\nIt was amazing,for desert the Cannoli was out of.this.world! I will beBACK!"
1,"Walked in here one night randomly spoke to the owner and he hooked me up on a pizza. It was really good, the sauce is really tasty. I would def come back."
1,"Eating here right now. Food is very good, but come hungry.  The lasagna portion is large. My husband's meatball sandwich is really good and very large. We saw this restaurant in NY and wanted to try it but ran out of time. We will definitely come back next time we are in Phoenix."
1,"Great deal, great pizza. We never dine in, always take out so can't comment on the that, but our to go experience has always been great."
1,Great service. Great people. What else can you ask for?! I recommend this cleaners to everybody!
1,I take all of my shoe repair and clothing mending to these guys. They never disappoint!
1,Good stuff! They fixed my shoes within 24 hrs and came out looking like new for $15
1,"Great service and very friendly brothers. I have been to other shoe repair and alterations shops, this one is by far very neatly kept and organized. \nThey are very talented in there work. I have been coming to Yuri and Vladimir for many years along with my friends and family. They have always been honest in what can and should be worth it to fix and alter, there is close to nothing that they can't do, being in business for over 20+ years, they have mastered a lot in there work! \nThey don't just do alterations on clothing and shoes, they also specialize in luggage/purses/leather work/ keys and watches! \nThey are fair with there prices, with the amount of work and time that goes into Manuel labor. \nVladimir pretty much does everything by hand and rarely uses machines, extensive tools and hard labor is applied with some shoes like boots. \nIn general my family and friends have never had a problem with this shop! Its convenient, and I'm glad we have them, because there are not that many shops left with these type of repairs!"
1,"So far so good!\n\nNo apartment complex is perfect, but I am very happy with one. \n\nStephanie did an awesome job showing us the property and the apartment. Knowing that the customer service is this good really made me more secure in leasing here. Also the layout of the apartments was a huge thing for me and Stephanie made sure that I got exactly what I wanted and worked with me for close to two months before we finally locked in a lease. \n\nUpon move-in (I moved in the first week of August), the leasing professionals greeted us and showed us to our room to make sure everything checked out and our keys worked. Turned out we had the wrong keys- no big deal. She went right back and got them made right. The apartment itself was in great shape. Very clean, no carpet stains, walls were all freshly painted (though it did seemed rushed a bit). Later in the day I noticed there were carpet ants alongside the kitchen (yuck). I called the office up and they immediately scheduled a pest control to come in and take care of the problem. Since then I haven't seen a single ant. Next thing that went was the indoor rack of the refrigerator that broke right off. Called again and they came in and replaced the entire door versus just jimmy rigging it the next day. A+ for maintenance.  \n\nThe amenities are gorgeous. The pool is a amazing and the gym is equipped with most of the essentials. Being 24/7 makes it that much better. Everyday I see landscapers working on the property. We recently had a bad storm where many trees fell all over the place and the groundskeepers were there the very next day cleaning it up. A+ for grounds. \n\nThanks again San Pedregal!"
1,"This is a really lovely place to get your nails done. It's put together well, it's clean, and the staff is so hilarious! They are so nice every time I come in. Pedicures are $20, but extra scrubs cost more. However, they'll ask you if you want them while they're in the middle of the pedicure, so be prepared to say no if you don't want it to end up costing more than $20. You don't need to make an appointment, I have never waited more than 10 minutes. This is a great neighborhood spot to get your spa on!"
1,Love it! Always will.\nClean & peaceful. \nThey're always so kind to me especially Lanie. \nShe always gets what I want on my nails.\nAs you can see in all the pictures that I've posted. :D \nThe bathroom is always clean & the songs that play relaxes the mood.. I could just fall asleep. \nIf they bring me to the wax room.. I might start snoring.
1,I highly recommend this shop! They went out of their way to fix my unique lamp that required extensive repairs & still kept it within my budget. They are very honest & have integrity in their work. A very pleasant find. I can't say enough good things about them!
1,"I cannot say enough good things about the team at Smart Auto - and I must admit; I'm embarrassed I haven't written a review yet even after years of fantastic service. First off, this is a local, family owned business and supporting the underdog has always been a priority to me. I remember my first visit to Smart Auto almost ten years ago when I took my very first car in and learned that the transmission was shot. As any 17 year old slaving away making only $5.15 an hour would do, I cried my eyes out at this news while Rob (owner) explained what would need to be done. He referred me to a transmission shop just down the street and made sure I was taken care of. Ever since this experience, I have been 100% paranoid about every noise, unusual vibration, etc. my vehicle makes, and Smart Auto has always been there to answer my questions and provide some \""auto Zen\"" and peace of mind. I can't even list how many times I've brought my car in to Rob, worried that it would explode, and was reassured by his clear and concise explanation of exactly what was happening and IF anything needed to be done. The \""IF\"" is emphasized for a reason - this guy does NOT participate in bullsh**, upselling or generally draining of one's bank account just for fun. He's an honest guy and does fantastic work. I've even called him from Hawaii (where I now live) with \""super urgent\"" (my words, not his) questions regarding a wheel bearing - this guy deserves an award just for dealing with me. I would recommend him to absolutely anyone looking for a top notch, grade A mechanic."
1,"I don't know how many years I have been going to SONY, and I have never been disappointed. Sandwiches, pizzas, beverages are all delicious, have a great appearance and the prices are right. Love the people working there."
1,Great pizzas for very reasonable prices.
1,"As my wife says, \""They are always a 5 star visit\"". We tried the white pizza with mozzarella, ricotta and bacon and I have to say it was AMAZING!! So much so that my wife had 3 pieces! The kids enjoyed the spaghetti and pizza slice from the kids menu as well. Will visit again when in town next year for sure!!"
1,"This place is so unassuming and in a shopping center so you may never really put it on your list of places to go - but you SHOULD. The food is EXCEPTIONAL. The service is always wonderful. This is one of the places that could make it in a high traffic area/snooty location because of the food alone, but it's nice they are a neighborhood favorite. Seriously get the margarita pizza and the fettucini."
1,"The food is fantastic and the prices are great. All of the soups say they are for 2, but could easily serve 4. The food portions are similar. One can easily get two meals from an entree."
1,"I have been coming to Bamboo house for at least 8 or 9 years now and have never been unsatisfied. The lunch specials are a perfect portion size, at amazing prices.  The orange chicken or orange beef are the best I've had anywhere.  I strongly suggest this place if you are looking for amazing Chinese at a great price!"
1,"Get the Orange Chicken.\n\nBeen going to this place since I moved to Phx in 1998.  The owner used to be Sam and he recently retired.  I have heard it's under new ownership but all the cooks are still there.  I hope so...\n\nSam was always friendly and remembered my group of friends since we started coming in years ago.\n\nIf you want to try a drink, get a Zombie.  \""Strong, but Good\""\n\nGood egg rolls, poo poo platter, chicken chow mein, house chicken, crystal shrimp, happy family, mongolian beef.  Haven't had a bad meal at Bamboo House!\n\nVery well priced compared to other Chinese places of this caliber.  I challenge you to find a better orange chicken in the Valley."
1,Staff 5\nClean 5\nFood 5\nSalsa 5\n\nI like this place and tell myself we should go here more. The place is clean and the staff is great. The food is fresh and tastes great. Not sure why only a 4 but thats where I stand. \n\nI prefer the pork over the beef and the chicken. It just tastes better.
1,"Fast, fresh, delicious...how can I not love it?"
1,"Yoga Pura is a beautiful oasis for relaxation and restoration of the self.  The gently lit studios are a wonderful place to learn and practice Yoga.  The shop in the front tantalizes the senses with gentle fragrance and sounds, soft comfortable clothes, tools and accessories for yoga, books, incense burners, CDs and other delightful gift items to share.  The studios are not too big, have gorgeous hardwood floors, and provide a peaceful place for classes or private sessions.\n\nYoga Pura has wide range of classes including an 8 session introductory package that is perfect for anyone who is new to yoga.  It also makes a great gift.\n\nYoga Pura also has a yoga instructor certification program that is one of the most respected in Arizona.  \n\nThey also have massage therapists that are available by appointment."
1,"Thank You Amy D. \n\nIf it were not for her, i would not have brought in the new year the best way i now know how to... \n\nby doing YOGA! :) \n\nthe lady at the front desk was amazing ... she was very calm and welcoming... that made me feel more comfortable since i don't ever go anywhere alone... and i had never done yoga ever in my life... two new things in one night... I'm on a roll :) \n\ni met Amy D.... she is so nice and welcoming too :) it made things way easier... \n\nthe instructor was a very nice gentleman... tall with a little ponytail... and an adorable little white chihuahua that stays up at the front of the studio in his kennel during the session.. :) i thought it was cute lol \n\nthe instructor had such a calming voice and was very easy to follow... \n\nmeditation is NOT my forte... even though it was relaxing and interesting... i guess i need more practice since half the time i had my eyes open (yes, i had my eyes open during meditation... i know now ... that's a no-no) and was watching everyone else to see what i was doing wrong.. why i couldn't just relax and think about nothing... hmm.. yes definitely need more practice... \n\nthe bathrooms were very spacious and clean... and i loved the little cubby holes for your shoes and things :) \n\nthe studio was very calming and clean... and clean makes me calm... lots of space.. and the dimming light action seriously helped in the mood setting... \n\nthis has been one of the best \""new\"" experiences Ive had yet this year... and i cannot wait for more... \n\nThanks Again Amy..."
1,"Yoga Pura definitely lives up to its reputation-this IS the best studio in the valley for those looking for authentic yoga. Everyone here from the welcoming staff to the knowledgeable teachers and the amazing community of students makes this place feel like home-which is what Pura means in Sanskrit!\n\nEric, the studio owner, is friendly, approachable and always makes himself available to students.  He has done so much for the community.  He is the creator of Bootstrap-a free program for troops and veterans suffering from the effects of military related stress, and he architected and teaches the most highly-respected 500-hour Teacher Training program in the state.  \n\nDefinitely the best place in the valley to practice...and the first class is free!"
1,"I'm sorry.\nI'm not ashamed.\nI love Chili's\n\nWent here for lunch with my mom\nThe service was better than most fine dining restaurants.\nFriendly, fast, efficient, tasty.... what more can you want???"
1,"I'm sticking to my 5-star review! I don't understand why this place has a horrible star rating. \n\nWe've been here a dozen times and it's always great. I've never had a bad meal or bad service. \n\nWe came in again last night for dinner and like normal we get the 2 for $20 deal. We always get the chips, salsa and guacamole. I'm unsure why someone would just order the chips and salsa when you can get the amazing guac for the same price. I'm not kidding on it being amazing, it's loaded with yummy avocados and CORN. \n\nJames ordered the fajitas and had comments like, \""wow, these onions are cooked perfectly\"" and \""mmmmm this chicken sure is good\"". \n\nI had the grilled chicken salad, it's the right amount of food for the price. \n\nWe'll be back...many more times!"
1,"OMG I wish we had gone here a long time ago.  This is an Italian restaurant/sports bar combo that fires on all cylinders.  Service, menu selection, food quality and quantity...all top notch.\n\nThe burger sliders were to die for, along with the sweet potato fries.  How many sports bars offer sweet potato fries???  \n\nCan't wait to return and try the pizza or calzone...."
1,I live nearby and probably order from here at least two or three times a month. I usually pick up my order and order online. I have never had a negative experience and have actually had great customer service every time. Maybe they have made some changes as I see others have not had as much luck. Either that or we reap what we sew I suppose...
1,My little one and I stopped in for a sweet treat the other day I let her choose. We had the chocolate mousse cups and my bad I didnt take pics because I couldnt wait to dig in. Working from top to bottom it was in layers. It had a huge fresh strawberry on top it was garnished w some thick chocolate slivers then there was the cream so light and fluffy I mixed it with the mousse at the very bottom there was a small layer of choc cake  and the whole thing was in a flower petal shaped cup made completely of choc. The little one could not eat all of hers and it was hard to waste such goodness but I didnt want to overdose. Mental note next time one to share is good. I also bought a few of there decorated pretzels they are such pretty little works of art I want to    recreate them and put them on my kitchen walls! The staff is always pleasant here AJ's has always been a fav of mine I like their catered dessert trays they are always a hit!
1,At AJ's you can buy fresh baked pizza. Try it. It's honestly one of best pizza's you will ever have. \nStaff is very nice. Overall great experience.
1,"Great local chain.  I try to shop here instead of Whole Foods and not just because its closer to me, but because its nice to support locals for sure.\n\nThe quality here is amazing, awesome butcher case (Kobe!), great deli (Boars Head!), great prepared food (pizza is awesome!) and a fantastic bakery.\n\ni try not to go here too often just because its bad for my wallet and my waistline!\n\nOh, and great beer and wine selection.  \n\nI do all my \""regular\"" shopping at Frys or Fresh and Easy and then get the luxury items here."
1,"I have been going to BeautyWorx now for a few years, and I have had nothing but wonderful experiences there! First off, when you walk through the door, someone friendly is always there to greet you and make sure you are taking care of. Second, the place is so colorful with so many new magazines, hair books, products to look at I hardly even sit on my phone. Third, I go see Krissy Moore for my haircuts. She is AMAZING in so many ways, not only talented at cutting hair, but has an awesome sensor or humor, a friendly positive attitude, and always does a phenomenal job!!! She and I have become good friends because of it! I look forward to getting my haircuts there, even though it is a drive from where I live. I recently moved to Flagstaff, Arizona, so for me- this commute is a 2 hour driving distance. I don't care! She does such a great job, I make an appointment way in advance so I can schedule in the time to make the drive. Worth every second!! Thank you BeautyWorx for your amazing stylists, friendly personalities, colorful environment, and overall GREAT SERVICE!!! I highly recommend anyone and everyone to go here for their hair, nails, and more!"
1,This salon is very welcoming.  Krissy is an artist when it comes to cut and color.  She's also great to talk to.  I definitely recommend Beauty Worx!
1,"Dr. Nick Warner is awesome. His treatment space is clean, quiet. Dr. Warner  is pleasant, respectful and very rofessional. I wish I could give him 6 stars.\n\nDr. Warner observes an obvious  knowledge of advanced anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, and chiropractic. \n\nHe is strong and gives great adjustments, utilizing a soft tissue technique called Trigger Point Therapy prior to adjusting. He knows how to \""melt knots\"" and find those troubled spots. It's obvious that he enjoys teaching when going over the symptoms, what he's doing, why he's doing it,, and what you can expect both during the session, and afterward.\n\nHe is intuitive, which is very important in someone who is a bodywork healthcare professional.  It's obvious that he is educated well in his craft. He is compassionate and a fantastic listener and gets down to the nitty gritty. The best part is he genuinely wants to find the root of the problem and fix it. \n\nDr Warner is hands down my top choice for chiropractic care in Phoenix. What I really like about Dr. Warner is he  prioritizes patient healing and independence, and his treatment plans are effective and efficient.  You will not spend years going to his office three times per week, because he truly wants to see his patients get better and go on to do all the things they love to do.  To this end, Dr. Warner offers exercises, stretches and other lifestyle modifications to his patients so they can continue their healing outside of his office.\n\nI highly recommend him to anyone who is looking for a fantastic chiropractor.  I wouldn't consider going to any other chiropractor."
1,"When Dr. Albert told me that he doesn't crack bones as a chiropractor, I was a little surprised and I was a little intrigued.  Instead, Dr. Albert uses a holistic approach to correct the whole body physically and mentally to make me feel better.  His techniques are gentler and unique.  You have to experience it to feel it.\n\nHe is a great guy and when I told him about Yelp and I was going to be the first one to review his clinic, he was so thrilled."
1,"I think that it is difficult to differentiate between Lexus service centers as they all adhere to to relatively high standards, but I have to say that Bell Lexus is a a pure pleasure to have my car serviced at.  Like most dealerships I was not only able to book my appointment online but also able to get the first time and date I requested.  When you get to the covered service drive, you are always greeted and walked into your service consultant.  I work with Debi at Bell Lexus and she not only gets everything processed and my car in for service quickly but also always has a loaner ready to go.  This time it was a 2010 RX which made the fiancee happy because she is looking at one as her next car possibly.  It gave us the perfect opportunity to drive it around for the morning and see if it was something that we truly liked. I think we are in trouble because we both definitely thought it was a great car for her.  Back to the service though. I had my car in at 8:30 am and I had a call by noon that my 15,000 mile service was not only done but also my brakes had been replace (under warranty) at no extra charge.  I was back in my car (which they also washed) by 1:30 in the afternoon and on my way.  Overall, great service and experience."
1,"Extraordinary Lexus dealer.  We bought our car right before they moved into their new location and they treated us with the same care and consideration at both spots.  We got a good deal on our vehicle and service has been a fabulous experience since moving to the new digs.  The facility is state of the art and the staff is second-to-none in the state!  They don't play games, if you're coming in to buy a Lexus they can assume you know what you're doing and they give you the best deal up front.  I felt great leaving with my new car.  Best price, best quality, and we've started a relationship with a dealer that will take care of us for years to come."
1,"After visiting a couple of area dealerships, I purchased a car from Bell Lexus North Scottsdale. The experience exceeded my expectations in every regard. The staff led by Normand Neal was professional and the deal was fantastic. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone that dreads the car buying experience, they treat people with respect."
1,"Purchased my Lexus in New Mexico, but had my first service at Bell Lexus North Scottsdale while living in Arizona. This is my first Lexus (after switching from BMW) and I was impressed with the process from start to finish. My service advisor was friendly and efficient. My service was completed within the quoted time frame. While I was waiting, I was able to complete some work (free WiFi) in their office cubicle waiting area. Also enjoyed the snack bar with the attendant who was able to provide a variety of food (bagel, muffins, etc.) and beverages. Great experience and will definitely return!"
1,"Ladmo gives Sherry's a 5 paw review! \n\nStill loving me some Sherry's! \n\nWe were having our roof replaced this past week and didn't want to leave our little pup Ladmo home all day to be scared and stressed out by all the banging on the roof. \n\nSo off to Sherry's he went. Each morning I would drop him off and pick him up on my way home from work. \n\nHe was soooo chill and relaxed (he is normally a hyper dog) he got to play with other dogs all day long, I can tell he had a blast! \n\nOn his last day I had them give him a bath, he is so nice and fluffy! \n\nI also found out they charge a whole heck of a lot less for grooming then where we usually go. So we may pay a visit for grooming."
1,"This place was awesome...interviewed 3 other places and came back to Sherry's.  The staff definitely loves dogs...and Lottie came back a very happy camper :)  I had to board her for 3 days while on a trip and she must have had a good time because she was exhausted.  I normally would take her to one of Sherry's competitors but they lost their lease and are not close to where I live...their loss was my gain in finding Sherry's.  I would definitely give them a 5 star...only wish I could have checked out the back where she slept at night, but they do have a sample of the little rooms they get to stay in.  Only thing I would change is to have them give her a bath before she came home...just to complete her spa pkg. \n\nConnie S. \nPhoenix"
1,I've been using Sherrys for over 6 years and they are always available by phone to set an appt in advance or at last minute.
1,Took care of my 3 dogs and did an awesome job. Facilities look very nice and dogs look spoiled. Very reasonable priced. I will go again.
1,"The location is in a strip mall, but this place is a diamond in the rough.  The food was some of the best italian food I have had anywhere.  I live in Kansas City, which has a pretty large and long standing italian populaiton.  The food is a good as any of the old italian places in KC.  Everyone in my group was amazed at the quality of the food for the price.  I will keep this one on my list of places to come back to when I am in AZ again."
1,I'm still laughing reading poor Maribeth's review below; I think maybe her ex DID pay someone to play an awful joke on her.  Like drugging her and taking her to Wendy's and telling her she was at Salute.  \n\nThis place is the best little neighborhood secret ever and I only hope everyone reads and believes Maribeth's review so I can still get a table on Friday nights without making a reservation.
1,"I've been waiting to change from four stars to five and tonights dining experience did it.  The staff always makes us feel like one of their family and tonight was no different.  My eggplant parmesan was mouth-watering accompanied with their house Chianti.  Friday night live jazz always a pleasure.  Thanks, Julie, for noticing my hair...yours was adorable as well!  BTW...the place was packed...you may need a reservation!"
1,"When we were seated, the first thought I had was that the restaurant had a surprisingly excellent sound system with a wonderful selection of moody, bluesy music. Then lo and behold, I realized it was live music! A talented man on a keyboard and a woman with a great voice provided a wonderful background to a memorable evening of dining. \n\nI had the Veal Toscana. If this was not the best veal I have had in my life then it certainly was the best veal in the last 25 years. My husband had Shrimp Risotto and he was enthusiastic it as well. The entrees came with a perfectly dressed salad made with a balsamic vinaigrette that was not the usual dressing overwhelmed by the vinegar. They must have used a white balsamic because it was so subtle. For dessert we had spumoni which came encased in chocolate and was delicious and rich...nothing like my vapid spumoni from my youth in the 50's.\n\nOh we will return for sure!"
1,"I had to run here on lunch to get my oil changed and 2 tires replaced before i left on a trip the next day to Flagstaff and i couldnt be happier.  The people i spoke with over the phone were very accomodating gave me a great price and most importantly got me in and out on time to work.  I really must say i will go back here again when i get my brakes done, as well any other routine maintence im too lazy to do myself, and back to the tires they beat the price on tires for the same tire everywhere else and had them in stock for me the same day!"
1,"Recently ordered Spinato's again and just had to update to 5 stars... as much as I've always loved NYPD, I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I've had in the valley. It's not fair to compare the two, as they're totally different styles, but it's just so good. And they're local. Can't beat it!"
1,"Must say this is the best pizza I've tasted in the valley!\n\nWent here Friday night with my husband and we were in the mood for something naughty... we found it..     We ordered \""The Super Six Pizza\"", which is sorta the combo they have....    As soon as I saw it I thought, Come here you little slice of heaven..spank, spank....     I think it was a little of everything that made this pizza for me...   The sauce was sweet and had a lot of tasty flavor.  The toppings were the perfect amount and you could actually taste all the different flavors of the meats while eating them.  The cheese was plentiful and the medium pizza for the two of us was more then enough.  You can really taste the love that was put into this pie.  I think it was the owner or chef, or both that came out and greeted everyone on the porch chit chatting with everyone to make it feel more homely.  \n**** Yes I think my search for a fabulous pizza is over with, I woke up the next morning craving it...  ****  Must return, and must return soon."
1,One of my students moms raved about this place so we tried it. Now their pizza is my favorite! It's sweet and a delightful change from the corporate pizza out there.
1,"I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but I like that.  It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.\n\nThe lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait."
1,The best pizza in the great state of Arizona! Enough said
1,"This is our favorite pizza place...we probably go once a week and enjoy ourselves every single time. The pizza is AMAZING!! We always get the same thing,  a large (cause we always want to take some home!) thin crust pizza with green olives, feta and salami... and it is literally the best pizza we've ever had! Wednesday nights they have 1/2 of a bottle of wine and their house red is pretty good. Very family friendly (sometimes too many families...) but the patio is always a good, chill option. Def dont pass up an opportunity to experience Spinatos!"
1,"Spinatos is awesome. I don't know this place slipped under my radar for so long. It's been here since the 80's. Went here for lunch 2 weeks ago and plan on making it a weekly habit since.\n\nI went with 2 coworkers last time and we split a Chicago pizza, excellent, and less than $7 each with tip... Previous time to that was a spinach topped mini pie that hooked me. \n\nSo hungry now and it's almost lunch time, maybe we should make it a 2 times per week minimum stop."
1,"I'd heard about Spinato's for some time, but never found myself in the neighborhood to stop in and try it...until yesterday...WOW!! I can't comment on the dining-in service, but I definitely have something to say about the pizza! \n\nSome say it's hard to mess up a pizza, and other say pizza preferences are personal. What I loved about the pizza here was that the sauce was not too salty, not too sweet, and not too tomatoe-y/out of a can tasting. It was perfect! The cheese also quality and aplenty. I haaaaate when places skimp on the cheese. The toppings were great and also not sparse. The pizza didn't have an inch of grease on it and didn't have that soggy middle bottom like some places leave their pizzas. The crust was thin enough so that you didn't feel like you might as well have ordered a bread basket, but not so thin that you felt like you were eating off a cracker. \n\nAs Chicagoans, we had the Chicago pizza...fantastic!!! I can't wait to come back here again and try their other pizzas and calzones. So happy I was introduced to the greatness that is Spinato's!!"
1,"This is the best pizza my family & I have ever tasted. We had cheese bread, pizza and cheese ravioli and all of it was excellent.  We also tried the apple/cinnamon dessert which also was outstanding.  We highly recommend it!"
1,"We got the signature pizza which consists of fresh spinach, tomatoes, and garlic and it was fantastic.  the sauce was flavorful, the pizza was seasoned perfectly and i have to say that i was impressed! the only thing i may do differently for next time is to ask for the pizza well done.... i usually do this to all pizzas just forgot this time.   We also had it delivered, during the NBA playoffs, and it arrived in about 35 minutes, right at half time; so timing was perfect!!  It showed up hot and delicious which says a lot about their delivery service.  Well done, I def recommend to others."
1,"AMAZING!!!!\n\nWe have been coming to this spinatos for over 6 years and we LOVE it!  Everything about Spinatos is incredible - food, staff, service, atmosphere, and did I say FOOD? The food is amazing, you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  The Chicago pizza is so delicious.  The prices are great and they do daily specials.  We go with our best friends on Wednesdays because it is 1/2 off a bottle of wine and they have some delicious choices - the cara Mia is a nice Pinot they have.  We love it when Rob is our server he is super fun and always makes us feel like family, very attentive and a great server all around, ask to be seated in robs section and you won't be disappointed. another great server is Maria but she is only there once a week I believe, very nice lady!  \n\nSpinatos has a sweet sauce unlike anything I've ever tasted it definitely makes the pizza.  It's amazing."
1,"Pizza is awesome, period."
1,"Found this place by accident when someone brought in some pizza for lunch. Wow just had to go check it out for myself.  Walked into the take out section placed an order and they gave me a free fountain drink while I waited.  Very clean, friendly and attentive to customer service.   And oh yeah the reason I came in is that their pizza rocks!  Had the thin crust pep and Italian sausage. Amazing!  Yummy!  Just found a new fav!!!"
1,OMGthis pizza is the bomb that's all i gotta say!
1,"I am from Chicago, and Spinatos is by far the best pizza in az.  Just like south side Chicago pizza, thin crust.  Amazing sauce like no other.  Delivery takes a bit but it is well worth the wait!"
1,"This place was AMAZING! Amazing food, friendly and fast service, and a really great menu with lots of fantastic Italian favorites. Also, they have Pepsi products!!!! Hooray! I got the Italian sub sandwich and the hubs for a little personal pizza, both of which were cooked perfectly! Gooey cheese, crispy bread, and yummy, warm Italian cured meats!"
1,"We've been raving fans of Spinato's for a few years but what happened on Valentine's day, 2014, moved our affinity for this company to a new level. My daughter is serving in the U.S. Air Force, currently stationed in Guam. It's 6,444 miles from Phoenix to Andersen Air Force Base on a tiny island the size of Scottsdale in the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean. She's so far away. There's a giant hole in our hearts from missing her. She knows we love Spinato's pizza, the sauce with it's sweet and savory goodness, the family friendly service and the affordable prices in a time of vast economic uncertainty. It's a little slice of comfort. So, she wanted to surprise us with a gift card to our favorite restaurant but that's a little hard to do from so far away. Spinato's stepped up in a big way. Not only did they sell her a gift card, but they sent one of their managers, with a bouquet of twelve red-heart balloons, to deliver her gift to our doorstep. Spinato's act of service for one of our military members went above and beyond the call of making great pizza. They showed their patriotic spirit by helping an airman reach out with a comfort-food hug to her parents. Thank you Spinato's! Your actions reflect selfless service to others and bring great credit on your company, the United States armed forces and pizza makers all over the world!"
1,"Hands down the best pizza in town! We have only been here once but we will definitely be back for our next pizza fix. \n\nWhatever pizza you choose, I recommend the thin crust. We got a Super Six thin crust and a Sicilian pepperoni. The Sicilian was good but it was a bit too much bread for my liking (I prefer more toppings in a bite than bread). The Super Six was omg delish and their pepperoni was executed better than any pepperoni pizza I've seen with a drizzle of delicious marinara on top. \n\nWe are definitely sold on this hot spot for pizza!"
1,"Worth every penny and then some. The secret is in the sauce I am pretty sure. The pizza is thin crust and sliced into squares so each piece is easy to handle. Meats are great and fresh, spegetti calzone is amazing, and prices are really good for the quality you get. Be warned though...,once you have Spinato's pizza the other stuff just won't do."
1,"Shout out to the guy on Trip Advisor who said the L'Italiana here is the best pizza in Northern Phoenix...I don't live locally, but this was wonderful advice and was well worth going a few miles out of the way for.  Antipasto salad was good, if not standard.  But man, that pizza.  Really incredible."
1,If you are looking for pizza on the sweeter side with friendly servers this place stays consistent in its tastyness!
1,"I went here for the first time on Sunday. I got the gluten free pizza and it was absolutely the best GF crust I've tasted. They get it from the Gluten Free Creations Bakery which is local. It is seasoned with rosemary and so delicious! Prices were reasonable, staff was very friendly and I would certainly recommend it and will definitely become a regular customer."
1,The pizza is really good with wine.
1,Best pizza in the valley. Get there early if you want a seat this place fills up fast.
1,"Saturday Dec. 6,2014, \nMy wife and I enjoyed your thick crust pizza.  As usual the pizza was outstanding, the service great.  All said it was a perfect dining experience.  We have been enjoying your pizza for many years, Our server was Suzanne, thanks to her and your staff."
1,"Nice, mellow atmosphere. We had the pear and Pecan salad which was fresh and delicious. The pizza was great--fresh ingredients and arrived hot. Friendly staff."
1,"Can you say BEST CHURCH EVER? When you come here... You become family. It may be a big church but, it makes it all the better. The barnetts are simply amazing. Groups are amazing. I love it so much! A great part is they offer free day care during service so I have something to do with my toddler while I worship! I love PFA!"
1,"The scenery and the mountains around the church is nostalgic! Being from a different part of the country, the backdrop isn't something that I see often and I was in awe. Several people greeted us and shook our hands, giving this mega church a personable feel. The worship and the service were both amazing too. If I were a nearby resident, I would attend services and small groups regularly."
1,This business is recommended by Discount Tire locations.  Good pricing and fast service.  They did such a good job on my alignment I was wondering if I had the right vehicle.
1,"All good. They did what they said, when they said for the price they said... and no surprises. I've been jacked around plenty at repair shops and so am always worried when I take my car somewhere new, but I had no problems."
1,"My vehicle had started pulling to the right, and if you took your hands off of the steering wheel, it would head for the curb. I took it to Network Alignment & Brakes to see what was going on. The tech came into the waiting room and told me he had found a problem. He showed me that two of the four bolts holding the upper left ball joint in place were missing, and the remaining two were very loose. A few months prior I had the ball joint replaced at another auto repair shop, and apparently the bolts that came with it were junk. The tech replaced the missing bolts and tightened everything. I was only charged for the alignment that I needed after the repair even though I asked about not being charged for the repair. That is real customer service. They will get all of my future alignment needs."
1,"Took my Jeep in for the post-lift alignment. Turned out the alignment was spot on (props to Cutting Edge 4x4 who installed it) and they didn't charge me. I overheard the tech talking to another customer explaining, with a sample part, why they needed to replace a worn tie rod end before they would do an alignment. So again, no charge for unnecessary work and a very helpful explanation. The honesty is refreshing and I wouldn't hesitate to go back even though its a far drive for me."
1,"I have bought new tires and was referred by Discount Tires to have an alignment done.  The service took little over an hour on a Friday afternoon.  I was glad there was a Dairy Queen next to the shop.  They have limited seats in waiting area, especially on a busy day.  The time just flew by while I was enjoying my favorite treats.   \n\nWhen I returned to pick up my car, I was ready to pay for the $49.99 alignment.  Adam explained that I didn't need the alignment, and was no charge for the service.  He showed me the print out and the wheels were aligned.  This is one shop that do follow their slogan \""affordable - honest - friendly\""!  They also have coupons to print on their website."
1,"These guys rock for sure! I had a 3inch lift installed on my FJ cruiser with aftermarket upper control arms. When the other shop completed the lift I had serious alignment issues. I brought my Fj to Network on Cave Creek and these guys had me aligned and out in no time. These guys know what they are doing for sure.\n\nSide note: Prior to bringing my truck here I tried Toyota dealer for alignment and they were gonna charge me through the roof, they looked at me like I was from outer space. They proceeded to tell me I would need additional parts to get this alignment done. Well Network didnt need extra parts and it drives smooth. Thanks guys!"
1,"These guys are honest,breath of fresh air. I brought my car in to check suspension/alignment. Alignment/suspension ok. Kudos!!!!"
1,These guys are amazing. The dealership tried telling me I desperately needed an alignment and wanted a ridiculous amount of money.  Brought it to these guys based on reviews I read online.  They put it up checked it out and found out my alignment was perfect. I would highly recommend this place.
1,I see Eve here. I have extremely thick long hair and cut it about twice a year since I am extremely paranoid of cutting! (had a bowl cut for the better part of my childhood).\nMy hair is my best asset so I'm ALWAYS weary of cutting. I saw Eve.. I was floored! I LOVED my cut! it's been 4 months since i cut it... and it's growing out beautifully. \nthe salon is fabulous and they sell the cutest jewlry. \nwould def recommend and continue driving 15 miles to see Eve again.
1,"I love this place. It's a great cause and the stuff is good. I always find something here in the way of household items and women's clothing. Half-price Saturdays are wonderful. They also have low cost pet food items (limited supply)\n\nGo early, they close promptly at 4pm and start calling for closing at about 3:30pm-3:45pm."
1,"For what this place is.... 5 giant huge amazing stars! ***\n\n1. Sales on top of amazing prices.\n2. Take donations\n3. Sales benefit Animal Care and Control for the state of Arizona\n4. The men's section has great work shirts for about $4\n5.  If you like digging around for deals, this is your store\n6.  If you like digging for a short about of time, this store is small\n7.  Operated by all volunteers\n8.  These volunteers are so nice and helpful\n9.  Clean dressing rooms\n10.  Found a ball gown for $10\n11.  Found 2 sport coats for my husband for $5 each\n12.  Designer shoes were $6 but there was a $4 sale on them\n13.  Found the sugar bowl to my sugar/cream set that broke years ago, this was priceless to me but I paid $2 for it.\n14.  Low cost pet food and supplies too!"
1,"I had to turn in a leased Mazda, and the guy Mazda sent to inspect the damages just reamed me for the costs; they were blatantly over-inflated.\n\nI took my car to Dent Busters -- damage that was estimated to be 1200 dollars they did for 500.  They were really friendly, honest, and timely.\n\nGreat guys, and a great place.  I will definitely, without a doubt, go back to them for any repairs."
1,"The gent that owns the place is nothing short of an artist!  He has an eye for body work and has removed numerous door dings from a number of my vehicles, all without paint, bondo or serious downtime waiting on repairs.  Typical dings range 60-80 bucks.  Here is a tip, they have a coupon on their web site for a discount of $20.  I suggest an appointment for best luck, but I have also been good on a walk-in basis numerous times.  \n\nWorth it.  Beats a regular body shop."
1,"I needed paintless dent removal and the traditional dent removal method due to the differing traits of the dents a vandalism on my car left.  I got to work with Gilbert (traditional dent removal and paint specialist) and with Rod (PDR specialist).  Both were extremely professional and explained everything to me as the process moved along, never assuming additional work until after speaking with me to get the ok to move forward with it.  My car looks perfect.  I even noticed that Gilbert touched up a scratch on my clear coat that I had accidentally made.  I shopped around and found that their prices are very fair. They have a safe lock-down if your car needs to stay overnight and a nicely set waiting area for customers.  While I hope I never have to see those cool guys again, I will keep their info on record if the unfortunate ever happens again to one of my cars."
1,":] best starbucks around & probably one of the best i've ever been too... & i'm not just saying that because i work there, but it really has a great atmosphere, huge lobby to come study or just hangout, & the drinks are always good. :]"
1,"Great staff! They are so genuine and treat you like a person, not another transaction. This is what coffee shops are all about. In a rush? Brew at home or wake up earlier."
1,i have to change my review after talking to bobby the general manager he turned me over to Vince who went out of his way to make us happy. Very pleased
1,"I just want to say how great this dealership is.  We worked a deal over the phone and they even brought the car to me to test drive.  This is our second vehicle from there and have totally enjoyed the buying experience.  Out of there both times in 30-45 minutes!  Ask for Ed Barowsky, he was our last salesman and we really liked him.  Will be back for a third vehicle in a few years."
1,"Lund Cadillac rocks. I drive a 2011 SRX and love it.  All of a sudden my  OnStar stopped working.  Rob Cox took great care of me.  Rob had a loaner car (a 2013) delivered to my front door.  It took a week for OnStar to get it right, but what did I care I was driving a brand new car. The service department at Lund Cadillac is great to work with. \nThank you, \nSara V"
1,"I recently puchased a CTS-V wagon from Lund Cadillac and had an excellent experience.\nBuying a car sight unseen is a bit worrisome but Sam the internet sales manager went above and beyond to help me throughout the deal.  I received the carfax report, the PDI report, pics from his phone, etc.  He made me feel comfortable with the whole process.  The car arrived as described.\n\nI highly recommend Lund Cadillac and will definitely consider them on my next vehicle purchase.  Ask for Sam the internet sales manager or Thomas the general sales manager.  They are excellent!"
1,Fast friendly service (as usual)....and GREAT snacks too!  LOL
1,This place has the absolute best bean and cheese burrito the mixture is amazing it is it!
1,"We went here because Shannon N. said it was the best mexicanfood ever and boy was she right. By far this was the best mexican meal and the best meal we've had in Phoenix area.\n\nThe hostess was great reseating us when we didn't like the back room for our group of 6 but she found us a great spot for a great night.\n\nChicken enchiladas, chicken chimichanga, soft shelled tacos ( ground beef) chili rellenos and 3 baskets of fresh chips and salsa, proved to be one of the best meals since we've been on vacation here in Phoenix!\nShannon was right this will be a favorite of ours for healed to come."
1,"Consistent good food. Prices are good. Been eating here for years, never had any problems. Quick service. Love the chips and salsa!"
1,I had my hair cut for the first time by Pete Gulick today and it was fanominal! He couldn't of done a better job. I felt very comfortable and welcome the whole visit. Pete is a not only a fabulous hair stylist but a friendly person who has the best advice about hair! I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a great quality hair cut.
1,Dave Sr is the best! Been coming here for years. I grew up in the neighborhood and went to school with some of the Gulick family. Great people. Exceptional stylists. Dave has always impressed me. Love this place!
1,"I've been going to Dave Jr. for a few years (on and off). I just saw him this past Saturday (09/13/14) and I am never disappointed in his work! The first time I ever went to him about 4 years or so ago, I didn't even know what I wanted to do, so I just let him work his magic, and that he did! He gave me the cut & style I'd been wanting for years but just was never able to explain it! Well, this time around, I had let my cousin (who was going through cosmetology school) dye my hair blonde, then after a while, I dyed it red, my roots started growing out, and the red faded to an orange-y blond throughout the rest of my hair. Needless to say, it was AWFUL. Dave Jr. not only picked the perfect color for me, but he is the only person I've gone to that takes the texture of my hair (incredibly curly) into consideration when he cuts it. His prices are fair and to me, definitely worth it! I have even taken my mom to him, and she also was incredibly happy with her results each time he's cut her hair. But, since Saturday, I have been getting compliments at work and in the street, and a few even asked where I got it done!! The other guys at the salon seem to be really great too, but I've personally only gone to Dave Jr. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a great cut and style and color!"
1,"Man, I am going to miss Krua when I move back to Washington. I was pretty convinced the Southwest just didn't understand Thai food the way the West coast did, but I've been proven wrong. I'm updating my review because I finally got the chance to eat inside. I love the decor! It's just a small hidden place but it really is worth eating inside.\n\nI started with a water and a sweet Thai iced tea. I've never had anything like it! Super sweet and served with heavy cream on top. When stirred, the whole drink turns a bright orange. It was a really nice contrast to what we ordered..\n\nPineapple fried rice. Shrimp panang curry. Tofu pad thai. Veggie spring rolls. Get ready to say the Lord's name in vain, because that's all I can really do when I eat food from here. It's just great. I love the pad thai especially because it isn't overly greasy or soupy at all. The tofu was really good, pan-fried to perfection. And I like it hot! Even at a mere 'medium' spice it was burning my palate. The veggie rolls were meatless and were made with lots of pepper counteracted by the sweet and sour sauce. Steaming hot, extra-crisp. Great big portions make for plenty of leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.\n\nThe service is quick and the man who always seems to be working is so so friendly. We got pretty cold from a breeze coming in, and he even closed the door. \n\nI don't care what you Thai purists have to say... I get around when it comes to pad thai and this place is duking it out in my heart for first."
1,"Wow!  What a find!  The panang curry reminded me of some of the best stuff I had in London.  The pad thai was also above average and the mee krob was a unexpected treat!  The place is small and , as a result, was a bit packed, but well worth it.   We'll be going back and/or picking up take-out again!\n\nAlso, a word of warning -- they're closed on Sundays."
1,So far so good ;)\nGreat place for lunch!\nFast and tasty.
1,"Amazing! We ordered red curry & panang curry and they both were so good. I really enjoy spicy but I decided to be safe and order medium - which they told me would still be pretty spicy. My mouth was at a perfect balance of on fire and delicious. I would definitely recommend. Also, we ordered take-out and there was plenty for two meals :)"
1,Do yourself a favor and eat here. Fresh classic traditional cuisine.  Always amazing.
1,This is my favorite Thai place in Phoenix and around. Its really authentic Thai. Krua thai rama and Green thai curry are my favorite here . The chicken satay is great too. We are a regular here and would recommend to everyone. Take care of what Spice level you ask for.5 is still above medium and works best for me as I'm an Indian. anything above that can be too much to handle.
1,Great food...consistently. Go here with my lunch buddies and been served quick with some hot awesome food. Service is very friendly and helpful in case you are new to Thai but have the pallette for flavors and lastly very decently priced!!
1,"This is the best Thai food I've found in Phoenix, and I've been to Thailand several times. Spice level \""hOt\"" is just right. My nose is running :-) Green curry has great crunchy veggies, Thai tea is nice and lunch specials are under $10."
1,"Everything from appetizer to desert has been amazing. I love veggie rolls, tom kay and  the curry noodles. The curry noodles I need at least once a month but if I could I would have it once a week, it's just that good."
1,"Don't let this restaurant's strip mall or small size fool you. The food here is FANTASTIC, as is the service. A fair warning to newcomers, however...their spice levels are a fair bit spicier than other Thai places in the valley"
1,"Very attentive staff and very friendly. Food was excellent. I love spice and this place sure delivered. I ordered the pad kee mow, spicier than Thai hot. It was incredible. Great flavor, great spice. Would definitely come back here."
1,1st time I have ever gotten a brow wax next to my work so I came here... The lady is awesome... Everything is klean and sanitized. She made me feel like as if she wad my mom and knew I was doubting or I was scare.  Shes been doing this for 25yrs also
1,"Love this place.  Always friendly and they're open 7 days a week! It's a full service salon.  Manicures, pedicures, waxing, tanning and massages. They have a pedicure special that includes sugar scrub, callous removal, foot and leg massage with mint lotion along with a neck and shoulder massage plus all the usual components of a pedicure for $35! They also do top notch eyebrow waxing.  It"
1,"Wow I am shocked that this DQ has such bad reviews!  Every single time I've been to this location the kids that work there have been great! I mean not just nice but above and beyond.  Also, I don't know why or how but they have better ice cream than the one up on Bell Rd."
1,I have moved in and out of this location several times for my customer's and they have always been happy with their experience.  My crew has been in contact with the management and they have always been helpful and professional.   I would not hesitate to recommend them or use their facilities for my own storage of household goods.  If you need a place to store your stuff this is the place in the north valley.
1,"This place is great!!  Clean, modern and well maintained.  The entire staff is responsive, friendly, courteous and accommodating which make this the ideal storage facility for my household overflow of items.  I've been renting multiple spaces for the past year and am completely satisfied with their service."
1,"We've had all 3 of our cars here at one time or another. They do the standard gamut of car repairs plus alignments, lifts and tires for off-road vehicles and probably other stuff I can't think of that I haven't had to have done. \n\nI like Quinn - he's a straight shooter and probably the most honest person I've ever met. I even like doing the routine maintenance G or I could do ourselves here because Quinn makes sure to give the cars the once-over and alert you if he sees anything askew. \n\nPrices are fair. Recent alignment $100. Oil change $40. Couple hundred dollars to deal with a whacked out cooling system in an SUV that had sat without running for more than 2 years. Most of the time I look at the bill and I'm shocked in a good way - prices are much less than I imagine they will be. Recently we dropped off G's car for brakes and Quinn called an hour later telling me the car didn't need brakes for another 15,000 miles or so and to come pick it up - no charge for his time. Our cars are never there for more than a day either - swift service."
1,Pat Ruiloba rocks!  My tire had a nail in it on a Sunday and not a lot of places were open.  Pep Boys wanted 125 + for a basic tire.  Firestone.....not!  Quick and kind folks here.  Love!  I'll come back.
1,"I love this Firestone. I have been coming here for a couple of years now. Every time I come in the staff is so friendly.  When the technicians takes my car, they complete the task at hand, in a timely manner. I know I will only wait what they quote me. I highly recommend them. I know you will see what I see. Then you will be hooked here for all your car needs."
1,Wonderful staff and Dr. Meek is a great vision specialist.
1,"Have just been once because we just got a puppy and were having him looked at.  They were very friendly and helpful. The vet seemed very happy to be working with my dog, and gave me a lot of information. It's an older building so it may seem a little run down, but I didn't get any feeling that anything was dirty or unkempt. Very happy to be taking my puppy there again."
1,"So we have Violet. She was truly a puppy stray that we picked up in Claypool, Az.  With Mange. Nice, huh? Dr. Shure is so good with her..she loves him and let him pull...are you listening? PULL A TOOTH with no sedation. He knew it was wonky and would come out easily and he didn't even freakin' charge us for it. WHO does that? \nGO. Go. I send all my clients there and they're all satisfied."
1,"Just got my dogs nails cut here. He hates anyone touching his nails and usually cries, bites and flees whenever we try. I was shocked with how quickly the groomer calmed him down and painlessly and efficiently trimmed his nails. It was like magic! There was no wait and the entire process only took 15 minutes. The final perk...only $12! We will never go anywhere else!"
1,"Love, Love, Love this place.  Ordered food for Graduation, went in early in day ordered and paid ahead,  food was ready when promised and everything was delicious.  Absolutely the best Soups....Hot n Sour is amazingly delicious!!!!!   Very friendly, courteous and knowledgable staff...."
1,"Our favorite Chinese place in town! We love their pork fried rice, beef & broccoli (yum!!), and sesame chicken. The dumplings are also great. We really appreciate that they deliver to our house, and fairly quickly!"
1,"Their house lo mein hit every spot of my craving!  It was a sizeable portion, which was great since I love cold Chinese leftovers, and the flavor was great.  My boyfriend got the Thai fried rice, and it too was really great.  I placed my order without any issue over the phone and drove to pick it up, though I do know they offer delivery.  When I arrived to pick up the order, the hostess was incredibly friendly.  We will definitely be ordering again!"
1,"I love this place! Employees are always friendly and helpful, and the place is always clean and shiny despite all the traffic it gets. I pick up sandwiches on my way to work sometimes that make my coworkers jealous! Great place and great peeps! Thumbs up!"
1,"Love QT gas stations! Always clean restrooms and floors. They have the best selection for every convenient need, especially beer! This one has the cheapest fuel on my way to work for me. They are always super friendly staff for 4am when I stop in haha"
1,The staff was very friendly and professional.  The grounds were kept very clean.  The National Memorial Cemetery put on a very good memorial service for my Uncle.
1,"With as much as I eat here, I'm surprised I haven't given them a review. Whenever I feel like pizza I always order from here. I order online because I have a daughter who likes to yell and scream and it is just so much easier. The order time is always accurate, I LOVE the tracker, and the delivery men are also so nice and polite. I used to go to pizza hut, but after having tons and tons of problems with the pizza-cold, gross, and skimpy toppings; I convinced my husband to let me order dominos and we have never turned back... he just wishes they had a better deep dish crust- which i dont mind either way :)"
1,"Great pizza at a pretty good value. They're always on time and I've yet to have a negative experience. Once I accidentally tipped using the wrong denomination and felt awful so I called the manager and she was able to apply an additional tip to my credit card afterwards. All the staff has been consistently helpful, punctual, and polite, and I've never had cold or bad food."
1,"Deer Creek Animal Hospital is a big, beautiful and modern facility. Super friendly crew of animal lovers, instills confidence that your pet is in good hands. Behind the office counter were several dogs and cats lounging around contently, and in harmony. Proving the atmosphere at Deer Creek is all about the pets. When I arrived to pick up my pet from his procedure, I was escorted back to the recovery kennels to retrieve my pet with the assistant. That was a nice touch I thought. Also shows, there is nothing to hide. Check out was an experience too. I was briefed with great detail, and in no way rushed. All my questions answered with due attention. I received post-op instructions, custom printed for my pet and his recovery!  \n  There is also a well stocked and appointed feed/accessory store within. Roomy and well lit, nicely planned, not an afterthought in the corner as is so typical.\nYeah, I'm impressed, and I'll be back."
1,"I would gladly recommend Deer Creek Animal Hospital to my friends! I never feel like I'm being pressured to buy more than I need to, which is such a relief as compared to other places I've been. \n\nLuckily we don't go often, but whenever we are there the staff is very friendly and the Dr. is very honest and gentle with my dog. Two paws up for this place!"
1,"We use this place all the time for our weimaraner. Great day care, caring vets, and an awesome staff. \n\nThey know our dog by name & when we see the staff in our neighborhood they always say hello."
1,"I have used Deer Creek for the past five years and they have always been great to me and my cat and two dogs. Everyone is super friendly and always helpful with any questions or concerns that I have and my animals are always well taken care of. \n\nRecently, Dr K. recommended that I bring my youngest rescue pup to daycare to help socialize her. She is very rambunctious and also untrusting of strangers. Yesterday was her first day and my fiance and I couldnt believe that our dog was so calm when we picked her up- she was plum tuckered out! She will now be going at least once a week. Thanks so much Deer Creek employees for always taking such good care of my babies! Dixie, Healey and Morgan thank you too!"
1,"The staff is very friendly and you can tell they are animal lovers.  I took my dog here for day care and came back to find her behind the desk with the staff and other dogs.  I had told them to watch for her sore leg.  They did and they noticed her starting to limp and getting overheated so they brought her in, took her temp, and gave her some water.  I was so impressed that they had watched her so well.  I feel extremely confident in her safety when I leave her in their care.  They have great boarding rates as well.  My dog loves going here!!"
1,"Deer Creek takes such good care of my dog Rusty.  Rusty is a pretty big, strong dog but very fearful of vet offices.  We have taken Rusty for boarding services at Deer Creek several times and everyone has been so patient with him.  The associates have spent extra time with him in an effort to help him feel safe.  They have just \""understood\"" that Rusty needed time and never made me feel ashamed of his nervous behavior (and believe me, other vet offices have made us feel that way).  During his last visit, Rusty had such a breakthrough that the tech pulled out his cell phone and took video to show me how happy Rusty was. He and another tech could not wait to show us the video when we got back from our vacation.  Now that is caring!\n\nAlso thank you to Dr. James who treated Rusty for allergies.  She was so patient with me and my questions but also with Rusty' s need to go slow through his appointment.\n\nWe are so glad that we found Deer Creek!"
1,"We have been taking our (2) dogs there for over 4 years and couldn't be happier. When we pull into the parking lot, our dogs go crazy from excitement ~ they cannot wait to get into the door! Whether it is vet services, boarding, grooming, or just a doggie daycare day, the staff treats our dogs with such kindness and offers great customer service to us as pet owners."
1,Staff was very nice and my baby Pumpkin seemed to have enjoyed her stay. Next time I visit my family in Phoenix I will definitely use this facility again.
1,"Took my dog there for a trial run day care visit before boarding next weekend.  First of all, my dog is my kid. I have no children, I've had him since he was a baby and he has developed dog epilepsy so I worry a TON about him. He was attacked a few times by a dog we used to have so I've been really worried about boarding him but decided it was TIME.\n\nI walked in and was greeted by smiling, welcoming calm faces. They assured me he would be fine, and gave me a tour. All the while speaking to my dog,  giving him loves and putting us both as ease. The facility was clean, large, lots of play room, and all the dogs in the play yard looked very happy.\n\nHe received an excellent report and they even remembered me when I came back. I watched as they put his harness on and my dog calmly sat there allowing them to do so (a trick he doesn't even do for ME!)\n\nHe has been pooped the rest of the afternoon.  There's no doubt he had an awesome time,  and was well cared for all day! Can't wait to take him back for more play time next weekend!"
1,"I had a pedicure at this place today. The prices are excellent. I paid $22 for the best pedicure I can ever remember getting and I have paid $60+ in some places. I kept expecting to pay more thinking they must be giving me the deluxe pedi instead of the basic one but nope the one I got was the basic one. I'm not even sure what they might add if they have a deluxe pedi accept maybe a paraffin dip or an herbal wrap?\nThey have an attractive clean facility. They actually line the basin where your feet go with a plastic liner that they change between customers, now that is clean! The chairs themselves look brand new. I got the longest foot massage I have ever had with a pedi even when I paid for a so-called deluxe or spa pedi elsewhere. My toes looked great when they were done. I was offered a bottle of water to drink while I waited. I know some places will give you wine, coffee etc but this is not a spa and for that price I am more than happy with water (besides I have to drive).\nBtw, they have male clients as well. In case you guys want to experience one of the things that makes it great to be a woman. \nThe staff was so pleasant and most of them are English speaking. What more could you ask for? Hanna was the girl that did my feet but I saw the others working and they all seemed to do quality work. I am so excited that I found a great affordable place to get some regular pedicures while I'm here. If I can only find a good massage around here I will be in heaven. \nI give them 5 stars because they are better than any spa I have ever been to and a third the price."
1,"After a lot of begging and convincing, me and my boyfriend decided to get pedicures together. I searched for places close to home and after reviewing Fancy Nails decided to give it a shot. We got there and all the techs and who seemed to be the owner or manager made us feel very welcomed. The place was clean and inviting. We got to the chairs which were probably the nicest chairs I've seen in a while and I loved that the spa pedi bowls had one use plastic liners that are disposed of after every single use. My massage was AMAZING!!! and the polish and selection was good!!! I was very happy and even my boyfriend said when we were finished \""that was awesome, we need to do that a lot more\"" SCORE ;)"
1,"I love this place! They give great services for the price. I got a mani and a pedi there and they were by far the cheapest, and the cleanest!! They take care of their clients. The best part, is they rememer you! it had been a while since I went there and they mentioned that to me. I will definately be going back there!"
1,"Love this salon. Kim is very friendly and did a really nice job on my mani and pedi. The owner runs a very tight ship and not very many people are talking, it's very quiet, the staff are very attentive and it's very relaxing. The place is very very clean. I will make this my nail salon now, it's reasonable, friendly, clean and relaxing, what more could you want?"
1,"Very nice girls, clean salon and quick service. \nIf you pay with cash, you get a 5% discount. If you pay with debit, you can't add a tip to the charge, so be sure to bring cash. \n I counted 17 people working today, very busy on the weekend, I dropped in with no appointment and got right in, 1 hour later, fresh mani/pedi in Lincoln Park After Dark (my favorite color). \nGo here!"
1,"When I need a sweet treat I go through this drive thru for a blizzard. I hate to admit it but I've tried multiple varieties of blizzard flavors, and every time I leave satisfied."
1,"OH , How i dont want to review this because it my little hidden gem!! MINE MINE MINE::))\n\nLocal Staff- I have to do the people and the owners in the same catagory. Bob and Lisa are just to two best owners. Lisa is just a ton of fun and Bob is full of knowledge. Always there to fill your glass and have great conversation. I say the locals of the bar are always chatty too and everyone seems to offer you a taste of their wine if you have never tried it. It really feels like your a your friends dinner party, minus the food.\n\nCheesy Things- Although it is a wine bar at not offering food, you can pick from a selection cheeses and salami and crackers that they will put together for you. If thats not enough order a pizza from down the street and eat it up, just be sure to make sure you get enought for everyone:) lol\n\nVino- its al amazingly priced wine at what seems to be an average of 16 or so dollars. Largest selection of Arizona Wines!! plus a few beers, Champagne and sparakling wine to choose from.\n\nParties- They do theme parties once a month , the 50's night was great raising money for charity. Every Friday and Sat they do tasting as well.\n\n\nBreak it Down Jess- Just by far one of the hidden gems, that i dont want anyone to know about because im selfish ha ha. you will always feel wecome by everyone there and be part of the family in no time. oh yeah did I mention NO CORKING FEE. yeah, thats right... See you there soon!"
1,"Husband and I were out with some friends on Saturday night and decided to hit this place up around 9pm. When we rolled in we were SHOCKED at the $5 cover charge! Who else has it so cheap???? GREAT START to our evening! :)\n\nWe easily found some nice seats on couches towards the back but the place is smallish so we had awesome views of the larger stage. It was kinda disappointing with the first couple dancers because they seemed to be more interested in staring at themselves in the mirrors to see how hard they could frown so it got a few doubts going but then some AMAZING dancers blew our minds! \n\nTwo girls in particular stuck with us for a while and gave us ALL lap dances and did some really crazy tricks on the chairs. $7 lap dances?? sign us up!!! We all agreed, who needs Christie's $20 dances when we can get gorgeous ladies and great music here! \n\nBTW-The music was just FABULOUS! Lots of variety (lil rap not much, lots of rock like Metallica, lil punk) so everyone in our group was rocking out hardcore-in more ways then one ;)\n \nGuys, girls, lesbians (we saw a few)-no matter-The Candy Store will take care of you all :D \n\nGo get your jelly watch on!!!"
1,"The only thing to not like about this place is that it's small. Really small. I've lived inside of bigger tissue boxes. \n\nBut that's just an excuse to get extra close to your special lady ;D\n\nThe girls here are very friendly, there's a large variety of girls, and a large selection of music. The decor threw me off, but you didn't come in to look at the couches....if you did, you have other problems. \n\nI've always had a good time here and recommend this place above all others of it's type in the valley. Female-Friendly dancers are hard to find....well, ones that give mind blowing lap dances are, anyway. I second Carissa!"
1,"Love going to The Candy Store with my Buds. Keep in mind I'm in no way an expert at T&A --- but even I recognized beautiful women when I see 'em! This place has improved over the years and far as female dancers go.\n\n$7 lap dances? Uhhh...one lap dance long ago was enough for me --  barking up the wrong side of the tree here --- but it was great fun. Girls can jam and do some kewl tricks.\n\nNow...I do know about their great Turkey and Top Sirloin Burgers. We often hit this place up for their great specials on Saturdays afternoons. Perfect spot to watch footballs games on the weekends. So overall, I kewl straight buds put up with many of my suggestions for our many of our outings so going to this spot every now and then isn't so bad. Sometimes being a fly on the wall can be fun! :)"
1,"That might be the last time I use the YELP search to try and satisfy my sweet tooth... No ring pops or bottle caps here folks!!! But since I was already there I decided to stop in and much to my surprise there was a solid vending machine next to the restrooms.. The $5 cover seemed a little steep just to peruse the vending machine selection... The young ladies working  the establishment seemed to be enjoying the surroundings.. A dimly lit ambiance in which to enjoy a \""Big Hunk.\"" Music bumping, fists pumping, and scantily clad women swinging around the red vines flashing their skittles around freely for the taking. Decided to leave a short time afterwards, before I was tempted to get a Milky Way. Top notch establishment, will visit again! Probably going to need another dentist visit after satisfying that sweet tooth."
1,"We did our previous due diligence and procured 6 bids from landscape companies. Those that actually came back and provided a  bid, were ridiculous! The prices were outrageous. We decided at that point-before meeting Desert Gardens Nursery, that we were going to hold off on creating our xeriscape backyard. Then, at the Home Show, we met Jenny (Owner of Desert Gardens Nursery). She is the first person to LISTEN. We just had our yard completed this week and we are thrilled! She stayed exactly on target with our budget and it is even more than we imagined. I highly recommend Desert Gardens Nursery! Jenny is an outstanding landscape designer and Kyle dot's the \""i's\"" and crosses the \""t's\"" on the job site.\nIt is great to know that there are professional landscapers that make good with their promise! You have to go check out their blooming cacti! AMAZING!\n\nThank you Jenny & Kyle! Outstanding job! Well done!\nNo-we had never met them or knew of them, prior to the Home Show just a month ago.\n\nPaul, Sandi & Family-Mesa, AZ"
1,Stopped in to use a Groupon. Needed advice on plants for yard on side of mountain were rabbits eat everything. Got best advice I've ever gotten in the 20+ years I've been landscaping. Thanks!
1,"She is the best dog groomer in the state of Arizona period. If you don't take your dog to her the dog loses, she loses, and you relly didn't think it out. WE  take our maltise there every two months (for the last 5 years) and he loves it, we love her, and she does a great job. What more can you ask for?"
1,I bring my wire hair doxie here and they do a great job! Janet and other groomers are great with the dogs. Price is good and we always walk away happy!
1,"Fast, polite, and painless. And they didn't try too up sell me a ton, which most places do. I will definitely be returning!!"
1,First time here and I couldn't be happier. Great recommendations without being pushy about sales. Quick in and out service and super friendly guys. A+ service and experience!
1,This place is GREAT! So thorough. They're definitely good at what they do. They double check everything. I trust them with my '10 challenger and my fiance's '14 charger. I recommend this place to everyone I know.
1,"I go here 3 or 4 times a week to get my all natural healthy foods.  The staff always remembers me and treats me so well.  The biggest issue at grocery stores is when there is a line of people and the staff doesnt open another lane, drives me nuts!!!  At this store, you will never see more than 3 people in line.\n\nTheir prices are great and the quality of produce is always on point.  Go Bashas"
1,Love this place and the new owners are great.  The previous owners were forced to close down and the new guys have been in there for about a year.  I go in about once a week and they are super friendy and very fast service.  Highly recommend this locaiton.
1,These guys do a great job. I've looked everywhere for a drive thru wash with soft pads so it doesn't scratch my paint..drive thrus r harsh on black..and not only does this place have it but the guys come out and give ur car a pre hand scrubbed wash down..legit..$5-7 can't beat it. Both me and my fiance come here..both black sports cars and never worry about scratches. :)
1,"Not only were they friendly, but they made it possible for me to be able to get my vehicle back during a typical stressful work day! They went above and beyond! I will use them for any tire issues! I have typically gone to the one on Bell, which are wonderful as well, but this location was closure to my job and provided the same great service I was used to!"
1,Great service great food. And the bacon queso fries are my new addiction.
1,"Active Life Center was recommended to me by a friend who also works in the medical field when I complained of chronic back pain that I had been experiencing for several months.  \n\nTom was super friendly and welcoming to help me out and fortunately had an x-ray machine because it helped him diagnose my condition.  After a couple of months of weekly visits and instructed exercises that I could do on my own at home, I felt much better and even bought some of the same equipment that they use in the office for my home.\n\nI'm very happy I met Tom and his team at Active Life Center.  Without a doubt, I would send my friends and family to Tom and his team.\n\nThanks Tom!"
1,"I was referred to Integrity Air by a friend who got great service at a reasonable price.  Shelby came out at the time he promised, diagnosed the problem with my Carrier AC unit (air handler) and charged a fair price.  Before he came out the AC was not working and when he left it was blowing very cold.  I am very happy.   Integrity is a great AC service provider."
1,The humans are great to me. And my canine buddies and I have a blast. I can't wait until my owners go on their next trip!
1,This is the most friendly and affordable nail salon ive been to! The owners are sweet and their massage chairs are fantastic! I highly recomend this place.
1,"I'm actually loving their new kitchen with food made to order. just tried the hazelnut iced latte and its not too bad. Staff is friendly,  store is always clean. I go out of my way to this location for work."
1,Best little Mexican restaurant in the area. Carne Asada is tender and not fatty!! Eat here a couple times a week
1,Great food.
1,"This is one of my familys favorite hole in the wall establishments in Phoenix. Almost as good as Valle Luna or the original Garcias on 35th and ossborn, but for a fraction of the price. Great tacos, rellenos, encheladas. The homemade salsa is excellent. They have coupons on yelp, groupon, and entertainment book, don't pass them up."
1,They used to have some awesome Tortas on the menu but they sometimes have the bread if you ask they can make them.  I really like the fish tacos omnomnom
1,"Best salsa in town and I've lived here for 37 years and been to the Salsa Challenge every year, but nobody beats Mi Pueblo. I like to mix the mild and hot 50/50. All their food is delicious and very consistent. Not as greasy as *bertos. So glad I live right down the street. Oh yeah, their party platters are awesome too."
1,"My go to place for Mexican food. Chimichangas, enchiladas and menudo are my favorites . Big portions , decent price."
1,"Only place in the valley that serves fresh and authentic Mexican food. The food is delicious, and they've even got fresh salsa! They have a wonderful, friendly staff. I won't go anywhere else for Mexican food."
1,Got chicken chimi ... so good.. so much food. Have come here multiple times . Everything is always great.  Family owned and operated.  Great people.
1,Had green burrito with pork.  Excellent! Not fatty. \nDaughter had taquitos.  Loved them.
1,"Just had the \""death wobble\"" fixed on my jeep. All staff was super knowledgeable, extremely courteous and the price for the new part and labor was most reasonable. I will definitely be back with any other vehicles. \n\nOverall, great prompt service, great prices, and awesome staff. Will be back for sure.\n\nThanks ATD!!"
1,"My husband and I were here on vacation. I had a many month grown out pedicure (and no polish remover at home). This had not been an issue with the rain and cold at home. There was just no point of freezing your toes off in flip flops. But now, here were are in sunny beautiful AZ. You have to wear flip flops. I lasted about three days before I just had to do something about those gross half painted nails. \n\nSO, yelp to the rescue. I found this place just a few blocks from our resort. I called a few times over the weekend, but the midday baseball games were rather limiting to getting in. SO, Monday morning, I headed on in. The place is nice with quite a few spa pedicure chairs and several tables for nails. The ladies were very nice were ready for me, with no appointment needed. I chose my color and headed to my spa chair. \n\nI had a spa pedicure, with all the frills. I got to do the soak in the foot spa. GOt the nails trimmed and filed. Had a wonderful sea salt scrub. Followed by a hot stone massage. This was not something I had had before, and it was great.  I had to look up from my book to see what was so warm in the massage. This is far better than the warm moist towel and massage. Then the nails were primped and prepped and I was on my way. \n\nWe come here usually twice per year to Scottsdale and I will most definitely be back. Though, most likely on my first day of arrival to give more time to show off my beautiful toes and feet."
1,I frequent many nail salons and for some reason I always want to come back to this place. I feel like they are always quick and accomodating. They also use the plastic inserts in the pedicure seats to give it that extra barrior for germs. They are a pretty busy facility but I haven't waited very long because they have many workers.
1,"You may be able to find better deals at craft stores, but what you'll find at Aaron Brothers are people who really know what they're doing.  The selection is also much better and the work is done meticulously.  Plus, they do send out coupons every now and then, and when that happens you really can score an amazing deal.\n\nWe had our Katubah framed (for the many non-jewish readers; it's a very artful jewish marriage license).  At 23\"" by 23\"", a custom job was the only way to have it framed.  Not only did Aaron brothers do a great job framing it, but they used a temporary back so we could take it out of the frame, sign it on our wedding day, and bring it back afterwards to finish the job at no extra charge. \n\nWhen originally pricing the frames, the sales people told my fianc\u00e9 that if she signed up for their email list, she would get a 60% coupon.  So they waited on making an immediate sale and instead let the customer know that she could get a better price if she waited a few weeks.  Mad props on that.\n\nMy only negative comment.  The Katubah looks so good in its frame that we want to hang it now."
1,"NOTE- 5 stars for a fast food place, not the Phoenician.\n\nThought this location deserved an updated review, in light of the current ones posted.  \n\nBeen twice to this location in the last week- once eat in with my kids and once drive through.\n\nBoth time, our orders were accurate.  Everything was very fresh and seemingly prepared moments earlier- taco shells crunchy, hot things hot, cold things cold.  Lettuce fresh and crisp, Mexican Pizza bubbling with heat.   \n\nThe staff on duty this Sunday afternoon were friendly and sharp.  while we ate our lunch, I noticed that on two separate occasions, someone came out to wipe tables and check trash.  No complaints here. \n\nI have a theory- with the Fry's Marketplace (sharing the same parking lot) recently remodeled, there is a huge draw of traffic to this location.  Perhaps the Taco Bell got their act together so as to not lose easy business.  No matter the  reason, they appear to have pulled it together nicely."
1,"I visited this Starbucks after having my nails done two doors down. I paid cash for my nails. Hang on there is a point to this ;)  I ordered a mocha frapp and gave the girl my debit card which was declined because I hadn't realized that it had expired and I hadn't put the new one in my wallet. Talk about embarrassing!! The girl said \""no worries, it's on the house\"". I was dumb founded. Who does that these days? Thank you! I have yet to stop by and repay them but definitely will do so! Kudos to the girl! Wish I had gotten her name!"
1,"Vartan what can you say about him that hasn't been said. A true gentleman, a humble man, a generous man... hospitality is A++++ at Ambassador. Make time to burn"
1,Very good service at this location.  I took my class of special needs students on a field trip here to practice money and social skills.  The servers were very patient with my students.  They allowed the students to take their time and make choices.  The cashier allowed my students to take their time paying as well.  Panda express also offers some really cool lesson plans for Chinese New Year online--free for teachers.  We went in because of the free resources they offer online.
1,"I love coming to this blimpies. Cal, Neil and the rest of the staff are so sweet and the food is always amazing. Wayy better than subway."
1,Yay!!! I second the first review!  Blimpie's is bomb and I will never walk in Subway ever again because I hate walking out smelling like bread!!!!  The guys who work here are all super sweet.. and even the women are too... shocking for me to say!  Much cheaper than Jersey Mike's too!
1,This place is awesome. Just bought a loose super powers darkseid. Will def be back for more. Lots of loose figures. Great prices and friendly staff.
1,"Such a great place! Toy Anxiety has a big selection of new and old, well priced, rare and cool toys!  Staff was nice and friendly which makes a world of a difference!  I will definitely be going back for more....Thanks Toy Anxiety!"
1,"This store is so cool. Every turn and glance I took, there was something from my childhood that brought back some fun memories. What makes this store even better is that it's so so so organized and the staff is super friendly. Definitely looking forward to checking out new inventory when I visit AZ again."
1,"I love this place and always stop here when I'm in the area. The smoked fish, sausages, and fresh made breads here are really awesome! Try the small smoked sausages on the deli counter, they are really good. I also love the smoked sturgeon and the excellent selection of salami they have here. The Russian salami is very good, if you like salami you need to try it. If you like pickles try the pickled tomatoes they have here. They also have a nice selection of caviar."
1,"Steve is spot on. His craftsmanship is top notch. He takes the time to cut every hair perfectly. In a nut shell his service exceeds expectations. \nHaircut, style, hot towel, neck and sideburns shave and a shoulder massage for a very reasonable price.\nTry it, you'll like it."
1,"Best OBGYN in the world - Dr. DeSanto! About to have my third baby, had another OB in another state with DD1, and moved mid-pregnancy with DD2, so I do have experience with other OB's. The office communicates well when I have questions, need an appointment or a change, or on the rare instances my appointment needs to be moved. Dr. DeSanto always listens to questions reasonably, isn't a meds pusher, reassures when parts of pregnancy that are wacky are just natural progressions. When DD2 had her shoulders stuck, he managed to get her out and keep me calm at the same time. He genuinely cares about seeing the baby and having ultrasounds. Unlike many other doctors he doesn't hold back on ultrasounds, communicating expectations for the current and future appointments & post-partum. I love Esther his nurse also. I have seen the NP in the past, she was also magnificent. I don't ever want another OBGYN!"
1,"I have been a patient for almost a year and found the office using online reviews. I later found out my colleague has been O'Sullivan's patient for several years. \nWait times: Morning appts are the best- I've never waited more that five minutes for a morning appt. Late afternoon appts on Fridays never start on time and it is common to wait 20-50 minutes for the appointment to begin. I prefer later appts so I just plan ahead and use the time to catch up on emails, watch the baby kick, and chat with my spouse. \nFront Office: Katie at the front desk is irreplaceable. I don't know her title or position, but I assume she is the manager because she incredible professional, she makes it her goal to know the patients and spouses by name, she uses the patient's time wisely when scheduling future appts, and she does everything with a smile! The other women at the front desk are never friendly and seem to be put-out when I ask a question on the phone or face to face. They answer the question, but I think they prefer to be uninterrupted. \nDoctor: Erin O'Sullivan is my prenatal doctor and Kathy is her medical assistant. Kathy is a perfect partner to O'Sullivan. She is sweet and excitable and loves hearing pregnancy updates. I enjoy our quick encounters because she is caring. O'Sullivan is awesome. She is not sweet or giggly, but that isn't her job. She is professional, dedicated, and passionate about her career. She is overtly honest with her answers and rarely sugar-coats. She supports natural childbirth and alternative birthing options and will give her professional opinion using years of experiences from the hospital and midwife/physician community meetings. She doesn't give an answer to a question in hopes that you like her answer; she provides you the response she thinks is best. I will continue to visit O'Sullivan for my annual exams and future prenatal exams because although she is not sweet, I know she is passionate and dedicated to the well being of her patients. \nUnexpected Situations: Once, I called the office at 6AM on a Saturday because I was concerned about symptoms I was experiencing. I left a message with the after-hours rep and Dr. O'Sullivan returned my call within about 30 seconds. She answered my concerns, made suggestions, and did not rush off the phone. I could tell that I woke her just because her voice was different, but she did not seem put-out at all. She has told me in the past that she chose a 24 hour career and she embraces it. \nOverall, I strongly recommend this office. Staff come and go so I don't worry about the two I've encountered who aren't customer-service oriented. Katie at the front should be your go-to person so try avoiding the others if you have questions and don't want to have a negative experience. \nKathy and Dr. O'Sullivan are great! I've also met with two nurses, Bergdale and another- once during a last minute scheduled appt (I was experiencing uncommon bleeding in second trimester and O'Sullivan was at the hospital] and once during a routine visit [I rescheduled at the last minute]. No complaints from either appt. The medical team is incredible."
1,"I currently live at this apartment community. We love it. It is the cheapest rent we found in the area (without sacrificing amenities or location). We live a few minutes away from the Paradise Valley mall and right next to the 51. I have not heard our neighbors once and it is very peaceful and shady here. They are pet friendly. No, it does not have a washer/dryer in the apartment but there are two laundry facilities centrally located so you don't have to walk far. A dollar to wash and a dollar to dry. The only thing I don't like is the parking. For a two driver household one person always ends up getting screwed and having to walk. We are looking forward to living here for years to come."
1,"They are always so friendly at this location. They are also very knowledgeable and will tell you how it really is. At some other pool stores, I have felt like they are trying to sell you on things you don't need. We had an expensive piece of pool equipment break and thought we would need to have it replaced. We dragged it on down to Leslie's and they repaired it for about 1/2 of the cost of replacing it. I refer anyone with a pool to Leslie's - especially this location."
1,"I moved into a new house and we now have to take care of our own pool, I know a bit but Daniel and the team here really know their stuff. \n\nThey have made it really quick and accurate with the WaterLink Spin machine-I had been to another pool place that used the traditional fluid test and besides it taking a while to do the test and get results it just didn't seem accurate. This works! My pool is clear and the family is happy to swim in a once greenish and algae tinted pool. \n\nThanks guys-knowledgeable, friendly, fast and fair service. Not a buy and try this-these guys know customer service and you will be with them long term because they recommend only what's necessary."
1,"There is nothing bad I can say about my experience here. The staff was wonderful, the nurses were wonderful, and most importantly Dr. Nelson was the best doctor I could have ever asked for. He always listened to my concerns and is extremely knowledgeable and reassuring. I wouldn't have anyone else deliver my babies."
1,"Never had a bad experience at this office.  Everyone was courteous and professional.  The front desk doesn't seem too lively, but they probably take a fair ration of abuse from people (usually the way it goes) so I can understand.  Otherwise, professional and nice.\n\nAlso want to say Tracy Innes is awesome.  Thanks!"
1,"My PCP at this office is Dr. Chad Campbell, D.O. and I love him! He really spends time with you in the exam room listening to your symptoms and assessing you current state of health. He and his staff are competent and have great triage skills so if you have a last minute emergency on Friday and call the office, they will be able to fit you in or tell you its okay to wait until Monday. As a Registered Nurse, I am picky about my providers and highly recommend Dr Campbell to anyone looking for a PCP!\n\nAlso, as a side note: For those of you who get caught up in the suffix of M.D.'s and D.O.'s please don't. I know the old school way was MD's and there is this prestigious entitlement around MDs, but D.O.'s actually have an extra class (it's their Osteopathy class they take each semester for their entire schooling) to take in order to graduate so don't dwell on the suffix, dwell on the actual provider!"
1,"My boyfriend and I love this whole foods! It is bigger with a bigger selection than the one in tempe. The cafe area is huge and so is the deli area. The employees are nice, it seems to have more products and it is like hard to choose which ones you want because it's all organic!\n\nThe problem is it is expensive, but I would pay more if I had the money and I do believe in good quality products within a reasonable price. We usually go there if we stay in Phoenix and not go to Tempe."
1,"My girlfriend and I love this Whole Foods! It is bigger with a bigger selection than the one in Tempe. The cafe area and the deli area is huge.

We usually go there if we stay in Phoenix and not go to Tempe."
1,"And then I found THIS Whole Foods!\n\nAfter my horrible Tempe experience, I wanted to give another WF a chance before going up to the Mayo location (see my review for that one). \n\nThis PV location is quite nice. It's definitely in a much nicer area than Tempe. As most WF's, this location is clean both inside and out.\n\nThe staff is VERY friendly here. Not always the most knowledgable (I had asked some pretty detailed questions about some of the supplements), but they are resourceful. The guy helping me, offered to call other locations for my stuff. Very nice of him.\n\nAfter I picked up everything I \""needed\"", I walked over to the prepared food section. Everything was spotless, and fresh. Excellent work. I bought some food to take home. I also got to sample some of their pizzas. Delish!\n\nThen, the best part of the store....the ice cream. It's not your typical FroYo, or gelato that has the consistency of snot. They have the best (in mine, and most Yelpers) ice cream around: Sweet Republic. \n\nI knew exactly what I wanted, so the guy packed up a pint for me to take home. If you are one of those people that can't make a decision on their own like a grownup, then you can sample each of the flavors, while you dilly dally...the lady in front of me was like that. The ice cream guy was VERY patient with her, and even kept up a smile the whole time.\n\nI said it before in a Quick Tip, but this is the second best WF in the area (next to the Mayo location), but the staff here makes up the difference.\n\nWell done, Whole Foods. Well done."
1,"I stopped by for some non-plastic wear (cups and bowls) and was delighted to see their fun juice/coffee bar.  They have a nice selection of different fresh juices, coffees and they even have kombucha on tap!  I don't remember the name of the juice I got, but it had kale, parsley, celery, cucumber, apple and spinach and was soooo good!  Overall, I really appreciate the fact that they support local business and stock their shelves with products that have some freaking integrity.  If it weren't so far from where I lived, I'd probably shop here more often.  Keep it real, guys:)"
1,I love this store!!! Everyone is happy and kind.
1,"even though i live roughly 15-20 minutes from this store, i still make it a weekly habit to come here for groceries. \n\nthe breakdown: \n\nsushi. their selection of rolls and sashimi are awesome! i love that i can buy a brick sized piece of salmon sashimi to take home and slice up myself. while i do love aj's sushi bar as well, whole foods definitely has them beat. \n\njuice bar. whenever i come in to do my shopping, i always head straight to the juice bar for one of their delicious fresh drinks. every juice mix i've tried has been fantastic, even if the fruit/veggie combo sounded like it might not work together.\n\nproduce. really terrific selection of fruits and vegetables. i especially love their huge variety of pre-cut produce; it makes cooking super convenient!\n\nin addition to carrying a lot of great companies that i can't get at any other local stores, their stuff is generally totally affordable.  a grocery store with a unique selection can mean higher prices (aj's), but i usually leave whole foods feeling pretty pleased with what i ended up spending. \n\nps. i'm super pumped for the new store that's opening on camelback next month! now i'll have a store within a mile of my house!"
1,"I love this store.  Non gmo foods, gluten free, dairy free you name it, they have it.  I liked the world market section they have.  I bought some vegetarian chilli to try out at home.  Among other items I found are: Bulgarian yogurt, all kinds of immitation cheese, sea weed snacks, awesome chips, nature's box oreo cookies.  I also enjoyed the juice from their juice bar while shopping, so it was definitely a nice experience.  However there was this one lady there that yelled at me to get out of her way as she needed to put milk in her coffee, and she did not care if she was rude or not lol.  Um is this the opposite of white trash I don't know??? :D"
1,3/5/11: we met some other families here for our first visit. Separate play area for under 2 years made it a lot easier for me to relax & enjoy watching my son play on his own & with other little ones. We will be back. :)
1,My girls love this place.  They are 2.  Its the perfect age.  We just went to the Thursday Story Time and its one of the best I have been to in Phoenix.  The leader is amazing and its very interactive.  I would say its more music time than story.  And there is a great drive thru coffee shop in the parking lot which you can bring into Imagination Avenue with the kids.
1,"We just came here today for the first time & we already love this place!!!  The owner checked us in & he is very friendly & helpful.   Everything is clean & well taken care of.  We have been here since right after they opened at 9:30 am & my 4 yr old little girl is still playing & very happy!!  There are kids of all ages here & there is something to do for all of them!   Moms,dads & a nanny or two have been here.  There are lots of toys, dress up outfits, ride on cars etc.  What a great place to take my little girl!!!"
1,"My 2 year old daughter absolutely LOVES Imagination Avenue! We've been here 3 times with our moms group and it always provides hours of hassle-free fun for all ages. \n\nIf you haven't been in the last 6-8 months since the new owners took over, GO BACK. They have completely refreshed the place. It has all new carpet, a designated baby area, more parent seating and rad a slide. It's much more open and clean. They're also working on more renovations including a new cafe which will serve healthy foods for parents and kids.\n\nWhen we meet with friends, it's always nice to be able to chat without chasing after the little ones. Imagination avenue provides a safe, fun environment for everyone!"
1,"My family really enjoys this place. The year membership is a great value, as we can pop in for an hour or two and not feel like we are paying for an entire day. The facility is really developmentally appropriate for little ones. I love that I can sit and chat with a friend while our kids play. Even when I go with just my kids, I usually run into someone I know, or end up striking up a conversation with someone new. I'm also a fan of the cafe. It offers several healthy option for when I forget to pack a lunch."
1,"This review is about hair stylist Carissa at Beauty Brands salon in Paradise Valley.  I live less than a mile from here but had been driving to Arrowhead to get my hair trimmed by Shelby.  I had been wanting to try a new stylist just closer to home.  \nWhen I called to make the appointment I asked for a senior stylist who was good with long hair.  I was getting a trim and style.  I wished I had taken a \""before\"" picture so I could post it.  Let me tell you.. I had just rolled out of bed and was looking like one hot mess!  What a transformation.  Carissa made my hair look FABULOUS!!.  She even gave me a scalp massage when she washed my hair and also she took her time blowdrying my hair and made sure it was perfect.  Carissa is very professional, friendly, and knowledgeable.  She seems very focused on her career and told me that she attends regular hair shows and keeps up on the hair trends and techniques. I'm so happy i found a hair stylist so close to my home."
1,"Best place to get your beauty products, hands down. Everyone is friendly and helpful without being pushy. They have great deals if you sign up for their mailing list...sometimes they send cards in the mail with vouchers for a FREE full size product with any purchase. They have special ladies night out events with raffle prizes, and discounts on salon services. I have never left empty handed or without a smile on my face.\n\nFYI, they take ULTA coupons too!!! and you can stack them with your beauty brands take ten!!"
1,"My husband's new obsession is saltwater tanks and I have been dragged to just about every store in the valley. This is by far the best store dedicated to the supplies needed for reef maintenance. They also have a small section for freshwater.\n\nThey have premixed salt water (bring your jugs, they will fill them), a wide variety of fish, and some shrimp, snails, eels, urchins, and crabs. They have the best selection of live rock and both soft and hard corals I have seen and they all seem to be responsibly harvested.\n\nThe store is bright and impeccably clean and the tanks are well maintained. The staff is very professional and knowledgeable. If you're going to get involved in an expensive hobby like this, you may as well buy from the best.\n\nAqua Touch's hours:\nMonday-Saturday 11-7\nSunday 12-5"
1,"Hands down, one of the best shopping experiences I have had - and I am comparing to all of them, not just fish.\n\nI was seeking a brand new, custom tank. I shopped around but Aquatouch had a good price and, more importantly, the best service. From start to finish, everything was covered - tank and stand. All of my questions were answered (and I had a lot!). I just got the tank this week and it's beautiful! I am still getting follow-up support on setting up the tank.\n\nI want to note something very important - I always felt like I was dealing with honest people.\n\nThe store itself is clean and neat. They focus more on saltwater than fresh. I'm not a saltwater expert but I would say their selection is good. The saltwater fish are all active and appear \""happy\"" to me. The planted  freshwater tanks are beautiful. I think they specialize in more of the high end freshwater fish and plants.\n\nThis store will remain tops on my list. If you are going to make that huge investment in a large tank, I would just go to Aquatouch. I already did the research for you. You'll get great service, good prices and have all your questions answered."
1,"Stopped in to check out the store for the first time, and was extremely impressed. All of the display aquariums were spotless and esthetically pleasing to the eye. Staff was very friendly and available for help. The selection of livestock was large, very health, and well maintained! Entirely an excellent experience!"
1,I can't remember how long I have been going to this store quality cleanliness great customer service the absolute best in this industry in the valley there is not a store in the valley that comes close yes the prices are high but I get the best opportunity to inspect the fish I'm considering purchasing because the tanks are so clean and bright  but if you really think about it all these garage sale reefs stores or the other brick and mortar store's that are here today and closed in eight months
1,"This place is so fun. Go when Lit Up is playing. Awesome 80's cover band and they draw a huge, interesting crowd. Cheap drinks and fun for all. Grab a shot and relax to some of the best bands in Arizona. Staff is attentive and fun. Give this place a try!"
1,"I love this place..... cheap quality chinese food... everything i've had there is good. When they label an item as spicy, it is actually spicy! \n\n\nThere lunch specials are an awesome deal. 5 or 6 bucks for a plate of food, soup and fried wonton chips.\n\nlove it!"
1,"My family and I have been eating here for at least the last decade. We always order the \""house special dinner.\"" This includes soup, egg rolls, chicken wings and several entrees depending on the size of your group. I can't speak for the other dishes but the ones we get with this are always superb. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but I would recommend this place to anyone."
1,"The PA Courtney was nice, friendly and knowledgeable. I was pleased with my experience."
1,I had my first adjustment ever done at Kerch Chiropratic and Kim Kerch was able to make me a patient for life.
1,"Dr Ingersoll is fantastic! My daughter had an emergency 3 weeks post surgery, & needed to be seen on a Friday afternoon. Dr stayed late to see her & make sure she was taken care of. \nEXCELLENT patient care here! Would recommend him to anyone."
1,"Thank you Sonora Quest for  having online scheduling. I had to get blood drawn the other day and I went online and made a 2:30 appointment. I showed up at 2:25, and at 2:30 they called me back and drew my blood. I was in and out in about 10 minutes. \n\nIn previous years I have waited up to an hour, because you just had to stand in line and wait.  This new process is fantastic!"
1,"When the building air conditioning unit went down and it was literally 112 degrees outside, our building manager Deena did everything possible to help us out with fans and to get the situation resolved as soon as possible.  We really appreciate her attentiveness and professionalism."
1,"I recently started using this location as a virtual office for my clients. I am very impressed with the entire staff involved in helping me get reservations, greeting my clients and using other support systems. I would highly recommend this facility/location. My experiences are distinctly different than those written by people with negative opinions. As an aside, I am an independent company in need of a facility/company like Corporate Centers. I have no connection with Corporate Office Centers as they are not my employer! The facility is clean, and in a great location. The kitchen is very clean. \n\n I need to reserve a day room \""on the fly\"" and the staff communicates with me on a very timely basis. This is a great place to establish a virtual office based on ones needs.\n\nRegus bought out corporate office center. It is still an excellent office setting."
1,"If you've got a 2- to 6-year-old, here's your school! \n\nThe Paradise Valley-area schoolday includes attentive lessons based on Maria Montessori's educational philosophy, picnic-style lunchtimes and a deeply shaded porch and yard for playing and more learning.\n\nMy daughter enjoys her days, and we enjoy feeling good about it."
1,Annie's Pet Parlor has always impressed us.  They are kind and gentle.  We plan ahead so paying with cash has never been a problem.
1,Best in town
1,"This is my barber shop of preference. Been going here for a year now, they do a good job and  are really friendly people. \n\nPaul does the best job with my hair."
1,"great philly cheesesteak, hot bbq wings, fries, pizza. Good place to drink that is not a bar."
1,"I went to high school right down the street from Uncle Sams and it always has, and always will, serve excellent cheese steaks and pizzas.  \n\nThis is another restaurant that I try to visit on every trip to the Phoenix metro area, and in my mind is one of the staple restaurants in the valley.\n\nThe food is inexpensive and is always hot and delicious.  The service is superbly provided by cute chicas in short mini skirts, but alas is NOT trashy like that other restaurant, Hooters."
1,I wish this place was in L.A.  Every trip to Phoenix I come here.  The happy hour beer prices are mind boggling... $6 for a pitcher of Blue Moon?  Count me in!  Wings are A+ and pizza is B+ and prices are dirt cheap!  Oh and everyone is super friendly and the service is very good. Looooove this place.  This is the sort of down home awesomeness that I don't think even exists in Los Angeles.
1,"I love Uncle Sams. It is right next to my boyfriends house so we go there all the time. They have the best wings and their pizza is great too! We also like to get their fried zucchini and mushrooms. Mmmm so tasty! Oh yeah and their beer is really cheap. If they didn't have all of those tv's with sports on my boyfriend might pay a little more attention to me. And I wish they served liquor. But oh well, I still love this place!"
1,"I rarely give 5 star reviews out, but Uncle Sams deserves it. I always order the half cheese steak with onions, and a side of mayo, ranch and sweet peppers. For a side I usually get either the fries, onion rings, mushrooms, or zuccini. But the fries satisfy me the most. Uncle Sams has the best cheese steak ive had, even better than all the places ive been too on the east coast and in philly."
1,Simply the BEST!
1,Great group of people who seem to genuinely want to help and not just get through all the appointments. They take care of both our dogs Bradock and Malea and we are very appreciative of all their help.
1,"I can't speak highly enough of the personal care you receive from Dr. Larson. He always greets you with a smile and takes the time to hear your concerns. I've had a few sports related injuries that my trainers struggled with fixing that Dr. Larson fixed within a few visits with his methods. He is a very active Doctor and I feel that's part of why he really understands the problems we go through as athletes. I drive 40 miles across town to see him, that's how much I believe in his methods. Do yourself a favor and give him a try, you won't be disappointed!"
1,"I have been coming to this practice for years. It is a true family practice, however, they are progressive and they do everything in-house, they have their own x-rays, labs, chiropractor and physical therapy. I have used almost all of their services without any complaints. They are thorough and take the time to discuss all your needs. I personal use Dr. Becky, the PA, but I have also seen Bruce."
1,3 words:  DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!\n\nOnly because I am being selfish and don't want everybody to go here.\n\nThe place is great.  Everytime we go there the food and service is great.\n\nThe cocktails are great.  \n\nGreat. Great. Great.
1,"No change after 20 years. We moved from Phoenix in 1994 and haven't been back until yesterday. It's the same, and that's a great thing. Same great food, same reasonable prices, same Michelina. One of the hidden treasures of Paradise Valley. It's right on the 51 at Shea so it's convenient from anywhere in the valley. Can't recommend it enough. It's great when good things don't change."
1,"Whenever I get my car cleaned, this is the place that I'll always go to.  They're nice, efficient, and they do a great job.  My car is still shining a week later!\n\nThe wait is very minimal.  The staff works together fantastically, and you can watch them clean your car so you don't have to worry about anything getting stolen.  Yeah it's a little small, and a bit shabby, but like the first reviewer said, you don't go there for the waiting experience!\n\nDefinitely worth the money!"
1,"I have been going to Silver Touch for the past seven years (it used to be Weiss Guys Car Wash). Over the past seven years I have never found anything to complain about. The washes are reasonably priced (about $10 for a vacuum and wash or $6 for a wash while you wait in your car), and my car always looks great afterward.\n\nI absolutely HAVE to mention my last visit here, because I received amazing service. I scraped my car on a pole and had a significant amount of yellow paint transfer on my silver car. I took it in to Silver Touch, and they took the paint off IMMEDIATELY upon my arrival and charged me nothing. Of course I tipped the guy a $20 for his work in the hot sun, but you really can't beat that! (I should also mention that my dad received the same treatment when he took my sister's car in about a year prior to my  visit).\n\nAs far as the standard car wash goes, I have no complaints. The detail work they do at the end is always done exceptionally well. I have had a couple instances when some of the dirt or grease on my car hasn't come off during the car wash cycle, but they happily remove it when asked. For the most part, these people are soooo busy getting cars in and out as quickly as possible, that that they may miss a small area on the car every once in a while. They're only human and it happens... Here's a tip - instead of complaining about the car wash after leaving, tell them politely that they missed a spot! They are more than happy to help you, trust me!\n\nI absolutely love this place and will continue to get my car washed, detailed, and shampooed here for many years to come!"
1,"I had an easy time setting up my appointment. John said I could call the morning of and usually he'll be able to get my car done that day. He said it would take 1.5-2 hours, they were done in 1 hour 15 min, so that made me very pleased. He was clear on the pricing and after care instruction. He is a very knowledagble guy."
1,"I grew up at this library.  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.  They have a great selection of audio books.  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be! \n\nClean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.  I dig this library."
1,"Been going to this library often now as it is the only one close by.  Good selection of books and audio for such a small library.  I've found it's a great place to spend time reading in one of the large chairs or out on the patio.  I ride my bike their and it's so fun to just take a ride on a Saturday with my pack and go to the library for a few good reads.  \n\nThe book check-out is all new and very simple to work, and the customer service desk is very helpful.  I remember when the library was flooded a while ago when heavy rains were brought in by the monsoon.  But even through that, they redid everything and looks like it never happened.  Also got to love the unique, and interesting architecture of the old building.  Got to go see it.  \n\nThis is my favorite library!!"
1,"I haven't used my library card in over a year (no idea how i racked up the $20 in over-due fees). \n\nAnyhow, what i luv about this place?  The used book corner.  This is where u can snag mags, children's books, novels, cd's, videos, altas, library discards, ect.  I like donating my books, but I LOVE picking thought the selection of goodies for 25 & 50 cents.\n\nReminds me, my shelves are over-flowing - time to donate again."
1,"You can't go wrong using these guys!  They fix all you electrical and Data problems.  They work on huge projects but they still care about the little ones too! Don't feel like your wasting their time for such a small job.  They will be there on time and will have the solution your looking for!  I highly recommend this company, and after you use them-you'll see why!"
1,"It is no secret that I am not very handy around the house.  I like to tinker but when electricity is involved I tend to not deal with it.  So, when my backyard floodlights weren't working, I knew I needed professional help.\n\nAfter a quick Yelp search I found Micor and decided to give them a call based solely on their reviews.  They sent a person out to my house within a half hour and had my lights working not long after.\n\nThe best part is that I wasn't even home.  I arranged it all from my workplace.  Sure it was a little bit sketchy having a stranger in my backyard doing god knows what because of a problem I probably described poorly.....but it all turned out ok.  I tested the light after I got home then called their office to pay.\n\nI hope I don't have any electrical problems in the future, but if I do I will call Micor."
1,"went there again yesterday, had a bit of a wait (which is nothing considering the amazing service) but after getting my haircut I was pleased to say my hair looks amazing once again thanks to Rosa"
1,Found my new barber and they even do flat tops. Old school my friends.
1,"Previously reviewed wrong business. \n\nFollowing suit with 5 Stars!!! \nNo line, no wait! Rosa was the only one there and she did a great job. Just moved here from Chicago and left my Barber of 6yrs behind. I have needed a haircut for awhile and finally went! \nI have my new spot, less than a mile from home! \n Rosa!!!!\n\n3 visits and super happy! I won't go anywhere else now! :-)"
1,This place is gone... Well kind off. The owner retired and the guys from cave creek took over (Retablo). I was so happy to hear the news because this place is much closer to my house. \nI was told that this store is going to be a mixture of their two stores in cave creek. They are going to carry furniture and decorations as well as all the cool pottery and garden art... I can wait until they reopen.
1,Great Fabric Store with Great low prices! Mostly everything is $8.99 a yard. Plus they give out great ideas and advice.
1,The Boys at Desert Rat are awesome.  I hate car stuff and am always afraid of being taken because I am  a women.   When I went is they asked what the problem was and took care of me without  trying to tell me I needed more than just the shocks.  I felt comfortable with them.  I will send everyone I know.  Thanks guys!!!
1,"One minute you're cruising on the freeway and the next you're running over a massive tire tread, which you believe to be a body or a chupacabra, that has been ejected violently onto your hood from the truck in from of you. Needless to say, you need some auto body work.\n\nMy insurance directed me to Auto Body World for an appointment that I thought would be about as pleasurable as a trip to the dentist. Wrong! Auto Body World and its fabulous, friendly staff proved a pleasure to work with from start to finish.\n\nFront office staff: Awesome. Estimate guy (I don't really know what the title is): Awesome. Technicians: AWESOME!\n\nThey had me in and out the door in less than 15 minutes for my initial appointment, repaired my car ahead of schedule, then graciously processed my paperwork and returned my vehicle  when I accidentally showed up 30 minutes after closing time. And all of this with a smile.\n\nAnother plus? There is an Enterprise rental car service on site just for their customers' use - and they offer great discounts through your insurance carrier even if your rental isn't covered by your plan.\n\nAnd did I mention my car looks like new? I couldn't recommend this business and location more highly."
1,"I have been a member of the credit union since 1986. I have had basic accounts, car loans, and other loans and have gotten the best interest rates around. Never have had a problem. Service is great too. I am always asked when I go in (which is rare) if I need an extra check register. That is really nice because I usually do! Then they give me 2!"
